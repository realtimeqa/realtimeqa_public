Before it’s too late, before this cancer will kill football,” Pierluigi Collina, chairman of FIFA’s Referees Committee, said Wednesday.\n\nMeler was hospitalized after being punched by MKE Ankaragucu president Faruk Koca at the end of a 1-1 draw with Caykur Rizespor. He fell to the ground and was also kicked in a melee when fans invaded the pitch after Rizespor scored a last-minute equalizer. Meler was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday.\n\nKoca and two other people have been placed under pre-trial detention, facing charges of causing injury to a public official. The Turkish Football Federation suspended all league games in response.\n\n“A referee cannot be beaten because of a decision they took, even if it’s wrong. His or her car cannot be bombed or set on fire because of a penalty kick,\" Collina said in a statement that did not provide examples. \"Unfortunately this is not an exaggeration, as car bombs and cars being set on fire is something that has happened in some countries, and not so rarely.”\n\nIn recent times there have been a number of high profile incidents involving attacks or threats made toward officials in soccer.\n\nIn Brazil, the president of fourth-division club Sergipe was suspended after he came onto the pitch and punched a referee in March. Last month, an official with Brazilian club Corinthians tried to break into the VAR room after one of the team's players was sent off.\n\nEnglish referee Anthony Taylor and his family had to be escorted away by security at an airport in Hungary after Roma fans targeted him and threw a chair in his direction after the Europa League final in May.\n\nMore extreme incidents include the gun-toting owner of Greek team PAOK Thessaloniki marching onto the field following a disputed goal in 2018. And a weekend soccer player was sentenced to at least eight years in prison in 2015 in the United States for a punch that killed a referee.\n\nSoccer has for a long time been concerned about how abuse at the top of the sport can lead to rising incidents at amateur and youth level.\n\n“The image of Halil Umut lying on the ground, with his hands protecting his head while he was kicked by his assaulters, as well as the image of the bruise under his eye, are horrific,” Collina said. “But even more horrific is to know that there are thousands of referees around the world who are verbally and physically abused at lower levels of the game across the world, without being reported by media.”\n\nA referees' charity in England has warned incidents like the one in Turkey could soon be repeated in the Premier League.\n\n“The desensitization of ref abuse has been left to fester for far too long and an incident like this, live on TV, is just around the corner in top-flight football in the UK unless we have a huge change in attitude and culture towards match officials at all levels of the game,\" said Martin Cassidy, chief executive of Ref Support UK. \"Referees all over the world have, for far too long, been viewed as fair game no matter what age the referee is. Referees are an endangered species due to abuse, threats and assaults.”\n\nDespite those fears, the body that runs referees and officials in England, said Wednesday that there had been a “significant decrease” in unacceptable behavior this season compared to the same point last season.\n\nThe Professional Game Match Officials (PGMOL) has clamped down on what it describes as conduct on the field and on the sidelines at all levels of pro soccer in England.\n\nAs a result it said there had been a 37% decrease in charges for surrounding match officials, dropping from 19 to 12. According to its figures there has also been 43% decrease in charges for mass confrontations (61 to 35) and a 10% reduction of charges for “technical area misconduct” (70 to 63).\n\n“A culture change won’t happen overnight and it is early days, but we are moving in the right direction and our officials are successfully delivering on our part of the collective football effort to reset behaviors, protect the reputation and promote the positive image of the game for the next generations,\" PGMOL chief Howard Webb said.\n\nThere has been an 88% increase in cautions for acts of dissent from players, which is likely a result of the PGMOL's clampdown. Numbers went up from 966 to 1,813 cautions.\n\n\"This shows that our new approach is making an impact at the top of the pyramid, and we need to maintain this and ensure that these positive changes are carried through to the whole game,” FA chief executive Mark Bullingham said.\n\n___\n\nJames Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/01/asia/indonesia-soccer-stadium-stampede-persebaya-surabaya-arema-fc-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Indonesia soccer stadium crush: At least 125 killed in Malang, East ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAt least 125 people are dead after chaos and violence erupted during an Indonesian league soccer match into the early hours of Sunday, according to Indonesia’s National Police Chief in what is one of the world’s deadliest stadium disasters of all time.\n\nSupporters of Arema FC and rival Persebaya Surabaya, two of Indonesia’s biggest soccer teams, clashed in the stands after home team Arema FC was defeated 3-2 at a match in the city of Malang in East Java, police said.\n\nSupporters from the losing team then “invaded” the pitch and police fired tear gas, triggering a fan crush that led to cases of suffocation, East Java police chief Nico Afinta said during a press conference following the event.\n\nTwo police officers were also among the dead, he said, adding that the crush occurred when fans fled for an exit gate.\n\nMore than 300 people were injured, according to Indonesian authorities, with fears that the death toll could rise.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, the governor of the East Java province, where the incident occurred, said the death toll was at 131. National Police Chief Listyo Sigit Prabowo clarified the discrepancy of the previous higher numbers saying it was due to some casualties being recorded twice.\n\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo, also known as Jokowi, on Sunday ordered all league matches to be halted until investigations were completed.\n\n“I have specially requested the police chief to investigate and get to the bottom of this case,” Jokowi said in a televised speech. “Sportsmanship, humanity and brotherhood should be upheld in Indonesia.”\n\n“I regret this tragedy and hope that it will be the last to occur in Indonesian football. We cannot have anymore (of this) in the future.”\n\nVideos filmed from inside the stadium late into the night and shared on social media showed fans, dressed in red and blue – the home team’s colors – storming the field and clashing with Indonesian security forces, who appeared to be wearing riot gear.\n\nVideo footage broadcast on local news channels also showed images of body bags, Reuters reported.\n\nSmoke, which appeared to be tear gas, was also seen later in videos, with several people shown being carried into a building. Officials said that many had been admitted to nearby hospitals, suffering from “lack of oxygen and shortness of breath.”\n\nSupporters from the losing team \"invaded\" the pitch and police fired tear gas, triggering a fan crush that led to cases of suffocation, police said. Yudha Prabowo/AP\n\nOne of the worst stadium disasters in history\n\nLocated in East Java, the Kanjuruhan Stadium is used mostly for soccer matches – with its full capacity estimated at 38,000 spectators.\n\nBut 42,000 tickets were issued for Saturday’s game, according to ministry officials.\n\n“We had anticipated the (large) numbers and suggested that the game be held in the afternoon instead but it went on in the evening,” Indonesian Chief Security Minister Mahfud MD said in a post shared on his official social media accounts.\n\nHe added that the stadium had been “filled beyond its maximum capacity.”\n\n“Our proposals were not met. I also would like to emphasize that supporters in the field were Arema FC’s.”\n\nThere have been previous outbreaks of trouble at matches in Indonesia, with a strong rivalry between clubs sometimes leading to violence among supporters.\n\n“All sports clubs (in Indonesia) that compete between the two cities are always intense,” Indonesian football analyst Dex Glenniza told CNN, who noted that it was “forbidden” for Arema and Persebaya supporters to visit each other’s stadiums.\n\n“(This is) in order to avoid friction and clashes between supporters,” he said. “But there are still many incidents between the supporters, most of which off the field.”\n\nPolice chief Listyo said officers will look at the organization and security that was in place during the match, and that a number of specialized units have been dispatched to investigate the incident. The probe will also look into the police officers who were on duty at the time of the incident, he said.\n\nSoccer fans invade the pitch at the Kanjuruhan Stadium in Malang, East Java on Saturday. Yudha Prabowo/AP\n\nWith Indonesia set to host next year’s FIFA Under-20 World Cup and staging a bid for the 2023 Asian Cup, there is now global scrutiny on the country.\n\nObservers note that the death toll from the Kanjuruhan Stadium disaster has surpassed that of other global soccer disasters like the 1989 Hillsborough Stadium tragedy in Sheffield, England, which saw 96 Liverpool supporters being crushed to death.\n\nCriticism is also growing over the police’s handling of Saturday’s event. In a statement released on Sunday, watchdog group Indonesian Police Watch (IPW) called for accountability and the “removal” of Malang Police Chief Ferli Hidayat.\n\n“This is the worst event in Indonesian soccer. The police chief should be ashamed and resign,” IPW said.\n\n“The death toll must be thoroughly investigated and President Jokowi must pay attention,” it added.\n\nExiled Indonesia rights advocate Veronica Koman of Amnesty International condemned the police’s use of tear gas.\n\n“This instance of abuse of tear gas by police is unlawful and amounts to torture,” she said.\n\n“Tear gas is illegal in warfare – but why is it still legal for domestic use?”\n\nSecurity officers detain a fan during a clash between supporters of two Indonesian soccer teams at Kanjuruhan Stadium in Malang, East Java, Indonesia. Yudha Prabowo/AP\n\nThe Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) has suspended matches next week as a result of the deadly tragedy, and banned Arema FC from hosting games for the rest of the season.\n\n“PSSI regrets the actions of Aremania supporters at the Kanjuruhan Stadium,” the association’s chairman, Mochamad Iriawan, said in a statement issued on Sunday.\n\nHe added that the incident had “tarnished the face of Indonesian football” and they were supporting official investigations into the event.\n\n“We are sorry and apologize to the families of the victims and all parties for the incident,” he said.\n\n“For that PSSI immediately formed an investigation team and immediately left for Malang,” he added.\n\nVictims are pictured at Saiful Anwar hospital following the riot.

But though kickoff for the opening match is just hours away, soccer itself is still being overshadowed by off-the-field matters.\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino’s extraordinary tirade against Western critics of the controversial tournament in an explosive hour-long monologue is still making headlines around the world. Human rights groups described it as “crass” and an “insult” to migrant workers.\n\nInfantino, the boss of world soccer’s governing body, looked on glumly as he addressed hundreds of journalists in Doha, Qatar, Saturday, and started the news conference with a near hour-long speech, during which he accused Western critics of hypocrisy and racism.\n\n“We are taught many lessons from Europeans, from the Western world,” he said, referring to criticisms of Qatar’s human rights record.\n\n“What we Europeans have been doing for the last 3,000 years, we should be apologizing for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons.”\n\nThis tournament will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but is also mired in controversy, with much of the build-up focusing on human rights, from the death of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nThose involved in the tournament have faced much criticism. Last week British comedian Joe Lycett questioned David Beckham’s status as a gay icon were the former England captain and Manchester United star to continue in his role as a Qatar World Cup ambassador.\n\nHomosexuality in Qatar is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison. A report from Human Rights Watch, published last month, documented cases as recently as September of Qatari security forces arbitrarily arresting LGBT people and subjecting them to “ill-treatment in detention.”\n\nColombian singer Maluma, who features in the official World Cup anthem, walked out of an interview on Israeli television when he was questioned about the Gulf state’s human rights record.\n\nInfantino addressed questions around the last-minute ban on alcohol from being sold at stadiums. Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images\n\n‘Today I feel gay’\n\nWhile Qatar’s team will take on Ecuador in the first game at 11 a.m. ET Sunday, in his remarkable press conference Infantino barely spoke about soccer and focused his attention on what he called the “hypocrisy” of Western criticism.\n\nInfantino told journalists that he knew what it felt like to be discriminated against, saying he was bullied as a child for having red hair and freckles.\n\n“Today I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arab. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel a migrant worker,” he said, in front of a stunned audience.\n\n“I feel this, all this, because what I’ve been seeing and what I’ve been told, since I don’t read, otherwise I would be depressed I think.\n\n“What I’ve seen brings me back to my personal story. I am a son of migrant workers. My parents were working very very hard in difficult situations.”\n\nInfantino said progress had been made in Qatar on a range of issues, but insisted real change took time, adding that FIFA would not leave the country after the tournament finished. He suggested that he thought some Western journalists would forget about the issues.\n\n“We need to invest in education, to give them a better future, to give them hope. We should all educate ourselves,” he said.\n\n“Reform and change takes time. It took hundreds of years in our countries in Europe. It takes time everywhere, the only way to get results is by engaging […] not by shouting.”\n\nHuman rights groups have criticized the FIFA boss and his speech. Nicholas McGeehan, director of FairSquare, a non-profit human rights organization, said in a statement: “Infantino’s comments were as crass as they were clumsy and suggest that the FIFA president is getting his talking points direct from the Qatari authorities.\n\nSteve Cockburn, Amnesty International’s head of economic and social justice, said in a statement: “In brushing aside legitimate human rights criticisms, Gianni Infantino is dismissing the enormous price paid by migrant workers to make his flagship tournament possible – as well as FIFA’s responsibility for it.\n\nAlcohol ban\n\nInfantino also addressed questions around the last-minute decision to ban alcohol from being sold at the eight stadiums which will host the tournament’s 64 matches. In a FIFA statement issued on Friday, the governing body said alcohol would be sold at fan zones and licensed venues.\n\nThe Muslim country is considered to be very conservative and tightly regulates alcohol sales and usage.\n\nIn September, Qatar had said it would permit ticketed fans to buy alcoholic beer at World Cup stadiums three hours before kickoff and for one hour after the final whistle, but not during the match.\n\n“Let me first assure you that every decision that is taken in this World Cup is a joint decision between Qatar and FIFA,” he said. “Every decision is discussed, debated and taken jointly.”\n\n“There will be […] over 200 places where you can buy alcohol in Qatar and over 10 fan zones, where over 100,000 people can simultaneously drink alcohol.\n\n“I think personally, if for three hours a day you cannot drink a beer, you will survive.”\n\n“Especially because actually the same rules apply in France or in Spain or in Portugal or in Scotland, where no beer is allowed in stadiums now,” he added.\n\n“It seems to become a big thing because it’s a Muslim country, or I don’t know why.”\n\nInfantino finished the press conference by insisting that everyone would be safe in Qatar, amid concerns from the LGBTQ community.\n\nHomosexuality in Qatar is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison, but the FIFA president promised that this was a tournament for everyone.\n\n“Let me mention as well, the LGBT situation. I have been speaking about this topic with the highest leadership of the country several times, not just once. They have confirmed, and I can confirm, that everyone is welcome,” Infantino said.\n\n“This is a clear FIFA requirement. Everyone has to be welcomed, everyone that comes to Qatar is welcome whatever religion, race, sexual orientation, belief she or he has. Everyone is welcome. This was our requirement and the Qatari state sticks to that requirement,” Infantino said.", "authors": ["Ben Church"], "publish_date": "2022/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/09/asia/sri-lanka-protest-president-saturday-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Sri Lanka protesters break into President's House as thousands rally ...", "text": "Colombo, Sri Lanka CNN —\n\nSri Lanka’s Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Saturday said he was willing to resign and make way for an all-party government to take over, shortly after protesters reportedly breached his official residence in Colombo during demonstrations over the country’s worsening economic crisis.\n\n“To ensure the continuation of the Government including the safety of all citizens I accept the best recommendation of the Party Leaders today, to make way for an All-Party Government,” Wickremesinghe wrote on Twitter.\n\n“To facilitate this I will resign as Prime Minister.”\n\nHis statement came after a meeting of party leaders, held by Sri Lanka’s parliament speaker, agreed to ask both the President and Prime Minister to resign per an “overwhelming request,” Sri Lankan lawmaker Rauff Hakeem tweeted on Saturday.\n\nWickremesinghe has not yet submitted his letter of resignation to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.\n\nSri Lanka’s Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena says President Rajapaksa has informed him he will resign on July 13, the speaker’s office announced late Saturday.\n\nThe announcement comes after the Speaker asked the President to resign following a meeting of party leaders.\n\nAnger reached unprecedented levels in the South Asian nation of 22 million on Saturday, as more than 100,000 people massed outside Rajapaksa’s residence, calling for his resignation.\n\nVideo broadcast on Sri Lankan television and on social media showed the protesters enter the President’s House – Rajapaksa’s office and residence in the commercial capital – after breaking through security cordons placed by police.

It’s important for our military and our country,” he said.\n\n“We have a lot of messages on our social media so we try to connect together and we put our powers and collective minds for different things.\n\n“We try to buy [things] and send them to different cities. It’s very difficult but it’s very important for our people.”\n\nTrubin is one of a number of Ukrainian sports stars that have either remained in or returned to Ukraine to help out during the war.\n\nFormer boxers Wladimir and Vitaly Klitschko – the latter of who is currently the mayor of Kyiv – and current world heavyweight Oleksandr Usyk all joined the Ukrainian forces, as did MMA world champion Yaroslav Amosov and former tennis star Sergiy Stakhovsky.\n\nUsyk has now left Ukraine, posting a message on Instagram on March 25 saying he had “decided to start preparing for a rematch with Anthony Joshua.” A date and location has yet to decided for the bout.\n\nTrubin explains why so many of his fellow countrymen felt compelled to aid in the efforts.\n\n“Our spirit is one of the strongest,” he says of Ukrainians. “This part of our spirit, no one can take out of our body. We try to give everything.\n\n“My heart is bleeding. A lot of people, a lot of children, are killed and I don’t understand this. Putin is a killer and I don’t understand how it is possible.”\n\nTrubin spoke to CNN on March 24, just over a week before shocking atrocities in Ukraine, allegedly at the hands of Russian forces, amplified calls to pursue war crimes charges against Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nImages of at least 20 bodies strewn across the street in Bucha, Ukraine, emerged over the weekend following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the area, prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to call for an end to Russian “war crimes.”\n\nAnd Trubin says he has a message for those waging war on his homeland.\n\n“We will win this war and our country will be stronger, more beautiful and one of the best in the world,” he says stoically. “Everything will be okay.\n\n“It’s why we keep fit and continue training. We want to move abroad to have a place where we can train better.”\n\nUkraine was involved in last week’s World Cup draw in Doha, Qatar.\n\nIf Ukraine is to take part in the World Cup it must first beat Scotland and then Wales.\n\nThe playoff game against Scotland was initially scheduled to take place on March 24 but was postponed by FIFA to June following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA date for the rescheduled qualifier is yet to be announced by FIFA.", "authors": ["Ben Church Patrick Snell", "Ben Church", "Patrick Snell"], "publish_date": "2022/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2018/07/01/the-latest-iniesta-out-for-spains-world-cup-game-v-russia/36537639/", "title": "The Latest: Subasic ties World Cup record in shootout", "text": "AP\n\nMOSCOW (AP) — The Latest on Sunday at the World Cup (all times local):\n\n12:15 a.m.\n\nDanijel Subasic has tied a World Cup record with his three saves in the penalty shootout that helped Croatia beat Denmark for a spot in the World Cup quarterfinals.\n\nCroatia won the shootout 3-2 after the round of 16 game ended 1-1 after extra time. Subasic joins former Portugal goalkeeper Ricardo as the only man to save three shots in a single World Cup shootout. Ricardo did it in the 2006 World Cup quarterfinal match against England.\n\nSubasic tipped Christian Eriksen's first penalty for Denmark onto the post. Then dived to his right again to save from Lasse Schone. Finally, he used his feet to block Nicolai Jorgensen's attempt.\n\n___\n\n12:05 a.m.\n\nFox has changed plans and is sending a third crew of commentators to Russia for the World Cup.\n\nDerek Rae and Aly Wagner called Russia's penalty shootout win over Spain on Sunday and will broadcast Colombia-England on Tuesday. The pair called 10 matches from the network's Los Angeles studio during the group phase.\n\nWith the shift, Fox will wind up calling 33 of the 64 World Cup games from stadiums and the rest from Los Angeles. The only knockout-stage game called from California was Croatia's penalty kicks win over Croatia on Sunday.\n\n___\n\n11:46 p.m.\n\nDanijel Subasic made three saves in the shootout as Croatia beat Denmark 3-2 on penalties to advance to a World Cup quarterfinal against Russia.\n\nLuka Modric missed a chance to win it for Croatia four minutes before the end of extra time but his penalty kick was saved by Danish goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel to preserve the 1-1 score and send the game to penalties. Russia beat 2010 champion Spain on penalties earlier Sunday after that game ended 1-1 after extra time.\n\nDenmark had scored inside a minute to open the match when defender Mathias Jorgensen scrambled in a shot that went off goalkeeper Subasic's left hand and then off the left post and in. It was Denmark's fastest World Cup goal ever.\n\nCroatia replied in the fourth minute with another untidy goal. Henrik Dalsgaard's clearance hit a teammate and fell for Croatia forward Mario Mandzukic to hook the ball in for 1-1. The teams were then locked at 1-1 for the next 116 minutes to force the shootout.\n\n___\n\n11:32 p.m.\n\nCroatia and Denmark are going to a penalty shootout for a spot in the World Cup quarterfinals after Luka Modric missed a chance to break a 1-1 deadlock five minutes left in extra time.\n\nDenmark took just 58 seconds to open the scoring in the World Cup round of 16 game and Croatia equalized in the 4th minute.\n\nThere was no better chance to score again until the 116th minute when Modric took a spot kick that could have won it for Croatia.\n\nBut his right-foot shot was comfortably saved by Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nIt's the second time Sunday that a game will be decided on penalties after Russia beat Spain 4-3 in a shootout after their match finished 1-1 after extra time.\n\nThe winner here will meet Russia in the quarterfinals.\n\n___\n\n10:48 p.m.\n\nAfter a frantic start, Croatia and Denmark are going to 30 minutes of extra time with their group-of-16 World Cup match tied at 1-1.\n\nBoth goals came in the first four minutes in Nizhny Novgorod. Mathias Jorgensen gave Denmark the lead after only 58 seconds, and Mario Mandzukic equalized in the 4th minute. The second half has seen far fewer attacking chances with both teams playing more cautiously.\n\nThe winner will advance to a quarterfinal against Russia, which beat Spain 4-3 in a penalty shootout after their match finished 1-1 after extra time.\n\n____\n\n10:29 p.m.\n\nMathias Jorgensen has bagged the record for Denmark's fastest World Cup goal with his score just under a minute into a knockout game against Croatia, but he would have had to have been a lot faster to set the tournament record.\n\nJorgensen's goal doesn't even crack the World Cup's 10 fastest. The record belongs to Hakan Sukur's strike just 11 seconds into Turkey's game against South Korea in 2002.\n\nSunday's match in Nizhny Novgorod did join some rare company moments later when Mario Mandzukic got the equalizer for Croatia: It's just the third time the World Cup has seen two goals in the first four minutes.\n\nThe scoring slowed down after that, with the two sides still tied at a goal apiece with about 15 minutes to play.\n\n___\n\n10:05 p.m.\n\nAndres Iniesta has announced his retirement from international football following Spain's loss to Russia in a penalty shootout at the World Cup.\n\nIniesta, who scored the winning goal in the 2010 World Cup final, played 131 times for Spain.\n\nHe was surprisingly benched to start the round of 16 game against Russia but went on in the second half with the score at 1-1. The score remained 1-1 after extra time and Russia went on to win 4-3 on penalties to secure a spot in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe 34-year-old midfielder has signed for Japanese club Vissel Kobe after spending his entire senior career at Barcelona.\n\n___\n\n9:46 p.m.\n\nCroatia and Denmark are tied 1-1 at halftime in a round-of-16 match that started in a sprint with each side scoring in the first four minutes.\n\nMathias Jorgensen scored for Denmark in the 1st minute, getting the goal after a scramble in the area with the shot deflecting off Croatian goalkeeper Danijel Subasic.\n\nMario Mandzukic equalized in the 4th minute, capitalizing on a series of Danish blunders to score from short range behind Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nThe goal was only the second given up by Denmark in its last eight matches. The Danes are unbeaten in their last 18 matches.\n\nThe winner of this match will face Russia, which upset Spain in a penalty shootout earlier Sunday.\n\nBoth keepers came up with key saves and the Russian crowd — outnumbering the Danish and Croatian fans — repeatedly chanted RUS-SI-A, RUS-SI-A.\n\n___\n\n9:30 p.m.\n\nSpain's king visited the national team to give them words of encouragement after the Spanish lineup lost to Russia in a penalty shootout and crashed out of the World Cup on penalties.\n\nKing Felipe VI attended the match at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium and sat beside FIFA's president and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.\n\nAfter Spain lost 4-3 on penalties, the king went downstairs near the team's dressing room.\n\nPhotos on the Spanish national team's official website show Felipe greeting and consoling Spain captain Sergio Ramos and goalkeeper David De Gea.\n\nThe Kremlin says King Felipe VI has congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin on the home team's win.\n\nThe Russian president's press service says the call also included \"a short exchange of opinions about issues of further development of bilateral relations.\"\n\nSpain's king is a soccer fan who, as crown prince, attended the 2010 World Cup final in Johannesburg to see La Roja beat the Netherlands 1-0 in extra time.\n\n____\n\n9:04 p.m.\n\nMathias Jorgensen has scored in the 1st minute for Denmark but Croatia has rallied quickly with an equalizer in the fourth of the World Cup round of 16 game.\n\nJorgensen scored after a scramble in the area and a deflection off Croatian goalkeeper Danijel Subasic.\n\nMario Mandzukic swooped after a series of blunders by the Danish defense to make it 1-1.\n\n___\n\n8:51 p.m.\n\nSpain set a World Cup record for completed passes in a game. But it counted for nothing in the end as the 2010 champion failed to make good use of the ball before losing a penalty shootout to Russia.\n\nFIFA's in-game analysis showed Spain's players successfully passed to each other 1,029 times against Russia in Sunday's round of 16 game. That's more than eight passes per minute and more than 12 of the 32 World Cup teams managed in all of their three group-stage games combined.\n\nSweden advanced to the round of 16 having completed just 660 passes, and used them to score five goals.\n\nSpain managed a single goal Sunday in a 1-1 draw, and that one was inadvertently put in his own net by a Russian defender.\n\nHaving 74 percent of possession simply was not effective against a well-organized Russia defense.\n\n___\n\n8:40 p.m.\n\nLocal authorities in Marrakech say a player from Morocco's World Cup squad has been in involved in a car crash in which someone died.\n\nMidfielder Amine Harit was driving in the city on Friday when the accident occurred. According to reports, Harit collided with a pedestrian attempting to cross a road.\n\nHicham Boulatar, the regional authority's head of communications in Marrakech, told The Associated Press that the victim was 29 or 30 years old.\n\nThe 21-year-old Harit, who plays for German club Schalke, has been released pending an investigation and his passport has been suspended. Morocco was eliminated from the World Cup in Russia at the end of the group stage. Harit played in the opening loss to Iran and wasn't used in the other group games against Portugal and Spain.\n\n___\n\n8:10 p.m.\n\nCroatia has returned to full strength for the World Cup round of 16 game against Denmark at Nizhny Novgorod.\n\nThe Croatians won all three of their group games and conceded just one goal. Once again, Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic anchor a strong midfield and Danijel Subasic is in goal.\n\nDenmark coach Age Hareide has made two changes from the last match with France. Jonas Knudsen starts in defense in place of Jens Larsen, and Yussuf Poulsen returns up front to replace Pione Sisto.\n\nThe winner will meet Russia in the quarterfinals.\n\nLineups:\n\nCroatia: Danijel Subasic, Sime Vrsaljko, Ivan Strinic, Ivan Perisic, Dejan Lovren, Ivan Rakitic, Luka Modric, Marcelo Brozovic, Mario Mandzukic, Ante Rebic, Domagoj Vida.\n\nDenmark: Kasper Schmeichel, Simon Kjaer, Jonas Knudsen, Andreas Christensen, Thomas Delaney, Christian Eriksen, Martin Braithwaite, Mathias Jorgensen, Henrik Dalsgaard, Yussuf Poulsen, Andreas Cornelius.\n\n___\n\n7:55 p.m.\n\nRussian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev has been voted player of the match after making a series of impressive saves to help the hosts beat 2010 champion Spain and reach the World Cup quarterfinals.\n\nIt was 1-1 after extra time and Akinfeev saved spot-kicks from Jorge \"Koke\" Resurreccion and Iago Aspas while four of his teammates all scored as Russia won the shootout 4-3.\n\nAkinfeev says \"I just feel emptied out.\"\n\nSpain dominated the possession during the game — completing more than 1,000 passes — but was too passive against a well-organized Russian defense.\n\nSpain led in the 12th minute when captain Sergio Ramos helped force Russia's Sergei Ignashevich into an own goal when his back was turned to the play. An error in Spain's defense let Russia level in the 41st, after Gerard Pique's raised arm blocked a header by Artyom Dzyuba at a corner.\n\nRussia next plays Croatia or Denmark who play later Sunday.\n\nAkinfeev says, \"We were hoping for penalties because Spain are hard to beat — Spain can't always be lucky.\"\n\n___\n\n7:42 p.m.\n\nHost Russia has advanced to the World Cup quarterfinals after beating 2010 champion Spain on penalties in their round of 16 game.\n\nThe game finished 1-1 after extra time, and goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev made two key saves to help Russia win the shootout 4-3.\n\n___\n\n7:31 p.m.\n\nRussia and Spain are going to the first penalty shootout of the 2018 World Cup.\n\nThe host nation and the 2010 champion are tied at 1-1 after extra time thanks to Sergei Ignashevich's 12th-minute own goal and Artyom Dzyuba's 41st-minute penalty.\n\nSpain put pressure on Russia in extra time, with substitute Rodrigo forcing a good save from Igor Akinfeev, before Dani Carvajal's shot on the rebound was blocked.\n\nSpain appealed for a penalty after some grappling in the box at a free kick, but referee Bjorn Kuipers did not award the spot-kick after conferring with the video assistant referees.\n\nThere hasn't been a World Cup penalty shootout between two European teams since Italy beat France in the 2006 final.\n\n____\n\n7:05 p.m.\n\nRussia's Alexander Yerokhin has become the first player to be brought on as a fourth substitute during a World Cup game, going on in the 97th minute against Spain.\n\nFIFA approved the new rule in March for an additional substitute in extra time at the World Cup, but had earlier used it at youth tournaments and the 2016 Olympic football tournaments.\n\nThe rule is aimed at reducing injuries and allowing higher-quality play in extra time, when players are most tired.\n\nYerokhin replaced fellow midfielder Daler Kuzyaev. The score was 1-1 at the end of regulation time in round of 16 game.\n\nSpain made its extra substitution about seven minutes later when Rodrigo Moreno replaced Marco Asensio.\n\nSpain and Russia used their three allowed substitutions in regulation.\n\n___\n\n6:51 p.m.\n\nSpain and Russia are going to extra time after finishing 1-1 at the end of regulation in their World Cup round of 16 game.\n\nSergei Ignashevich's own goal at a free kick gave Spain the lead in the 12th minute but Artyom Dzyuba leveled with a penalty in the 41st after Gerard Pique handled the ball.\n\nSpain played much of the game at a low tempo and made few attempts to attack into the Russian penalty area.\n\nRussian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev made a diving save to tip away Andres Iniesta's powerful shot from the top of the area and got to his feet immediately to block Iago Aspas' shot from the deflection with five minutes to go in regulation.\n\nFor the first time in a World Cup, teams will be allowed to make a fourth substitution in extra time.\n\nBoth teams have already used all three of the substitutions allowed in regulation time.\n\n___\n\n6 p.m.\n\nBelgium will give a late fitness test to winger Adnan Januzaj ahead of Monday's World Cup round of 16 match against Japan in Rostov-On-Don.\n\nCoach Roberto Martinez says Januzaj \"picked up a little knock in training, nothing serious. But he's got a bit of a bruised knee and we'll have to assess him today.\"\n\nThe fleet-footed Januzaj scored a spectacular goal when Belgium beat England to top their group. During that game, injury-prone center half Vincent Kompany went on in the second half for his first game since injuring his groin on June 2.\n\nMartinez adds \"We're all delighted Kompany is back in the squad ... I'm delighted what the medical department hase done. Great news for us.\"\n\n___\n\n5:48 p.m.\n\nArtyom Dzyuba's equalizer from the penalty spot for Russia in the 42nd minute has made it 1-1 at halftime against Spain in the World Cup round of 16.\n\nRussia won the penalty for handball when Dzyuba's header hit Gerard Pique's arm at a corner.\n\nDzyuba hit the spot kick hard to David de Gea's right as the Spanish goalkeeper dived the wrong way. The equalizer came against the run of play.\n\nSpain had earlier taken the lead when Russian defender Sergei Ignashevich deflected the ball into his own net at a corner in the 12th minute.\n\n___\n\n5:12 p.m.\n\nAn own goal from Russian defender Sergei Ignashevich has given Spain a 1-0 lead in the World Cup round of 16 game in Moscow.\n\nPlaying in a record 126th game for Russia, Ignashevich accidentally struck the ball with the back of his leg in the 12th minute while challenging Sergio Ramos at a free kick.\n\nIn a World Cup which already broke the record for own goals, Ignashevich made it 10 when the ball deflected off his heal and into his own net.\n\n___\n\n4:30 p.m.\n\nKing Felipe VI of Spain is at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow to see the national team play World Cup host Russia.\n\nThe king heads FIFA's list of VIP guests for the round of 16 game, which also includes Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has not returned to the stadium where he watched Russia beat Saudi Arabia 5-0 in the opening game on June 14.\n\nSpain's king is a soccer fan who, as crown prince, attended the 2010 World Cup final in Johannesburg to see La Roja beat the Netherlands 1-0 in extra time.\n\nHe had other business four years ago when Spain was eliminated by a 2-0 group-stage loss to Chile at the Maracana stadium in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe following day in Madrid, Felipe was sworn in as king after the abdication of his father, Juan Carlos.\n\n___\n\n4:20 p.m.\n\nMark Geiger has been assigned to referee Tuesday's World Cup round of 16 match between England and Colombia, four years after he became the first American to officiate in the knockout stage of soccer's showcase.\n\nThis will be the sixth World Cup match for the 43-year-old former math teacher from Beachwood, New Jersey, and the third at this tournament. He refereed Portugal's 1-0 win over Morocco and Germany's 2-0 loss to South Korea, which eliminated the defending champions.\n\nFour years ago in Brazil, Geiger worked Chile's 2-0 win over Spain and Colombia's 3-0 victory against Greece in the group stage, and France's 2-0 win over Nigeria in the round of 16.\n\nThe U.S. is the only nation with two referees at the World Cup. Jair Murrufo officiated Belgium's 5-2 victory over Tunisia.\n\n___\n\n4 p.m.\n\nSpain is starting without Andres Iniesta against Russia in the last 16 of the World Cup.\n\nCoach Fernando Hierro makes three changes from the lineup which drew 2-2 with Morocco in the last game of the group stage, bringing in Nacho Fernandez, Jorge \"Koke\" Resurreccion and Marco Asensio.\n\nUp front in a 4-2-3-1 formation, Diego Costa is likely to try to open up space in Russia's five-man defensive line for David Silva and Isco to threaten the goal.\n\nSpain lineup: David de Gea, Nacho, Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets, Koke, Marco Asensio, Sergio Ramos, Jordi Alba, Diego Costa, David Silva, Isco.\n\n___\n\n3:50 p.m.\n\nRussia is set to switch to five at the back for its World Cup round of 16 game against Spain on Sunday.\n\nFyodor Kudryashov will join Sergei Ignashevich and Ilya Kutepov in the center of defense, with Mario Fernandes and Yuri Zhirkov on the flanks. Russia used a four-man back line in its three group games. In midfield Daler Kuzyaev, who came on as a substitute in all three group games, gets his first World Cup start in place of the dropped Yuri Gazinsky.\n\nThe winger Denis Cheryshev, who was raised in Spain, is on the bench despite having scored three goals so far, while backup right-back Igor Smolnikov is suspended after being red carded in Monday's 3-0 group-stage loss to Uruguay.\n\nRussia is playing its first World Cup knockout game in the post-Soviet era. The winner will play either Croatia or Denmark in Sochi on July 7.\n\nRussia lineup: Igor Akinfeev, Mario Fernandes, Ilya Kutepov, Sergei Ignashevich, Fyodor Kudryashov, Yuri Zhirkov, Roman Zobnin, Alexander Golovin, Daler Kuzyaev, Alexander Samedov, Artyom Dzyuba.\n\n___\n\nMore AP World Cup coverage: www.apnews.com/tag/WorldCup", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/10/football/morocco-football-victory-reaction-intl/index.html", "title": "Moroccan ecstasy at World Cup win shared by Africa and Arab world ...", "text": "Moroccan fans exploded in joy on Saturday as their team became the first from any African country to reach a World Cup semi-final, filling the stadium with a deafening roar and unleashing cheering, crying, dancing and singing on the streets back home.\n\n“They made us happy and proud and they proved that they can make it to the final.

Instead, he slid down at the two-yard line, good enough for a first down. The Jets had already burned their timeouts.\n\nGame over.\n\nThe game had plenty of drama — unpredictable performances, a comeback battle, Aaron Rodgers' return to the Jets and Pop icon Taylor Swift, in the stands for the second consecutive week to watch Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nChiefs vs. Jets highlights\n\nTaylor Swift? Aaron Rodgers? Deadpool, Ant-Man and Wolverine? Zach Wilson outperforming Patrick Mahomes? A 17-0 lead in the first quarter? A major comeback? A three-point victory that comes down to the wire?\n\nThis game had it all. See full highlight reel here.\n\nFirst, T. Swift arrived, with Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively, Hugh Jackman and Antoni in tow.\n\nThen, the Chiefs ran up the score — fast. Running back Isiah Pacheco ran 48 yards for a touchdown, Noah Gray caught a 34-yard TD pass from Mahomes, and Harrison Butker kicked a 37-yard field goal.\n\nPacheco finished with 115 rushing yards, 48 of those coming on his touchdown run.\n\nBut the Jets didn't let it go. They went on a 20-3 scoring run to tie the game entering the 4th quarter. The scores came with a safety, 31-yard field goal from Greg Zuerlein, and 1-yard and 10-yard TD passes from Wilson to C.J. Uzomah and Allen Lazard, respectively.\n\nJets quarterback Zach Wilson had one of his more promising performances, leading a comeback and tying the game at 20 on the first drive of the second half with the touchdown pass to Lazard and a two-point conversion he ran in himself. He finished 28 of 39 with 245 passing yards and two touchdowns.\n\nBut he also made a critical error that could have cost the Jets the game, fumbling the ball in the fourth quarter.\n\nMahomes had an uncharacteristic outing. The two-time MVP had a third interception negated by defensive holding on the final drive of the game. But his scrambling, including a 24-yard dash on 3rd-and-23, bailed out the Chiefs on a night the offensive line struggled against the Jets and receivers could not find much wiggle room in the secondary.\n\nHarrison Butker’s 26-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter made it 23-20 and held as the game-winning score.\n\nThe Taylor Swift-Travis Kelce romance is fake. You know it is. So what? Let's enjoy it.\n\nYou know it. Deep inside your soul. Where you tell yourself the truth. In fact, everyone knows it. Your friends. Your family. Your kids. The country. The President. Outer space. We. All. Know. It. We know the Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce romance is fake.\n\nDon't hate me for telling the truth that you already intuitively feel. You have told yourself this inevitable truth over and over as this story has washed over the nation. Your significant other even asked you recently: \"Do you think it's real?\" And you replied: \"Of course it is.\" You knew this was a a lie and it landed you in therapy but you want to believe. But you know what?\n\nIt's OK. This moment is actually interesting and fun. A certain sort of goofy obsession has seeped in. No, it's not real, but who cares? We all love this phony love affair. We will continue to love it. We will keep loving it until this spectacularly fake relationship dies and Kelce becomes a cautionary lyric on one of Swift's future albums. — Mike Freeman\n\nJets postgame press conference: Zach Wilson takes blame, Robert Saleh supports players\n\nJets quarterback Zach Wilson took full blame for the loss during a postgame interview.\n\n\"Yea, that's on me. Critical situation, I can't have a play like that. I can not drop the ball,\" Wilson said of his fourth-quarter fumble recovered by the Chiefs. \"To drop a snap, I can not do that. I lost us that game, and I can not do that. \"I was making it clear to those guys that I needed to be better. I needed to be better on the little things, the details. It can't happen.\"\n\nChiefs postgame press conference\n\nTaylor Swift and Donna Kelce hug it out at Chiefs game\n\nThe NBC broadcast cameras zoomed in on Taylor Swift chatting in a suite with Travis Kelce's mom, Donna. The two looked close, smiling and whispering while Swift put her arm around Donna multiple times.\n\nPatrick Mahomes recovers from near-interception: Holding?\n\nJets cornerback Sauce Gardner was called for a controversial hold that wiped out a Patrick Mahomes interception. The penalty resulted in an automatic first down on Kansas City’s final possession. Following the penalty, the Chiefs picked up a couple first downs, including a game-clinching nine-yard scramble by Mahomes on third-and-8 to ice the game.\n\nMahomes didn’t have his best performance Sunday night, but he did just enough for the Chiefs to survive. The quarterback went 18 of 30 passing for 203 yards, to go with one touchdown and two interceptions.\n\nJets turnover: Zach Wilson fumble recovered by Chiefs' Tershawn Wharton\n\nThe Jets battled back from a 17-point deficit to even the game at 20, but needed to score again as they trailed by 23-20 midway through the fourth quarter. With the ball at midfield, and the offense moving the ball incrementally, it looked like they’d have that chance for at least a game-tying field goal.\n\nBut Zach Wilson could not handle a shotgun snap and Chiefs defensive tackle Tershawn Wharton jumped on the pigskin before anybody else could. The Chiefs took over in Jets territory with 7:24 remaining. It was the Jets’ first turnover of the game.\n\nHarrison Butker makes 3rd field goal, Chiefs reclaim lead\n\nAfter going scoreless in the third quarter, the Chiefs put together a 14-play, 80-yard drive to get into scoring position. The Jets were able to stop the Chiefs on third down to force a 26-yard field goal with 10:51 remaining in the fourth quarter.\n\nButker’s made all three of his field goal attempts tonight.\n\nJets vs. Chiefs third-quarter highlights\n\nAllen Lazard’s 10-yard touchdown reception served as the only points in the third quarter.\n\nThe Jets have played solid defense against Kansas City for two straight quarters. New York held the Chiefs to just 42 total yards and three first downs in the quarter. Zach Wilson produced 79 passing yards and one touchdown. While running back Breece Hall had 43 rushing yards.\n\nThe contest is tied 20-20 at the end of three quarters.\n\nHas Travis Kelce scored a touchdown for the Chiefs today?\n\nNo, Kelce did not give Taylor Swift a reason to scream and cheer, but the Chiefs star tight end had a team-high six catches for 60 yards in the win. Kelce was targeted nine times.\n\nKansas City’s go-to guy on offense Sunday night was running back Isiah Pacheco who produced 158 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown playing in his home state of New Jersey.\n\nJets' Zach Wilson vs. Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes stats\n\nLet's take a look at the quarterback stats right now, after the first two drives of the third quarter:\n\nZach Wilson: 25 of 34 passes complete, 220 yards, two touchdowns, no interceptions\n\nPatrick Mahomes: 8 of 17 passes complete, 135 yards, one touchdown, two interceptions\n\nAllen Lazard touchdown: Zach Wilson ties it up with 2-point conversion\n\nOn the first drive of the second half, the Jets offense drove 75 yards and left the field with the ballgame knotted at 20.\n\nWilson found tight end Tyler Conklin for 25 yards to open the half. He then had first-down completions to receiver Allen Lazard and tight end Jeremy Ruckert.\n\nFrom the Chiefs’ 10-yard line, Wilson dropped back and fed Lazard a pass for a touchdown to make it 20-18. Wilson then scrambled to his left and extended the ball over the goal line to make the two-point conversion successful and tie the game.\n\nJoe Klecko honored at halftime of Jets vs. Chiefs\n\nSporting his gold jacket and standing on the Jets logo at midfield, Joe Klecko took the microphone next to his Hall of Fame bust that will be displayed at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio for eternity.\n\nHe thanked Jets fans as the team honored him for his induction to the Hall this past August. Klecko played for the Jets from 1977-1987 and was a two-time All-Pro defensive end. His 20.5 sacks in 1981 led the league that season.\n\nFirst-half recap: Chiefs lead Jets 20-12\n\nThe Chiefs jumped out to a 17-0 first quarter lead, but the Jets rallied back in the second quarter to go into halftime down 20-12.\n\nNew York outscored Kansas City 12-3 in the second quarter, thanks to two interceptions by the Jets defense.\n\nSafety Ashtyn Davis’ interception led to the Jets’ one and only touchdown thus far in the game. Linebacker C.J. Mosley also had a pick.\n\nThe Jets had 152 yards in the quarter compared to just 59 by Kansas City.\n\nStill, the Chiefs have an advantage at halftime due to a hot start. Kansas City’s gained 259 total yards. Running back Isiah Pacheco has 126 yards from scrimmage and one touchdown in the game.\n\nTaylor Swift welcomed by fans: 'I've never seen this much attention paid to the Chiefs'\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. – The last time Taylor Swift entered MetLife Stadium it was as a performer, the third of three nights she played in the stadium as part of her “Eras Tour” in May.\n\nOn Sunday, she was just a spectator, cheering on beau Travis Kelce as his Kansas City Chiefs faced the New York Jets on “Sunday Night Football.”\n\nFor the many Chiefs – and Jets – fans in attendance, the rumored Swift-Kelce relationship represented the apex of the hype surrounding the organization's “Winning Era,” a stretch that has included three Super Bowl appearances (two championships) and plenty of victories.\n\n“I’ve never seen this much attention paid to the Chiefs,” said Chiefs fan Josh Mayer, from Reading, Pennsylvania. “Every single TV show is talking about it, which is nice. Every TikTok I’ve seen is all about the Chiefs and how these Swifties are into football. It’s like ‘Oh, this is cool.’”\n\nRead the full story from reporter Chris Bumbaca.\n\nPatrick Mahomes intercepted again: Jets' C.J. Mosley makes catch\n\nMahomes nearly threw an interception to Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley while looking for Travis Kelce over the middle on the Chiefs’ previous drive. But Mosley dropped the pass, as Kelce and Mahomes’ telepathic communication stopped for at least a play.\n\nAs the second half came to a close, Mahomes was not as fortunate. This time, with Mosley roaming the middle of the field, Mahomes floated a pass off his back foot and straight into the linebacker’s hands for his second pick of the game.\n\nNew York, however, was unable to do much with the 26 seconds left on the clock.\n\nHarrison Butker field goal extends Chiefs lead 20-12\n\nAfter throwing an interception on Kansas City’s previous possession, Patrick Mahomes led the Chiefs on a 10-play, 56-yard drive that ended with a Harrison Butker 37-yard field goal.\n\nWide receiver Kadarius Toney had a nice 15-yard catch to put the Chiefs in field goal range.\n\nButker’s field goal gave Kansas City a 20-12 lead. Butker’s made both his field goal attempts in the first half.\n\nJets Brandin Echols out with hamstring injury\n\nPhantom horse collar, C.J. Uzomah touchdown helps Jets\n\nTaylor Swift won’t have to witness a first-half blowout after all.\n\nFollowing Mahomes’ interception, the Jets had excellent field position and were aided by a horse collar penalty – although replay appeared to contradict that call – to reach the red zone. Zach Wilson missed a wide-open Garrett Wilson for a touchdown on the next play, but he eventually found tight end C.J. Uzomah from one-yard out for the Jets’ first touchdown of the game. New York trailed 17-12 after the extra point with 6:26 until halftime.\n\nPatrick Mahomes pick: Jets' Ashtyn Davis intercepts throw\n\nPatrick Mahomes threw an interception in the second quarter against the New York Jets.\n\nBeginning a drive after the Jets kicked a field goal, Mahomes took the snap, faked a handoff and rolled right. He shuffled around in the pocket before throwing downfield for Noah Gray.\n\nJets safety Ashtyn Davis leaped up and caught the ball before it could get to the tight end and New York had the ball back.\n\nGreg Zuerlein field goal puts Jets offense on board\n\nZach Wilson and the Jets offense put together their best drive of the first half and gained some points and momentum, now trailing 17-5.\n\nWilson had a deep 39-yard pass to wide receiver Allen Lazard to put the Jets in scoring position. Wilson almost threw his first touchdown pass off the night a few plays later, but tight end Tyler Conklin couldn't hold onto the football in the end zone, so the club settled for a 31-yard field goal by kicker Greg Zuerlein.\n\nThe 62-yard drive was New York’s longest of the half.\n\nChiefs' Cole Christiansen is out with hamstring injury\n\nChiefs facemask penalty gives Jets safety, first points\n\nChiefs right tackle Jawaan Taylor has taken his share of penalties and criticism through the first three weeks of the season.\n\nThis play won’t make his highlight reel, either.\n\nTaylor was called for a facemask penalty in Kansas City’s end zone as the team started its drive deep in its own territory. Since the foul occurred in the end zone, it was ruled a safety.\n\nThe points were the Jets’ first of the game, and they trailed 17-2 early in the second quarter.\n\nNoah Gray touchdown: Chiefs lead Jets 17-0\n\nThe Chiefs came is as the heavy favorite, and they are playing like it.\n\nKansas City jumped out to a 17-0 lead after Patrick Mahomes engineered a six play, 89-yard touchdown drive. The Chiefs’ drive was capped off by a Mahomes 34-yard touchdown pass to tight end Noah Gray.\n\nThe Chiefs have scored on all three of their possessions and have 200 total yards late in the first quarter.\n\nWho is Chiefs' No. 10 Isiah Pacheco?\n\nIsiah Pacheco is a running back for the Kansas City Chiefs who scored the team’s first touchdown in its Sunday night matchup against the New York Jets.\n\nThe game served as a homecoming for the 24-year-old, who grew up in Vineland, New Jersey and played college football at Rutgers. He finished his college career at Rutgers as seventh in school history with 2,442 rushing yards.\n\nPacheco was drafted by the Chiefs in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL draft. His rookie year, he started 11 games and played in all 17. He ran for 830 yards and five touchdowns. The Chiefs won the Super Bowl, beating the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nPacheco goes by the nickname “Pop,” which he says comes from his time as a kid when he played Pop Warner and made a big tackle on defense. It also serves as a tribute to his older brother, who called him the name and passed away in 2016 at the age of 29.\n\nIsiah Pacheco touchdown gives Chiefs 10-0 lead over Jets\n\nThe Chiefs offense scored quickly after their defense forced a three-and-out.\n\nRunning back Isiah Pacheco followed his blockers to the left, found space and scampered for a 48-yard touchdown to extend Kansas City’s first-quarter lead. Butker hit the extra point to make it 10-0.\n\nThe Chiefs’ second series went 69 yards in just 5 plays. It lasted just over two minutes. The Chiefs have eight carries, 82 rushing yards and one rushing TD in the first quarter.\n\nChiefs' Harrison Butker hits 37-yard field goal\n\nChiefs kicker Harrison Butker made a 37-yard field goal to open scoring after Patrick Mahomes’ short pass to wide receiver Skyy Moore fell incomplete on third down. Chiefs lead 3-0.\n\nTight end Travis Kelce had two catches for 29 yards during Kansas City’s first series.\n\nIs Taylor Swift at Chiefs vs. Jets game?

Last week, she was seen in a suite with Kelce’s mom, Donna, and cheered Kansas City on to victory.\n\nSwift had three shows at MetLife Stadium this summer as part of her Eras Tour.

Goalkeeper Hannes Halldorsson has saved a Messi penalty kick to keep Iceland level with Argentina midway through the second half. Halldorsson went to his right and easily parried Messi's shot.\n\nMessi, the five-time FIFA player of the year, has struggled from the spot in some crucial moments. He famously (and briefly) retired from international football after missing when Argentina fell to Chile in the 2016 Copa America final.\n\n___\n\n5 p.m.\n\nA prominent group which campaigns against racism and anti-gay abuse in sports has accused St. Petersburg authorities of having it evicted from premises in the city.\n\nThe Fare Network, which helps FIFA and UEFA investigate cases of discriminatory behavior by fans, had planned to operate \"diversity houses\" in Moscow and St. Petersburg with exhibitions and talks on human rights.\n\nFare says the lease on their part of a St. Petersburg building was abruptly canceled and other tenants were told not to sub-lease space to Fare.\n\nExecutive director Piara Powar says \"it seems to be clear that the project in St. Petersburg has been subject to a political attack of the kind that shows how debates about human rights are curtailed by powerful conservative political forces in Russia.\"\n\nHowever, Powar says Fare has only \"anecdotal evidence\" of the city government's involvement.\n\nFare plans to open its event at new premises elsewhere in St. Petersburg later Saturday.\n\n___\n\n4:50 p.m.\n\nIceland is hanging in with Group D favorites Argentina at 1-1 at halftime in a match that has all the ingredients for an upset.\n\nA Sergio Aguero strike in the 19th minute was canceled out just 4 minutes later when Alfred Finnbogason swept a loose ball into the Argentina net off another broken play by the South Americans' defense.\n\nIceland, the smallest nation ever to qualify for the World Cup, has been content to surrender most of the possession but the chances have fallen fairly evenly. Iceland's strategy of long-range counterattacks and pressuring the Argentines' shaky backline seems to be working.\n\nGoalkeeper Wilfredo Caballero and the defenders in front of him have repeatedly left loose balls in the middle of the area, creating second chances for Iceland.\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson's volley just before the break was the last of those, but it went wide.\n\n___\n\n4:25 p.m.\n\nAlfred Finnbogason buried a rebound off a broken play by Argentina's defense to bring Iceland level just minutes after a Sergio Aguero strike had given the South Americans the lead at Moscow's Spartak Stadium.\n\nAguero spun his defender near the penalty spot to create enough space to beat goalkeeper Hannes Halldorsson to his right. The 19th-minute goal was the first serious threat from the Argentine attack, which has seen Lionel Messi force a pair of straightforward saves from Haldorsson but not much else.\n\nFinnbogason drove home a loose ball that had been parried into traffic by Argentine keeper Wilfredo Caballero to make it 1-1 in the 23rd.\n\nIceland missed a fantastic chance in the 10th when their pressure forced a breakdown on Argentina's backline. Caballero was forced to stab away an ill-advised back pass, and the ball wound up at the feet of Kari Arnason, whose volley missed a fairly open net.\n\n___\n\n4:05 p.m.\n\nArgentina has the early edge in their opening World Cup match against Iceland — at least in the stands.\n\nFans of Lionel Messi & Co. outnumber their Icelandic counterparts perhaps 10 to one inside Spartak Stadium in Moscow. Their singing has filled the 45,000-seat stadium since well before kickoff.\n\nThe South Americans did politely quiet down long enough for Iceland fans to get in the first of their famed \"Skol\" chants and a song of their own. But the few sections of fans wearing Iceland's dark blue are nearly swallowed up by the sea of sky blue-and-white Argentina jerseys.\n\nThe match is the first for each team in a group that also includes Croatia and Nigeria, who play later Saturday in Kaliningrad.\n\nIceland is the least populous nation ever to play in the World Cup. The entire country's population is only about seven times bigger than the stadium's capacity.\n\n____\n\n3:05 p.m.\n\nLionel Messi is joined in Argentina's attack by the fit-again Sergio Aguero to face Iceland at Spartak Stadium in Moscow. Aguero had knee surgery in March but returned in a warmup friendly against Haiti two weeks ago.\n\nThere is no space in the starting lineup for Juventus playmaker Paulo Dybala.\n\nIceland's No. 10 Gylfi Sigurdsson is fit to start despite, like Aguero, ending his English Premier League season in March because of a knee injury. Coach Heimir Hallgrimsson has opted for Alfred Finnbogason to lead the attack in a likely 4-5-1 formation.\n\nIt's the first game in Group D. Croatia plays Nigeria later Saturday.\n\nLineups:\n\nArgentina: Willy Caballero, Nicolas Tagliafico, Lucas Biglia, Lionel Messi, Angel Di Maria, Maximiliano Meza, Javier Mascherano, Marcos Rojo, Nicolas Otamendi, Eduardo Salvio, Sergio Aguero.\n\nIceland: Hannes Halldorsson, Birkir Mar Saevarsson, Ragnar Sigurdsson, Johann Berg Gudmundsson, Birkir Bjarnason, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Alfred Finnbogason, Kari Arnason, Aron Gunnarsson, Hordur Magnusson, Emil Hallfredsson.\n\n___\n\n2: 52 p.m.\n\nMidfielder Paul Pogba scored a late winner to help France to a 2-1 win against Australia in their World Cup opening game in Group C on Saturday.\n\nPogba was unimpressive until the 81st minute at the Kazan Arena, when he set up a fine one-two with substitute Olivier Giroud to beat Australia 'keeper Mat Ryan with a shot that took a deflection, hit the bar and crossed the goal line.\n\nAfter a balanced first half, France was awarded a penalty following a VAR review, the first of the World Cup, and scored to take the lead in the 58th minute. After checking images of a tackle from behind by Joshua Risdon on Antoine Griezmann, referee Andres Cunha pointed to the penalty spot. Griezmann sent a powerful strike into the net that left 'keeper Ryan stranded.\n\nAustralia equalized within four minutes with captain Mile Jedinak converting from the penalty spot after Samuel Umtiti handled the ball in the box.\n\n___\n\n2:38 p.m.\n\nFrance has taken a 2-1 lead against Australia with less than 10 minutes left to play in the World Cup Group C game. Paul Pogba scored following a fine one-two with substitute Olivier Giroud after his shot took a deflection, hit the bar and crossed the goal line.\n\n___\n\n2:20 p.m.\n\nFrance has been awarded a penalty following a VAR review, the first in the World Cup, and scored to take the lead against Australia.\n\nAfter checking images of a tackle from behind from Joshua Risdon on Antoine Griezmann, referee Andres Cunha pointed to the penalty spot. Griezmann sent a powerful strike into the net that left 'keeper Mat Ryan stranded to give France a 1-0 lead.\n\nAustralia equalized within minutes with captain Mile Jedinak converting from the penalty spot after Samuel Umtiti handled the ball in the box. Jedinak took the kick and sent France 'keeper Hugo Lloris the wrong way\n\n____\n\n1:55 p.m.\n\nGermany coach Joachim Loew says goalkeeper Manuel Neuer is looking confident ahead of the team's World Cup opener against Mexico, despite missing most of the season with injury.\n\nNeuer, a star of Germany's World Cup-winning team in 2014, played just four times this season for Bayern Munich because of a fracture in his left foot.\n\nLoew says \"he looks self-confident in training, the Manuel Neuer that we've always known.\"\n\nLoew adds that Neuer has been \"very calm, stable and he's in a very good mood. You could see that in the weeks and month before that he was working to strengthen his stamina.\"\n\nAhead of Sunday's game against Mexico, Loew revealed Germany spent Friday concentrating on corners, free kicks and penalties to deal with a perception that set-pieces might be a weak point for the 2014 champions.\n\n____\n\n1:46 p.m.\n\nIt's 0-0 at halftime between France and Australia in their World Cup Group C opener in Kazan.\n\nThe French have been dominating in the early stages and had the best chances before Australia settled in.\n\nAustralia defenders Trent Sainsbury and Joshua Risdon have been doing a fine job in making sure Antoine Griezmann and Kylian Mbappe did not get too many balls.\n\nApplying coach Bert Van Marwijk's orders, the Socceroos are putting on a composed but aggressive display that has been working well so far.\n\n___\n\n12:55 p.m.\n\nJulian Draxler says it's \"not true\" that his Germany teammates Mesut Ozil and Ilkay Gundogan are feeling isolated in the squad following controversy over their photo with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nArsenal's Ozil and Manchester City's Gundogan, who are both of Turkish descent, posed with Erdogan during the Turkish president's visit to Britain last month.\n\nGundogan, who gave Erdogan a shirt with a message \"to my revered president,\" was jeered by fans during last week's friendly win over Saudi Arabia.\n\nDraxler says reports \"that Mesut Ozil was not up to his best or that Ilkay Gundogan was a bit subdued, that's not true.\" He's praised Ozil as \"probably our most creative player on the pitch and so I'm sure that Mesut oezil will be there when we need him.\"\n\nGermany starts its title defense against Mexico in Moscow on Sunday.\n\n____\n\n12:05 p.m.\n\nFrance coach Didier Deschamps has opted for a three-pronged attack of Kylian Mbappe, Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembele to face Australia in the World Cup Group C opener.\n\nPaul Pogba, N'Golo Kante and Corentin Tolisso have been selected in a three-man midfield, with Benjamin Pavard, Samuel Umtiti, Raphael Varane and Lucas Hernández making up the back four.\n\nAustralia captain Mile Jedinak has been confirmed as a starter in place of Massimo Luongo, who started as screening midfielder in recent friendlies. Striker Andrew Nabbout will assume the scoring duties for the Socceroos.\n\nLineups:\n\nFrance: Hugo Lloris, Benjamin Pavard, Raphael Varane, Samuel Umtiti, Lucas Hernandez, Corentin Tolisso, N'Golo Kante, Paul Pogba, Antoine Griezmann, Ousmane Dembele, Kylian Mbappe.\n\nAustralia: Mat Ryan, Josh Risdon, Trent Sainsbury, Mark Milligan, Aziz Behich, Mile Jedinak, Aaron Mooy, Mathew Leckie, Tom Rogic, Robbie Kruse, Andrew Nabbout.\n\n___\n\n11:35 a.m.\n\nLaurent Ciman has left Belgium's World Cup squad, the team says on its official Twitter account, although it has not said if the defender's departure means that center back Vincent Kompany is fit again after injuring his groin in a warmup match two weeks ago.\n\nCoach Roberto Martinez took Los Angeles FC defender Ciman to Russia as a stand-by player in case Kompany was not fit for Belgium's opening Group G match against Panama on Sunday.\n\nThe team says that despite returning to Belgium, Ciman will remain on stand-by until Sunday evening.\n\n___\n\n11:10 a.m.\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron will travel to the World Cup only if Les Bleus make it to the semifinals.\n\nBut the French players will have the support of a former French president during their opening match against Australia in Group C.\n\nFIFA says Nicolas Sarkozy, an avid football fan who served as president from 2007-12, is among the guests at Kazan Arena.\n\n___\n\n10:30 a.m.\n\nSome soccer fans will follow their team anywhere to see it play in the World Cup. For five friends from Croatia that meant cycling 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) all the way from Zagreb to Kaliningrad in Russia.\n\nThe epic trek took them 15 days, cycling for 10 hours a day as they pedaled through Slovenia, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland.\n\nOn the way they encountered a number of challenges including a broken bridge. As they reached their final destination, the group collapsed into a bar and celebrated with a well-earned drink.\n\nThey're now looking forward to Saturday's game between Croatia and Nigeria.\n\nFrane Lukovic, a 46-year-old lawyer from Zagreb, insisted it was nothing out of the ordinary for long-distance cyclists such as himself.\n\nFor Lukovic, the trip represented a personal comeback, having been diagnosed with skin cancer six years ago.\n\n____\n\n10 a.m.\n\nWhile fans from around the world are singing and celebrating the World Cup on Moscow's streets, they can't go to the most famous place in the Russian capital — Red Square.\n\nBarriers staffed by police officers have blocked off the square for several days, with authorities citing the need to build and dismantle stages for a national holiday and a World Cup-themed opera performance last Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nMexico supporter Cesar Reyes, peering past the barriers, says \"it's a real shame it's closed because it's one of the best places to visit when you're in Moscow. It's a real shame that people will miss it because it's closed for special event and there's no opportunity to appreciate this building.\"\n\nRussian police have closed off a number of roads and other areas for security reasons over recent days. It's unclear when the square will be reopened.\n\n___\n\nMore AP World Cup coverage: www.apnews.com/tag/WorldCup", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2018/07/06/the-latest-fifa-fine-to-knock-socks-off-sweden/36672449/", "title": "The Latest: Beckham-Ibrahimovic have friendly World Cup bet", "text": "AP\n\nMOSCOW (AP) — The Latest on Friday at the World Cup (all times local):\n\n12:50 a.m.\n\nSoccer superstars Zlatan Ibrahimovic and David Beckham have struck a deal ahead of the World Cup quarterfinal game between their two countries on Saturday.\n\nIbrahimovic challenged Beckham via Instagram and the bet was relayed on the Los Angeles Galaxy's Twitter account.\n\n\"Yo @davidbeckham if @england wins I buy you dinner where ever you want in the world,\" the Galaxy and ex-Sweden forward wrote, stipulating that if the Swedes wins Beckham must buy him whatever he chooses from furniture store Ikea.\n\nBeckham, the former England and Galaxy midfielder, accepted the risk of furnishing Ibrahimovic's L.A. mansion — with a twist.\n\nIf Beckham's team wins Saturday in Samara, Ibrahimovic must come to a future England game \"wearing an England shirt and enjoy fish & chips at half time.\"\n\n___\n\n11:30 p.m.\n\nBrazilian fans are consoling one another after their national team was knocked out of the World Cup by Belgium.\n\nBrazilians had crowded plazas and bars to watch the quarterfinal game on Friday afternoon local time. In Rio de Janeiro's Maua Square, the atmosphere was festive and light ahead of the game, with the weekend and a hoped-for win on the horizon.\n\nWhen Belgium scored first and then again before halftime, the atmosphere grew more tense. Some still shouted: \"I believe!\"\n\nBrazil is soccer-mad, but this year's Cup served as an especially welcome distraction as the country emerges from a deep recession and suffers a crisis of confidence in its leaders.\n\nAfter the 2-1 loss, the fans in Maua Square were hugging one another. Five-time champion Brazil reached the semifinals four years ago when it hosted the World Cup but the 7-1 loss to eventual champion Germany stunned the nation.\n\n___\n\n11:05 p.m.\n\nBelgium coach Roberto Martinez says his squad's execution was perfect in the World Cup quarterfinal win over five-time champion Brazil.\n\nBelgium reached the World Cup semifinals for the first time in 32 years with the 2-1 win, setting up a meeting with France and sending Neymar home without living up to his status as soccer's most expensive player.\n\nMartinez says his Belgians \"were incredible.\"\n\n\"Sometimes you have to accept that Brazil has got this finesse, that quality, and that they're going to break you down, and (Belgium) just refused to accept that,\" Martinez adds. \"The execution was perfect. These boys deserve to be something special back home in Belgium.\"\n\nBelgium's golden generation lived up to their hype as Kevin De Bruyne netted the winning goal by completing a counterattack led by Romelu Lukaku in the 31st minute.\n\nBelgium and France will meet in St. Petersburg on Tuesday. The next day in Moscow it will be England or Sweden against Russia or Croatia.\n\n____\n\n10:55 p.m.\n\nBelgium has beaten Brazil 2-1 to reach the semifinals of the World Cup for just the second time. The Belgians led 2-0 at halftime and withstood late pressure from the five-time champions after Renato Augusto cut the margin with a header in the 76th minute.\n\nBelgium, which last reached the semifinals in 1986, will next face 1998 champion France in St. Petersburg.\n\nIt will be the first time since 2006 that four European teams will feature in the World Cup semifinals. The two other spots will be decided in Sunday's quarterfinals which feature Russia vs. Croatia and England vs. Sweden.\n\n____\n\n10:36 p.m.\n\nBrazil substitute Renato Augusto has pulled one back for the five-time champions, reducing Belgium's lead to 2-1 in their World Cup quarterfinal.\n\nAugusto, who went on three minutes earlier as a replacement for Paulinho, connected with a cross from Philippe Coutinho and headed the ball into the net to beat 'keeper Thibaut Courtois in the 76th minute.\n\n___\n\n9:47 p.m.\n\nA Fernandinho own goal and a perfectly executed finish from Kevin De Bruyne have given Belgium a 2-0 lead over Brazil at halftime in the World Cup quarterfinal match at Kazan.\n\nBelgium took the lead in the 13th minute after a Belgium corner from Nacer Chadli was met at the near post by Vincent Kompany with a flick, then diverted into the back of the net by Fernandinho's shoulder.\n\nDe Bruyne doubled Belgium's lead in the 31st minute following a swift counterattack following a Brazil corner. After the corner was cleared, Romelu Lukaku went on a mazy run through Brazil's midfield before laying a pass off to his left for the oncoming De Bruyne, who struck his shot low into the corner of the Brazil net and beyond the dive of goalkeeper Alisson.\n\nBrazil has had chances to get back into the game, notably in the 37th minute when a curling shot from outside the area from Philippe Coutinho was palmed away by Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.\n\nThe winner in Kazan will advance to a semifinal match against France.\n\n___\n\n9:33 p.m.\n\nKevin De Bruyne has made it 2-0 for Belgium in the World Cup quarterfinal against Brazil with a superb strike from the edge of the area at the end of a swift counterattack.\n\nDe Bruyne was set up on the right side of the box by striker Romelu Lukaku, who recovered the ball in Belgium's half and ran for about 30 meters before delivering a pinpoint pass to his teammate on the left. De Bruyne unleashed a low shot beyond the dive of 'keeper Alisson and into the corner of the Brazil net in the 31st minute.\n\n___\n\n9:17 p.m.\n\nBelgium has taken a 1-0 lead against the run of the play in its World Cup quarterfinal against Brazil through an own goal from Fernandinho.\n\nNacer Chadli's corner kick that was met at the near post by Vincent Kompany with a flick, then diverted into the back of the net off Brazil midfielder Fernandinho's shoulder in the 13th minute.\n\nBrazil had been in control with a high press and a couple of good chances, including a Thiago Silva's effort onto the post.\n\nThe winner of the Belgium-Brazil game will meet France in the semifinals.\n\n___\n\n8:40 p.m.\n\nBelgium fans are getting excited at Kazan Arena as their unofficial anthem, Gala's \"Freed From Desire\" Eurodance song, plays over the stadium's loudspeakers. Released in 1996, the song was a hit in many European countries and remains very popular among the Red Devils' supporters.\n\nBelgium is playing five-time champion Brazil for a spot in the World Cup semifinals.\n\n____\n\n8:35 p.m.\n\nAntoine Griezmann says it was \"normal to not celebrate\" the goal that sealed France's 2-0 win over Uruguay and sent his team into the World Cup semifinals.\n\nGriezmann did not smile, or perform his trademark dance from the Fortnite game, after Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera spilled a long-range shot into the net in the 61st minute.\n\nThe France forward explains he was mentored in soccer by a player from Uruguay and has friends from the country: \"I love Uruguayan culture and I love Uruguayans.\"\n\nHe was playing against his Atletico Madrid teammates Diego Godin and Jose Maria Gimenez who helped make Uruguay the toughest World Cup team to score against. Godin is the godfather to Griezmann's daughter.\n\nGriezmann says: \"I was also playing against friends, so out of respect I thought it was normal to not celebrate my goal.\"\n\n___\n\n8 p.m.\n\nBrazil coach Tite has made two changes from the team that beat Mexico for the World Cup quarterfinal match against Belgium at Kazan Arena.\n\nMarcelo has recovered from a back injury to take his place at left back in favor of Filipe Luis and Casemiro's absence through suspension has given given Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho a start.\n\nBelgium coach Roberto Martinez has brought Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli into the starting lineup in place of Yannick Carrasco and Dries Mertens.\n\nThe two players played big roles in Belgium's comeback win over Japan in the round of 16, both scoring in the team's 3-2 victory. Chadli scored the winner in the final seconds of the match following a thrilling counterattack.\n\nThe changes suggest that Belgium is likely to play a more direct approach as it tries to make the semifinals of the World Cup for the first time since 1986. The winner in Kazan will meet France in the semifinals.\n\nLineups:\n\nBrazil: Alisson, Thiago Silva, Miranda, Gabriel Jesus, Neymar, Philippe Coutinho, Marcelo, Paulinho, Fernandinho, Willian, Fagner.\n\nBelgium: Thibaut Courtois, Toby Alderweireld, Vincent Kompany, Jan Vertonghen, Axel Witsel, Kevin De Bruyne, Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Eden Hazard, Thomas Meunier, Nacer Chadli.\n\n___\n\n7:45 p.m.\n\nFor some reason, Croatia can't seem to avoid drawing the host country at the World Cup.\n\nCroatia has only qualified for the World Cup five times, the first coming in 1998. And for the third time in those trips, the Croatians are matched up with the home team. This time it's in the quarterfinals against Russia.\n\nCroatia lost to France 2-1 in the semifinals in 1998. In 2014, Croatia was drawn into the same group as host Brazil and fell 3-1 in the opening match of the tournament. In both 1998 and 2014, Croatia took 1-0 leads only to see the home country rally.\n\nClearly, Croatia is ready for a different result. A win would put the Croatians in the semis for the second time.\n\nCoach Zlatko Dalic says \"We cannot choose our opponents, be it hosts or somebody else. We are facing a huge game, quarterfinals, it doesn't matter who is the opponent. Maybe the only thing is the vociferous support by the fans.\"\n\nDalic says is players regularly play way games at packed stadiums \"fans howling\" for their clubs and \"this shouldn't be a problem for us.\"\n\n\"And ultimately we should not be asking or looking for any excuses. We have to play our own game, irrespective of who is in the stands.\"\n\n___\n\n7:30 p.m.\n\nEngland coach Gareth Southgate says there is a generation of young players finally starting to challenge the duopoly of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in world soccer.\n\nMuch to his delight, one of them is in his team.\n\nSouthgate says Harry Kane has reached \"another level\" by scoring six goals to top the scoring charts at the World Cup and that the striker is one of the \"exciting young players from right across the world announcing themselves\" in Russia.\n\nKane, though, says Messi and Ronaldo are still the benchmark for emerging players and that \"you can never write them off.\"\n\nWhile Messi's Argentina and Ronaldo's Portugal are already out of the World Cup, Kane can lead England to the semifinals for the first time since 1990 if his team beats Sweden in Samara on Saturday.\n\n____\n\n7:20 p.m.\n\nJamie Vardy is still a doubtful starter for England's World Cup quarterfinal match against Sweden because of a groin injury.\n\nCoach Gareth Southgate says the Leicester City striker did what he needed to do in training before the squad left for Samara for the match, but he still worked out \"slightly separate\" from the team.\n\nSouthgate says, \"In terms of fitness we just need to check with Vardy in the morning.\"\n\nVardy was hurt after going on as a substitute in the 88th minute of England's penalty shootout victory over Colombia in the round of 16.\n\nHe has been in the starting lineup only once in Russia, against Belgium, when Southgate made sweeping changes.\n\n___\n\n6:52 p.m.\n\nFrance is into the World Cup semifinals for the first time in 12 years after beating Uruguay 2-0. Raphael Varane opened the scoring with a header in the 40th minute and Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera's error contributed to Antoine Griezmann's clincher in the 61st.\n\nFrance went on to reach the World Cup final the last two times it advanced this far. It won its only World Cup in 1998 on home soil, and in 2006 lost the final to Italy on penalties.\n\nVarane raced across the area to meet a free kick and struck a glancing header that went into the far corner behind keeper Fernando Muslera.\n\nMuslera was then to blame for Griezmann's second-half goal when he tried to parry his shot away and instead saw it deflect off both hands into the goal.\n\nThese were only the second and third goals conceded by Uruguay in five World Cup matches. Uruguay played without striker Edinson Cavani who sat on the bench with an injured left calf picked up victory over Portugal in a round-of 16 match. Substitute Cristhian Stuani filled in for Cavani, teamming up front with Luis Suarez.\n\nFrance faces either Brazil or Belgium in the semifinals.\n\n___\n\n6:35 p.m.\n\nFrance forward Kylian Mbappe and Uruguay midfielder Cristian Rodriguez have picked up yellow cards after a testy exchange in the World Cup quarterfinal at Nizhny Novgorod.\n\nWith France leading 2-0 in the second half, Rodriguez appeared to stick his arm back as Mbappe jogged behind him. Mbappe dived to the ground as if injured, immediately angering Uruguay's players.\n\nThe game stopped for several minutes as players from both squads pushed and shoved while Mbappe lay on the pitch simulating an injury.\n\nArgentine referee Nestor Pitana issued yellow cards to both players.\n\n____\n\n6:20 p.m.\n\nFrance leads Uruguay 2-0 and appears to be on course for a World Cup semifinal spot, helped by a blunder from Uruguayan goalkeeper Fernando Muslera.\n\nAntoine Griezmann extended France's lead in their quarterfinal in Nizhny Novgorod in the 61st minute with a long-range shot that Muslera got both hands to but deflected into his own net.\n\nGriezmann's shot was straight at Muslera, but the keeper couldn't hold it and it looped into the net.\n\nFrance took the lead five minutes before halftime with a header from defender Raphael Varane. Griezmann was also involved in the openiner, providing the free kick from the right for Varane to head home.\n\nUruguay started without key striker Edinson Cavani, who hasn't recovered sufficiently from a left calf muscle injury. He sat on the bench during and looked unlikely to play any role in the game.\n\n____\n\n5:50 p.m.\n\nFrance leads Uruguay 1-0 at halftime of their World Cup quarterfinal after a header five minutes before the break from Raphael Varane.\n\nThe French defender made an angled run and met a free kick from the right side from Antoine Griezmann to put his team ahead in the 40th minute in Nizhny Novgorod. He glanced his header into the top left corner of the goal.\n\nUruguay nearly replied immediately, also from a set-piece, when Martin Caceres' header was saved low to his right by France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.\n\nFrance had the better of the first half but had to work to break down Uruguay's stubborn defense. Varane's header was only the second goal Uruguay has conceded at the tournament.\n\nUruguay started the game without key striker Edinson Cavani, who hasn't recovered sufficiently from a left calf muscle injury. He sat on the bench during the first half, with Cristhian Stuani taking his place in the lineup and playing up front with Luis Suarez.\n\nFrance brought midfielder Corentin Tolisso into its starting lineup to replace the suspended Blaise Matuidi.\n\nThe winner in Nizhny Novgorod plays Brazil or Belgium in the semis.\n\n___\n\n4:55 p.m.\n\nFrance forward Antoine Griezmann has arrived for the World Cup match against Uruguay sipping from a mate (MAH'-tay) gourd — perhaps as a silent retort to Luis Suarez.\n\nThe Uruguay striker took a verbal shot at Griezmann earlier this week ahead of Friday's quarterfinal, accusing him of trying to be Uruguayan. Griezmann plays at Atletico Madrid alongside Uruguayan defenders Diego Godin and Jose Maria Gimenez. Godin is godfather to Griezmann's daughter, and Griezmann has a fondness for the tea popularly sipped from a gourd in Uruguay and Argentina.\n\nSuarez stepped off the Uruguayan team bus at Nizhny Novgorod Stadium sipping from a mate gourd. Moments later, Griezmann did likewise as the French team arrived.\n\n___\n\n4:45 p.m.\n\nFIFA has fined Sweden's soccer federation 70,000 Swiss francs ($70,750) for players wearing unapproved branded clothing in World Cup games.\n\nFIFA says the Sweden team defied requests \"to cease the activity that led to the sanction.\"\n\nThe case relates to some players wearing branded socks that supplement the official team uniform.\n\nFIFA says its marketing and equipment rules were broken again when Sweden beat Switzerland 1-0 in a round of 16 game.\n\nSweden plays England on Saturday in the quarterfinals.\n\n____\n\n4:10 p.m.\n\nEdinson Cavani is not in Uruguay's starting lineup for the World Cup quarterfinal against France in Nizhny Novgorod.\n\nThe striker, who scored two goals and then injured his left calf in the round of 16 win over Portugal last Saturday, hasn't fully recovered and is replaced by Cristhian Stuani.\n\nThat's the only change made by Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez from the 2-1 victory over Portugal.\n\nFrance coach Didier Deschamps also made just one forced change: suspended midfielder Blaise Matuidi has been replaced by Corentin Tolisso.

Balwani, Theranos’ former president and COO who was also Holmes’ live-in boyfriend at the time, was found guilty on Thursday of ten counts of federal wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\n\nThe verdict comes after a stunning downfall that saw Holmes, once hailed as the next Steve Jobs, go from being a tech industry icon to being a rare Silicon Valley entrepreneur on trial for fraud.\n\nBut a Wall Street Journal investigation poked holes into Theranos’ testing and technology, and the dominoes fell from there. Holmes and her former business partner, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, were charged in 2018 by the US government with multiple counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. (Both pleaded not guilty.)\n\nTheir trials were separated after Holmes indicated she would pursue a defense that included alleging she was the victim of a decade-long abusive relationship with Balwani that impacted every part of her life. (Balwani’s legal team has strongly denied the allegations in court filings.)\n\nHere are the highlights of the rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos.\n\nMarch 2004: Holmes drops out of Stanford to pursue Theranos\n\nHolmes, a Stanford University sophomore studying chemical engineering, drops out of school to pursue her startup, Theranos, which she founded in 2003 at age 19. The name is a combination of the words “therapy” and “diagnosis.”\n\nSeptember 2009: Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani joins Theranos as Holmes’ right-hand man\n\nBalwani joins as chief operating officer and president of the startup. Balwani, nearly 20 years her senior, met Holmes in 2002 on a trip to Beijing through Stanford University. The two are later revealed to be romantically involved.\n\nThe two kept in touch and began living together in 2005, Holmes testified during her criminal trial. Their personal relationship was largely concealed from employees, investors and business partners. Balwani would ultimately become the company’s chief operating officer and president of the startup.\n\nSeptember 2013: Holmes opens up about Theranos; announces Walgreens partnership\n\nA decade after first starting the company, Holmes takes the lid off Theranos and courts media attention the same month that Theranos and Walgreens announce they’ve struck up a long-term partnership. The first Theranos Wellness Center location opens in a Walgreens in Palo Alto where consumers can access Theranos’ blood test.\n\nThe original plan had been to make Theranos’ testing available at Walgreens locations nationwide.\n\nSeptember 2014: Holmes named one of the richest women in America by Forbes\n\nHolmes is named to the magazine’s American billionaire list with the outlet reporting she owns a 50% stake in the startup, pinning her personal wealth at $4.5 billion.\n\nElizabeth Holmes speaking onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt on September 8, 2014 in San Francisco, California. Steve Jennings/Getty Images\n\nDecember 2014: Theranos has raised $400 million\n\nTheranos has raised more than $400 million, according to a profile of the company and Holmes by The New Yorker. It counts Oracle’s Larry Ellison among its investors.\n\nJuly 2015: Theranos gets FDA approval for Herpes test\n\nThe FDA clears Theranos to use of its proprietary tiny blood-collection vials to finger stick blood test for herpes simplex 1 virus – its first and only approval for a diagnostic test.\n\nOctober 2015: Theranos is the subject of a Wall Street Journal investigation; Holmes hits back\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports Theranos is using its proprietary technique on only a small number of the 240 tests it performs, and that the vast majority of its tests are done with traditional vials of blood drawn from the arm, not the “few drops” taken by a finger prick. In response, Theranos defends its testing practices, calling the Journal’s reporting “factually and scientifically erroneous.”\n\nA day later, Theranos halts the use of its blood-collection vials for all but the herpes test due to pressures from the FDA. (Later that month, the FDA released two heavily redacted reports citing 14 concerns, including calling the company’s proprietary vial an “uncleared medical device.”)\n\nOne week after the Journal report, Holmes is interviewed on-stage at the outlet’s conference in Laguna Beach. “We know what we’re doing and we’re very proud of it,” she says.\n\nHolmes speaking at a Wall Street Journal technology conference in Laguna Beach, California on October 21, 2015. Glenn Chapman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAmid the criticism, Theranos reportedly shakes up its board of directors, eliminating Henry Kissinger and George Shultz as directors while moving them to a new board of counselors; the company also forms a separate medical board.\n\nNovember 2015: Theranos and Safeway partnership falls short\n\nSafeway, which invested $350 million into building out clinics in hundreds of its supermarkets to eventually offer Theranos blood tests, reportedly looks to dissolve its relationship with the company before it ever offered its services.\n\nJanuary 2016: Federal regulators take issue with Theranos’ California lab; Walgreens pulls back\n\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) sends Theranos a letter saying its California lab has failed to comply with federal standards and that patients are in “immediate jeopardy.” It gives the company 10 days to address the issues.\n\nIn response, Walgreens says it will not send any lab tests to Theranos’ California lab for analysis and suspends Theranos services at its Palo Alto Walgreens location.\n\nMarch 2016: CMS threatens to ban Holmes, Balwani from lab business\n\nCMS threatens to ban Holmes and Balwani from the laboratory business for two years after the company allegedly failed to fix problems at its California lab. Theranos says that’s a “worst case scenario.”\n\nMay 2016: Balwani steps down; Theranos voids two years of blood tests\n\nBalwani departs. The company also adds three new board members as part of the restructuring: Fabrizio Bonanni, a former executive vice president of biotech firm Amgen, former CDC director William Foege, and former Wells Fargo CEO Richard Kovacevich.\n\nTheranos voids two years of blood test results from its proprietary testing devices, correcting tens of thousands of blood-test reports, the Journal reports.\n\nJune 2016: Holmes net worth revised to $0; Theranos loses its largest retail partner\n\nForbes revises its estimate of Holmes’ net worth from $4.5 billion to $0. The magazine also lowers its valuation for the company from $9 billion to $800 million.\n\nWalgreens, once Theranos’ largest retail partner, ends its partnership with the company and says it will close all 40 Theranos Wellness Centers.\n\nJuly 2016: Holmes is banned from running labs for two years\n\nCMS revokes Theranos’ license to operate its California lab and bans Holmes from running a blood-testing lab for two years.\n\nAugust 2016: The company unveils ‘miniLab’ device\n\nHolmes tries to move past recent setbacks by unveiling a mini testing laboratory, called miniLab, at a conference for the American Association for Clinical Chemistry. In selling the device, versus operating its own clinics, Theranos seeks to effectively side-step CMS sanctions, which don’t prohibit research and development.\n\nOctober 2016: Theranos investor sues the company; Theranos downsizes\n\nTheranos investor Partner Fund Management sues the company for $96.1 million, the amount it sunk into the company in February 2014, plus damages. It accuses the company of securities fraud. Theranos and Partner Fund Management settled in May, 2017, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nThe company also lays off 340 employees as it closes clinical labs and wellness centers as it attempts to pivot and focus on the miniLab.\n\nNovember 2016: Walgreens sues Theranos\n\nWalgreens sues the blood testing startup for breach of contract. Walgreens sought to recover the $140 million it poured into the company. The lawsuit was settled August, 2017.\n\nJanuary 2017: More layoffs, followed by a failed lab inspection\n\nTheranos downsizes its workforce yet again following the increased scrutiny into its operations, laying off approximately 155 employees or about 41% of staffers.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Theranos failed a second regulatory lab inspection in September, and that the company was closing its last blood testing location as a result.\n\nApril 2017: Theranos settles with CMS, and Arizona AG\n\nTheranos settles with the CMS, agreeing to pay $30,000 and to not to own or operate any clinical labs for two years.\n\nTheranos also settles with the Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich over allegations that its advertisements misrepresented the method, accuracy, and reliability of its blood testing and that the company was out of compliance with federal regulations governing clinical lab testing. Theranos agrees to pay $4.65 million back to its Arizona customers as part of a settlement deal.\n\nMarch 2018: Holmes charged with massive fraud\n\nThe SEC charges Holmes and Balwani with a “massive fraud” involving more than $700 million from investors through an “elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company’s technology, business, and financial performance.”\n\nThe SEC alleges Holmes and Balwani knew that Theranos’ proprietary analyzer could perform only 12 of the 200 tests it published on its patient testing menu.\n\nTheranos and Holmes agree to resolve the claims against them, and Holmes gives up control of the company and much of her stake in it. Balwani, however, is fighting the charges, with his attorney saying he “accurately represented Theranos to investors to the best of his ability.”\n\nMay 2018: “Bad Blood”\n\nReporter John Carreyrou, who first broke open the story of Theranos for the Wall Street Journal, publishes “Bad Blood,” a definitive look at what happened inside the disgraced company. Director Adam McKay (who directed “The Big Short”) secures the rights to make the film, starring Jennifer Lawrence as Holmes, by the same name.\n\nJune 2018: Holmes and Balwani indicted on criminal fraud charges\n\nHolmes and Balwani are indicted on federal wire fraud charges over allegedly engaging in a multi-million dollar scheme to defraud investors, as well as a scheme to defraud doctors and patients. Both have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMinutes before the charges were made public, Theranos announced that Holmes has stepped down as CEO. The company’s general counsel, David Taylor, takes over as CEO. Holmes remains chair of the company’s board.\n\nFormer Theranos COO Ramesh \"Sunny' Balwani leaves the Robert F. Peckham U.S. Federal Court on June 28, 2019 in San Jose, California.

Taylor said more than 80 potential buyers were not interested in a sale. “We are now out of time,” Taylor wrote.\n\nMarch 2019: Theranos gets the documentary treatment\n\nAlex Gibney, the prolific documentary filmmaker behind “Dirty Money,” “Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room,” and “The Armstrong Lie,” debuts “The Inventor” on HBO, following the rise and fall of Theranos.\n\nSeptember 2020: Holmes’ possible defense strategy comes to light\n\nA new court document reveals Holmes may seek a “mental disease” defense in her criminal fraud trial. Later, in August 2021, unsealed court documents reveal Holmes is likely to claim she was the victim of a decade-long abusive relationship with Balwani. The allegations led to the severing of their trials. His trial is slated to begin in 2022.\n\nDecember 2020: Holmes’ criminal trial delayed til 2021\n\nInitially set to begin in July 2020, Holmes’ criminal trial is further delayed til July 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMarch 2021: Holmes’ pregnancy further delays trial\n\nNews surfaces that Holmes’ is expecting her first child, once more further delaying her criminal trial. Holmes’ counsel advised the US government that Holmes is due in July 2021, a court document revealed. She gave birth in July.\n\nElizabeth Holmes, founder and former chief executive officer of Theranos Inc.

Nina Riggio/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAugust 2021: Holmes’ criminal trial begins with jury selection\n\nMore than 80 potential jurors are brought into a San Jose courtroom for questioning over the course of two days to determine if they are fit to serve as impartial, fair jurors for the criminal trial of Holmes. A jury of seven men and five women is selected, with five alternatives.\n\nJanuary 2022: Holmes found guilty on four of 11 federal charges\n\nHolmes is found guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud investors as well as three wire fraud counts tied to specific investors. She is found not guilty on three additional charges concerning defrauding patients and one charge of conspiracy to defraud patients. The jury returns no verdict on three of the charges concerning defrauding investors. Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison as well as a fine of $250,000 plus restitution for each count.\n\nHolmes’s sentencing date is set for late September to allow for the completion of Balwani’s trial. In the meantime, Holmes remains free on a $500,000 bond secured by property.\n\nElizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos Inc., left center, departs from federal court with, from left, husband Billy Evans, parents Noel Holmes and Christian Holmes IV in San Jose, California, U.S., on Monday, Jan. 3, 2022.

Here washers and dryers are on display at a Lowe's Home Improvement store in Miami. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nIt’s not just food and fuel\n\nFrom new tires to a dental visit or a new piece of sports gear, nearly every spending category tracked in the Consumer Price Index shows a price increase from not only last year but also from before the pandemic. The hikes, spurred in part by high crude oil prices, supply chain disruptions and global economic pressures, highlight just how pervasive inflation has become in America.\n\n“Everything that is directly or indirectly touching or dependent upon those really hot categories – food and energy – is also seeing faster rises, but it really is a broad-based increase,” said Nikolai Roussanov, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn June, prices for major appliances were up nearly 24% since before the pandemic in June 2019, tires were up 20%, veterinary services were up 17%, sporting goods were up about 14%, according to the CPI.\n\nAlthough those increases may pale in comparison to gas and grocery costs that are significantly higher than what they were in 2019, a 20% hike on a one-time – and frequently urgent – expense can be a budget killer at a time when paychecks are spread thin.\n\n“Low-income families are easily derailed by these unexpected expenses,” said Elizabeth Ananat, a Barnard College economics professor who studies topics such as inequality, poverty and the pandemic’s effects on lower-income mothers and families.\n\nAnd while the pandemic-related stimulus efforts like expanded child tax credit payments temporarily alleviated some of these ongoing money concerns for families by helping them manage unexpected expenses and maintain employment, low-income families have exhausted that savings buffer, she said.\n\n“When we look at bank balances for low-income families, that has gone back down to zero, on average,” she said. “When that happens, people don’t make ends meet … and it starts snowballing.”\n\nBusinesses are seeing firsthand just how the higher costs are rippling through every facet of life and the tough choices consumers are making as a result.\n\nPulling back on repairs\n\nAt Great Bear Auto Repair in New York City’s Queens borough, “everything is going up” in price, said Fordin, whose great-grandfather started the business in 1933.\n\n“My motor oil is off the hook,” she said. “Every time they deliver, every week, my motor oil prices are going up, my auto parts prices are going up, my labor’s going up, my cost of living is going up.”\n\nFor the most part, Great Bear is having to eat a lot of the price increases – especially when it comes to services like oil changes, she said.\n\n“We’re just doing it at cost so that we can still provide the service,” she said. “People don’t necessarily have the finances right now for even more of an increase.”\n\nAudra Fordin, of Great Bear Auto Repair in Queens, New York, says customers are cutting back on repairs to save money. Angelica Briones\n\nBroad-based inflation serves as a double whammy for the auto business, which has been in a state of flux due to high oil prices, shipping delays and computer chip shortages. Many customers are logging even more miles on their cars because they cannot afford a new or used one and have started to pull back on repairs – even the relatively small ones.\n\nIt’s a shift in consumer behavior and sentiment that Fordin last saw around 2008, when oil prices spiked, and the Great Recession was in full swing.\n\n“It feels like hesitation; people are scared,” she said. “They’re uncomfortable with the money. You can’t afford to put gas in your car. You can’t afford to put oil in your car.”\n\nDouble whammy\n\nAt Old Friends Senior Dog Sanctuary in Tennessee, donations serve as a lifeline.\n\nThe 10-year-old nonprofit organization provides food and veterinary care to more than 500 older dogs – including 125 rescues and about 400 furry friends placed in “Forever Foster” homes. The operating costs run about $4 million a year, and the organization is 100% reliant upon donations.\n\nOld Friends Senior Dog Sanctuary in Tennessee is paying more for the food and veterinary care it provides to more than 500 dogs. Devi Sanford/Old Friends Senior Dog Sanctuary\n\nThose donations have dropped off significantly since the end of last year, falling by 50%, said Zina Goodin, the sanctuary’s executive director.\n\n“Everybody’s being hit [by rising prices],” she said.\n\nOld Friends has a financial buffer that’s filling in the gaps, but those operational costs have been on the rise, she said. The cost of food is about 25% more than it was last year, medication costs are climbing and labor costs are going up as the nonprofit tries to stay competitive for workers, she said.\n\n“We’re OK right now, but as time goes on, that buffer will get eaten up,” she said, “and we’re concerned about what’s going to happen.”\n\nQuieter streets\n\nMagazine Street in New Orleans is home to cafés, restaurants and boutiques, including The Collective Shop, an art print and stationery business launched in 2020 by Alysia Fields and Toni Point.\n\nAfter successfully surviving the worst of the pandemic, the store and online retailer is now trying to navigate this period of high inflation, Fields said. Card stock and other paper goods have become more expensive, as well as harder to come by. Supply has been shoddy, leaving Fields and Point to guess inventory needs and buy more than they typically would.\n\nThe Collective, an art print and stationery business in New Orleans, survived the pandemic. Now it's contending with rising supply costs and fuel surcharges. The Collective Shop LLC\n\n“We have to play this fun game of overstocking in certain things, thinking that we’re going to need it later,” Fields said.\n\nThe cost increases have forced the young business to pause its free shipping online, since supply costs and shipping surcharges have become too unpredictable.\n\nFor the most part, The Collective Shop has tried not to hike the price of its cards and paper goods, instead letting the wall art serve as the moneymaker, she said.\n\nBut for a shop that’s part of a business district heavily reliant on passers-by and tourists, Fields has noticed that inflation seems to be taking a bite.\n\n“We’re so used to crawling with travelers, and it just doesn’t feel the same,” she said. “You can tell that there’s still a lot of hesitation to travel and to purchase anything outside of food and liquor.”\n\nCosts to come\n\nInflation levels are expected to moderate in the months to come, but consumers likely will feel the effects of high prices for many months ahead.\n\nAt Joe’s Sporting Goods in St. Paul, Minnesota, most of the outdoor gear on display – a colorful array of kayaks, tents, paddle boards and other products – was manufactured more than six months ago and at a time when the petroleum used to make those items was considerably cheaper, said Jim Rauscher, co-owner and president of the Twin Cities business. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year helped send oil prices rocketing to record levels, affecting everything from prices at the pump to key materials based on petroleum – and Rauscher is bracing for price spikes.\n\nPrices for petroleum-based products, like these kayaks on display at Joe's Sporting Goods in St. Paul, Minnesota, are expected to spike even further due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Jenner/Joe's Sporting Goods\n\nThe kayak that might retail for $850 now likely will run $1,000 or a little more next year, he said.\n\n“You’re going to see the higher prices at least through the holidays and possibly through next spring,” he said.\n\nWhile everyone along the supply chain is feeling the effects of higher prices, Rauscher tries to keep the situation in perspective. His family has run Joe’s for nine decades and has navigated plenty of choppy economic waters.\n\n“Having been through it in the past and knowing that everything is kind of cyclical, you’ll get through it,” he said of his business.\n\nMaking do\n\nAs widespread inflation continues to put certain purchases out of reach, families are learning to adjust their budget – and their outlook.\n\nWhen Amy Randall’s dishwasher broke down a couple of months ago, the substitute teacher watched video after video on YouTube to learn potential fixes, but none of them worked. She washes dishes by hand now.\n\nWhen the cost of chuck roast hit $28, Randall’s family turned instead to their garden teeming with zucchini.\n\nHer house in New York’s Catskills region could use a new coat of paint, but the prices quoted are now completely out of league for the 60-year-old single mother.\n\n“I don’t care anymore that the paint is chipping on my house, I don’t have the money,” she said. “People have to make a living, and people are charging more for things. And so all of these things just have to get put aside.”\n\nRandall said she has taken on a more mindful approach, being less impetuous and more resourceful, or simply “being OK with things not being OK,” she said.\n\n“I don’t want my kids to see the sorrow and distress,” she said. “I want my kids to see that we’re flexible, and we have everything we need, but some things are just too expensive.”", "authors": ["Alicia Wallace"], "publish_date": "2022/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/12/15/pharmacies-trimming-hours-and-stores-what-means-patients/10855274002/", "title": "Pharmacies are cutting hours and closing stores.

CVS Pharmacy spokesperson Amy Thibault said the company is not experiencing any widespread staffing issues or hours changes.\n\nPharmacies post-Roe:Walgreens, CVS pharmacists are withholding medications for people post-Roe\n\nStaffing challenges are also hitting mom-and-pop pharmacies, according to the National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents more than 19,000 independent pharmacies.\n\nAn Augustreport from the association found more than three-quarters of roughly 360 surveyed independent pharmacy owners and managers say they have a hard time filling open positions, resulting in higher payroll costs and longer wait times for patients.\n\nThe number of pharmacists employed by pharmacies and drug stores dropped 6% between 2019 and 2021, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bureau forecasts about 13,600 job openings for pharmacists each year on average over the next decade.\n\n“There are multiple stories about pharmacists just getting overwhelmed. The stress level and burnout is high,” Qato said. “So pharmacists leave, and stores have to shorten\" their hours.\n\nA lack of pay raises could also play a role. Compensation for pharmacists fell nearly 5% in 2021 after adjusting for inflation, according to the New York Times.\n\nHow many pharmacies are closing?\n\nCustomers are also facing mass store closures among some of the largest pharmacy chains in the nation.\n\nCVS said it is on track to close 300 stores in 2022, chipping away at a goal to shutter 900 stores over the next three years. Rite Aid spokesperson Catherine Carter said the chain is also reducing its retail footprint and has closed more than 150 stores across 17 states since late 2021.\n\nIn 2019, Walgreens announced plans to close 200 stores but declined to share additional numbers.\n\nSpokespeople for the companies told USA TODAY they take many factors into consideration when shuttering stores, such as customer buying habits and local market dynamics.\n\nAs for independent pharmacies, data from the National Community Pharmacists Association shows their numbers have remained relatively flat between 2020 and 2021.\n\nDoug Hoey, the association's CEO, said business from the coronavirus pandemic and the closure of surrounding chain pharmacies helped keep numbers stable, but he worries this is a short-term trend.\n\n“I'm concerned that without the help from the COVID vaccinations that everyone needed, these pharmacies that were able to tough it out for another year or two might not be able to continue,” Hoey said.\n\nResearch shows location plays a significant role in closures.\n\nThe number of independently-owned retail pharmacies in metropolitan areas increased by 28% between 2003 and 2021 but declined by 16% in noncore rural areas, according to the federally-funded Rural Health Research Centers.\n\nQato said closures are especially concerning if they lead to pharmacy deserts – areas that lack access to a nearby pharmacy. That could lead to issues with access to medications and other health services and worsen health disparities.\n\nA 2019 report published in the peer-reviewed Jama Internal Medicine found pharmacy closures between 2009 and 2015 disproportionately affected independent pharmacies and low-income neighborhoods where residents are more likely to use public health insurance. Another study from USC looking at the 30 most populous U.S. cities between 2007 and 2015 found Black and Latino neighborhoods had fewer pharmacies than white or diverse neighborhoods.\n\n\"For Medicaid and Medicare, reimbursement rates for pharmacies per prescription are lower than private insurance,\" Qato said. \"It makes it hard for any pharmacy that serves more publicly-insured populations to stay open because the profit margins are slimmer in those neighborhoods.\"\n\nWhy are pharmacies closing?\n\nExperts say a number of factors are leading to pharmacy closures, including a period of intense competition that continues to pressure prescription profits and pharmacies' focus on expanding digital services.\n\n\"This is not easy to paint with a broad brush by citing one cause,\" said Kathleen Bashur, spokesperson for the National Association of Chain Drug Stores. \"It is important to keep in mind that retail businesses of all sizes and formats, and across industries, are adapting to changing consumer expectations and to a very, very broad and complex array of dynamics.\"\n\nWalgreens spokesperson Marty Maloney said the company is focusing on creating “the right network of stores in the right locations,” while CVS’s Thibault said its closures are based on “changes in population, consumer buying patterns and future health needs.” Carter said the Rite Aid closures are meant to reduce costs and improve profitability.\n\nAs for independent pharmacy closures, the pharmacists association points to slim margins on prescription drugs dictated by pharmacy benefit managers.\n\nPharmacy benefit managers – the middlemen between pharmacies, drug manufacturers and health insurers – help set the rates pharmacies are paid to fill prescriptions, also called reimbursement rates.\n\nThe top three benefits managers (CVS Health’s CVS Caremark; Cigna's Express Scripts; and UnitedHealth Group’s OptumRX) control about 80% of the market, according to data from independent market research firm Health Industries Research Companies.\n\n\"Because those three have such a large market share, they're able to dictate prices and payments to the pharmacies,\" Hoey said. \"And it's often a very low payment to the pharmacies. That's leading to the closures.\"\n\nBashur said pharmacies of all types are in \"serious need\" of reform to address pharmacy benefit manager tactics that are \"manipulating the pharmaceutical marketplace in a way that inflicts consequences on patients and on the pharmacies that serve them.\"\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission in June launched an inquiry into the pharmacy benefit manager industry, and Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Maria Cantwell of Washington introduced legislation in May that would give the FTC the power to increase drug pricing transparency and hold benefit managers accountable for \"unfair and deceptive practices.\"\n\n\"Prescription drugs are frequently sold at breakeven or loss,\" said Don Downing, a clinical professor at the University of Washington pharmacy school. \"That is not a business model that allows community pharmacies to sustain staffing or even being able to keep their doors open.\"\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents benefit managers, argues that the independent pharmacy market is stable and says benefit managers lower prescription drug costs and increase access.\n\nThe trade group's website says benefit managers administer prescription drug plans for more than 266 million Americans and save payers and patients an average of $962 per person per year.\n\nSpokesperson Greg​ Lopes pointed to data that shows the number of independent retail pharmacies in the U.S. has grown over the last 10 years, based on a Quest Analytics analysis of National Council for Prescription Drug Programs pharmacy data.\n\nPharmacy benefit managers “absolutely recognize the value of independent pharmacies to patients and better health outcomes,” Lopes said in a statement. “(The stability in this market) allows PBMs to partner with independent pharmacies to achieve our shared objective of increasing access to affordable medications, helping patients stay on their prescribed medications, and work together to maintain stability and growth in the independent pharmacy market.”\n\nYou can follow USA TODAY reporter Bailey Schulz on Twitter @bailey_schulz and subscribe to our free Daily Money newsletter here for personal finance tips and business news every Monday through Friday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/business/real-estate/2020/09/15/gun-manufacturer-sccy-firearms-to-close-tennessee-plant-to-expand-in-daytona-beach-instead/5799316002/", "title": "Gun maker SCCY to close Tennessee plant to expand in Daytona ...", "text": "DAYTONA BEACH — Three years after making national headlines by announcing plans to move his Daytona Beach company's headquarters and most of its gun manufacturing operations to Tennessee, the owner of SCCY Firearms is now saying the company will remain in Volusia County.\n\n\"I've made a commitment to stay in Daytona Beach, Volusia County, and grow SCCY Firearms here,\" said CEO Joe Roebuck whose company's name is pronounced \"sky.\"\n\nRoebuck last year leased a building in Maryville, Tennessee, where he opened a plant, but continued to lease a 21,000-square-foot building off of Bill France Boulevard in Daytona Beach where most of his manufacturing operations remain.\n\nRoebuck said he informed economic development officials in Tennessee last week of his decision to scrap plans to build a nine-building headquarters campus there. He said he will close his plant there by the end of October and move the manufacturing equipment to Daytona Beach.\n\nA second manufacturing plant is set to open here in a portion of the former Costa Del Mar headquarters building at the Center Point Business Park on Mason Avenue. Roebuck recently agreed to lease a 20,000-square-foot space there with possible plans to lease additional space in that building as his business grows.\n\n\"By the end of October, 100% of our products will be manufactured in Daytona Beach,\" Roebuck said. He said he expects to add 30 more workers here that would boost his total work force locally to 200 by year's end.\n\nRoebuck also recently paid $1.7 million to buy an aircraft hangar home in the Spruce Creek Fly-In community in Port Orange.\n\n\"I'm fully invested here,\" said Roebuck, who started SCCY in a small leased building in South Daytona in 2003.\n\nThe company makes semi-automatic pistols that offer the quality of high-end guns, but at more affordable prices, according to Roebuck.\n\nThe New York native describes himself as \"an inventor, mechanical design engineer and tool-and-die maker\" who has invented a number of products including medical devices over the years.\n\nA January 2020 article in Guns & Ammo magazine described SCCY as \"a leading brand in affordable carry pistols (that) is revolutionizing the everyday-carry market with the launch of their red dot-equipped CPX-1 RD and CPX-2 RD nine millimeter pistols.\"\n\nThe company recently launched its newest product: a light-weight nine millimeter semi-automatic pistol called the DVG whose initials stand for \"David versus Goliath,\" Roebuck said.\n\nThe pistol has a suggested retail price of $289 for a standard model and $389 for one that comes with a red dot sight. Similar guns made by high-end brands such as Sig Sauer and Springfield typically retail in the $600 to $800 range, Roebuck said.\n\nThe roll-out of that new product, combined with a surge in gun sales thanks to the coronavirus pandemic as well as the looming Presidential election has resulted in an upswing in orders for SCCY, said Roebuck. \"We currently have a 10-month backlog,\" he said.\n\nRoebuck said his company is on track to have one of its best-ever years for sales.\n\nThe state of Tennessee and Blount County had offered SCCY roughly $5 million in potential economic incentives to persuade Roebuck in 2017 to agree to move his headquarters and most of his manufacturing operations to the Maryville area outside Knoxville.\n\nRoebuck said he originally planned to immediately build a new headquarters campus on 68 acres in Maryville with the goal of beginning production there in 2018. He also intended to create 350 jobs there.\n\nThose plans were delayed by an unexpected industry-wide slump in gun sales. He decided last year to temporarily lease a 10,000-square-foot building next to the site of his planned future headquarters \"to see what it was really like to do business in Tennessee.\"\n\nWhile Tennessee and Blount County economic development officials \"immediately made me feel welcome,\" Roebuck said he discovered that it was harder than he anticipated to find available skilled workers.\n\nAnd more costly.\n\n\"Labor costs in Tennessee are 30% more than here (Daytona Beach),\" said Roebuck. He attributed that primarily to the presence of a large manufacturer in Maryville where the starting pay was much more than he could afford to offer.\n\n\"I couldn't get good people because (the other Maryville manufacturer) was sucking them all up,\" he said.\n\nJeff Muir, communications director for The Blount Partnership, the economic development group for Blount County, Tennessee, said Roebuck's decision to pull the plug on his Maryville operations \"was definitely a shock. We had high expectations when he came here. We worked diligently with him to help him get employees. He paid his taxes and made donations (to Maryville area charities). I think it came down to wages.\"\n\nRoebuck said he also realized, \"it would be too costly to lose production in Daytona Beach and move. Can't afford it.\"\n\nRoebuck said he is walking away from Maryville after investing nearly $1 million there,\n\nThe 68 acres that Blount County had turned over to Roebuck for his planned headquarters campus will be awarded back to The Blount Partnership, Muir said.\n\nRoebuck said while the economic incentives that Blount County and the state of Tennessee offered were enticing, \"I never took a dime of it with the exception of the land which I'm giving back.\"\n\nRoebuck said he is receiving no economic incentives to consolidate and grow his operations in Daytona Beach.\n\nRoebuck said the new jobs he plans to create here range from $14 an hour for low-skill machine operators up to $90,000 to $100,000 a year on average for skilled engineers.\n\n\"We pay above market and we also offer a full benefits package that includes a 401(k) program. We pay more than 90% of medical, including vision and dental, and offer two to three weeks of PTO (paid time off) and all major holidays off,\" he said. All employees at SCCY are full-time. \"We don't have any part-timers here. We operate in three shifts.\"\n\nRoebuck said one of the factors that helped seal his decision to consolidate here was learning about the availability of space at Center Point Business Park, which is owned by his longtime friend, local developer Mike Cotton of Cotton Enterprises.\n\nCosta Del Mar late last year announced that it would be closing most of its Daytona Beach operations by mid-2020 to move to other parts of the country.\n\nThe sunglass company vacated the space it was leasing in the two buildings at Center Point in July.\n\n\"When I found out about Costa, I called Mike Cotton in February and asked if he had any space that would become available. When he said yes, I said hold it for me,\" Roebuck said.\n\nCotton was Roebuck's original landlord when he started SCCY in South Daytona.\n\nRoebuck said he plans to continue leasing his current headquarters building at 1800 Concept Court off of Bill France Boulevard. The building is owned by the family of the late developer Joseph Fisher, who Roebuck said he had formed a close relationship with.\n\nEventually, Roebuck said he hopes to grow his Daytona Beach operations by leasing another space that would expand his total footage to 60,000 square feet.\n\nKent Sharples, president of the CEO Business Alliance in Daytona Beach, said his group worked with Roebuck for about six months in 2016 to persuade him to expand here rather than out of state.\n\nWhile that effort fell short, he said, the alliance is thrilled that Roebuck finally decided to reverse course.\n\n\"We're really happy that Joe did not leave Florida and go to Tennessee,\" Sharples said. \"While incentives offered by other states can seem enticing, ultimately it often does come down to work force and we do have a very stable work force here. And the thing about those (economic incentive) deals, when you start digging into the details, sometimes there are a lot of caveats that make the incentives not so sweet.\"\n\nRoebuck credited local Cobb Cole attorney John Ferguson and his Realtor wife, Kelly, with helping him feel more connected with the Daytona Beach community.\n\nKelly Ferguson was the Realtor with Geri Westfall Real Estate, that helped him negotiate the deal to buy the hangar home at Spruce Creek Fly-In.\n\nThe listing agent who represented the seller was Rachel McGrath of Premier Sotheby's International Realty. The sale closed last Friday.\n\nRoebuck is an avid pilot. \"I fly myself for business,\" he said.\n\nRoebuck noted that he always intended to keep some of his manufacturing operations in Daytona Beach, in part because he didn't want to risk losing his employees, some who have been with SCCY for 10 years.\n\n\"This is home now,\" he said. \"My heart has always been here.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/04/07/coronavirus-heres-list-tallahassee-businesses-received-local-stimulus-money/2962887001/", "title": "Coronavirus: Here's a list of the Tallahassee businesses that ...", "text": "After more than $1 million in local stimulus dollars were distributed to 489 businesses in just 12 days, another round of sales tax money may be in the works for restaurants and hospitality businesses in danger of closing because of the coronavirus.\n\nThe Blueprint Intergovernmental Agency, made up of all 12 city and county commissioners, is set to discuss another economic stimulus package through the Office of Economic Vitality next week at its Wednesday meeting.\n\nOEV has filled an unanticipated role amid the economic uncertainty accompanying the global spread of the coronavirus, which has all but halted the routine of American life and forced companies to close, lay off workers, or overhaul their business models.\n\nThe businesses approved for the COVID-19 Economic Disaster Relief (CEDR) Grant Program represent a wide array of the 9,000 or so that operate in the community that serve as local economic drivers.\n\nOEV Director Christina Paredes broke down the major industries that benefited from the temporary influx of money until state and federal dollars arrive — 79 restaurants and bars, 69 personal services such as barbers and nail salons, and 192 professional services all were awarded funding based on the number of people they employ.\n\nOwners that received the money had to pledge that their business would stay open for the next 45 days and be able to prove they’ve taken a 50% hit to revenues.\n\n“The intent being this was to provide that initial lifeline in these first few critical weeks,” Paredes said. “We didn’t want to be in a situation where a business knew they were closing. The key focus is to help sustain our key businesses.”\n\nBack story:12 days, $1 million. Economic stimulus money goes to 487 Tallahassee businesses\n\nParedes said a backlog of applications resulted in an additional $18,000 being awarded to businesses after the $1 million approved by the IA ran out. The extra money could be diverted from the Urban Jobs Program, pending approval of the IA Board.\n\nShe said OEV was helping businesses connect with state and federal services as more aid becomes available and the award process was analyzed by independent grant reviewers.\n\nBusinesses were eligible for $1,500, $2,500 or $5,000 based on the number of people employed.\n\n$5,000 TIER\n\nLofty Pursuits\n\nFlorida Health Science Consulting\n\nSimply Soul Food Inc dba Earley's Kitchen\n\nSweat Therapy Fitness\n\nChop Barbershop LLC\n\nCatering Capers\n\nCrawco, LLC dba Sport Clips\n\nFielder Tree Service LLC\n\nCentrale\n\nMain Street Entertainment\n\nMiracles In Me Childcare\n\nHairsmith Inc\n\nHaute headz salon\n\nFood Glorious Food\n\nbella bella\n\nTarget Print & Mail\n\nRailroad Square Craft House\n\nThe Cabo Corporation\n\nBackwoods Bistro, LLC\n\nRedEye Coffee\n\nCorner Pocket of Tallahassee\n\nProper Brewpub\n\nCapital Home Health Corp\n\nAlbritton Electrical Service\n\nGMT Pubs (Finnegan's Wake/Fifth and Thomas)\n\nBackwoods Crossing LLC\n\nSkate World Center Inc\n\nJeri's Midtown Cafe LLC\n\nTNT Spa 5 LLC dba Millennium at Nail and Day Spa\n\nTNT Spa LLC\n\nQuick & Clean, Inc.\n\nPrime Time\n\nSocial Catering and Events\n\nVibe Adventures/Which Wich\n\nUrban Air Tallahassee LLC\n\nWalter G.

For every one of these teams and their vendors, the summer of 2020 will have to be written off as a complete bust, with total losses expected to far exceed $100 million.\n\nBut there is one source of income they’re still hoping to collect: business interruption insurance.\n\nLike thousands of other companies across the country, these teams and their vendors believe that because they faithfully paid insurance premiums and could not have foreseen that the coronavirus pandemic would cause the government or MLB to shut them down, they are now entitled to a payout.\n\nThe problem is, their insurance companies don’t agree.\n\nNot only do insurers say that no physical damage has been done to property – such as would have occurred after a flood of a hurricane – they point to clauses in practically every contract that explicitly state that losses caused by viruses are not covered.\n\nBattle royale in the business world:Coronavirus business interruption battle pits business lobby against itself\n\nOne a mission to save restaurants:His mom died the day before he closed 23 restaurants. Now he’s on a mission to save the industry he loves.\n\nUnwilling to take these denials as the last word, every kind of company that has been battered by government shutdowns – from bars, restaurants and daycare centers to gyms, hair salons and dental offices – is now suing insurance carriers to collect on claims, and insurers are circling the wagons to defend themselves.\n\nFor most of the participants in this battle, the stakes could not be higher.\n\nThe American Property Casualty Insurance Association estimates that coronavirus related shutdowns have cost companies with 100 or fewer employees anywhere from $250 billion to $430 billion per month. With the insurance industry’s collective surplus hovering around $800 billion, it would not take long for carriers to get completely wiped out if they started paying on claims, according to a letter circulated in April by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.\n\n“Pandemic outbreaks are uninsured because they are uninsurable,” David A. Sampson, president and CEO of APCIA, is quoted as saying in the Chicago Fed letter. “Insurers benefit from diversifying risk, but diversifying pandemic risk is particularly difficult as a large number of businesses and households are often affected at once, which in turn can create substantial losses.”\n\nThe potential downfall of the insurance industry isn’t stopping companies across the country from demanding payment. That’s because their own fates hang in the balance.\n\nBecause MLB is not playing ball\n\nA group of 50 minor league baseball teams and their vendors are just the latest to sue. According to their lead attorney, Andrew Sandler, it wasn’t coronavirus that ended their season. It was MLB.\n\n“The teams are unable to play because they’re not getting their players from MLB,” said Sandler, an attorney with Mitchell Sandler LLC in Washington, D.C. “That is classic business interruption.\n\n“This is no different than cases after 9/11, Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Katrina,” Sandler continued. “The courts view it very dimly when insurers collect premiums then when a major catastrophe hits, they say they can’t pay.”\n\nA spokesman for Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Co., the lead insurance carrier named in the lawsuit, said his firm does not comment on pending litigation.\n\n2020 MLB schedule:The 10 matchups, games and series we want to watch most\n\nThe teams involved in the lawsuit average about 20 employees and more than $2 million in annual expenses, according to Jason Freier, the chief executive of Hardball Capital, an Atlanta company that owns three of the minor league teams. Some of the teams in the league own their own stadiums and all the concessions stands that sell everything from t-shirts and jerseys to hotdogs and hamburgers. Others lease the ballparks from the cities in which they operate and contract out to vendors.\n\nPlayers are not part of their payrolls. They are paid and managed by MLB, which can withhold players if it chooses to do so, and that’s exactly what happened late last month.\n\nIn terms of fans, league attendance has surpassed 40 million for the last 15 years, according to the lawsuit. “These ballparks are among the largest community gathering places in town,” Freier said.\n\nThe stadiums are also major employers.\n\n“Large numbers of people cycle through seasonally – ushers, concession workers, cleaning crews,” Freier said. “There are literally hundreds of people that rely on the activity in season for some portion of their income, and now that the season has been canceled, it’s going to be a struggle for them.”\n\nFreier said his company has faithfully paid business interruption insurance for 35 years.\n\n“It’s frustrating when you keep paying your premiums in the hope that you won’t need it and then something comes along and you think this will get you through,” Freier said. “Now we’ve gotta find some other way to mitigate the damage.”\n\nBattle royale: restaurants vs. insurers\n\nOwners of restaurants have been equally frustrated with insurance companies regarding the refusal to pay business interruption insurance. They also have been exceptionally vocal about it.\n\nIn April, a group of famous restauranteurs led by Thomas Keller, Wolfgang Puck, Daniel Boulud, Jean-Georges Vongerichten and John W. Houghtaling II formed the Business Interruption Group, and they complained all the way to President Donald Trump about the devastation wrought by the pandemic and the failure of insurance companies to provide relief.\n\nBesides the complaints, these restaurant owners also filed dozens of lawsuits.\n\nIn New Orleans, Houghtaling filed one of the first suits against underwriters at Lloyds of London on behalf of his 500-seat Oceana Grill restaurant in the heart of the French Quarter. He argued that he paid for an “all risk policy” that “only excluded losses due to biological materials such as pathogens in connection with terrorism or malicious use.” He, therefore, concluded that his insurance company should provide coverage for the pandemic.\n\nAs to whether coronavirus does long-term damage to property, the Houghtaling suit concluded that the virus physically infects and remains on surfaces for up to 28 days, particularly in humid areas of the country like Louisiana.\n\n“It is clear that contamination of the insured premises by the coronavirus would be a direct physical loss needing remediation to clean the surfaces of the establishment.”\n\nLloyds of London disagreed.\n\nIn ensuing lawsuits, such as one filed by the owner of El Novillo restaurants in Miami against Lloyds of London in April, owners expanded on the same themes.\n\nThey claimed it was the actions taken by government to stop the spread of coronavirus, and not the pandemic itself, that put them out of business. They insisted that the virus attached itself to property making it unsafe for the general public to enter and required remediation; and they maintained that insurers never intended to honor their commitments.\n\nAttorneys representing Lloyds of London battled back, saying that business losses could be covered under their policies only if there was \"physical loss or damage to the insured properties,\" and that no property was damaged in any way by the coronavirus.\n\n“There is nothing to repair, rebuild or replace,” court documents filed by attorneys representing Lloyds in the El Novillo case state. There isn’t “any mention of what physical damage occurred, how the physical damage occurred and when the physical damage occurred.”\n\nIn their motion to dismiss, attorneys also pointed to microorganism and pollution exclusions in the contracts.\n\nThe first exclusion voids coverage for any claim arising directly or indirectly out of a microorganism, and \"the coronavirus is unquestionably a microorganism,” court documents state. The second exclusion “precludes coverage for any claim related to substances that pose a threat to human health,” and coronavirus is unquestionable a threat to human health.\n\nWhat's more, attorneys representing Lloyd’s accused restaurant owners of lying in their pleadings by saying that government forced them to close their restaurants.\n\n“Plaintiffs were never required to cease delivery, take-out or pick-up services,” documents filed on behalf of Lloyds state. “No government order prevented plaintiffs themselves, or their employees, from entering the properties, and indeed certain of the orders actually encouraged access.”\n\nThus far, most cases filed against insurance companies are still pending, with attorneys on both sides expecting to be litigating for some time.\n\n\"In terms of business interruption insurance, we're in the top of the first inning of a nine inning game,\" said Sandler, the lead attorney representing minor league baseball teams in their lawsuit against insurance companies.\n\nLike after 9/11 and Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, insurers worked hard to discourage small businesses from pursuing claims by denying coverage, Sandler said. Then after those businesses sued, insurers tried to get courts to interpret their exclusions as broadly as possible and to dismiss the cases.\n\nThat’s where we are now, Sandler said. In the end, however, many of the cases were resolved through settlements, allowing businesses to recover some or all of what they were owed.\n\nCoronavirus business interruption battle pits business lobby against itself\n\n'We will not pay for loss or damage'\n\nThe depth and variety of the companies filing lawsuits against insurance companies are hardly limited to restaurants and minor league baseball teams.\n\nOn May 18, for example, the company that owns and operates Central Bucks Children’s Academy, a day care center based in Warrington, Pennsylvania, sued Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Co., accusing it of refusing to pay benefits under its business interruption policy.\n\nThe day care center says in its lawsuit that it was forced to shut down on March 15 and has remained closed ever since, incurring “a substantial loss of business.”\n\nIn a letter to the daycare center, Philadelphia Indemnity’s property claims supervisor Karen Grocott counters that no day care employee was sickened by the virus and “there have been no reports of physical damage to your property.” She also noted an exclusion in the contract “due to virus or bacteria.”\n\n“We will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from any virus, bacterium or other microorganism that induces or is capable of inducing physical distress, illness or disease,” Grocott wrote. “Further, because physical damage by a covered cause of loss did not occur to property, the coverage provided under the (government shutdown) provision is not triggered.”\n\nGabriel Gillett, an attorney with Jenner & Block LLP in Chicago who represents clients that have been denied business interruption claims, believes many more lawsuits will be filed before the battles between companies impacted by government shutdowns and their insurers are over.\n\n“One thing we’re finding is that when some people get that denial letter, they think that’s the final word,” Gillett said. “But they need to know that insurers are denying everyone everywhere and that their denial is susceptible to a challenge.\n\n“In their policies, insurers simply did not choose to exclude coverage for the loss or damage caused by the unprecedented government shutdown orders. Restaurants and other businesses who bought insurance for business interruption reasonably believed they would get such coverage.”\n\nThe policies do offer coverage in the case of these government shutdown orders, Gillett says. And, in his view, insurers can’t keep client premiums and deny coverage just because they claim they can’t afford to live up to the terms of the contracts.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2021/12/04/nft-apple-metaverse-2022-predictions/8803081002/", "title": "From NFTs to Apple and the metaverse: What 2022 holds for the tech", "text": "Peter Csathy\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nJust when we thought it was safe to get back into the real world, new COVID variants emerge to brush us back – continuing to transform all aspects of our lives. While nothing is more powerful than real physical human connection, the digital virtual tech-driven world was the big story for media and entertainment in 2021.\n\nIn particular, 2021 marked the coming out party for the blockchain – a kind of transformational decentralized Web 3.0 world. In the world of media, the headline blockchain story took its form in so-called non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Will the blockchain’s adoption in media accelerate in 2022?\n\nMy Magic 8-Ball says “Signs point to ‘YES’.”\n\n►What's an NFT:A guide to what they are and why someone spent $69 million for one\n\nHere are 10 predictions for the coming year in which we hope that we finally get COVID under some kind of real long-term control.\n\n1. Blockchain blows up in 2022\n\nAfter early experimentation in 2021, 2022 will mark the year creators truly begin to embrace and leverage the power of the blockchain at scale. Just like iPhones ushered in a whole new mobile-first world of content 15 years ago, so-called Web 3.0 ushers in a whole new transformational world for originators of intellectual property, or IP, to directly reach and monetize their audiences. In the process, creators take back at least some of the power of mega tech platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Apple that built their trillion-dollar-plus valuations on their backs.\n\n2. NFTs a new venue for fans\n\nAnd 2022 will mark the year superfans will use their collective decentralized power to fuel creativity from their favorite artists via blockchain-related opportunities. Most in the entertainment world still focus on Beeple’s $69-million digital art NFT as being the blockchain’s poster child.\n\nBut instead they should be thinking of NFTs as new direct and directly monetizing channels of super-fandom – opening up membership into exclusive new clubs. If few in the world of media now know of CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club and DAOs in general (decentralized autonomous organizations), that changes in 2022. The blockchain, NFTs and DAOs are no momentary fads. They are long-term game-changers. Like it or not, the Los Angeles-based Staples Center’s new “Crypto.com Arena” moniker is here to stay. Hey, brands out there, you better claim your \".eth\" web address now. (Here's why.)\n\n►Decoding the lingo:10 cryptocurrency terms people use every day\n\n►Crypto tithes:With fewer young parishioners carrying cash, more churches accept bitcoin as offering\n\n3. Big action to come against Big Tech\n\nThe new mega-media platforms of Facebook (or Meta, actually), Google, Apple, and Amazon face a more immediate threat than the blockchain and related new decentralized social platforms in 2022, as big government finally takes big action against big tech in advance of 2022’s mid-term elections. Facebook and Zuckerberg are first to feel the pinch, as the Feds force Facebook to shed Instagram (and perhaps set some real rules to limit unbridled ad and AI-driven algorithmic devastation, both on young people and society itself). These “unlockings” of tech conglomerates will unlock more content innovation across more competing tech platforms.\n\n►The Facebook Papers:Facebook fed posts with violence and nudity to people with low digital literacy\n\n4. Apple leads the way to the metaverse\n\nFaced with these threats, Facebook tries to run and hide with its new Meta moniker (the quintessential “lipstick on a pig”), but real metaverse innovation comes from others, including Apple. Yes, Apple’s AR glasses ultimately will drive some of that innovation. But Apple already sports the ultimate wearable – AirPods (now a $20-billion business by itself). AirPods will become the first major gateway into the metaverse – outside of the games industry – much like Apple drove mass consumer adoption in the mobile world with the iPhone. Expect micro-cameras to be incorporated into higher-end, extremely expensive versions of AirPods that will enable visual experiences. I can see you lining up at your local Apple store already.\n\n►What is the metaverse anyway? Everyone wants to own the metaverse including Facebook and Microsoft\n\n5. Games + crossovers = metaverse magic\n\nSpeaking of games, that industry will continue to lead all other categories of entertainment content by an order of magnitude and increasingly show the way for artists and creators to emerge and build audiences. Before the tragedy of Astroworld, Travis Scott broke out into the metaverse in 2020 via \"Fortnite\" to the tune of 50 million viewers who drove a No. 1 hit. Ariana Grande shattered those numbers this past year, and the marriage of games and music grows stronger in 2022 as music licensing for games becomes a massive new revenue stream.\n\n►From Facebook to Fortnite:The metaverse is calling. Are we ready?\n\n6. Get paid to play\n\nMedia and tech business models will continue to fundamentally evolve, particularly in light of the havoc wreaked by ad-driven business models from the two major culprits of Facebook and Google. We’ve already seen the shift from single transactions to subscription-based recurring revenue bundles (Amazon Prime, Apple One, Disney+). That will accelerate in 2022. And move over “free to play” business models in the world of games. Now, thanks to the blockchain, welcome to an entirely new “play to earn” model that literally pays players to play (and gives them fractional ownership in the games they play). Why work when you can play? Other parts of the entertainment industry will continue to look to the world of games for inspiration and innovation, because that’s where it’s happening.\n\n7. In battle for screen dominance, Disney beats Netflix\n\nDisney+ will grow more rapidly than Netflix – and begin to close the gap in terms of global paid members – as the Mouse House begins to unlock significantly more dollars to produce originals. And don’t forget Disney’s “special sauce” that Netflix can’t touch – Disney’s priceless crown jewels of content – i.e., the Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, Avengers, and Disney Princess franchises. Just imagine the NFTs Disney can (and will) create with those timeless characters (which, in turn, will drive more Disney+ subscriptions/memberships). Meanwhile, Amazon and Apple will also quietly raise their own originals ante as they too accelerate their media ambitions – but for decidedly different ends. Amazon and Apple use content as marketing and to drive customer loyalty – to draw us in and create an ongoing customer relationship so we spend more time (and cash) in their walled gardens. And in the thirst for new content, expect more media production company acquisitions in 2022. The big buy in 2021 was Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine. Indie idol A24 will be the big prize for 2022.\n\n8. Musicians to harness the power of NFTs\n\nMusic will continue its double-digit growth – fueled by accelerating streaming via broader global broadband connectivity, entirely new royalty-paying platforms (Facebook, TikTok, Peloton), the growing ubiquity of smart speakers and, yes, transformational blockchain-fueled opportunities like NFTs. Perhaps most notably – and most notably absent in the minds of most executives still today – superfans will directly drive significantly more dollars into the pockets of their favorite artists. Billions have been left on the table in the past. Not any longer.\n\n►Making music and history:In her return, singer Shontelle deploys NFTs in song of empowerment\n\n9.You could help finance the next big Hollywood entertainment project\n\nExpect the retail market – that's you and me, the superfans – to directly finance and even buy fractional pieces of content from our favorite artists. In a world of content increasingly being “king,” private equity has pumped billions of dollars into the world of music acquisitions for the likes of Stevie Nicks and Bob Dylan. But that kind of content ownership will not be just for the “big boys” in 2022. NFTs will help fuel the way. And superfan-fueled crowd-funding and IP ownership aren’t just for the world of music. The retail market will open up an entirely new world of financing for producers of film and television. Hey, Hollywood, check out “The Chosen.” If you don’t know about it, you should.\n\n10. Live entertainment is back, but forever changed\n\nMusic festivals and other mega-live entertainment experiences will continue to open up in 2022 due to pent up demand for real, physical interaction and lasting shared experiences in our increasingly heads-down digital, virtual world. But these large-scale live events are forever changed as a result of the twin tragedies of COVID and Astroworld. Crowd control, mitigation and broader safety and security efforts and focus will transform overall planning and execution – not to mention the overall “festival experience” for those who attend.\n\nThere you have it – 10 predictions for our increasingly tech-driven world of media and entertainment in 2022.\n\nPeter Csathy is the chairman of CREATV Media & Deep Cuts Media, a media, entertainment & tech-focused business development, M&A and advisory firm.

The cost varies depending on whether a student is a Canadian citizen, permanent resident or foreign student and the particular school. For Canadian citizens or permanent residents, tuition for the first year of medical school ranges from $2567 ($3,334 Canadian) to $20,064 ($26,056 Canadian), according to The Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada's website.\n\nThe same group, the Médecins Québécois pour le Régime Public (MQRP), that published the aforementioned public letter, also published a letter on February 17 opposing $500 million worth of pay increases for specialist doctors.

Steadiness\n\nWith your iPhone in your pocket, the Health app uses custom algorithms to assess your balance, strength, and gait. You can set up a notification if your level of steadiness drops. That’s important because that could mean you’re more at risk of falling.\n\nHere’s how to set up Steadiness Notifications:\n\n• Open the Health app and tap your profile at the top right. If you don’t see your picture or initials, tap Summary or Browse at the bottom, then scroll back to the top.\n\n• Tap Health Checklist.\n\n• Tap Set Up for Walking Steadiness Notifications and follow the onscreen instructions.\n\nIs carrying your phone in your pocket (guys) or your bra (ladies) safe? Here’s my answer.\n\n2. Heart rate variability\n\nHeart rate variability, or HRV, measures time intervals between heartbeats when you’re at rest. Your Apple Watch checks for irregular rhythms, sends you a notification and records the data in the Health app.\n\nIrregular rhythms could indicate atrial fibrillation (Afib), where the heart’s upper chambers beat out of sync with the lower chambers. Seriously dangerous stuff.\n\nHere’s how to check up on your HRV data:\n\n• Open the Health app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap Browse in the bottom right corner.\n\n• Tap Heart > Heart Rate Variability.\n\n• At the top, choose to view your data by day, week, month, half-year, and year.\n\nHere’s how to enable irregular rhythm notifications:\n\n• Open the Health app.\n\n• Tap Browse in the bottom right corner.\n\n• Tap Heart > Irregular Rhythm Notifications.\n\n• Once enabled, turn irregular rhythm notifications on or off in the Apple Watch app on your iPhone:\n\n• Open the Apple Watch app, tap the My Watch tab, then go to Heart > Irregular Rhythm.\n\nA nursing student said an Apple Watch notification helped detect a rare abnormality.

Respiratory rate\n\nYour respiratory rate refers to the number of times you breathe in a minute. This goes up as you exercise and down as you sleep. When you wear your Apple Watch to bed, it automatically measures and records your respiratory rate.\n\nWhen your respiratory rate is significantly higher or lower than usual while you sleep, it could indicate illness or a health condition.\n\nTo track your respiratory rate, you’ll need to set up the sleep features on your iPhone:\n\n• Open the Health app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap Get Started under Set Up Sleep and tap Next.\n\n• Follow the onscreen prompts.\n\n• Turn on Track Sleep with Apple Watch. This option is available during setup if you’ve paired your Apple Watch with your iPhone beforehand.

Families who had left damaged homes lie on a few dozen cots spread across the Sportsplex’s indoor tennis courts.\n\nHill and Wilkins, who live in Germantown, said the home was not damaged but they came to the shelter because they lost electricity. They initially took shelter at the Nashville Farmers’ Market, but then the market also lost power, so they moved to the Sportsplex. On Tuesday morning, their spirits were lifted by a visit from the governor.\n\n“It means a lot to me, at least,” Wilkins said. “You have people who say they are already here to help, but for the governor to actually show up for people who are displaced, it means a lot.\"\n\nHill and Wilkins said they were first notified of the storm by an alert on their phone in Monday night, but soon the weather outside became impossible to ignore. Strong winds were uprooting trees and streets signs and audibly snapping power lines. Tents from a nearby homeless encampment could be seen blowing down the street. Down the street, some entire buildings were leveled, they said.\n\n“If it would’ve touched down just a couple feet further, that would have been us,” Wilkins said.\n\n11:40 a.m. Man moving to Nashville left 'homeless'\n\nLarry Taylor moved to Nashville to live with his relatives on Monday. By Tuesday, he was “homeless.”\n\nTaylor, 58, said he and his wife drove into Middle Tennessee on Monday night on as tornadoes ripped through the state. As the hail fell and the wind roared, their car became trapped in traffic about 50 miles outside of the city.\n\n“The tornado came down the highway, so we saw poles falling and trucks turned over,” Taylor said, “but we couldn’t do anything about it because we had to use the light from the truck in front of us to keep going.\n\nEventually, Taylor and his wife pulled into n the parking lot of a shuttered gas station, then rode out the storm hunkered down in their car. When they finally arrived in Nashville on Tuesday morning, Taylor discovered his sister-in-law’s house – where he planned to live – was damaged to the point of being unlivable.\n\nAs of midday on Monday, Taylor was taking shelter at the Centennial Sportsplex on West Nashville.\n\n“I’m not real comfortable,” Taylor said, “but I’m thanking God for my life.”\n\n10:57 a.m. Governor visits storm-devastated Germantown neighborhood.\n\nAfter visiting the shelter set up at Centennial Sportsplex, Gov. Bill Lee and some Cabinet members walked the streets of Nashville’s Germantown neighborhood to assess damage.\n\nLee walked into a historic home on 7th Ave North, where the roof and entire front wall had been blown off.\n\n“That’s intense,” Lee said as he walked back down the stairs.\n\nIt was the first time he had ever seen such devastating tornado damage “up close,” he said.\n\nLee was then leaving to catch a helicopter to Putnam County.\n\n“Our heart is broken for many families whose lives were changed in an instant,” Lee said in an interview surveying the Germantown damage. “It’s tragic. it’s heartbreaking.”\n\n“We also know there’s great hope in the midst of suffering and difficulty and that’s what we hope we can help provide.\n\n“There are days ahead for Tennessee, post-this tragedy, that will show just who we are as a people.”\n\nEarly that morning Lee had visited both state and local emergency operation centers in Nashville and had been on the phone with the White House and members of Tennessee’s federal delegation in an effort to expedite aid.\n\nLee did not yet have an estimate on how how much federal aid the state would receive or how soon it would be available.\n\n“We know that because of the extent of this disaster there will be aid available,” Lee said.\n\n“What’s encouraging is the coordinated effort,” Lee said. “What’s tragic is what we see right here and what we believe we’ll see more of as the day unfolds.”\n\nThe state has deployed resources to rural areas hard, including sending generators and state troopers. The state is in communication with hospitals in those areas.\n\n“This is the sort of thing where initially government steps in, but the real work will get done by the people of Tennessee as they engage to help one another.”\n\nLee described Tuesday as “a day of assessment.”\n\n“We’ve really just begun to realize the extent of physical damage. We know that there may be even more fatalities as the day unfolds. There are missing persons, there’s search and rescue teams right now underway.”\n\nAs he looked at a crumbled, more than century-old building on the corner of Jefferson Street and 7th Avenue North, Lee talked to a small group of people who knew the owner.\n\nThe black-owned business was home to Music City Cleaners, a dry cleaning service, as well as The Lab, a new coworking space. The building was also used as an event venue.\n\n“It’s a historic structure that’s gone, but what we really see is lives that have been impacted in a negative way. There’s people behind that building. There’s people’s livelihood. There’s businesses. There’s startups.”\n\n10:52 a.m. President Trump says he'll visit Tennessee\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he will visit the Nashville area after a deadly storm struck Middle Tennessee on Tuesday.\n\nTrump said he is scheduled to visit Middle Tennessee on Friday.\n\nDetails about the president's visit were not immediately available.\n\n\"We're working with the leaders in Tennessee, including their great Governor Bill Lee, to ensure everything is done properly,\" Trump said while speaking at the National Association of Counties on Tuesday.\n\n\"Our hearts are full of sorrow for the lives that were lost.\"\n\n10:40 a.m. North Nashville residents recount storm terror\n\nAs major portions of Rosa Parks Boulevard and Jefferson Street remained closed around Germantown Tuesday morning, long lines of traffic cams to a standstill on small side streets.\n\nSome residents took it upon themselves to try to direct traffic in the area around 10th Avenue North, where downed trees and power lines blocked streets with no warning to drivers.\n\nDrinking a Smirnoff Ice around 8 a.m. Tuesday, Domonique Hodge recalled hearing the roof come off his 14th Ave. North duplex earlier that morning.\n\n“That’s the roof right there, Hodge said, pointing to a massive pile of shingles and roofing material in the front yard.\n\nHe got in the closet, caught off guard by what was going on outside around him.\n\nAnother woman who lives in the house sat in a folding chair by the side of the road holding a baby wrapped in a blanket.\n\n“What’s there to say?” the woman responded, appearing numb, when approached by a reporter.\n\n10:40 a.m. Significant damage at Robert Churchwell elementary\n\nRobert Churchwell Museum Magnet Elementary School has sustained significant damage from the tornado that touched down in North Nashville on Tuesday morning, according to Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools spokesperson Sean Braisted.\n\nThe district is looking at relocation options for the school, which most likely will be Park Elementary, Braisted said.\n\nThe district is also assessing the damage at Meigs Academic Magnet School, and Lockeland Design Center Elementary School, both located in East Nashville. If class relocation is required, the district will later announce it to families.\n\nMNPS district representatives are consulting with emergency management officials to determine when school will be in session and the district schedule for the remainder of the week. Some schools are still experiencing power outages.\n\n10:30 a.m. Displaced families arrive Centennial Sportsplex storm shelter\n\nAbout 50 people displaced by the storms are now at the Centennial Sportsplex, which was opened as a Red Cross storm shelter.

His neighbors weren’t so lucky.\n\n“We woke up to the sound of a freight train,” Inmon said.\n\nReggie Ingle and Tsan Lozano, who also live on Knowles Street, were trapped on the second floor of their home with their adult son for about seven hours after a large tree fell onto their back porch, and blocked the only entrance into their home.\n\nShortly after daybreak a neighbor emerged with a ladder and helped the family down to safety.\n\n“It’s so good to be on the ground,” Ingle said after his family made it to safety. “We are so thankful to be alive.”\n\nBehind him, a portion of the huge tree rested inside his home.\n\n9:12 a.m. Shattered glass, buildings in East Nashville\n\nNear the corner of 11th and Holly Streets in east Nashville, yellow insulation covered the streets like fall leaves. Outside Fanny’s House of Music saws buzzed as workers boarded up the blown-out windows of the light blue building.\n\nDown the block at Five Points, a wooden telephone pole latched onto the traffic lights and snapped in two the rusted metal of electric wiring dangling into the middle of the road.\n\nAt the intersection of 10th Street and Woodland Avenue, a metal roof from a nearby business dangled across the telephone wires, scraping the ground below every time the wind blew.\n\nOn the corner, the front windows of the popular Burger Up restaurant were shattered, glass strewn across the street. Inside, remarkably, many of the liquor bottles on the shelves behind the bar inside remained in tact.\n\n8:40 a.m. Bridgestone Arena to offer lunch to those impacted\n\n8:15 a.m. Mayor, Governor give updates at live press conference:\n\nGov.

Four different counties, as of this morning, had confirmed fatalities.”\n\nLee said he was in touch with the White House this morning \"to ask for assistance.\"\n\nMayor John Cooper said the tornado, which “devastated our community,” was a reminder of how “fragile life is.”\n\nCooper said this morning he had visited with storm survivors at the Nashville farms market.\n\nCooper said firefighters and first responders were examining damaged and collapsed buildings to “ensure all residents are accounted for.” He said “many” Nashvillians remained out of power, and urged residents to avoid downed power lines.\n\n“Frankly, if you can refrain from driving on our roads today, you will help metros cleanup and recovery efforts go further and faster.”\n\nAfter the press conference, Lee planned to visit with people currently at a city shelter set up at Centennial Sportsplex, according to spokesman Gillum Ferguson.\n\n7:57 a.m. Family credits dog with keeping them alert to storm\n\nPreston Bailey’s dog, Theo, arguably saved his family’s life.\n\nThe pup — who hates storms — kept his dad up in Standford Estates until he got an alert on his phone about the tornado.\n\nBailey woke up his soon to be wife Chelsea Ardisson. The couple went into the downstairs laundry room to huddled together with their hedgehog and dogs, but they forgot one pet: their fish.\n\nAfter the storm went by their house, they discovered their first floor was annihilated.

Today's all about planning. Board members have been helpful. We are resilient.\"\n\nDonelson resident Phoebe Collum stood on the pavement outside the school with tears running down her face. The 2015 graduate lives up the street, her house mostly untouched.\n\n\"I have no words,\" she said. \"I got the warning in less than 10 minutes. We huddled and we prayed. Then it was gone.

Nearby in the norther and eastern parts of the Dominican Republic, 4-8 inches of rainfall is expected, with a local maximum of 12 inches possible along the northeast coast.\n\n“These rains will produce life-threatening and catastrophic flash and urban flooding across Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican Republic, along with mudslides and landslides in areas of higher terrain,” the hurricane center said.\n\nA flash flood emergency was issued for Sector San Felipe and Mosquito in Salinas County Sunday night as heavy rainfall pounded the region, where 10-15 inches of rain have already fallen, and another 2-4 inches are possible, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe heavy rainfall in Salinas County has already led to multiple swift water rescues, and the Weather Service is urging people to “move to higher ground now. Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order.”\n\nAll of Puerto Rico lost power earlier Sunday, according to PowerOutage.us, as the Category 1 storm approached the islands.\n\nMany rivers on the eastern side of the territory are in moderate to major flood stage. One river in the southeast has risen over 12 feet in less than seven hours and is now over 25 feet, breaking the previous record of 24.79 feet set in 2017 during Hurricane Maria.\n\nHurricane Fiona is the third of the 2022 Atlantic Hurricane Season and forecast to become a major hurricane – a storm of Category 3 or higher – in about 48 hours, east of the Bahamas.\n\nTropical storm conditions are expected to reach portions of the Dominican Republic within the next few hours and then in the Turks and Caicos Islands and portions of the southeastern Bahamas by early Tuesday.\n\nThe government of the Bahamas issued a tropical storm warning for the Turks and Caicos and for the Southeastern Bahamas, including the Acklins, Crooked Island, Long Cay, the Inaguas, Mayaguana and the Ragged Islands.\n\nThe storm’s impacts have already been felt: At least one death has been reported in Basse-Terre in the French territory of Guadeloupe, according to the vice president of the territory’s environmental agency, who said the capital had been devastated by flooding.\n\nPuerto Rico without power as hurricane lashes the islands\n\nPuerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi confirmed the territory-wide outage in a tweet, noting the entire electric system was out of service and officials have activated the proper protocols to work to restore power.\n\nThe Authority of Electric Energy and LUMA Energy, which operates Puerto Rico’s power grid, continue to work on the islandwide power outage affecting nearly 1.5 million customers, according to Pierluisi.\n\nThe blackout – which followed hours of progressively worsening power outages – comes five years after Puerto Rico’s power grid was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September 2017, leaving many residents without electricity for months.\n\nBut officials have stressed it won’t be like last time: Not long before the lights went out, Abner Gomez, head of public safety and crisis management at LUMA Energy, said utility authorities plan to repair and restore electricity with the help of local government agencies. “This is not Maria, this hurricane will not be Maria,” Gomez said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday morning approved an emergency declaration for Puerto Rico, freeing up federal resources, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for emergency response and disaster relief efforts.\n\nThere are more than 300 FEMA responders on the ground working “hand and glove” with the Commonwealth and their emergency management structure, Anne Bink, FEMA’s Assistant Administrator for Response and Recovery, told CNN Sunday.\n\n“Our heart goes out to the residents that are again going through another catastrophic event five years later,” Bink said, noting Fiona has hit close to Hurricane Maria’s five-year anniversary.\n\nBink said FEMA’s response is dual focused, including emergency generation and power missions for critical facilities and ensuring command and control structure is in place for things like search and rescue, emergency power generations and long-term needs once the island moves into recovery.\n\nEvacuees are seen in a classroom of a public school being used as a shelter as Hurricane Fiona and its heavy rains approach in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, on Sunday.

Andy Beshear said Thursday.\n\n“Let us pray for those families and all of eastern Kentucky as we continue to try to stabilize the region and ultimately turn toward rebuilding,” Beshear said during a news conference.\n\nParts of the state were nearly leveled in late July when historic flooding washed away homes, submerged vehicles in deep floodwaters and destroyed many businesses and critical infrastructure for water and electricity. Thousands of residents were displaced in the aftermath, and efforts to receive aid from the federal government remain underway.\n\nAt the time, officials reiterated that reaching a final death count would be challenging due to the extent of the devastation the heavy rain unleashed in the region and the difficulties in accounting for those who were missing.\n\n“This is a type of flood that even an area that sees flooding has never seen in our lifetime,” Beshear told CNN during the floods.\n\nOne person from Breathitt County remains missing, the governor said Thursday.

Sometimes who they are is as impressive as what they do, sometimes not.\n\nFor J.J. Watt, however, there’s no more apt description this week.\n\nIn less than four days, the three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year has raised more than $12 million and counting for hurricane-ravaged Houston. It’s not just the money, though. He’s dug in on every detail of what’s being done with it, from where to get trucks to what supplies to buy to where distribution centers will be, to ensure that all of this money benefits the people who need it.\n\nMore:J.J. Watt's Hurricane Harvey fundraising efforts surpass $10 million\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nMore:Watt gets wish: Cowboys-Texans game funds going to recovery\n\n“I’m not going to be perfect at this, I can promise you, because it’s happening on the fly and I’ve never done anything like this,” Watt said Wednesday. “But I’m doing everything I can and we’re going to make it as good as we possibly can.”\n\nPlenty of athletes and celebrities lend their names and star power to causes, and they’re to be commended. When disasters like Hurricane Harvey hit, anything – everything – helps.\n\nUniversity of Houston basketball coach Kelvin Sampson started a clothing drive. Masters champion Sergio Garcia has pledged $2,000 for every birdie and $5,000 for every eagle he makes during the FedEx Cup. Nationals pitcher Max Scherzer is covering adoptions fees through Sunday at Washington D.C.’s Humane Rescue Alliance Centers, which need to make room for animals that will be arriving from Texas. And on it goes.\n\nBut Watt has taken it a step further.\n\nAs one of the NFL’s most popular players – his jersey was among the top-10 sellers in 2015, the last time he played a full regular season – his call for donations alone would have been enough to attract a pile of cash. More than 113,000 people have given so far, donating everything from $5 and $10 up to the six- and seven-figure contributions by Drake, Walmart and Tennessee Titans owner Amy Adams Strunk.\n\nWatt kicked off the campaign with a $100,000 donation of his own, half of his original goal.\n\nOnce the money started coming in, Watt could have delegated the details to someone else. He does have a season to prepare for, after all. The Texans have people. Heck, Watt’s a big enough star that he’s got people.\n\nBut he didn’t want this to be a money grab. There have been too many instances of charitable organizations not exactly being charitable, and the needs in Houston are too great. (It’s worth noting that instead of a big national charity with the big operating costs to match, Watt staged the fundraiser on Youcaring.com, a fee-free crowdfunding site.)\n\nSo in between practices and meetings this week, Watt has been working the phone.\n\nSemi-trailers are heading to Houston from Watt’s hometown of Pewaukee, Wis., and Utah, Watt told the Wall Street Journal. (The storm made it tough to find trucks closer to Houston.) They’re carrying water, food, clothing, cleaning supplies, generators – whatever Watt could think of that storm victims might need.\n\n“That’s phase one. That’s going to be the first phase of our operation to get as immediate of an impact as we can,” Watt said in an Instagram video Thursday morning after the fundraising drive had surpassed $10 million.\n\n“But if there’s something I’m not thinking of, please leave it in the comments because we want to make sure we get these people exactly what they need so we can help rebuild as quickly as we can.”\n\nThe first loads of supplies will be distributed Sunday by Watt and his Texans teammates. He’ll figure out what to do next after that.\n\n“This is not a one week-process,” he said. “This is going to be a very, very long process and Houston, I just want you to know that we’re going to be with you every step of the way.”\n\nThe campaign makes Watt a shoo-in for the NFL’s Walter Payton Man of the Year award before the season’s even begun. But he’s quick to brush off praise.\n\n“It’s not me. I’m just the one organizing it,” he said, crediting firefighters and police officers as well as the thousands of others who’ve pitched in to lend a hand to Houston.\n\n“There are so many people out there that want to help, we just needed somebody to organize it. I’m just very glad that I could use my platform to help.”\n\nWhatever Watt does for the Texans this season, it won't be nearly as important as what he's done for Houston.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/09/17/little-haiti-corn-pop-capote-lee-news-around-states/40161297/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMonroeville: A new play about the relationship between Alabama authors Truman Capote and Harper Lee will have its debut performances in their hometown. “Truman Talks Nelle Harper Lee” is set to premiere at the old Monroe County courthouse Sept. 27. It runs through Sept. 29. The play was written and is performed by Broadway actor Joel Vig, who was in the original Broadway production of “Hairspray.” Capote and Lee grew up together in Monroeville and remained friends throughout much of their lives as writers. The play is about a fictional surprise birthday party for Lee. Performing as Capote, Vig tells stories about Lee and his relationship with her. Lee helped Capote research his best-known work, “In Cold Blood,” and authored the landmark novel “To Kill a Mockingbird.”\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: All but two of the University of Alaska Fairbanks Experiment Farm reindeer herd have moved amid budget cuts and program changes. Thirty-five of the reindeer were moved to a bison farm near Delta Junction two weeks ago, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports. The farm, owned by the Stevens Village Native Council, has been working with the reindeer program for a number of years. Milan Shipka, director of the UAF Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station, says the move will help the farm develop a larger herd for meat production. “This was an opportunity to help an Alaska Native entity develop a red meat industry,” Shipka says. The remaining reindeer, Roger and Olivia, have been moved to the Large Animal Research Station near the UAF campus. The pair will be used for outreach.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Emergency dispatchers who handle 911 calls are about to have a place to decompress. The Phoenix Police Department on Tuesday will dedicate a new “quiet room” for 911 operators. Police Chief Jeri Williams and Mayor Kate Gallego will be on hand for the ceremony. A local Rotary Club came up with the idea as a way to show appreciation to police communications operators. Officials say the job of emergency dispatcher can sometimes take an emotional toll. The quiet room will allow the workers a place to rest or take a few moments for themselves.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: Patrol Packs – bags of easy-to-prepare grocery items meant to be given out to those facing food insecurity – are now part of the arsenal of the Baxter County Sheriff’s Department. Cathy Foraker, director of external affairs for AT&T Arkansas, recently delivered the first 25 Patrol Packs to the sheriff’s office. The packages are assembled and donated by AT&T through its “Believe Arkansas” program to combat hunger. The Sheriff’s Office has the Patrol Packs installed in its patrol vehicles, Sheriff John Montgomery says. “We run into people on a regular basis (that are food insecure),” he says. “We’re excited to try this, and I think it can make a difference.” The Patrol Packs contain items like peanut butter, easy-to-make skillet dinners, macaroni and cheese, pouches of tuna and easy-to-open canned goods.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Sacramento State University has accidentally accepted 3,500 waitlisted students for fall admission. The Sacramento Bee reports the students were mistakenly invited to Admitted Students Day after an email was sent in March welcoming them to the event. Officials say the school never rescinded the invitation, which implied the students were accepted. University officials say the error resulted in an additional 500 students who began classes this semester. Officials say there was space to admit them because the school initially admitted a conservative number of students, and it noted a record number of graduates last year. Officials say they don’t believe the additional students will have an effect on students’ ability to take classes in their department. University officials estimate a 1% enrollment increase.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The number of children and teens killed by gun violence in the Mile-High City is rising, and so is the number of youth charged with gun-related crimes. The Denver Post reports 15 teens and children have been shot and killed in the city since January 2018, more than in the previous three years combined. Prosecutors say 107 teens were charged with gun possession in 2018, compared with 50 in 2015. They say this year is on pace to equal or surpass last year. Law enforcement officers, community members and health officials point to a variety of possible reasons for the increase in gun violence against young people. They include changing gang structures, easy access to firearms, violent video games, socioeconomic inequality, hopelessness and an online culture that glorifies gun possession.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont is recommending the state join a growing number of counterparts in eliminating the religious exemption to childhood vaccinations. The Democrat and state Health Commissioner Renee Coleman-Mitchell on Monday proposed the General Assembly do away with the exemption by the start of the 2021-22 school year. The decision follows the recent release of state Health Department statistics showing the percentage of Connecticut kindergarteners who were vaccinated against measles and mumps dropped from 96.5% in the 2017-18 school year to 95.9% in the 2018-19 school year. Lamont and Coleman-Mitchell were joined by leaders of the Legislature’s Democratic majority, who called the repeal a public-safety issue during the nation’s worst measles outbreak in decades. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1905 that states have the right to enforce compulsory vaccination laws.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Yes, Corn Pop is a real person. Over the weekend, a clip of presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden recalling his time as a local lifeguard in the 1960s went viral. He was speaking in Wilmington in 2017, when the pool where he worked as a college student was being named after him. At the time, he was the only white lifeguard at the pool. The clip made many people wonder on Twitter who Corn Pop is and if the incident actually occurred. In short, William L. Williams was very much a real person. He died in 2016, and his nickname, “Corn Pop,” was included in his short obituary in the Delaware News Journal. Williams was associated with the Romans, a Wilmington gang prominent in the 1960s. Former Mayor Dennis Williams confirmed to CNN that Corn Pop was as “real as the moon in the sky.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The next acting chief of the U.S. Park Police is accused of using his role to improperly have criminal charges dropped against defendants, including some accused of assaulting officers. News outlets report a complaint filed Friday by the Fraternal Order of Police details the allegations. Gregory T. Monahan is set to take on the role this week. He previously worked for the department’s San Francisco office while based in D.C. The complaint says Monahan twice intervened to have charged dropped against San Francisco employees of Presidio Trust, a federal agency that helps fund San Francisco’s park police through partnerships with other organizations. Its chief executive, Jean S. Fraser, is accused of asking Monahan to drop the charges.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A billion-dollar development project set to be built in a cultural neighborhood has divided residents. Magic City Innovation District is taking up 17 acres of land in historic Little Haiti, which once had the most Haitians outside of Haiti. The project has inspired hope and fear amongst residents. Leonie Hermantin, a Little Haiti community leader, says she is cautiously optimistic. She hopes the project will bring economic benefits to an impoverished neighborhood but is wary of longtime residents being displaced due to rising house costs. Hermantin says her support for the project has lost her many friends, but allying with what she calls an unstoppable process is better to ensure residents can be protected and for the neighborhood to thrive.\n\nGeorgia\n\nLithonia: Rapper Kanye West brought his collection of choir singers and musicians to an Atlanta-area megachurch for his religious popup performance called “Sunday Service.” News outlets report West visited New Birth Missionary Baptist Church on Sunday, drawing a large group of parishioners and celebrities including rappers T.I. and 2 Chainz. The rapper’s wife, Kim Kardashian West, said on the ABC daytime show “The View” that West’s “Sunday Service” is a musical ministry and Christian service that discusses Jesus and God. The church’s Instagram stories show West performing “Father Stretch my Hands” and a gospel set to the tune of Ginuwine’s “So Anxious.” West’s pop-up group has made various appearances on Sundays since January, including a stop in Dayton, Ohio, at a benefit event supporting the community affected by the mass shooting.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: State and federal agencies have approved an energy company’s request to increase incidental bat deaths at its Maui wind farm. The Maui News reports the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the state Department of Land and Natural Resources have allowed Auwahi Wind Energy to increase the number of hoary bat deaths by 2037 to 140, up from the 21 bats in its original application. Officials say Auwahi applied for a federal permit, which was prepared and signed Sept. 3, but decisions must be published in the Federal Register to be made final. Experts say there is not enough information to determine the impact wind farms have on bat populations. Environmental groups say companies can change operations to have little to no effect on bats.\n\nIdaho\n\nNampa: A dog once deemed “unadoptable” has found a new purpose as a police K-9 working in local schools. During the week, Huck, a rescued red heeler mix, wanders around East Valley Middle School alongside his handler, Officer Serena Tlucek, the Idaho Press reports. He hangs out with students during lunch and enjoys lots of pats in the halls as students pass by. There’s a particular hallway he usually bolts down because a teacher always has a treat waiting for him. And when necessary, he will visit other Nampa schools and sniff for drugs that may be in cars, classrooms or lockers. Before getting certified as a police K-9, Huck spent most of his life in a shelter. Now he has his own Instagram account, which allows people to see what his life’s like.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A central Illinois congressman says a site linked to the city’s 1908 race riot has been deemed suitable for designation as a national historic monument. U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis had asked the National Park Service last year to conduct a survey of the block-long site. He says a review by the U.S. Department of the Interior found the site suitable for a historic monument designation. The (Springfield) State Journal-Register reports that construction work in the area has uncovered the remains of seven homes, five of which were burned during the race riot. Sixteen people died during three days of rioting in August 1908 when a white mob attacked black citizens in Abraham Lincoln’s hometown. The city and the NAACP hope to build a memorial at the site.\n\nIndiana\n\nRussiaville: A middle school’s planned “Slave Ship” history exercise has been canceled following an outcry by parents upset that the lesson called for students to portray bound, enslaved Africans aboard a vessel returning to the Americas. The proposed role-playing exercise at Western Middle School would have had students reenacting the Middle Passage, in which millions of Africans were kidnapped, shipped across the Atlantic in dire conditions and sold into slavery. The school’s eighth-grade social studies teacher, Kevin Pax, sent a letter to parents detailing the class. But his letter triggered an uproar, with worried parents reaching out to the school and posting their concerns on social media. WISH-TV reports Pax sent a follow-up email last week canceling the role-playing portion of the lesson.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: More than $8.5 million was wagered at 13 participating casinos in the state’s first month of sports betting. Ames station WOI reports that figures released by the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission show the state reaped nearly $146,000 in tax revenue from the wagers on sports events. The report shows Prairie Meadows in Altoona topped Ameristar II in Council Bluffs, with more than $3.4 million in sports handle – or money placed on bets – and nearly $2.9 million paid out to bettors. On Aug. 15, Iowa became the 11th in the nation and first in the Midwest to allow such wagering. Iowa’s law allows betting on-site or through a mobile app but requires mobile betting to be done within the state’s borders. Betting software includes precision geofencing technology that nullifies bets made outside Iowa.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Officials are trumpeting the state’s growing economy while also worrying about how to find enough employees to fill new jobs, especially in high-demand careers like health care. The state’s recent monthly economic report showed Kansas created 14,000 jobs in the past year, and unemployment is 3.3%. The Kansas News Service reports the state’s total labor force dropped from a high of 1.521 million in 2009 to 1.479 million in July. Kansas Labor Secretary Delia García says the state is in good shape economically, but leaders need to think ahead to attract more workers. She hopes state officials will work more closely with education and business groups to train workers. And she wants lawmakers and other officials to support economic development programs that would attract workers to Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A $1 million donation by the disgraced founder of Papa John’s to a historically black college has prompted the school to give up $20,000 in scholarships from the pizza company. Only hours after John Schnatter announced his donation to Simmons College, the school’s development director declined the company’s pledge to help 10 students with $2,000 each toward tuition. A Simmons spokeswoman said the school meant only to delay the scholarships and was acting under pressure from Papa John’s diversity director. The school spokeswoman says the company was made uncomfortable by Schnatter’s donation. A Papa John’s spokeswoman denies that and says the school’s rejection was unexpected. Schnatter lost control of Papa John’s amid backlash for using the N-word while blaming poor sales on NFL player protests.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State officials are looking for suggestions on what to include in the new Louisiana Civil Rights Trail. The Louisiana Office of Tourism says submissions can include sites, “events, persons, activities, stories, or experiences that had a significant impact on the Civil Rights Movement in Louisiana.” In recent months officials have held 15 meetings across the state to discuss the project. Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser says the Louisiana Civil Rights Trail will recognize the “stories, people and locations” that played a crucial role in the history of the state and the country. The deadline to submit suggestions online is Dec. 6.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: High numbers of a species of jellyfish that can grow to huge sizes have been sighted in recent months in the Gulf of Maine and some of its beaches. The lion’s mane jellyfish, believed to be the world’s largest, can grow to 5 or more feet across, with tentacles more than 100 feet long. Such huge jelliyfish are uncommon, but larger-than-average ones have been more common this year, according to beachgoers. Nick Record, a senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, says he typically gets 300 to 700 reports of jellyfish per summer. This year’s total number of jellyfish is likely to be about average. But usually, fewer than half are lion’s manes, and this year, it’s almost all of them. Scientists are puzzling over why.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Authorities are searching for a former actor from the Baltimore-based television show “The Wire” who they say escaped custody after being taken to a hospital. Baltimore police say Christopher Clanton Sr. was arrested Sept. 12 for violating a protective order and was taken to a hospital for a check-up ahead of being booked into jail. Police say he escaped Friday. Court records show he has three other pending criminal cases. News outlets report that Clanton posted on Facebook that he “basically walked out of the front door.” Clanton played Savino Bratton in two seasons of “The Wire,” an acclaimed HBO drama about the city.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The leaders of the four Roman Catholic dioceses in the state are calling on the faithful to address climate change. In a pastoral letter released Monday, the bishops wrote that “we must act now within our faith institutions and throughout the state to take substantial, meaningful steps to protect our environmental and provide relief from the impact of toxic pollution and climate change” to protect public health and safety. The letter was signed by Boston Archbishop Cardinal Sean O’Malley, Springfield Bishop Mitchell Rozanski, Worcester Bishop Robert McManus and Fall River Bishop Edgar da Cunha. The leaders in their letter cited several recent scientific studies that “detail the urgency of this crisis,” including climate change’s effects on weather and global food supplies. The bishops asked everyone to “take better care of our common home.”\n\nMichigan\n\nManistee: A 400-ton pavilion built in the 1940s could fall 100 feet from a bluff into Lake Michigan if nothing is done to fight erosion from rising waters at a state park. Orchard Beach State Park supervisor Doug Barry says the limestone pavilion sits about 50 feet back from the edge of a bluff that’s eroding at an average annual rate of 6 inches. Barry says while the structure isn’t in imminent peril, the Department of Natural Resources is working to ensure it doesn’t fall off the edge. MLive.com reports that the work to save it could begin in fall 2020. Barry noted that engineering firm GEI Consultants has been commissioned to survey the erosion and find ways to salvage the historic building and restore a beach.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A deleted video from a forum that turned tense over race demonstrates some of the risks in Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz’s push for criminal justice reform. Walz and administration staffers wanted to promote an upcoming PBS documentary about a rigorous college program for inmates because they want to replicate the concept in the state. But Minnesota Public Radio reports a forum at Twin Cities Public Television one day last May, which included screenings of clips from the documentary, turned tense when the moderator pressed participants about race. A top aide to Gov. Tim Walz then sought to make sure a video of the forum didn’t circulate. TPT officials defended deleting the video, saying it was never intended for broadcast, but the Walz administration ultimately expressed regret for overreacting.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: A convenience store in the Delta is telling workers at a neighboring soybean oil mill that many of them stink and should stay out. The Greenwood Commonwealth reports the store has a sign on its door stating, “Notice: Bad Smelling Oil Mill People Please Do Not Enter.” Anurag Randive, who manages the Greenwood store, says the sign was posted about three months ago after customers complained about the odor of employees from the Express Grain oil mill across the street. He says he’s prevented some odorous workers from entering. Randive says he hasn’t received any complaints. Express Grain workers continue shopping at the store. Employee Michael Blount says workers who labor in the pits filled with stinking rotten soybeans send less-smelly coworkers inside to buy snacks. “We know we stink,” Blount says.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Legal Aid of Western Missouri says there has been a drastic drop in the percentage of cases it wins to secure Medicaid disability benefits for the aged, blind or disabled in the state. The organization succeeded in 54% of its cases in 2017 seeking the reversal of denial or reevaluation of benefits by the Missouri Department of Social Services. It won 42% of such cases in 2018 and less than 20% in the first four months of this year. Jim Brightman, a Legal Aid attorney, tells The Kansas City Star that DSS blamed staff shortages during a July meeting. Brightman blames a high turnover in middle management at the agency and misapplication of laws. DSS didn’t respond to a request for comment or explanation.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A Native American storyteller from the state is expected to be honored as a National Heritage Fellow by the National Endowment for the Arts. The Billings Gazette reports traditional Crow storyteller Grant Bulltail is one of 10 people chosen by the NEA to receive a 2019 fellowship. Bulltail is expected to be honored Wednesday in Washington, D.C., with the presentation of the fellowship, which includes a $25,000 award. Bulltail says the award money will be put toward hiring an editor to work with him on a novel presenting a story of the Crow people. He has previously shared his stories at state and national parks and places of significance to the Crow people.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state has approved $3 million in grants to help communities recover from flooding in the spring and rebuild housing. Six Nebraska communities will each receive $500,000 to help with projects related to housing: Nebraska City, Fremont, Peru, Lynch, Wood River and Pierce County. The money will help pay to demolish some houses in the flood plain, rebuild or rehabilitate some homes, and help some families with down payments on new homes. The Nebraska Department of Economic Development used money from an affordable housing program to pay for the grants to help communities recover after the severe spring flooding.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A change in state law to ban gun ownership by people convicted of domestic violence led the state Supreme Court to expand provisions for jury trials in misdemeanor cases. A unanimous ruling Thursday points to a 2015 law that justices say means a conviction for misdemeanor domestic violence can no longer be considered a petty offense. The court calls limiting state and U.S. constitutional rights to own a gun a serious penalty that a jury should decide. Michael Pariente, the attorney who won the ruling on behalf of Christopher Anderson, says it brings Nevada in line with all but a few other U.S. states. It could also lead to increased costs in a state where officials tallied more than 30,000 domestic violence arrests in 2017, including more than 21,000 in and around Las Vegas.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPlymouth: A lecture series at Plymouth State University will explore some of the key issues facing voters ahead of the next presidential election. The free Saul O Sidore Lecture Series starts Tuesday, with other sessions set for Oct. 22 and Nov. 5. The first speaker will be sociologist Alison McLetchie, who will discuss the role of race in U.S. elections. In October, Gregory Samuels of the University of Montevallo will discuss fact-checking in the age of fake news. The November speaker will be Harold Meyerson, an editor of The American Prospect, who will explore the renewed appeal of socialism. The series will continue in March and April with presentations on immigration and border security, health care, the economy and the risk of nuclear escalation. Reservations are recommended.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWildwood: A congressional subcommittee has heard from fishermen asking for input on crucial decisions about offshore wind energy. They said Monday at a hearing at the Jersey Shore that they want to be consulted on where wind energy projects are located and whether water access is restricted. The hearing’s purpose was to gather input from the industry and its advocates to be considered in future regulation of wind energy. Peter Hughes, of Atlantic Cape Fisheries, says proposed projects off New Jersey sit atop prime fishing grounds. Capt. Ed Yates, a fisherman from Barnegat Light, New Jersey, says flounder, cod and other species have moved away from underground cables at a wind project off Denmark. The productive Cape May fishing port in Southern Jersey is second in the nation in terms of the value of seafood brought ashore each year, the fishermen say.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nGallup: Activists are using virtual reality technology to focus on areas of the Navajo Nation affected by uranium contamination. The Gallup Independent reports the arts collective Bombshelltoe has collected 360-degree footage of Churchrock, New Mexico, to show how people and the land have changed since a 1979 uranium mill spill. The film, titled “Ways of Knowing,” was directed by artist Kayla Briet. The project started four years ago after Washington, D.C.-based nuclear policy program manager Lovely Umayam met Navajo activist Sunny Dooley at an event in Santa Fe. Umayam says the group wanted to use the new technology of virtual reality with the stories to show the impact of uranium mining. In 1979, a dam on the Navajo Nation near Church Rock broke at an evaporation pond, releasing 94 million gallons of radioactive waste to the Puerco River.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Schools across the state began the academic year with a new tool intended to prevent student suicides and violence – the ability to ask a court to remove a troubled person’s access to firearms. So-called red flag laws allow courts to temporarily seize guns from people believed to be a danger to themselves or others, but New York is the first to empower schools to petition a court themselves for such an order, rather than go through local law enforcement. Supporters of the law say educators are uniquely suited to pick up on the kind of troubling behavior seen before school shootings. With the law so new, though, schools are still crafting procedures or waiting on guidance to help them figure out when and how to take action if the need arises. Several school systems said they’re not yet sure what the law will look like in action.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Plaintiffs in a successful redistricting lawsuit say state judges should allow the public release of a trove of documents culled from a late Republican mapmaker’s files. Common Cause and North Carolina Democrats were permitted to use a small number of files they subpoenaed from the daughter of Thomas Hofeller in a partisan gerrymandering trial in July. The judges ordered the rest remain confidential while Hofeller’s old firm designated documents they wanted to remain private. That confidentiality order – issued before some documents also were used in litigation over a U.S. census citizenship question – expires next week. Democratic U.S. senators and media outlets filed briefs Friday – as did the plaintiffs – asking more documents be released.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: When electronic pulltabs launched one year ago, they instantly became the state’s most popular form of gambling. And the charities and the state’s treasury have ballooned with cash. Data shows North Dakotans wagered $410.5 million on the new machines in the first nine months following their debut. But critics say the e-pulltabs are simply slot machines in disguise that take away profits from the state’s American Indian casinos and have caused problem gambling to soar. Lisa Vig, who helps run a gambling treatment program in Fargo, called the machines’ popularity “very frightening.” She says the e-machines are contributing greatly to “financial distress, emotional distress and family issues.”\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: A baby snow leopard born at the city’s zoo is now on exhibit. Babochka is on display for the first time since her birth in March at the Toledo Zoo. The Blade in Toledo reports the cub’s parents, Greta and Shishir, were imported from Scandinavia in 2017 to start a new bloodline in North America. Snow leopards are listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources’ Red List. An international conservation group called Panthera estimates there are between 4,500 and 10,000 specimens in the wild. The World Wide Fund for Nature cites poaching, human encroachment and climate change as stressors on the species’ population.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Weekend fights at six state prisons that left one inmate dead and more than a dozen others injured were apparently coordinated and the result of race-based gang tension inside the facilities, the head of a prison workers association said Monday. The first fight erupted Saturday at the Northeast Oklahoma Correctional Center in Vinita. It was followed Sunday by fights at prisons in Hominy, Sayre, Fort Supply, Lawton and Stringtown, according to the state Department of Corrections. The prisoner who died was at the medium-security Dick Conner Correctional Center in Hominy. More than a dozen inmates were taken to hospitals with injuries that aren’t considered life-threatening. All of Oklahoma’s prisons remained locked down Monday, with family visitation canceled and inmates mostly confined to their cells.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state has banned the trapping of an extremely rare, cat-like creature in coastal areas critical to its survival. A coalition of environmental groups on Monday said the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission voted 4-3 for a trapping ban west of Interstate 5 to protect the fewer than 200 Humboldt martens left in the state. The Humboldt marten is related to the mink and lives in coastal forests. Conservation groups had sued Oregon when it didn’t act to ban trapping last fall. The groups said the delay had the potential to wipe out the population. Oregon’s martens live in two isolated groups in the Siskiyou National Forest and the Siuslaw National Forest. The martens are also found in Northern California. Coastal martens are proposed for protection as “threatened” under U.S. law.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPlainfield: The township has approved zoning changes aimed at blocking projects such as natural gas pipelines, wind turbines, solar panels and cellphone towers from being located near its section of the Appalachian Trail. The (Allentown) Morning Call reports that Plainfield Township supervisors last week unanimously approved the ordinance, which also addresses mineral extraction, billboards and mobile homes. Environmental planner Brooks Mountcastle of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy says other municipalities have recently adopted ordinances aimed at protecting the trail, but they aren’t as comprehensive as Plainfield’s. It includes guidelines for controlling light pollution, groundwater withdrawal, digital signs, noise, commercial outdoor recreation, residential developments, solar panels, natural gas pipelines and wind turbines.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s treasurer says $1.4 million in unclaimed property will be returned to about 4,000 people. Treasurer Seth Magaziner says his office automatically sends checks to many people listed in the unclaimed property database through an initiative called “Your Money.” Unclaimed property can include money left in old bank accounts and safe deposit boxes, uncashed paychecks, unused gift certificates, unreturned utility deposits, uncollected insurance payments, and forgotten stocks and dividends. Since the initiative launched in November 2017, Magaziner says more than $17 million has been returned to about 52,000 people. He says much of it has been returned automatically, without the need for paperwork. Magaziner says residents can visit the office’s website to see if the state is holding their unclaimed property.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A former state chief justice will oversee all court cases around a pair of nuclear reactors abandoned during construction. An order from the state Supreme Court says former Chief Justice Jean Toal will take over all lawsuits about the V.C. Summer nuclear project that lost billions of dollars. Circuit Judge John Hayes had been handling the cases and approved a settlement to a lawsuit by South Carolina Electric & Gas ratepayers that led to rebate checks for less than $100. The order does not say why Toal is taking over. Cases still pending include South Carolina’s electric cooperatives lawsuit against the minority partner in the project, state-owned Santee Cooper. Toal was South Carolina’s first woman elected chief justice, holding the office from 2000 to 2015.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Nearly a week after three EF2 tornadoes ravaged the city, students at O’Gorman High School are coming together to help their neighbors across the street. The students are establishing a tornado relief fund for families at an apartment complex across from the campus after the storm last Tuesday night ripped the roof off the building, according to a press release by the Bishop O’Gorman Catholic Schools system Monday. The students will join together during homecoming week this week to bring in as much as they can each day, and the funds will be split evenly to reach of the displaced families at the complex. The city is also taking donations through the Sioux Falls Area Community Foundation.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: If you’d like to visit a museum for free this weekend, the Smithsonian has your tickets. As part of the annual Museum Day, 28 museums and cultural institutions in the state will offer free admission Saturday. Hopeful visitors can go request a ticket that provides free admission to two people. Participants are allowed to download one ticket per email address, while supplies last. Memphis has the most participating museums with 10, including the Blues Hall of Fame, Pink Palace Museum, Memphis Brooks Museum of Art and Memphis Rock ’n’ Soul Museum. The Knoxville area has six, including the American Museum of Science and Energy and the Children’s Museum in Oak Ridge, as well as Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame and Knoxville Museum of Art. Nashville area participants include the First Art Museum and the Parthenon.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: Hearings in tent courts in South Texas are underway for asylum-seekers forced to wait in Mexico while their immigration applications are considered. Monday’s hearings mark the formal opening of the courts. Twenty-one migrants lined up in Mexico to cross the border for their appearances. Officials say they want 200 migrants to appear each day in the tents in Laredo. A judge in a brick courthouse in San Antonio is presiding over the Laredo court via video chat. Outside observers are barred from the tents, but journalists were allowed into the San Antonio courthouse. The Trump administration introduced its “Remain in Mexico” policy in January in response to an increase in asylum-seeking families, especially from Central America. Critics have assailed the policy for making families and children wait in violent Mexico border cities.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: A man who has been in a wheelchair for more than three decades has created a pheasant hunt for people like him who need help getting into the outdoors. Clint Robinson broke his neck after being thrown off a horse at a rodeo 32 years ago. He’s done his best to keep getting into the outdoors to hunt and fish, the Daily Herald in Provo reports. The event he calls “Wheelchairs in the Wild” pairs people who have physical disabilities with hunters who help them with whatever they need. Many go in off-road vehicles. The youngest hunter at last year’s event was 13-year-old Missy Cowley, who has spina bifida. Her father loves to hunt but didn’t know how to accommodate her wheelchair. Her mother, Cindy Cowley, says it was amazing to find a program that allowed her daughter to go hunting.\n\nVermont\n\nSwanton: A total of $3.6 million in grants will go toward improving bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure in communities around the state. Gov. Phil Scott’s office says this year’s projects include a shared-use path to complete a missing link in South Burlington; sidewalks in Moretown; and a sidewalk to provide safe access to the high school in Swanton. The governor’s office says about $3.3 million federal money will fund the larger projects, and $300,000 in state funding will go to 10 small improvement projects that address critical safety needs for pedestrian crossings and filling sidewalk gaps. Scott says that “improvements to the bike and pedestrian infrastructure around the state help communities modernize and become more livable and affordable.”\n\nVirginia\n\nLovingston: Authorities say a yak on its way to the butcher’s shop escaped to the nearby mountains, avoiding animal control officers and treats trying to lure it back into a trailer. The News & Advance reports the yak named Meteor was on its last ride Tuesday from Buckingham, Virginia, to the butcher when it got out of its trailer. The escape was called in as livestock on the loose, and Nelson County Animal Control officer Kevin Wright says he figured he was looking for a cow. Wright says the yak crossed a busy highway and avoided officers trying to capture it by heading for the mountains. The yak was last spotted Wednesday at an inn, where the owners tried unsuccessfully to lure it into a trailer using treats.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: State auditors say schools are struggling to keep students sitting for the recommended 20-minute lunch. The Seattle Times reports an audit from the Washington State Auditor’s Office found scheduling lunches could be the key to improving health and behavior in K-12 students. Washington is one of five states that require a 20-minute lunch seating schedule for students. The state auditor’s report found that students who sit for 20 minutes wasted less food, ate healthier and exhibited better behavior in the classroom. But the report also found students at nearly all of the 31 schools observed didn’t sit for 20 minutes to eat. Seventeen schools scheduled 20 minutes of sitting, but only one followed through. Enforcing the rule can be tough. Teachers are required to have a break from supervising students, and some schools don’t have enough support staff to keep kids in their seats.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: A private university will reinstate several academic and athletic programs that were dropped amid a financial crisis. Wheeling University says in a statement that starting in January, it will resume offering majors in biology, engineering science and English. It also will offer new online programs in criminal justice and psychology. In 2020, the school will reinstate men’s golf, men’s and women’s lacrosse, and men’s and women’s swimming. Wheeling University athletic teams compete in the Division II Mountain East Conference. Wheeling University cut more than half its academic programs this fall, and two top officials were placed on paid administrative leave. The school changed its name from Wheeling Jesuit University and ended its affiliation with the Jesuit order while maintaining its Roman Catholic identity.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state’s dairy industry is raising a stink about potential new regulations governing manure storage. State officials are crafting new farm standards to serve as a template for local ordinances. The standards would expand setbacks for manure storage. New farms with at least 500 animals and farms looking to expand to at least 500 animals would have to place storage facilities between 600 feet and 2,500 feet from their neighbors’ property line depending on herd size to minimize odor. Farm groups including the Dairy Business Association, the Wisconsin Dairy Alliance and the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation held a news conference Monday to rail against the standards. They insisted the regulations would make expansion nearly impossible and drive farmers out of Wisconsin.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: The park recorded just over 820,000 recreational visits during the month of August and has exceeded 3.1 million visitors for the year so far. The August numbers are a slight increase from August 2018, while the total visitor numbers for the year are down by about 21,500 from the same period last year. Visitation to the United States’ first national park typically begins to decrease in September with the end of the busy summer tourist season and the onset of winter.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/12/20/alaska-america-bathtub-miracle-glamping-opposition-news-around-states/49552231/", "title": "Alaska for America, bathtub miracle: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Nearly two dozen organizations have sent a letter asking the U.S. House Financial Services Committee to investigate the state’s plan to use $400 million in pandemic relief funds to build two super-size prisons. The American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, The Sentencing Project and others signed on to a letter arguing that prison construction is an improper use of money from the American Rescue Plan and asking Chairwoman Rep. Maxine Waters to hold hearings on the matter. “Directing COVID relief funds to a massive prison construction plan that long predates the pandemic is an absurd and inappropriate use of (American Rescue Plan) funds,” the organizations wrote. Gov. Kay Ivey signed legislation in October to tap $400 million of the state’s money from the federal plan to help build two super-size prisons. The Republican governor at the time called the construction plan “a major step forward” for the prison system, which faces various federal court orders and a lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department. Republican legislative leaders and Ivey have said they are confident they can use the pandemic money for prison construction because the American Rescue Plan says states can use the money to replace revenue lost during the pandemic to strengthen support for vital public services and help retain jobs.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The newly crowned Miss America has made history, becoming both the first Korean American and the first Alaskan to hold the title in the competition’s 100-year history. “I never could have imagined in a million years that I would be Miss America, let alone that I would be Miss Alaska,” a beaming Emma Broyles said Friday. In fact, she was sure they had it wrong. The final two contestants were Broyles and Lauren Bradford, Miss Alabama, and Broyles said she was thinking Bradford was going to make an amazing Miss America. “And then they said Alaska, and I said, ‘No way. Are you sure? Do you want to check that card again?’ ” she said. “I am so, so grateful to everybody back at home who’s been supporting me for so long, and I’m so glad that I’m able to bring home the title of Miss America to the state of Alaska for the first time in history.” Broyles, 20, said her grandparents immigrated to Anchorage from Korea about 50 years ago, before her mother was born. Her mother is a special education teacher at Service High School in Anchorage, the same school Broyles attended. Broyles has chosen the Special Olympics for her social impact initiative. Besides her mother’s position, her older brother, Brendan, has Down syndrome and competes in athletic events with Special Olympics Alaska.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey has extended an executive order prohibiting state and local governments from requiring people to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The prohibition includes an exception for hospitals and other licensed health care institutions. It’s a small part of a nine-page order signed Wednesday that largely deals with surveillance and monitoring of health care institutions during the pandemic. Ducey in August issued an executive order barring the state and local governments from requiring vaccines, based on an existing public health law. However, after the outbreak worsened again during the fall, the state university system, the city of Tucson and Pima County decided to require their employees to be inoculated. Tucson Mayor Regina Romero said in a statement Friday that the city will keep its employee vaccine mandate in place. The city says Ducey has no authority to block its immunization rules. Phoenix also mandated employee vaccinations, but it and at least one university have since paused their mandates after a court blocked the Biden administration’s mandate that federal contractors require employee vaccinations. Ducey’s office did not announce the latest order, which was reported by local news outlets.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Friday reported its first case of the omicron variant as the state’s coronavirus cases and COVID-19 hospitalizations continued to increase. The Arkansas Department of Health did not release information about the person’s location, age or gender, nor whether they had been vaccinated. However, department spokeswoman Meg Mirivel said the case was not associated with travel. The variant’s appearance in the state had been expected as it spreads throughout the United States. The variant has been detected in at least 40 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Globally, more than 75 countries have reported confirmed omicron cases. “This was expected, and we expect more cases of the variant to be confirmed in the near future,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted. “This is not a surprise, but it is a compelling reason to get a booster shot now.” The state reported 1,111 new virus cases, bringing its total since the pandemic began to 542,426. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations rose by nine to 538. The state reported 17 new COVID-19 deaths. Arkansas ranks 35th in the country for new virus cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The California Coastal Commission has approved a plan to poison invasive mice threatening rare seabirds on the Farallon Islands National Wildlife Refuge. The agency that regulates California’s coastline voted 5-3 Thursday night to approve a plan to drop about 3,000 pounds of poisoned bait from helicopters onto the rocky islands off the San Francisco coast that are home to hundreds of thousands of breeding birds. The move still requires approval from the regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, officials said. The Farallon Islands refuge is home to an estimated 300,000 breeding seabirds, including the rare ashy storm-petrel. But officials say the population is threatened by mice that arrived on the islands aboard ships more than a century ago. In recent years, the mouse population has exploded, attracting burrowing owls that also prey on the ashy storm-petrel, officials said. “This project is necessary and is the right thing to do to stop the ecosystem carnage done by mice: a human-caused problem,” Gerry McChesney, manager of the wildlife refuge, said at the meeting. The proposal has won both support and condemnation from various conservation groups. Critics contend other wildlife could be poisoned by the rodenticide. Famed animal researcher and conservationist Jane Goodall spoke against the proposal at the hearing. “This poison will inflict pain and suffering on a great many sentient animals,” she said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The 110-year prison sentence meted out last week to the truck driver who killed four people when he lost his brakes on Interstate 70 put a renewed spotlight on the state’s mandatory-minimum sentencing laws and on district attorneys’ ability to use such laws to ensure convictions lead to prison time. Rogel Aguilera-Mederos, 26, was sentenced to a prison term twice as long as some Colorado murderers after his convictions triggered provisions in state law that forced District Court Judge Bruce Jones to lay down a minimum 110-year sentence. The judge said during the sentencing hearing that he had no discretion to set a lesser prison term but wished he could. One family member of a man who died in the fiery 28-car pileup in Lakewood said he did not want a life sentence for the truck driver. And the day after the sentencing, First Judicial District Attorney Alexis King – who pursued the convictions that led to the 110-year sentence – said in a statement that she would “welcome” a reconsideration of the prison term. Aguilera-Mederos’ sentence stretched to more than a century because under Colorado law, first-degree assault and attempted first-degree assault are so-called crimes of violence in which prison sentences must run consecutively, not concurrently, when they spring from the same incident.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: An appeals court ruled Friday that a local historical society cannot try to impose its conservation rules on a congregational church that dates back to 1700 and is located on the celebrated Lebanon Town Green. The ruling by the state Appellate Court is the latest chapter in years­long legal proceedings over who owns the mile-long green and how to shield it from development that would harm its historic character. As a result of those proceedings, the Lebanon Historical Society has conservation authority over 95% of the green, meaning any construction and property improvements must adhere to its building rules and restrictions. But the First Congregational Church of Lebanon is on the 5% of the green the society does not control. In a lawsuit filed in 2019, the historical society is seeking authority to regulate the remaining 5%, saying it needs to be protected like the rest of the green. The church argued that just because the society controls adjacent property doesn’t mean it has legal standing to try to impose that authority on the property where the church buildings stand. Three judges on the Appellate Court on Friday upheld a lower court ruling in favor of the church, saying the case has implications for property owners statewide. The historical society intends to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court, a lawyer said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A lawsuit filed Friday on behalf of two men who claim they were unjustifiably beaten by officers at Sussex Correctional Institution aims to investigate what the filing describes as an “ongoing and egregious pattern of the use of excessive force” against people housed in the prison. The lawsuit was submitted to U.S. District Court in Wilmington on behalf of William “Bill” Davis and Isaac Montague. Both claim that they were beaten as pretrial detainees and that officers deployed pepper spray directly into their noses and mouths as they were held down in two separate incidents this fall. “Justice? I think they definitely need to be charged criminally because eventually they are going to kill somebody,” said Davis, a resident of Bear and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The lawsuit follows other litigation against the Delaware Department of Correction in which people imprisoned by the state claim that officers engage in violence and other violations of basic rights with impunity. Both Davis and Montague are being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Delaware. It is the first time the organization has represented prisoners in recent years and the first such lawsuit since hiring Susan Burke, who took over as the chapter’s legal director earlier this year. “We intend to do a lot of prison litigation,” Burke said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new mural honoring civil rights icon John Lewis now decorates the walls of the barbershop where the late congressman was a regular customer, WUSA-TV reports. The artwork was officially unveiled at HIS grooming Thursday afternoon. Posts on the shop’s Instagram page show that the piece depicts Lewis in the chair getting his head shaved. After Lewis’ death in 2020 of pancreatic cancer, shop owner Jared Scott spoke about the first time Lewis came into his business for a hot shave with a straight razor. “My heart skipped a few beats,” Scott said. “My hands were trembling.” Lewis continued to visit HIS Grooming nearly a dozen times over the course of a year. The art project honoring Lewis has been in the works for a while, but a special event for its unveiling will have D.C. Council members in attendance, as well as U.S. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district’s delegate to Congress.\n\nFlorida\n\nGulf Breeze: A man who was rewarded by the Planters peanut company for being a good Samaritan is continuing to help others in his Panhandle city. Over the previous two Christmas seasons, Mike Esmond donated about $12,000 to pay off utility bills for people in Gulf Breeze who needed some extra help. Then, in March, Planters sent Esmond a check for $104,000 for his good works as part of the company’s “A Nut Above” campaign. Since then, Esmond has continued helping with past-due utility bills, paying off balances for 677 accounts. “In other words, I paid everybody’s past-due account for a while, about March to August, like six months straight,” Esmond said. Last week, he donated funds to pay off 29 accounts, putting his total donations at about $85,000 this year and more than $96,000 over three years. He said he’s continuing his effort in hopes of inspiring others, and it’s been touching to hear how the donations have helped older residents who may need additional assistance. “I’ve had some older, retired people call me crying on the phone because I paid their bills, because they live on Social Security, and they don’t know what’s going on,” Esmond said. The U.S. Army veteran said he was inspired to help with utility bills because of his own experience in the 1980s, when he couldn’t afford to pay his winter gas bill.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Johnny Isakson, an affable Republican politician who rose from the ranks of the Georgia Legislature to become a U.S. senator known as an effective, behind-the-scenes consensus builder, died Sunday. He was 76. Isakson’s son John Isakson said his father died in his sleep before dawn at his home in Atlanta. John Isakson said although his father had Parkinson’s disease, the cause of death was not immediately apparent. “He was a great man, and I will miss him,” John Isakson said. Johnny Isakson, whose real estate business made him a millionaire, spent more than four decades in Georgia political life. In the Senate, he was the architect of a popular tax credit for first-time home buyers that he said would help invigorate the struggling housing market. As chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, he worked to expand programs offering more private health care choices for veterans. Isakson’s famous motto was that “there are two types of people in this world: friends and future friends.” That approach made him exceedingly popular among colleagues. In a farewell Senate speech, he pleaded for bipartisanship at a time of bitter divisions between Republicans and Democrats. He cited his long friendship with U.S. Rep. John Lewis, an Atlanta Democrat and civil rights hero, as an example of two men willing to put party aside to work on common problems.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A working group tasked by the Legislature to come up with recommendations for a new management plan for the state’s tallest peak and its affiliated telescopes released the first draft of its proposal Friday. Mauna Kea is the proposed site for what would be the world’s largest optical telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope. The giant telescope project has sparked a cultural movement among Native Hawaiians who believe the mountain is sacred. Construction of the massive instrument has been blocked by opponents. The group suggested a new governing entity for the mountain, which is managed by the University of Hawaii. The group recommended the school not have a seat on the board of the new governing body. The university’s lease expires in 2033. “The University of Hawaii was represented at the table during the working group discussions,” said the group’s chairperson, Rep. Mark Nakashima, a Democrat whose Hilo district includes Mauna Kea. “One of the premises of the resolution was that the university failed in some of its duties and responsibilities to the Native Hawaiian population, and so it was not included in the final management structure.” The group could not come to a consensus on whether someone from the astronomy field should participate and recommended any such involvement be in an advisory capacity.\n\nIdaho\n\nKuna: Lawmakers are looking at a $400 million tax relief package for the upcoming legislative session that includes a $200 million income tax cut, a top Republican House member said. House Assistant Majority Leader Jason Monks said Friday that the income tax cut involves lowering the top income tax bracket from 6.5% to 6%. Monks spoke at a legislative district town hall meeting in Kuna with several other lawmakers. Monks said Republican Gov. Brad Little is behind the income tax cut plan, as is the House Revenue and Taxation Committee chairman. “They’re greasing the skids pretty good on this,” Monks said. He said the other $200 million would come from a one-time tax relief package. Republican lawmakers last year passed nearly $400 million in tax relief that Democrats said mainly benefitted the wealthy. Idaho’s budget surplus is estimated at $1.6 billion, much of that attributed to the $5 billion the federal government has sent to Idaho in coronavirus relief money. The Legislature is scheduled to meet in Boise on Jan. 10, and lawmakers will look at setting state agency budgets. Republican Gov. Brad Little earlier this month hinted at possible tax cuts stemming from the projected surplus.\n\nIllinois\n\nHoffman Estates: Sears plans to sell the sprawling suburban Chicago corporate headquarters that’s been the struggling retailer’s home for three decades. Transformco, Sears’ parent company, confirmed last week that in early 2022 it plans to market the 273-acre corporate headquarters in the northwest suburb of Hoffman Estates. Transformco has been downsizing Sears’ operations and corporate staff for several years. “These changes have reduced our needs for a corporate campus that was built 30 years ago for the needs of a more centralized business,” Transformco spokesman Larry Costello said in a statement. Costello said employees have been operating under a hybrid structure during the pandemic, with a mix of in-office and remote work. He declined to say how many employees are based out of Hoffman Estates or where a future headquarters might be located. The Hoffman Estates campus was home to more than 4,000 Sears employees as recently as 2017, according to company filings. The site features a 2.3 million-square-foot corporate office and 273 acres, including 100 acres of undeveloped land.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: More than half of the state’s population remains unvaccinated against COVID-19, and its largest hospital system is so strained that it has asked the Indiana National Guard for assistance. A new WalletHub report adds another dire distinction to the resume: Indiana is the least safe state in the country during the pandemic – not just one of the worst or the worst in the Midwest but the absolute worst. Indiana ranked 51st on the list of “Safest States During COVID-19,” which includes all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The rankings came from the following data, according to WalletHub: vaccinations, deaths, hospitalizations, transmission rate and positive testing rate. All five categories were averaged together and graded on a 100-point scale, with 100 being the most safe. Indiana received a score of 17.67 out of 100. Hoosiers fared poorly in each individual category. When looking at vaccination rates, Indiana ranks No. 48. For COVID-19 hospitalizations, it ranks No. 46, tied with South Dakota, Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan. As of Thursday, the state reported more than 3,000 hospitalized patients, according to the Indiana State Department of Health’s dashboard. The state’s latest average positivity rate was 13.8%, as of Dec. 10. Nearly 18,000 Hoosiers have died of COVID-19 throughout the pandemic.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Property owners who ask to remove their names from online property searches to conceal their address may keep their names confidential under a ruling the state Supreme Court published Friday. Des Moines Register reporter Clark Kauffman filed a complaint with the Iowa Public Information Board against Polk County Assessor Randy Ripperger in 2017 after Ripperger refused to release a list of people who had requested their names be removed from the county’s online search-by-name property search database. The list includes police officers, prosecutors, judges and crime victims who want to make it harder for criminals or harassers to find out where they live. There are more than 3,500 property owners on the list. Kauffman alleged that Ripperger was violating the state’s open records law by refusing to provide the list of names. Kauffman said in a hearing that he sought the disabled name list to determine who opts in to the policy and find out if developers, landlords or slumlords are trying to keep their names from public disclosure. The board, which under Iowa law is empowered to enforce the state’s open records law, found in 2018 that Ripperger had violated the law. An administrative law judge and a state court judge affirmed that conclusion, and Ripperger appealed. The court concluded the list of names fits within an exception the Legislature allowed in the state law.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A moratorium on voluntary admissions at Osawatomie State Hospital will be lifted in January to provide more space for adults with long-term mental health issues. The Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services announced Thursday that the ban, which has been in place since 2015, will end as of Jan. 3. The hospital, one of two state-run hospitals for the seriously mentally ill, stopped taking voluntary admissions after receiving citations for not doing enough to help suicidal patients and routinely housing three patients in rooms meant for two because of capacity issues. The policy caused problems for other mental health providers, law enforcement and health care facilities who struggled to place people with serious mental health issues. The department also has created a new classification for mental health providers called State Institutional Alternative, which allows private psychiatric facilities to accept mentally ill patients who have been approved for admission to state hospitals. Currently, eight hospitals in the state are classified as SIAs, and they have cared for 122 adults and 291 youth since September. The agency is also planning renovations on the Osawatomie campus that will eventually increase capacity to 72 certified beds and 110 licensed beds.\n\nKentucky\n\nMadisonville: Two babies survived a tornado that ripped the bathtub in which they were sheltering out of the ground and tossed it with them inside, their grandmother said. Clara Lutz told WFIE-TV she put 15-month-old Kaden and 3-month-old Dallas in the bathtub Dec. 10 with a blanket, a pillow and a Bible. Then the house in Hopkins County started shaking. “Next thing I knew, the tub had lifted, and it was out of my hands,” Lutz said. “I couldn’t hold on. I just – oh my God.” Lutz, who had been hit in the back of the head by the water tank from the tub, said she began looking everywhere among the wreckage for the children. Her house was stripped to the foundation. “All I could say was, ‘Lord please bring my babies back safely. Please, I beg thee,’ ” she said. The bathtub was found in her yard, upside down, with the babies underneath. Authorities from the sheriff’s office drove to the end of her driveway and reunited her with the two children, she said. Dallas had a big bump on the back of his head and had to go to Vanderbilt University Medical Center Nashville because his brain was bleeding, but the bleeding stopped before Lutz got to the hospital, she said. Lutz said the parents of the children live on the north end of the county, and their home was nearly untouched by the tornado.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A man convicted in a killing has been exonerated and freed after being locked up for 12 years. Kendall Gordon walked out of the criminal courthouse in New Orleans a free man Thursday, days after local prosecutors asked a judge to void his conviction and release him, news outlets report. Gordon was serving a life sentence in the shooting death of a young woman during a 2009 home invasion and robbery. But the justice advocacy group Innocence Project New Orleans and the District Attorney’s office said DNA collected from the crime scene linked someone else to the crime. Also, a key witness recanted. “Darceleen Comadore consistently described the intruders that entered her home as an older man and a younger man, explicitly pointing out that the younger intruder had been shot and wounded while in her home by his accomplice,” the IPNO said in a news release. “Ms. Comadore believed she recognized the younger wounded intruder and identified him as Kendall Gordon.” However, she changed her story after learning that another man, Jessie Bibbins III, 18, had been shot and killed with the same weapon as the victim in her home. Bibbins was found dead less than 3 miles from the crime scene, wearing clothes matching those worn by the younger intruder, IPNO said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: New England’s commercial shrimp fishery will remain shut down because of concerns about the health of the crustacean’s population amid warming ocean temperatures. The cold-water shrimp were once a winter delicacy in Maine and beyond, but the fishing industry has been shut down since 2013. A board of the regulatory Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission voted Friday to keep the fishery shuttered for at least three more years. The shrimp prefer cold water, and their population health is imperiled by the warming of the ocean off New England. The Gulf of Maine, in particular, is warming faster than most of the world’s oceans. Scientists have also said recently that warming waters led to increased predation from a species of squid that feeds on shrimp. The board last voted to extend the existing moratorium on commercial fishing of the shrimp in 2018. The board could have decided to reopen the fishing industry Friday but chose not to do so in the face of discouraging news from scientists. Recent surveys of the shrimp show far less of them than historical averages, and there have been seven consecutive years of low abundance, said Maggie Hunter, a scientist with the Maine Department of Marine Resources. Warming waters remain a problem, Hunter said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The state’s Public Service Commission on Friday awarded offshore wind renewable energy credits to two developers who have proposed two projects off Maryland’s coast. The decision will support plans by US Wind Inc. and Skipjack Offshore Energy to build separate projects that would produce more than 1,600 megawatts of energy, the PSC said in a news release. The new proposed projects are in addition to the 368 megawatts of offshore wind already being developed by both companies off Maryland’s shore and whose offshore wind renewable energy credits were approved by the commission in 2017. In the second-round application period that ended in June, US Wind submitted three bids, and Skipjack submitted two bids. The proposals were evaluated on a number of criteria, including impacts to customer electric bills; Maryland’s health, environmental and climate interests, including progress toward lowering the state’s greenhouse gas emissions; and economic development benefits, the PSC said. The second-round projects are both expected to be operational before the end of 2026. They are subject to review by the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Nurses at St. Vincent Hospital have reached a tentative agreement to end one of the longest nurse strikes in state history. The deal between the Massachusetts Nurses Associates and Tenet Healthcare, the Dallas-based company that owns the Worcester hospital, was announced late Friday. Union members will vote on the proposal at a later date. The hospital said in a statement that 700 nurses will be able to resume their old jobs, and the nurses hired to replace them will also be able to retain their current positions. “We are glad to finally end the strike and put our sole focus back on patient care,” Carolyn Jackson, the hospital’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We will be setting a new tone at Saint Vincent Hospital: We are one team with a common purpose. Not striking nurses versus replacement nurses. Not nurses versus management.” U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, a former Boston mayor and labor leader in Massachusetts, helped broker the accord during an in-person meeting Friday, the union said in a statement. Federal mediators have been working for two weeks with both sides to reach an accord. The nurses walked out in March complaining that staffing levels were too low and that they had too many patients to care for safely.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The University of Michigan and Michigan State University will require all students, faculty and staff to receive a COVID-19 booster vaccination for the next semester in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The two universities, with the two largest student enrollments in the state, released statements Friday announcing the requirement, noting the omicron variant being found in the state. MSU said in its release that the deadline to get a booster shot is the beginning of the spring semester Jan. 10, while Michigan’s release said Feb. 4. Both schools already require vaccination against COVID-19 and have set their policies to reflect access and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation to receive a booster for anyone who is 18 or older and six months out from the last vaccine in their initial series. In July, both university presidents announced vaccines would be required for the fall semester due to spread of the highly infectious delta variant. The first case of the omicron variant was found in Kent County earlier this month. The CDC says the omicron variant may be even more contagious than the highly spreadable delta variant.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Hennepin County’s sheriff has pleaded guilty to drunken driving. Dave Hutchinson entered the plea Thursday to the misdemeanor charge and said he has enrolled in an outpatient treatment program to address his issues with alcohol. Hutchinson crashed his SUV on Interstate 94 near Alexandria on Dec. 8 at 2:30 a.m. after attending a state sheriffs conference. Hutchinson’s blood alcohol level was 0.13%. The legal limit to drive is 0.08%. The sheriff said in a statement that the crash was a “wakeup call” for him. He suffered three broken ribs and head and hip injuries when he rolled the SUV. “I understand the seriousness of my actions, for which I take full responsibility,” Hutchinson said. Hutchinson entered his guilty plea to fourth-degree driving while intoxicated via a plea petition. Douglas County Attorney Chad Larson said a plea agreement calls for a stayed jail sentence of 90 days, up to two years of probation, a $500 fine, a chemical-use assessment and a requirement that he follow the assessment’s recommendations. Hutchinson also must abstain from alcohol and nonprescribed controlled substances and submit to random testing. Larson said it’s a standard misdemeanor sentence for anyone with a first-time drunken-driving conviction.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Five universities are receiving nearly $10 million from the state to cover tuition for aspiring educators. The Mississippi Teacher Residency Program is part of an effort to address the state’s teacher shortage. There were 3,036 certified teacher vacancies in Mississippi’s public schools from Aug. 21 to Oct. 11, 2021, according to a Department of Education survey. The grants will cover tuition and expenses for up to 240 people seeking a graduate degree in elementary and secondary education and are being paid for with American Rescue Plan relief dollars. The money is being split among Delta State University, Jackson State University, Mississippi State University, University of Southern Mississippi and William Carey University. Anyone accepted into the program will receive full scholarships, testing fees, books and mentor stipends. The grant includes training alongside a mentor teacher, testing support, professional development, and a commitment to teaching in a district serving low-income children, racial and ethnic minorities, and children with disabilities.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The state treasurer will no longer help schools refinance bond debt unless superintendents promise not to enforce face mask requirements and other COVID-19 safety measures issued by local officials. Treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick this month began requiring school districts trying to refinance bond debt to certify that they’ll obey Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s warning against coronavirus-related mandates, Missourinet reports. Schmitt this month threatened to sue school districts and local health departments that require masks. He cited a November ruling from Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green. “These schools received certification forms because their bond deals were scheduled to close after the Attorney General communicated with schools about the court decision and we were made aware of several schools which did not intend to comply with the order,” Treasurer’s Office spokeswoman Mary Compton said in a Friday email. Fitzpatrick’s policy puts more pressure on districts to ditch mask and quarantine requirements. Without help from the Treasurer’s Office, districts face higher interest rates on debts.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Federal wildlife officials say two species of rare insects in the Rocky Mountains will need several thousand acres of glaciers and snowfields if they are to survive a warming world that’s threatening them with extinction. The western glacier stonefly and the meltwater lednian stonefly live in streams that flow from melting glaciers and snowfields. Scientists say the insects are not doing well and face continued declines as they lose a projected 80% of their habitat in Glacier National Park by 2030. The stoneflies’ peril underscores the threat climate change poses worldwide to mountaintops that are “biodiversity hot spots” – home to a rich variety of plants, animals and insects about which scientists are still learning. The two species live in and around Glacier National Park in Montana; Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, Canada; and Native American tribal lands in western Montana. More recently, they’ve been found in streams in Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park and the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness in Montana and Wyoming. A new draft recovery plan from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service suggests the possible transplant of some of the insects to new areas, exploring ways to artificially propagate populations and research into the stoneflies’ heat tolerance.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Even in normal times, the state has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation, with fewer than 2 million residents and plenty of jobs to go around. But with some workers slow to return to work after COVID-19 shutdowns, the state has hit new depths, recording the country’s lowest-ever state unemployment rate of 1.8% in November. Now Gov. Pete Ricketts, who frequently expounds on the value of work, is confronting an intriguing question: Can a governor force citizens to work, even if they apparently aren’t eager or able to do so? Options he’s trying include requiring people to confer with job coaches before seeking unemployment benefits. “There’s going to be a lot of different things we’re going to have to do to reach each individual and, if they’re not working for whatever reason, get them back into the workforce,” Ricketts said recently. “Jobs help create great financial independence for Nebraskans and their families, giving them the dignity to achieve their dreams,” said the Republican governor, whose family’s estimated $4.5 billion in wealth originated with the creation of online brokerage Ameritrade. Nebraska has about 49,000 job openings listed on a state website and 19,000 working-age residents who are not working. About 4,300 people are receiving unemployment benefits.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Fireworks that were called off last year because of the coronavirus pandemic are returning to the Las Vegas Strip on New Year’s Eve, with a theme pointed toward 2022 – Deuces Wild – and the addition of an eighth hotel-top launching place, tourism and elected officials announced Thursday. “Aside from last year, ‘America’s Party’ has been the culminating event of the entire year for more than 20 years,” said Pat Christenson, president of Las Vegas Events, a nonprofit agency created to produce and support big events. Thousands of revelers still congregated on casino-lined Las Vegas Boulevard last year despite the canceled fireworks. There was no mention during a news conference previewing this year’s event of the possible effect of the emergence and spread in recent weeks of the omicron variant of the virus. Fireworks were first held on the Strip on the last night of 2000. The display has helped make New Year’s Eve one of Las Vegas’ biggest events, drawing more than 300,000 revelers, according to tourism officials, and filling the tourism-dependent city’s more than 250,000 hotel rooms. “Being able to host this event again is so special because it allows us to close out the year in a memorable way,” Christenson said in a statement accompanying Thursday’s announcement.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nGreenland: The town has resoundingly rejected a proposal to ban the use of voting machines and return to counting ballots by hand. Voters in the town of Greenland on Saturday defeated a citizen petition that would have stopped the use of voting machines in all local, state and federal elections. The vote was 1,077 against to 120 in favor of the proposal. Town Clerk Marge Morgan said turnout was higher than expected, and officials had to print more ballots. Greenland has a little over 4,000 residents, according to the 2020 U.S. census. Similar attempts to ban voting machines are under way in Hampton and Kensington, and a bill calling for a statewide ban was filed in the Legislature. Interest in banning the machines grew following an audit of a legislative race in Windham. The audit was requested after a losing Democratic candidate asked for a recount, which showed that Republican candidates got hundreds more votes than were originally counted. The discrepancy drew the attention of former President Donald Trump and his supporters in their effort to find evidence of his wider, unfounded claim of election fraud from 2020. But the audit showed the cause of the discrepancy yielded not from the AccuVote machine but from a separate letter-folding machine used to send out absentee ballots.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Marriage equality may soon be better protected as a bill moves on to votes in the state Senate and Assembly. A 2013 court ruling legalized same-sex marriage in New Jersey, but it has not been cemented in a statute. The New Jersey Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee on Thursday voted almost unanimously to move forward the bill that would codify marriage equality into law. Legislators will consider the bill Monday. If it passes both chambers, it heads to Gov. Phil Murphy for his likely approval. He has vocally supported LGBTQ rights during his tenure. The momentum in Trenton arrives at an important time, said Christian Fuscarino, executive director of Asbury Park-based Garden State Equality. “With a conservative-leaning Supreme Court, we cannot afford to sit by in hopes the justices will leave Obergefell v. Hodges intact,” Fuscarino said, referring to the 2015 ruling that legalized marriage equality at a national level. When marriage equality got the all-clear from New Jersey courts, Amy Quinn and her partner of 10 years, Heather Jensen, were among the first to be wed, exchanging vows on Asbury Park Boardwalk. Nearly a decade later, Quinn is now deputy mayor of Asbury Park, and the fight for marriage equality in New Jersey continues. “I can’t believe we’re still fighting for this, but here we are,” Quinn said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed legislation Friday to redraw the state’s three congressional districts and divide a conservative stronghold into multiple districts over the objections of Republicans. Lujan Grisham, a former three-term congresswoman, said the new congressional map establishes a “reasonable baseline for competitive federal elections, in which no one party or candidate may claim any undue advantage.” Republicans disagree, calling it a power grab by Democrats who have long dominated state politics. “These maps are far from fair representation, and they are a disservice to constituents,” said Steve Pearce, chair of the Republican Party of New Mexico. Consultants to the Legislature say the new congressional map gives Democrats an advantage in all three districts to varying degrees, based on past voting behavior. Republicans need a net gain of five seats in 2022 to take control of the U.S. House and effectively freeze President Joe Biden’s agenda on everything from climate change to the economy. Democrat-backed redistricting plans for the House and Senate also were on their way to the governor’s office Friday after a final House vote. Both plans embrace recommendations from Native American communities for shoring up Indigenous voting blocs in New Mexico’s northwest corner.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Despite soaring COVID-19 case numbers, long testing lines and event cancellations, so far New York City hospitals aren’t seeing a repeat of the surges that swamped emergency rooms early in the pandemic. The state reported Saturday that nearly 22,000 people had tested positive for the coronavirus Friday, eclipsing the previous day’s mark for the highest single-day total for new cases since testing became widely available. More than half the positive results were in the city. The Rockettes on Friday canceled remaining performances of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, citing “increasing challenges from the pandemic,” with lines at some testing sites in the city stretched around the block and at-home tests remaining hard to come by or pricier than usual. But new hospitalizations and deaths – so far – are averaging well below their spring 2020 peak and even where they were this time last year, during a winter wave that came as vaccinations were just beginning, city data shows. Mount Sinai Health System’s emergency rooms are seeing about 20% more patients – with all conditions – in recent days, according to Dr. Eric Legome, who oversees two of the network’s seven ERs. But at least so far, “we’re seeing a lot more treat-and-release” COVID-19 patients than in earlier waves, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state Supreme Court ruled Friday that nonprofit charter schools can’t avoid facing civil fraud claims alleging mismanagement of taxpayer money by arguing they are immune from such lawsuits like a state agency. The justices reversed a 2019 Court of Appeals decision that had dismissed claims against Kinston Charter Academy, which closed abruptly to 190 students and their teachers in 2013. A 2016 lawsuit by then-Attorney General Roy Cooper sought financial damages for the state and monetary penalties against the academy, its CEO and the chair of its board. Charter schools are tuition-free public schools that receive state funds on a per-pupil basis and have more flexibility – with instruction and enrollment among them – than traditional K-12 schools. They are overseen by the State Board of Education. Kinston Charter Academy and leaders were accused by Cooper’s office of violating the state’s False Claims Act and deceptive trade laws. State attorneys allege the school provided a bogus upgraded enrollment estimate to state education officials that meant receiving additional funds, even as leaders knew the school would not last the 2013-14 school year.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is urging the U.S. Supreme Court to reject an appeal by developers of the Dakota Access oil pipeline who are seeking to reinstate a federal permit for the line’s Missouri River crossing. Early this year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed part of a lower court order that revoked the permit and required a new environmental review of the pipeline. “Though the dispute over the pipeline garnered national attention, the D.C. Circuit’s decision plowed no new ground,” lawyers for Standing Rock and other Sioux tribes fighting the pipeline wrote in a brief filed Thursday. The tribes argued that the high court should decline the developer’s petition to hear the case because appeals courts are not split on the issues surrounding the dispute, which can lead to the Supreme Court taking the case. The tribes say the D.C. Circuit judges applied a “conventional” review of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ permitting decisions and “found no abuse of discretion” in the lower court’s order revoking the permit, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The Corps permitted the pipeline’s river crossing, which is just upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and where tribal members fear a leak could occur and harm their water supply.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: More than 1,000 members of the Ohio National Guard have been ordered into hospitals overwhelmed by patients being treated for COVID-19, the vast majority of them unvaccinated, Gov. Mike DeWine announced Friday. The state is also hiring a staffing agency to help recruit nurses from out of state to assist with patient care, DeWine said. “Twenty-two months of this pandemic has taken its toll on our health care workers,” the Republican governor said, recounting stories of short-staffed hospitals needing workers to return for second shifts after only short breaks. Of the Guard members, 150 are medical workers – mainly nurses and EMTs – who will be assigned beginning Monday to hospitals largely in the Akron, Canton and Cleveland areas, which are seeing the highest hospitalization numbers. Most of those hospitals have stopped elective surgeries, and facilities elsewhere are considering the same, the governor said. The remaining Guard members will serve in as-needed hospital roles in other parts of the state. As of Friday, 4,723 Ohioans were hospitalized with COVID-19 – a figure last seen almost a year ago, the governor said. Nine of every 10 of those patients are unvaccinated.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An Oklahoma County grand jury has indicted a top Republican state House leader on multiple felony counts, alleging he misused his power to change state law so his wife could become a tag agent. House Speaker Pro Tempore Terry O’Donnell, the second-highest-ranking member in the chamber, was charged in the indictment Friday with five felonies and three misdemeanors. “He denies any wrongdoing,” said his attorney, Mack Martin. His wife, Teresa O’Donnell, who was also indicted, faces three felonies and one misdemeanor. Court records don’t indicate the name of her attorney. The most severe offense against the couple is conspiracy against the state, which has a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a $25,000 fine. The Catoosa Republican introduced a bill in 2019 that allowed spouses of legislators to serve as tag agents. The Oklahoma Tax Commission appointed his wife to take over the Catoosa Tag Agency on Aug. 1, 2019, three months after Gov. Kevin Stitt signed the bill into law. Terry O’Donnell said last year that his wife had no intention of becoming a tag agent when he sponsored the bill. He said she sought the appointment after her mother died unexpectedly from pancreatic cancer. Her mother, Georgia McAfee, had been in charge of the Catoosa Tag Agency for more than 40 years. Teresa O’Donnell had worked there for more than four years before her appointment. Grand jurors alleged the two submitted a fraudulent application to the Oklahoma Tax Commission.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A weeklong strike is underway, affecting a number of grocery stores across the state less than a week before Christmas Day. The United Food and Commercial Workers Local 555, representing many employees at Fred Meyer and QFC stores, confirmed early Friday morning that it is moving ahead with a walkout at stores in Portland, Bend, Newberg and Klamath Falls, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. The details and specifics of a walkout are complicated. While the UFCW represents roughly 10,000 Fred Meyer employees, not all stores, departments or worker categories are participating in the strike. The union has been in labor negotiations for months with the Kroger-owned supermarket chains. Last weekend, UFCW announced its members had authorized a strike. Union representatives said Fred Meyer has been underpaying certain workers, in violation of contract terms. The grocery chain hasn’t been providing necessary information to the union to refute or verify its concern or to address it through the grievance process, according to the union. Workers are also seeking wage increases. A Fred Meyer statement provided to OPB confirmed that its stores affected by the strike, along with impacted QFC stores, remain open for customers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will no longer impose income taxes on public-sector workers and nurses who receive student loan forgiveness from two major programs, the Wolf administration announced Friday. The change affects participants in the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which provides debt relief to teachers, social workers, military members and other public servants, and the Pennsylvania Student Loan Relief for Nurses Program, a recent pandemic-era initiative to forgive up to $7,500 in student loan debt incurred by state-licensed nurses. Most other states and the federal government do not subject student loan forgiveness to taxation, but Pennsylvania lawmakers who pushed for the change said the state Department of Revenue had considered canceled student loans to be taxable income. That meant that a Pennsylvania resident who owed $50,000 in student loans would be subject to a $1,535 state tax bill once that debt was forgiven. “These people have chosen to serve the public, and often in lower-paying fields, because they want to make a difference. They don’t have thousands of dollars lying around to pay a one-time tax bill. So it’s wrong to take what should be a blessing and turn it into just another burden,” Gov. Tom Wolf said at a news conference Friday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A major theater canceled its performances of “A Christmas Carol” over the weekend because a cast member was dealing with COVID-19 symptoms. The Trinity Repertory Company made the announcement on its Facebook page about half an hour before Saturday’s matinee show. The Providence theater said the unnamed cast member reported feeling sick at home Saturday morning, and the afternoon performance had to be scrubbed because there wasn’t an understudy who could take on the role. The theater said it was canceling the rest of the weekend’s performances out of an abundance of caution. Officials apologized for the abrupt change and said ticket holders would receive a full refund and complimentary access to an online streaming version of the production. “While we never make the decision to cancel a show lightly, our commitment to the health and safety of our artists, staff, and audiences are extremely important to us and made this decision clear,” the theater said in a statement. “A Christmas Carol” runs through Jan. 2 at Trinity Rep. The online streaming version is available until Jan. 16.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFolly Beach: Three young men on a beach vacation dug up a marked loggerhead turtle nest, causing 71 of the 90 eggs not to hatch, wildlife officials said. The men posted video to Snapchat in September of themselves digging up a nest marked with orange tape and signs on Folly Beach, and the Department of Natural Resources said agents were able to track them down. The three men, all under age 21, met with wildlife agents and admitted what they did. In exchange, the agency said it won’t charge them with a count of unlawful taking of loggerhead turtle eggs for each egg, instead agreeing to two counts for each man who was seen digging up the nest and one count for the person who filmed it. The men will face a fine of up to $2,000 on each charge and community service, the agency said in a statement. Wildlife agents will recommend all three men work with the state Marine Turtle Conservation program so they can find out how much work goes into protecting sea turtles in South Carolina. More than 1,300 volunteers along the coast help protect nests. Female sea turtles don’t lay eggs every year, and their nests are vulnerable if not protected on the beaches. Wildlife agents said 2021 overall was a successful year protecting the turtle eggs, with 5,649 nests recorded.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nCuster: Authorities say numerous fire departments worked through the night to put out a fire at a popular 85-year-old lodge in the Black Hills. Two firefighters received minor injuries in the blaze at Sylvan Lake Lodge in Custer State Park. No guests of the multistory hotel were hurt, according to the Custer Volunteer Fire Department. Firefighters discovered a “free-burning fire” when they arrived at the lodge Saturday night, authorities said. They encountered heavy smoke and flames extending to the roof. The stone-and-timber lodge was built in 1937, funded in part through Depression-era New Deal programs. A wing of additional rooms was added in 1991. The original Sylvan Lake Hotel was a stopping point for adventurers looking to climb Black Elk Peak, the highest point in America east of the Rockies, according to the lodge’s website. Alarms initially went off in the southeastern part of the building, authorities said. Freezing temperatures, narrow roads covered with ice and snow, and darkness added to the difficulty of dealing with the blaze. About two dozen agencies responded to the fire. Thirty-one cabins are nearby, all within close access to Sylvan Lake. Authorities asked people to steer clear of the area, where Custer firefighters said on social media that a massive cleanup effort is required.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The future of Second Avenue, ravaged by a bomb blast nearly a year ago, will feature a life-size mural of the street’s historic buildings, expanded sidewalks and a restored tree canopy. Mayor John Cooper revealed details of the first phase of Second Avenue’s reconstruction Wednesday among a crowd of residents, property owners and first responders. The historic avenue was the site of a bombing on Christmas Day 2020 that crumbled 100-year-old facades and severely damaged dozens of businesses and homes. The bomber, Anthony Quinn Warner, was the only person killed in the explosion. The bombing left Nashville with the task of salvaging as much as possible of the core section of Nashville’s original downtown Market Street, literally brick by brick. In the months since, Cooper’s Second Avenue Task Force and numerous community organizations facilitated nine community workshops to collect input from more than 500 residents on how the street should be rebuilt. The first phase will be funded by a $20 million allocation approved Tuesday by the Metro Council as part of Cooper’s $564 million capital spending plan. The plans focus on creating a “more livable streetscape” with widened sidewalks, increased space for outdoor dining and food kiosks, plant life, and public art.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A group of attorneys and advocates have pledged to seek clemency for 110 Black soldiers who were convicted in a mutiny and riots at a military camp in the city in 1917. The South Texas College of Law Houston and the NAACP’s local branch have signed an agreement to continue fighting for clemency for the soldiers of the all-Black Third Battalion of the U.S. Army’s 24th Infantry Regiment, the Houston Chronicle reports. They plan to ask the secretary of the Army to posthumously grant honorable discharges and urge the Army Board for Correction of Military Records to recommend pardons to President Joe Biden. The soldiers were either executed or given long prison sentences. “We are on a quest to obtain justice for the 24th Infantry Regiment … that organized group of men who died with shameful reputations at the hands of those who had the power of the government, the courts and the power of the media,” said Bishop James Dixon, board president of the NAACP Houston Branch. On Aug. 23, 1917, four months after the U.S. had entered World War I, the regiment mutinied in Houston. It resulted in the largest murder trial in U.S. history, with 110 out of 118 soldiers found guilty. Nineteen were hanged. Law enforcement immediately recorded the events as a deadly, premeditated assault by Black Army soldiers on a white population. Historians and advocates now recognize the riot as part of the regiment’s response to what it believed was a white mob heading for them.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A local group is hoping to welcome Afghan refugees to America through playing soccer. Refugee Soccer organizes teams of those who’ve settled in Utah. It gathers equipment and helps place players on mainstream soccer clubs. “Really the mission is to bridge the gap between mainstream and refugee communities,” Executive Director Adam Miles told KSL NewsRadio. Miles is now leading a group of 10 volunteers to a military base in New Mexico after Christmas to play soccer with Afghans who fled the country this summer and are waiting for placement in homes around the country. Miles and his team will head there after Christmas and stay through the first of the year. “Three weeks of concentrated, intense (soccer) clinics, and getting to know these kids and building some relationships,” Miles said. He said soccer allows them to build those relationships. “It’s creating that bridge between people that don’t look like them, don’t speak their language and probably don’t practice their religion but are connecting over the world’s sport – the beautiful game of soccer,” he said. The group also has another big challenge. Miles said many kids fled Afghanistan with nothing. “They fled for their lives … a lot of these kids don’t have shoes.” So Refugee Soccer is trying to collect 500 to 800 pairs of shoes and cleats for the kids to wear.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The mayor says he hopes to double housing production over the next five years as part of an effort to end chronic homelessness in the city. Mayor Miro Weinberger released a 10-point action plan Thursday to fulfill what he calls the “promise of housing as a human right.” “The path to making good on the promise that decent, stable housing is a human right is to build a lot more homes throughout the city and throughout the region,” Weinberger said. “This will require community change and understanding from us all. Our goal should not simply be to reduce homelessness; it must be to end it.” Mychamplainvalley.com reports Weinberger said the number of people in Chittenden County experiencing chronic homelessness has risen from 35 in 2018 to more than 160 now. The mayor’s action plan includes investing $5 million in COVID-19 relief funds to build new, permanently affordable housing. That would include at least $1 million for initiatives to better serve the chronically homeless population. The plan would also set a goal of creating 1,250 new homes by the end of 2026, with a quarter of those permanently affordable.\n\nVirginia\n\nFairfax: Police say four bodies discovered at two different locations in the state are the work of a serial killer who used a shopping cart to transport his victims’ bodies after meeting them on dating sites. At a press conference Friday, Fairfax County Police Chief Kevin Davis dubbed the suspect, 35-year-old Anthony Robinson, of Washington, D.C., the “shopping cart killer” and said police are working to determine if there are other victims. Davis said Robinson, who was taken into custody in Rockingham County last month, has lived in multiple locations, including New York and Maryland, in recent years. Police in Harrisonburg arrested Robinson last month and charged him with two counts of murder after finding two bodies in a vacant lot in the city. “The good thing is he’s in custody. The challenge that remains is identifying other victims,” Davis said. One body found in Fairfax County has not yet been identified. The three victims who have been identified all went missing in the past few months. Police say they are trying to research Robinson’s life going back many years to see if there might be more victims. “That’s what worries us,” Davis said. “He didn’t suddenly turn into who he is three months ago.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Voters have retained socialist City Councilmember Kshama Sawant, a controversial lawmaker and longtime foe of hometown tech giant Amazon. Sawant had faced a recall effort. King County Elections on Friday officially certified the Dec. 7 recall election, showing Sawant narrowly prevailing with 50.4% voting “no” on the recall question and 49.6% people casting “yes” ballots. Sawant, a 48-year-old economics professor, is the longest-tenured councilmember in Seattle. By surviving the recall, she gave a boost to the beleaguered left wing in liberal Seattle, which was bruised in last month’s general election when business-friendly candidates won the mayor’s office and a council seat. Sawant has had an outsized influence on the tone and direction of Seattle politics since she launched her political career under the banner of the Socialist Alternative party in 2012, when she ran unsuccessfully for state representative. Sawant was elected to the City Council the following year, and her threat to run a voter initiative drive for an immediate $15 minimum wage has been credited with pressuring business leaders and then-Mayor Ed Murray to reach a deal raising the wage to $15 over a few years. Seattle was the first major city in the U.S. to adopt such a measure.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nParkersburg: A former city councilor who is charged with breaching the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot has pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts. Eric Barber, 43, admitted to entering the Capitol and stealing a portable charger from a C-SPAN media station during a remote hearing Thursday, the Parkersburg News and Sentinel reports. “When I entered the Capitol building, I knew we weren’t supposed to be there,” he said after the judge asked if the charges were accurate. The criminal complaint alleged photos and security video showed Barber inside the Capitol wearing a green, combat-style helmet and a green, military-style field jacket. It said that video recorded Barber saying, “They’re giving us the building,” and that he took selfies in the Capitol Rotunda. It also claims he stole a portable power station from a C-SPAN media stand. Barber was elected to the Parkersburg City Council in 2016 as a Democrat. He changed his registration to independent a year later, then changed it again to Republican before losing his reelection bid last November. As part of the plea agreement, other misdemeanor counts will be dismissed. Barber’s sentencing was set for March 31.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The city will soon have a change in leadership. The U.S. Senate on Thursday evening confirmed the nomination of Mayor Tom Barrett to become ambassador to the small European country of Luxembourg. Barrett, who was elected mayor in 2004, did not say when he plans to step down. Common Council President Cavalier Johnson will become acting mayor until a special election can be held to fill the remainder of Barrett’s term, which ends in 2024. Johnson is one of seven candidates who have filed papers to run for the permanent position. Others include Milwaukee County Sheriff Earnell Lucas, Ald. Marina Dimitrijevic and former Ald. Bob Donovan. After his nomination was confirmed, Barrett thanked President Joe Biden, who nominated him, and U.S. Sens. Tammy Baldwin and Ron Johnson. “I’m not running from something; I’m running to something,” Barrett said in a virtual press conference after the vote. “And I think we all recognize that there are different chapters in life, and I’m very, very eager now to start this next chapter.”\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Residents south of the town are sounding the alarm over the possibility that dozens of high-end commercial campsites, roads and related infrastructure could be carved into the lower flanks of Munger Mountain. A Wyoming-owned 640-acre section of land that raises money for the state’s school trust account and is exempted from local zoning regulations could host the development. At the direction of legislators seeking to wring more money out of state lands in exorbitantly priced Jackson Hole, the Office of State Lands and Investments has identified the site as a potential moneymaker and plans to issue an open-ended request for proposals, Jason Crowder, the office’s deputy director, told the Jackson Hole News&Guide. That board, which has the final say, consists of five state officials: Gov. Mark Gordon, Secretary of State Ed Buchanan, Auditor Kristi Racines, Treasurer Curt Meier and State Superintendent Jillian Balow. Although a request for proposals was once expected out by September, Crowder is now assigning no time frame for its release. But a luxury “glamour camping” company, Under Canvas, has already expressed an interest in building another of its safari-inspired glamping compounds on the Munger parcel. That the concept is being met with firm resistance.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/02/tumbleweed-trap-norse-pagan-beard-polar-plunge-news-around-states/40929241/", "title": "Tumbleweed trap, Norse pagan beard, polar plunge: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: The mayor says the city is taking corrective action after a police officer’s “inappropriate” social media post that appeared to ridicule homeless people. The Facebook post showed two Mobile Police Department officers holding what the post called a “homeless quilt” made of cardboard signs that apparently had been confiscated from panhandlers around the city, according to media outlet al.com. “Wanna wish everybody in the 4th precinct a Merry Christmas, especially our captain. Hope you enjoy our homeless quilt. Sincerely Panhandler patrol,” the post read. Mayor Sandy Stimpson said Mobile Police Chief Lawrence Battiste has apologized for the post. He said the city is taking corrective steps but did not elaborate.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Gov. Mike Dunleavy has established an eight-member oversight committee to monitor the sale of BP Plc assets in Alaska, officials said. The Republican governor said the panel will oversee the $5.6 billion sale to Hilcorp Energy Co., Alaska’s Energy Desk reports. Texas-based Hilcorp announced plans to buy BP’s Alaska assets in August. The companies expect to finalize the deal next year, giving Hilcorp a major stake in the Prudhoe Bay field and the trans-Alaska pipeline, two major projects in the state’s oil industry. Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Corri Feige will chair the committee that also will include Dunleavy senior policy adviser Brett Huber, according to gubernatorial spokesman Jeff Turner. Six other seats are expected to be filled by five state commissioners and Attorney General Kevin Clarkson or their representatives.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Police shootings in the city plunged over the past year amid increased scrutiny of the department and new policies aimed at controlling use of force. Phoenix officers shot 15 people through Dec. 30 – a dramatic drop from 2018, when police were involved in 44 shootings, half of them fatal. That was the largest number of police shootings for any department nationwide. The police shootings in 2019 are the lowest number in the city of 1.6 million. Community advocates say the improvement is the result of increased scrutiny and new policies. They say Phoenix police still need a civilian review board to increase accountability. The number of shootings across Arizona was also down from 117 in 2018 to about 50 in 2019, based on information from county attorney’s offices statewide. While fewer police shootings occurred in 2019, the shootings were more often deadly: 13 of the 15 resulted in death.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The American Civil Liberties Union and others on Monday asked the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to continue a ban temporarily blocking three state abortion restrictions. Federal Judge Kristine Baker has issued a preliminary injunction to prevent the state from enforcing the restrictions while a lawsuit challenging them is pending. Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge’s office is appealing Baker’s ruling. The laws present “insurmountable obstacles” to a woman seeking an abortion, ACLU attorney Meagan Burrows said in a statement. The laws prohibit the procedure 18 weeks into pregnancy, require that doctors performing abortions be board-certified or board-eligible in obstetrics and gynecology, and prohibit doctors from performing an abortion if it’s being sought because the fetus was diagnosed with Down syndrome.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State regulators said Tuesday that they have streamlined the state’s permit process to make it faster to approve tree-thinning projects designed to slow massive wildfires that have devastated communities in recent years. The state Board of Forestry and Fire Protection approved a vegetation management program based on more than a decade of analysis of the potential environmental damage from removing different types of fuel, ranging from alpine trees to chaparral. That will allow new projects to use the preapproved environmental analyses rather than starting fresh each time to meet the requirements of the California’s strict environmental laws. Gov. Gavin Newsom equated it to the emergency orders he issued nearly a year ago to speed up approval of 35 forest management projects intended to help protect more than 200 communities in high-risk areas.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The city is appealing a court ruling that found its urban camping ban to be unconstitutional. The city filed its notice of appeal Monday in Denver District Court following the Friday ruling by County Judge Johnny C. Barajas. The judge determined that the ban enacted in 2012 constitutes cruel and unusual punishment against the homeless. Barajas’ decision came in a case involving Jerry Burton, a homeless advocate, who had been cited for violating Denver’s ban. The city’s motion Monday seeks a stay of Barajas’ ruling pending appeal. He cited a 2018 decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that struck down a ban on camping in public places in Boise, Idaho. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of that case. Denver voters rejected a ballot measure in May that would have overturned the camping ban.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s foster care system plans to restructure its evaluation process for complaints of abuse or neglect involving school employees, according to department officials. The state Department of Children and Families will form two units starting in mid-January that will solely focus on complaints against school employees, according to Ken Mysogland, the department’s bureau chief of external affairs. Both units will be staffed by five social workers who will report back to supervisors at the department’s headquarters. Each school case will also be reviewed by agency lawyers. Existing personnel will be reassigned to these new units, Mysogland said. No new employees will be hired. Social workers currently have mixed caseloads that include both educational and familial investigations.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The newest member of the state’s Supreme Court is also the first black justice in its history. Delaware State News reports Tamika Montgomery-Reeves is also believed to be the youngest member of the Supreme Court since it was officially established in 1951. Montgomery-Reeves is a native of Mississippi who attended law school in Georgia and now lives in Wilmington. She clerked for William B. Chandler III, head of Delaware’s highly influential Court of Chancery, which handles many of the nation’s business-related cases. She started her career in New York and worked on cases stemming from the financial crisis of the late 2000s. Then she came to Wilmington law firm of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati. A formal investiture for Montgomery-Reeves is scheduled for Friday.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The principal of a D.C. elementary school says a lesson about the Civil War and Reconstruction era went wrong when some fifth graders asked their black classmates to portray slaves. Lafayette Elementary School principal Carrie Broquard detailed the mistake in a letter to parents that explained the learning exercise won’t be offered in the future, The Washington Post reports. Part of the lesson involved students creating a dramatic reading or podcast. “Unfortunately, several students of color were asked by their peers to portray inappropriate and harmful roles,” Broquard wrote. The roles, which were requested by students after they broke into groups, included that of an enslaved person and a person of color drinking from a segregated water fountain, according to letters from the school. Broquard said the students reported being uncomfortable with such casting.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: On the sixth day of Christmas, Baby Jesus vanished from his manger in a popular nativity scene at a park – right under the noses of Mary, Joseph and bowing kings. The disappearance of the replica startled 8-year-old Nate Takacs, who had rushed to get a glimpse of angels and the infant Savior only to find an empty crib at the display at Dorothy B. Oven Park in Tallahassee. Each year the park hosts a well-trafficked and colorful Christmas display. “When I saw the barn and the angels and the kings bowing down, I ran to see what Baby Jesus looks like,” Nate recalled Tuesday. “Why would they take Baby Jesus? It’s a big sin.” He rushed back to his parents, who alerted city officials via Twitter. By Tuesday, a different infant was taken out of storage and placed into the manger.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Although there was no Peach Drop in downtown Atlanta for the first time in decades of New Year’s celebrations, fans can still see the famous peach on display. Fulton County Commission Chairman Robb Pitts voiced his disappointment about the canceled Peach Drop but came up with an alternative plan: displaying the peach in the atrium of the Fulton County Government Center, news outlets report. “This is an iconic symbol,” Pitts said. “We’re inviting the public to come down to see it, touch it, feel it, take pictures in front of it.” Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said in November that the city would ring in 2020 without the Peach Drop, breaking a 30-year tradition. Pitts told news outlets there will definitely be a Peach Drop next year. The peach will be on display through the end of January.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Officials want to deploy a wasp throughout the state to combat another type of wasp that threatens a species of native trees. A biological control plan issued by the state Department of Agriculture and Department of Land & Natural Resources calls for the use of wasps named Aprostocetus nitens, The Maui News reports. Their release would supplement another species that is already protecting wiliwili trees statewide. The black and metallic green Aprostocetus nitens are related to the Eurytoma wasp that defend the trees from a third wasp species. Swollen, tumor-like growths called galls left by Erythrina gall wasps damage and kill thousands of wiliwili, along with other types of trees, officials say. The Eurytoma wasp, called “a gall wasp gladiator” by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was first released in Hawaii in 2008 to destroy the galls. The release of Aprostocetus nitens is needed to provide another layer of defense, state biologists say. Wiliwili in bloom are distinctly Hawaiian, with coral red and salmon-colored flowers. Red wiliwili seeds are valued among Native Hawaiians for making leis and other uses, the state report says.\n\nIdaho\n\nTwin Falls: The state became the latest to signal its willingness to continue accepting refugees for resettlement despite a presidential order giving state and local governments the ability to refuse them. Twin Falls County commissioners unanimously approved accepting refugees after hearing testimony from community members, business owners and church leaders in support of the College of Southern Idaho Refugee Center, The Times-News reports. Republican Gov. Brad Little joined 30 other governors nationwide who have agreed to accept refugees, officials said. “I support the decision of the county government on this matter,” Little wrote in a statement Monday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The state and county actions were in response to the executive order signed by President Donald Trump in September requiring states and localities to express their willingness to allow refugee resettlement programs to operate.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A drive-through car-washing business that opened when Eisenhower was in the White House and tail fins were on stylish coupes has closed its doors after 64 years. Henry Grebler opened Drive-In Car Wash just south of downtown Springfield in 1955, appropriating a now-vintage neon sign from the former In & Out Car Wash that had operated a few blocks away. Grebler modeled the assembly line-like wash business after one he saw in Madison, Wisconsin, The (Springfield) State Journal-Register reports. After heart surgery, he surrendered the business to his son, Peter, in 1972. Peter Grebler, now 81, watched on New Year’s Eve as his last customers pulled away from the business in their sparkling, freshly washed autos. “Forty-seven years is a lifetime,” he said. “I could talk about the economy of the industry and competition, but for me, it’s time. I don’t want to get carried out of here on a gurney with my boots on.”\n\nIndiana\n\nTerre Haute: Indiana State University’s Dreiser Hall is set to undergo an $18.4 million renovation that will replace much of the 70-year-old building’s aging infrastructure. The State Budget Committee recently approved the release of the funds for the renovation after state lawmakers approved the funding during their last session. The project will improve the building’s HVAC and plumbing systems, fire suppression system, and electrical needs and also bring it into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Dreiser Hall’s classrooms will also be upgraded to include state-of-the-art technology to allow individuals statewide to earn a degree at a distance, the Tribune-Star reports. Work on the project should begin around June 1 and take about 16 months to complete, said Diann McKee, ISU’s senior vice president of finance and administration.\n\nIowa\n\nEldon: This tiny southeast Iowa town has been losing population, jobs and business for nearly five decades, but one woman is trying to turn things around with a focus on tourism centered around the community’s famous landmark – the house that served as the backdrop for Grant Wood’s “American Gothic” painting. Donna Jeffrey, 70, is leading a nonprofit that seeks to reinvigorate the town by giving visitors a reason to spend more time and money there after seeing the structure. Eldon formed in 1870 around a railroad depot. The economy grew when it became a stop for the Rock Island Company’s route between Chicago and Los Angeles and a crew change station. But it was after Iowa-born Wood based the background of “American Gothic” on a white-framed house there that the town received international attention. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nKansas\n\nScandia: Authorities say a young bull moose has been spotted twice in north-central Kansas. The Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism said Friday that the moose was captured on a trail camera along the Republic River near the Republic County town of Scandia. The moose was also spotted earlier this month about 20 miles northwest of the town. State wildlife research biologist Matt Peek said then that the spotting was “very rare.” Prior to this month, the last time it happened was when a bull moose wandered into the state in 1989 on its way to Oklahoma.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The city may get a village of about 25 tiny homes meant to house homeless veterans as they undergo a 12-month support program. The founder and president of Veteran’s Club Kentucky started discussing the plan several months ago and expects the $3.5 million project to break ground this spring. Plans include a community center, offices and a spiritual wellness center. A neighborhood meeting will be held before construction begins, Jeremy Harrell said. The project has been supported by the community, city officials and the Louisville VA Medical Center, he said. The architecture firm Luckett & Farley has even agreed to design the project for free, and the land for the project was donated by developer Chris Thienema, a former Louisville mayoral candidate, Harrell said. Donations are still needed to fund the project.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The family of legendary chef Leah Chase, who died last year, is holding a memorial event at the restaurant she once led featuring many of the dishes she made famous. The event will be held Monday, on what would have been her 97th birthday, according to a release from the family. Chase was a civil rights icon and groundbreaking chef who created the city’s first white-tablecloth restaurant for black patrons, broke the city’s segregation laws by seating both white and black customers, and introduced countless tourists to Louisiana Creole cooking. She died June 1, 2019. The event will be held at Dooky Chase’s Restaurant, where she was a constant figure for decades. The event is a fundraiser for the foundation she and her late husband founded in 2013. It will also feature a special art exhibit. Chase was an avid patron of African American artists, and many works she collected are featured in her restaurant.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state’s minimum wage has gone up from $11 to $12 per hour, giving a wage boost to thousands of workers. It marks the fourth annual increase in Maine under a ballot measure approved in 2016 when the state’s minimum was $7.50 an hour. State lawmakers subsequently changed the law to allow restaurants to continue paying tipped workers a lower hourly wage. About 8% of Maine’s 679,000 workers earned at or below minimum wage in 2018, according to available state labor data. Federal labor rules on overtime eligibility also became effective with the new year, lifting the minimum salary for exemption from $23,660 to $35,568 per year for a full-time employee. Maine Labor Commissioner Laura Fortman said her department estimates 1,600 workers will be newly eligible for overtime pay protection.\n\nMaryland\n\nCumberland: A western Maryland zoo where five endangered animals died was ordered by a judge to send its remaining big cats to a sanctuary. Tri-State Zoological Park in Cumberland has seen two tigers, a lion and a lemur die within a three-year span. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sued the zoo in 2017 after conducting undercover inspections. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis sided with PETA on Thursday and said the zoo engaged in “flagrant and persistent violations” of the Endangered Species Act, news outlets report. She ordered the zoo to give up two surviving lions and a tiger. Following a six-day trial in federal court, Xinis wrote that testimony made clear that every animal at the zoo suffered under living conditions there.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A famous seafood restaurant with an odd moniker has announced that it is closing after more than a century in business. The No Name on South Boston’s Fish Pier announced on its Facebook page Monday that it is closing. “We want to thank our generations of customers for all the years of loyal patronage, and for helping make the No Name a landmark location,” management wrote. The restaurant was founded in 1917 by Nick Contos to feed fishermen at the end of the work day, according to the restaurant’s website. He didn’t give his establishment a name, saying, “If it works, leave it alone.” It was run by the Contos family until the end. According to federal court documents, the restaurant was facing financial difficulties, and on Monday it filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: Three businesses that sell recreational marijuana have won the right to begin making home deliveries of pot. The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs says it’s approved home pot deliveries by Lit Provisionary in Evart, Battle Creek Provisioning in Battle Creek and Nature’s Releaf Burton in Burton. Those three businesses are the first approved for adult-use home delivery in Michigan, which on Dec. 1 began allowing sales of recreational marijuana to adults age 21 and over, WOOD-TV reports. The delivery process is similar to medical marijuana delivery. Customers will sign up online and place an order, but they must provide an ID to verify that they are at least 21 years old. Most payments will be made online, but delivery services are allowed to accept cash.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: New estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau show the state’s population growth slowed down slightly in 2019, leaving some concerned Minnesota could lose a congressional seat after the 2020 census. Minnesota’s population grew by about 0.6% last year, or about 33,000 people. That was down slightly from 0.7% the prior year. State demographer Susan Brower tells the Star Tribune she’s less confident Minnesota will keep the seat, but it’s still within reach. Election Data Services, a Virginia consulting firm that studies reapportionment, projects the state will fall about 21,000 to 25,000 people short of keeping the seat. But consultant Kimball Brower says the number of people Minnesota needs to keep its seat is not insurmountable. The state of about 5.6 million outperformed its neighbors. Its annual growth has been about four times the growth in the Midwest region overall in recent years.\n\nMississippi\n\nMeridian: Some military veterans and their caregivers are getting more access to a Navy base. A policy change at Naval Air Station Meridian that’s new for 2020 means approved veterans can apply for authorization to shop at base commissaries and Navy Exchange stores, The Meridian Star reports. They’ll also be able to take part in morale, welfare and recreation programs, including recreational activities such as golf and bowling. Base officials say eligible veterans include Purple Heart recipients, former prisoners of war or veterans with a service-related disability. A key change with the new policy will be more access for disabled veterans, base officials say. “This opens things up for a lot more people to access these services,” base spokeswoman Penny Randall said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The city has sold just four properties under a program launched last year that allows people to buy homes for just $1. St. Louis developed the Dollar House Pilot Program in hopes of selling tax delinquent properties that the city’s Land Reutilization Authority has received and of revitalizing struggling neighborhoods. Under the program, a buyer must have the financial means to renovate the property. The requirements can be hard to meet, considering the condition of the buildings, said Otis Williams, director of the the St. Louis Development Corp., which oversees the Land Reutilization Authority. “Citizens often get a reality check when they go see the houses in person,” he told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “They realize that this is a lot of work for this $1.” Buyers have four months to stabilize the outside to city code and 18 months to obtain occupancy permit. They must then own and occupy the home for at least three years.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Nearly 30 years after losing its second seat in the U.S. House, the state could regain it following the 2020 U.S. census, officials with the Brookings Institution forecast. Montana’s resident population has grown from 989,400 in 2010 to an estimated 1.069 million in July 2019, according to figures released Monday by the U.S. Census Bureau. Montana lost its second U.S. House seat after the 1990 U.S. census and has had just one member in the 435-member body since January 1993. The 2020 census will count residents as of April 1. The Census Bureau will deliver apportionment counts to the president and Congress in December 2020. States will have the information to start redrawing districts, if necessary, by March 31, 2021, the Census Bureau says.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state’s roads saw a deadly rise in fatal crashes in 2019, and leaders say the failure to buckle up was a major factor. The Lincoln Journal Star reports that as of Dec. 27, 249 people had died on Nebraska roads, a 9% increase over the average for the years 2014 through 2018. Nebraska Department of Transportation spokeswoman Jeni Campana says it’s tough to pinpoint the main reason, but the failure to use a seat belt is often a factor. In 2014-18, 69.3% of those killed in passenger vehicle crashes were not wearing a seat belt, according to the department’s data. That’s 25% higher than the national average over the same time period. “It’s absolutely concerning,” AAA spokeswoman Rose White says. She says part of the problem is that Nebraska is among just 16 states that don’t enforce seat belt use as a primary offense.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A Nevada Army Guard soldier serving in Afghanistan has received a uniform religious exception to sport a beard based upon his Norse pagan beliefs. The Nevada Army Guard says Sgt. 1st Class Benjamin Hopper is the first guard soldier to receive a religious accommodation approval for a beard. Norse paganism is a polytheistic religion that is based on ancient beliefs and practices associated with the geographic area of Scandinavia. Hopper, 34, says he has been practicing his Norse pagan faith for about two decades, and his beliefs complement the Army Warrior ethos. He cited documents on the Norse beard that underscore the fact beards are seen as a sacred and defining feature of masculine men. “In short, it is honoring the pillars of heathenism, our ancestors and ancient gods and way of life,” Hopper says.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State authorities are urging hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts to start the year off with a fresh Hike Safe card. Valid for the calendar year, Hike Safe cards exempt holders from certain liability for repaying search-and-rescue costs. They cost $25 for individuals and $35 for families, and the money goes to the Fish and Game Department’s search-and-rescue fund for training and equipment. The department’s conservation officers carried out nearly 200 search-and-rescue missions last year. The cards are available at Fish and Game headquarters in Concord or online.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nElmwood Park: An iconic paper plant that was destroyed in a massive fire last year will soon reopen, according to a top company official. Rob Baron, president and chief executive officer of Marcal Paper, says the plant will be “back in business” this month, though he did not provide a specific opening date. The decision to resume operations was made after Marcal assessed the site and merged with Pennsylvania-based Nittany Paper, a deal Baron said would facilitate Marcal’s conversion of paper into products ready for sale. The company lost 21 paper-converting lines during the Jan. 30 fire, making the merger the “only viable pathway” to restarting operations, Baron said. Officials have said they can’t determine what caused the fire, which did not cause any injuries but put hundreds of people out of work. The fire also destroyed 30 of 36 buildings and Marcal’s iconic red sign.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The U.S. Interior Department has decided not to extend a deadline involving a proposal to divert the Gila River to aid rural communities, a move that cuts off access to more than $50 million in construction funds. U.S. Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., and environmentalists praised the recent decision, saying the river that flows through southwestern New Mexico and into Arizona will be protected. “We cannot sacrifice the Gila – and the benefits it provides to our tourism and outdoor recreation economy – to this project,” Udall said. “I urge all parties involved to move forward to invest in more cost-effective, high-priority community and agricultural water and restoration projects in southwestern New Mexico.” The fight over the Gila has raged for years. Under a 2004 settlement, an entity overseeing the project had faced a deadline last month to have an environmental review completed.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: 2020 began in frigid fanfare for hundreds of people who splashed through the Atlantic Ocean during the annual Coney Island Polar Bear Club Plunge. Swimmers wearing Santa hats and other costumes braved 40-degree temperatures to partake in the New York City tradition. The weather was chillier than last year, when the mercury rose unseasonably high into the upper 50s. The event dates to 1903 and raises money for various charities.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The new year will bring new training requirements for reporting and preventing child sexual abuse and sex trafficking in the state’s schools. The News & Observer reports the training requirements are part of an overhaul of state sexual assault laws. The changes include making it a Class 1 misdemeanor for adults to fail to call authorities if they suspect a child is being abused. The statute of limitations will also be extended for civil suits against abusers. North Carolina is thought to have one of the highest rates of human trafficking in the nation. But there have been only nine human trafficking convictions across the state since 2013. Five involved children. The new law requires all public schools to train employees who work with students to spot warning signs of abuse.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s population has reached a record level, according to new estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. About 762,000 people live in North Dakota, an increase of approximately 4,000 compared to 2018. “We are excited to see that a record number of people are experiencing North Dakota’s exceptional quality of life. Our population growth reflects the abundant opportunities in North Dakota and the strong potential for future economic expansion,” Gov. Doug Burgum said in a statement. Burgum authorized a task force last year to prioritize counting everyone in North Dakota, from the Bakken oilfield to its American Indian reservations to the state’s universities. North Dakota remains the fourth-least-populated state, ranking behind Alaska, Vermont and Wyoming.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A bill would allow judicial candidates in the state to determine whether to list their party affiliation on general election ballots. The bipartisan Ohio House bill that was introduced Friday would go into effect in 2021, Cleveland.com reports. The bill sponsored by Republican Rep. Stephen Hambley and Democratic Rep. Michael Skindell would not affect next year’s state Supreme Court races. If the bill passes, residents would see party affiliations for lower-level judicial races, such as municipal court judge. “Very clearly we have partisan involvement in all elections,” Hambley said. “Judicial candidates can advertise on their literature; they can identify with the party. But they’re just not allowed on the ballot.” The practice of leaving party affiliation off the general ballot is more than 160 years old, and before that the Ohio General Assembly appointed judges.\n\nOklahoma\n\nVinita: The community held a candlelight vigil this week to remember the lives of two girls who went missing more than two decades ago. Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman were 16 years old when they disappeared. About 200 people attended a vigil Monday night and remembered the girls with a slideshow, songs, prayers, speeches and a balloon release, the Tulsa World reports. Lauria was spending the night at Ashley’s family home in Craig County after celebrating Ashley’s birthday. Investigators believe that in the early hours of Dec. 30, 1999, Ashley’s parents, Danny and Kathy Freeman, were killed, and their home was set on fire. Ashley and Lauria have never been found. Ronnie Busick, a suspect in the slayings of the parents and the kidnapping and presumed deaths of the teens, is in the county jail. Busick is slated to come back to court in February.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city is working to clean up and contain an oil sheen on the Columbia Slough caused by illegal dumping. The Portland Bureau of Environmental Services says containers with a mixture of oil and gas discovered around midnight Sunday were dumped on the roadway above the slough near Alderwood Road. City contractors placed booms in the water to contain and absorb the fluid. Environmental Services advises people recreating on the slough to avoid the immediate area around the NE Glass Plant Road bridge. Each container holds a maximum of 275 gallons, but only a fraction of that amount is believed to have reached the slough. Portland Fire & Rescue and Portland Bureau of Transportation managed the initial response and cleaned up the residue on the roadway. Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call Environmental Services’ spill response hotline at 503-823-7180.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Homicides in the city hit a 20-year low in 2019, with 37 killings, according to data from police and the Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office. That’s down from the 52 homicides reported in 2018 and ties the number of homicides in 1998, The Tribune-Review reports. All but four of last year’s victims were men, and all but three were shot to death. Five victims were children. Homicides in Pittsburgh have been decreasing since a spike in 2014, when the city saw 70 homicides., the paper said. Surrounding Allegheny County had 59 homicides last year.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Police say a new red flag law has likely helped to prevent tragedies. Since the red flag law took effect in June 2018, police across the state have invoked it 33 times as of Oct. 31, according to a newspaper’s analysis. “Although the impact of the law is difficult to measure since it is preventative in nature, I believe that the removal of firearms and prevention of future purchases of firearms from individuals in Cranston, where extreme risk protection orders were granted by the court, likely averted potential tragedies,” Cranston Police Chief Michael Winquist told the Providence Journal. The red flag law allows law enforcement officials to file for an order to take guns away from people deemed to be imminent threats to themselves or others.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nClemson: Three fraternities at Clemson University were placed on disciplinary probation for violating the university’s code of conduct, according to a university report. Delta Chi, Phi Delta Theta and Chi Phi were investigated following accusations of harsh new member processes. The university’s report lists misconduct investigations involving alcohol, drugs, sexual assault, physical assaults and hazing. Chi Phi is on probation until May 31, 2020. The report says fraternity members forced new members to consume alcohol after joining the chapter Sept. 13. Phi Delta Theta is also on probation until May 31, 2020, for not being “forthcoming” during an investigation into a Sept. 20 incident, the report says. Delta Chi is on probation until Dec. 31, 2021, for forcing new members into “personal servitude” during an Oct. 16 incident, which is a form of hazing, the report says.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem says the storms, tornadoes and flooding that devastated communities across the state provided one of the biggest challenges she faced in her first year in office, in a wide-ranging interview in which she also promised to focus on growing the economy and improving her working relationship with lawmakers in the new year. The first-term Republican governor called it “a difficult year, all in all, for the state” due to flooding that strained state resources and had her administration working overtime and traveling thousands of miles to respond to disasters. Noem said she had successes, naming her work to encourage foster families, address drug addiction and spread broadband internet access in rural areas. And she also called herself “teachable,” a nod to some lawmakers who said she failed to communicate well on some policy decisions.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A new passport will let tourists check off their visits to 22 of the state’s most iconic country music destinations. The state Department of Tourist Development will be including the Country Music Passport in an insert in the 2020 Tennessee Vacation Guide to be released Jan. 8. The passports are also now available at Tennessee’s 16 welcome centers. The initiative focuses on country music locations featured in Ken Burns’ latest PBS documentary on the music genre. Limited prizes will be offered for participants who make it to five, 15 or 22 of the sites, including a custom Hatch Show Print and the “Ken Burns Country Music: An Illustrated History” book with the first 100 signed by Ken Burns and author Dayton Duncan. A branded Tennessee Music Pathways guitar is available for visiting all 22 sites. Stops include the Birthplace of Country Music Museum in Bristol, the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Loretta Lynn’s Ranch in Hurricane Mills and Memphis’ Sun Studios.\n\nTexas\n\nGoliad: Benny Martinez, a Mexican American civil rights leader who helped organize the historic Latino meeting with President John F. Kennedy, died Sunday. His daughter Loretta Martinez Williams said Martinez died peacefully of natural causes in Olmito, Texas, following a long bout with several illnesses. He was 85. Born in Goliad, Martinez went to segregated schools before his father moved the family to Houston so his sons “wouldn’t have to pick cotton for a living.” After serving 18 months as a medic in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, Martinez returned to Houston and organized boycotts against businesses that refused to hire Mexican Americans. He later joined the League of United Latin American Citizens, then the nation’s largest civil rights organization for Latinos, and raised money for Mexican Americans to pay their Texas “poll taxes” so they could vote.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state issued several hundred film permits in 2019, which officials say made for a busy year. Nearly two dozen productions received film incentives, including for feature films, television series and documentaries, the Utah Film Commission said. The state currently offers up to a 25% tax credit or cash rebate on money spent by productions in the state, with the program capped at about $8 million each year. Among the productions filmed in Utah last year are Disney’s “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series,” which will film a second season in the state this year. Two films shot in Utah will premiere at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival, “The Killing of Two Lovers” and “Nine Days.” The Utah Film Commission says it issued 780 film permits this year. Productions across the state created more than 1,500 local jobs. The commission estimated spending in the state at $59 million in 2019.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Johnsbury: Work is set to begin in earnest this year with the renovation of a downtown housing project. The Depot Square apartment building will be reborn as the New Avenue Apartments. The $8 million renovation plans call for 40 apartments, and the first floor of the building will become commercial space. The Burlington-based nonprofit Housing Vermont bought the building more than a year ago from an out-of-state developer, using nearly $1 million in state funds contributed by the town. The Caledonian Record reports the final occupants of the current building are in the process of moving out. “We plan to start asbestos abatement work in mid-January,” Housing Vermont Vice President Kathy Beyer said. A huge trash container at the back side of the building has been filling up with dozens of old appliances and other large items.\n\nVirginia\n\nSuffolk: Online retail giant Amazon has bought 87 acres of land in southeastern Virginia. But the company isn’t revealing why. The Virginian-Pilot reports the company bought the land last month in Suffolk. The city is near the Port of Virginia and already home to many warehouses that store coffee from other countries. Amazon spokeswoman Rachael Lighty confirmed the land purchase to the Pilot but would not provide details on its plans for the property. She said Amazon has a policy of “not commenting on our future road map.” She said that “the purchase in Suffolk provides us with the flexibility to quickly respond to our future network needs.” The newspaper reported in July that Amazon could be planning to build a $200 million multistory fulfillment center.\n\nWashington\n\nWest Richland: Some people spent part of their New Year’s Eve trapped on a state highway after tumbleweeds blocked their route, authorities say. YakTriNews reports the Washington State Patrol announced via Twitter about 6:30 p.m. that State Route 240 was closed in both directions near West Richland. Trooper Sarah Clasen told KAPP-KVEW that vehicles were trapped in a pile of tumbleweeds that stood up to 15 feet tall. The state Department of Transportation used snow plows to clear the scene. Trooper Chris Thorson said it took about 10 hours to clear the road, which opened again about 4:30 a.m. Wednesday. Thorson says five cars and one 18-wheeler were trapped in the tumbleweeds. No injuries were reported. “People were still stuck at midnight and rung in the new year trapped under the weeds,” Thorson said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: West Virginia University’s chief of obesity medicine is investigating how best to help the state’s primary care providers treat their obese patients. “Weight loss used to be designated to commercial programs, like stores selling diet products,” Dr. Laura Davisson told The Herald-Dispatch. “Now, providers are realizing the health care field needs to get involved.” To that end, Davisson is developing a survey to assess the needs of those providers. She estimates the assessment will be ready for distribution by spring and hopes to have results analyzed by the fall. After that, she’ll be working to develop an educational outreach program for the state. Ideas include sharing information at annual Continuing Medical Education meetings, offering immersion courses in Morgantown, and providing help online through e-consultations or webinars.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Some of the state’s fire departments have stopped using firefighting foam that contains a group of man-made chemicals that have been linked to increased cholesterol and cancer risk, among other health hazards. The per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances contaminate Wisconsin’s groundwater and waterways and are also found in products like nonstick pans, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. In mid-December, the Madison Fire Department switched to fluorine-free foam. “I don’t feel safe with our firefighters being exposed to those products,” Madison Fire Chief Steven Davis said. Davis also has environmental concerns. After the American Transmission Co. substation fire in Madison in July, large amounts of chemicals were found in stormwater runoff, he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State wildlife officials have opened hunting applications for six different big game species and wild turkey. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department is opening applications Thursday for elk, deer, antelope, spring turkey, moose, sheep and mountain goat, the Rocket-Miner reports. The first deadline is Jan. 31 for resident and nonresident spring turkey hunters and nonresident elk hunters, department officials say. All applications must be submitted online. Nonresident elk hunters now have until May 8 to modify or withdraw their applications but must still submit by the end of January, officials say. Tentative season information for elk, deer and antelope would not be listed in the application packet but is expected to be available for moose, sheep and mountain goats, department officials say.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/29/heat-relief-tiny-veterans-homes-unearthed-bones-news-around-states/117294388/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nSelma: Preservation work has begun on the historic Brown Chapel AME Church, the 113-year-old church that played a pivotal role in the fight for voting rights. Gov. Kay Ivey, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell and other officials attended the groundbreaking ceremony Thursday in Selma, The Selma Times-Journal reported. The National Park Service has provided a $1.3 million grant for the church’s restorations and repairs. Brown Chapel was built in 1908. The restoration work will include electrical work, roof work and cupola repairs. Sewell said the grant will “ensure that America’s story lives on.” The church and its members played key roles in the marches that helped lead to the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The church was the site of preparations for a 1965 march that became known as Bloody Sunday after marchers were beaten on Selma’s Edmund Pettus Bridge. The event galvanized support for the passage of the Voting Rights Act. The church was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997, and it is still in use today. “The love of Brown Chapel AME Church will forever be shared by our state to the world, to be a representative of doing the right thing even when it can be dangerous,” Ivey said\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: If people want to testify at city council meetings in Soldotna, they will have to do it in person from now on. The council decided last week it would end the city’s use of Zoom conferencing, the Peninsula Clarion reported. Like many governmental bodies, the city began using Zoom as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Soldotna paid just over $3,000 for a Zoom subscription, which included a video webinar that could host up to 500 participants. The City of Seward said in April it would no longer offer Zoom for meetings, but the City of Kenai and the Kenai Peninsula Borough still use Zoom. In a memo to the city council, Soldotna Mayor Paul Whitney said the need for video conferencing had decreased. Whitney also said during last week’s meeting that the council will return to regular seating.\n\nArizona\n\nLake Havasu City: An Arizona State University nursing program, set to debut at the school’s Lake Havasu City campus this fall, seeks to put a dent in the state’s nursing shortage. ASU Havasu, which is still a young campus at 9 years old, got approval in April from the Arizona Board of Nursing to offer a 12-month bachelor’s of science degree in nursing. The program is expected to draw more than 30 new students, the Today’s News-Herald reported. Anita Harger, the chief human resources officer at Kingman Regional Medical Center, said she has never seen such a dearth of nurses in her 30-year career. It’s a worry for most hospital administrators across the region, she added. Hospitals in rural areas also find it hard to compete with regional hospitals or private medical practices. Amanda Goodman, a spokeswoman for Arizona State University’s Edson College, is hopeful the class of future nurses will consider planting roots. Nurses who get their education in rural areas are likelier to stay in there after graduation.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture Cooperative Extension Service recently issued a notice on Japanese beetles. Looking like miniature June bugs, Japanese beetles are becoming an annual nuisance. Nearly every year, about mid-June, adults appear, feeding on various ornamental plants. In the landscape, that’s most often roses, crape myrtles, hollyhocks and several others, but they will take advantage of whatever they can get. Large populations will defoliate plants seemingly overnight. Adults can be controlled with malathion, carbaryl (Sevin) and pyrethrin. The better option might be to try to control the grub stage of the beetles that will occur next year. After this year’s adults feed, they will lay eggs that will hatch this fall and over the winter as white grubs in the soil. This is often in the lawn near the host plants that the adults feed on. Because the newly hatched grubs feed on grass roots, applying a lawn grub control product, such as GrubX, that contains the active ingredient imidacloprid in late June and into July will control the grubs and break their life cycle. For information, call (870) 425-2335.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Delta is now the variant of the coronavirus identified third-most often in California, according to new data – underscoring that the variant is highly contagious, a danger to people who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19. The Delta variant now makes up 14.5% of California coronavirus cases analyzed in June, up from 4.7% in May, when it was the fourth-most-identified variant in California, according to data released by the California Department of Public Health. Experts said the Delta variant poses a greater chance of infection for unvaccinated people if they are exposed to this version of the virus. The variant, first identified in India, might be twice as transmissible as the conventional coronavirus strains. The Delta variant has been responsible for the rise in cases recently in India, the United Kingdom and elsewhere. But vaccinated people are well-protected against infection and illness from the Delta variant. One recent study found that the full course of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (two doses) was 88% effective against symptomatic disease caused by the Delta variant and 96% protective against hospitalization. There is no widespread scientific consensus on whether the Delta variant is more likely to cause more serious illness than other conventional strains. Delta’s rise comes as California’s currently dominant strain, Alpha, first identified in the United Kingdom, might have peaked.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Easing the notorious rush-hour gridlock on Interstate 25 south of Denver will require controlling thousands of motorists’ access to the highway with fraction-of-a-second precision never before seen in Colorado. It’s why in the next few weeks, state transportation officials will launch the Smart 25 Managed Motorways Pilot Program, using what’s called “coordinated ramp metering” on a 14-mile stretch of northbound I-25 between University Boulevard in Denver and Ridgegate Parkway in Lone Tree. Many entrance ramps on metro Denver highways have traffic lights to control traffic flow but they aren’t programmed to respond to real-time conditions. By making constant and minute changes to the length of time cars wait on entrance ramps before merging onto the highway, traffic engineers believe slowdowns and logjams can be greatly reduced – or avoided altogether. The proof, according to Colorado Department of Transportation Smart 25 Project Manager Zach Miller, resides nearly 8,800 miles away in Melbourne, Australia. “Australia has figured out how to use algorithms to resolve complex traffic problems to prevent congestion,” Miller said. “I am hopeful this technique can be beneficial to CDOT as well.” What Australia’s second-largest city found after implementing its coordinated ramp metering program on a stretch of the M1 freeway a decade ago is impressive: The number of vehicles getting through increased by 25% during peak commuting periods, travel speeds improved 35% to 60% during peak periods and crashes went down by 20% to 50%.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Opioid deaths spiked in Connecticut during the pandemic and continue to increase in 2021, fueled by continued disruptions to recovery programs and a deadly, fentanyl-laced drug supply. The synthetic opioid fentanyl, which is 80 to 100 times more powerful than morphine, was found in 4% of accidental intoxication deaths in the state in 2012 but showed up in the vast majority of fatal overdoses last year, the Hartford Courant reported. The isolation brought on by the pandemic led to more drug use, more emergency room visits and more overdoses. The state Department of Public Health reported the number of overdose deaths in the first three months of 2021 was higher than the same period in 2019 and 2020. Some recovery programs stopped offering treatment or support groups, exacerbating the difficulties.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:U.S. Sen. Tom Carper revealed recently that he was sending his old minivan out to pasture, opting for a much younger and sportier red Model Y Tesla, which has all-wheel drive, 20-inch induction wheels and an all-black interior. Nothing lasts forever. Not even a 2001 Chrysler Town & Country minivan. In all, the Silver Bullet logged an estimated 535,000 miles. “Whether it’s your first car or some other car, I think everybody has a vehicle for which they had just a real attachment, a lot of affection or maybe even just gratitude because of what it carried them through,” Carper said. The reach of Carper alumni is vast in Delaware politics. Many are now high-ranking communication aides or elected and appointed officials. Upon hearing the news, former drivers, who consider themselves to be a part of an unofficial fraternity, immediately texted one another. The thought of getting lost while driving the van or it breaking down on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge still makes some break out in a sweat. “It’s the most famous prop in Delaware history, right?” joked Mat Marshall, a former driver who estimated he drove miles 340,000 to 390,000.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Mayor Muriel Bowser said that all DMV service centers will return to walk-in service starting July 19, WUSA-TV reported. DMV officials said that they will honor all appointments made through July 7, but none will be available after that date. In addition, two DMV locations will have special weekend hours to accommodate residents. In-person service becomes available on a first-come, first-serve basis at Adjudication Services starting July 19 and at all DMV Service Centers starting July 20, Bowser said in a release. “As DC DMV transitions away from ‘appointment only’ service, the agency notes that residents can still make appointments for any available or canceled appointments through July 17,” Bowser said. Scheduling road tests for commercial and noncommercial driver’s licenses will remain by appointment only, Bowser said. Additionally, the mayor states that D.C. residents can take advantage of “special weekend hours” for in-person services at the DMV’s 95 M Street SW location and Inspection Station between 8:15 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday, July 11 and July 18.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis said Florida is sending 50 state law enforcement officers to Texas to help enforce the U.S.-Mexico border, though it remains unknown what their mission will be and who will be paying for the effort. “We are unable to share mission specifics at this time to protect the security of the missions they are working,” said Katie Strickland, a spokeswoman for the governor. DeSantis said funding the mission has also not been determined. “That is still a point of discussion,” DeSantis said. “Typically, if someone would help us, you know, we would pick up some of their funding and so that is how we would hope that it goes. But we do not anticipate getting any federal funds.” DeSantis’ focus on the U.S. border comes as Republicans across the country are using immigration to attack the Biden administration. As part of that effort, former President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the U.S. border Wednesday with about a dozen House Republicans. The governor, who is positioning himself for reelection in 2022 and is widely believed to be considering a run for the White House, said Friday that he might try to make a trip to the U.S. border himself.\n\nGeorgia\n\nClarkston: Researchers at Georgia State University will use a $500,000 grant to try to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates among refugees and other groups in Clarkston – one of the largest refugee resettlement communities in the U.S., the university announced. The money from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will help train and deploy six outreach workers to address residents’ concerns about COVID-19 vaccines and encourage them to get vaccinated. The workers will represent major refugee groups living in Clarkston, including the Burmese, Congolese, Afghan and Somali communities, as well as the African American community, the university said in a news release. The school plans to use workers who are known and trusted in their respective communities and send them out within a month, Michael Eriksen, a public health professor at Georgia State who is leading the effort, said. Thousands of refugees live in the Clarkston area.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Health care professionals who care for the medical needs of homeless in Honolulu’s Chinatown neighborhood will be expanding their efforts to other parts of Oahu with a new mobile clinic. Starting in July, the team led by Christina M.B. Wang, of the Hawaii Health & Harm Reduction Center, will take a Nissan van to help homeless people across the Haleiwa and Waianae small boat harbors. They will also go to Central Oahu, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. Nessa Vierra, 60, has received COVID-19 vaccinations, a cellphone, bandage kits and repeated offers of help from a walking team in Chinatown. She called the center’s medical mobile outreach across Oahu “one of the greatest things to happen. That’s perfect.” Vierra spends time in her regular spot at River and Pauahi streets, along with dozens of her friends who have been treated by Wang’s team over the years. The van was purchased through a grant from the state Department of Health.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Boise Police Department said 28 people were sickened when an unidentified chemical was spilled at a popular Boise public pool on Friday afternoon. Fourteen people were hospitalized after the exposure, but officials said none of the injuries was life-threatening. Boise Fire Division Chief Paul Roberts said the chemical was “pool-related” and the spill happened at a maintenance building while a commercial truck was filling tanks at the site. Hazardous materials crews were sent to the pool about 1 p.m., and authorities warned people in the neighborhood to “shelter in place” for a few hours because of the risk of respiratory injuries. About 28 people who were at or near the pool reported symptoms, police said. Eleven were treated at the scene and 14 were taken to area hospitals for treatment. Officials were still investigating what chemicals were involved in the spill.\n\nIllinois\n\nGlencoe: A famed horticultural park north of Chicago that has been free to attend for a half-century is about to charge patrons. Starting in January, the Chicago Botanic Garden in Glencoe will start charging visitors on a sliding scale, between about $10 to $26. Jean Franczyk, the garden’s president and CEO, said the decision to charge admission was driven by popularity of the park that before the pandemic drew more than a million visitors a year. “We did a lot of modeling and anticipating and said, ‘OK, how are we going to maintain the quality of programs?’ ” she told the Chicago Tribune. “How are we going to keep up with ongoing maintenance? How are we going to meet this audience demand? And we landed on: One of the things that we could do was revise our admissions policy.” Visitors will catch a break because the cost to park will drop from $20-$30 to $8. And visitors can save money if they plan ahead or visit at times less popular than spring weekends. For example, what the park calls “plan-ahead pricing” means it will cost $9.95 for many days every year. Also, the park will add 52 free days a year.\n\nIndiana\n\nColumbus: Unearthed bones recently discovered at a construction site in south central Indiana are believed to be thousands of years old, according to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Construction workers found the human remains in May while digging at the site of a new Bartholomew County judicial building in Columbus, The Republic reported. Archaeologists from the University of Indianapolis analyzed the bones, determining them to be between 2,000 and 3,000 years old. The bones belong to an adult male, a preteen and an infant, according to the DNR. The bones are thought to be the bones of Native American people of the Adena culture, which existed in the Ohio River Valley as far back as 1000 B.C. The human bones were found roughly 6 feet deep and mixed with animal bones. A different settlement was also found about 2 feet from the surface, consisting of glass, nails and other artifacts dating to the late 1800s or early 1900s. After archaeologists conclude their analysis, the remains will be turned over to Native American tribes for reburial, the DNR said. The county building is still set to open in April 2022, but a monitor will be onsite to oversee further construction to ensure any additional human remains discovered are handled properly.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Falls: The University of Northern Iowa has received its third and largest allotment of federal COVID-19 relief funding, which will provide additional financial assistance to qualifying students impacted by the pandemic during the fall 2021 and spring 2022 semesters. The $10.7 million provided to UNI as part of the American Rescue Plan and Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund III is the most recent round of funding the university has received for its students since the beginning of the pandemic. The university previously distributed more than $7. million in federal funding to students who showed exceptional need because of COVID-19. Undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in the fall semester may be eligible for a portion of the new funding. In order to qualify, students must fill out a 2021-22 FAFSA, which the university is using to help determine individual need. Students who are referred to the office of financial aid and scholarships for HEERF III funding, yet do not meet FAFSA eligibility criteria, will have their applications considered on a case-by-case basis. The award amount will likely range from $1,250 to $1,750 per eligible student. The funding will be made available to qualifying students starting in mid-September. Additional awards are anticipated for the spring semester and will be provided based on remaining available funds.\n\nKansas\n\nLarned: A man has been charged with arson after a large U.S. flag was burned outside a business in Larned, Pawnee County Attorney Douglas McNett said. Jason Wayne Cauble, 37, of Larned was arrested Tuesday. He made his first court appearance Thursday on the felony arson charge, McNett said in a news release. Investigators said the 30-by-20-foot flag was burned in April at the Carr Auction and Realty Inc. building in Larned. McNett said that people who burn their own flags are protected by First Amendment free speech rights but arson can be charged when another person’s property is burned. He said he didn’t have information on Cauble’s possible motive. Cauble remains jailed on $15,000 bond. His preliminary hearing was scheduled for July 8.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:Army 1st Sgt. Michael Miller pulled off a surprise reunion with his family Sunday with the help of the Louisville Bats minor-league baseball team. Miller’s children and other family members were at the game to throw out the ceremonial first pitch, only to find out their loved one was behind the plate after he took off a catcher’s helmet. The family sprinted to Miller as soon as they recognized him and shared a long group hug to applause and cheers from the crowd at Slugger Field. Miller had been on deployments since 2017, the Bats said. Gov. Andy Beshear’s son, Will, also threw out a ceremonial pitch at Sunday’s game, and Beshear shared a photo of himself with the Millers on social media.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge:Legislation that would have allowed adults to carry concealed firearms without a permit in Louisiana was vetoed by Gov. John Bel Edwards. In a statement from Baton Rouge, Edwards said he strongly supports Second Amendment rights. “But I simply cannot support carrying a concealed carry firearm without proper education and safety training – and I believe the majority of Louisianans agree with me,” Edwards said. He added that anyone carrying a concealed firearm should have “basic marksmanship and safety training.” The bill by Monroe Republican Sen. Jay Morris passed 73-28 in the House and 27-9 in the Senate – wide enough margins to override a veto. But the Legislature is not in session. To consider overriding the veto, members of each chamber would have to agree to hold an unprecedented veto session in July. Pressure for such a session has been building since Edwards vetoed legislation prohibiting transgender athletes from competing on girls’ sports teams in Louisiana schools. Under Louisiana’s constitution, a veto session is automatically scheduled when a governor vetoes legislation. However, a majority vote of either the House or Senate can scrap the gathering. Lawmakers have never held a veto session since the current Louisiana Constitution was adopted in 1974.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The federal government has given Maine a $7 million boost to help prepare for another public health crisis. Republican Sen. Susan Collins and independent Sen. Angus King said the Maine Department of Health and Human Services has received the money from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About $1.8 million is for preventing and controlling emerging diseases and the rest is for preparing and responding to public health emergencies. The senators said the state “must not lose sight of other public health initiatives that protect the health and safety of the community” while it continues responding to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:A plane crashed into Assawoman Bay near the Ocean City airport on Sunday afternoon, according to the fire department. Maryland State Police reported that the plane, which was piloted by Matthew Cortigiani of Utah, went off the runway and into the water shortly before 2 p.m. Cortigiani reported smoke in the cabin as he attempted to shut down the plane’s engine. He then proceeded to try and land the plane at the airport; but it went off the runway and into the bay. An Ocean City Fire Department official confirmed five individuals were on board but suffered no significant injuries and were placed on civilian vessels. One of the occupants was transported to TidalHealth Peninsula Regional for treatment of injuries. Maryland Department of Natural Resource Police and the U.S. Coast Guard also responded to the scene and assisted. The Worcester County Bureau of Investigations and the Federal Aviation Administration are investigating the incident.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Massachusetts Senate has approved legislation designed to create a more secure egg supply chain and raise the state’s farm animal welfare standards to be on a par with other states. The bill would upgrade Massachusetts’ egg production law – created by a successful 2016 ballot question – to create predictability and certainty by mirroring even stronger national United Egg Producers cage-free guidelines. Supporters of the bill said those guidelines have been adopted by leading retailers, producers, and other states. Massachusetts voters in 2016 overwhelmingly passed what at the time was the strongest law for farm animals in U.S. history, known as Question 3. Since then, retailers, producers, and other states mandated even stronger standards in the shift to cage-free conditions for hens. The legislation passed by the Senate updates existing state law to meet the new standards. The bill has the backing of the animal welfare groups that supported the 2016 ballot question. The bill now heads to the Massachusetts House of Representatives\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit:Residents in the Detroit area were cleaning up Sunday after flooding in the area overloaded sewer systems, damaged homes and knocked out power for thousands. Bags of trash lined neighborhood streets in suburban Grosse Pointe Farms as garbage trucks made special rounds to help pick up debris, including damaged furniture and bedding. A day earlier, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office declared a state of emergency for Detroit and surrounding Wayne County after daylong rain flooded freeways and streets. Health officials warned of hazardous conditions Sunday amid cleanup efforts and cautioned residents to stay out of flood waters. The Port Austin area on Michigan’s Thumb was also reeling from storm damage, including a suspected tornado Saturday night. There were reports of a badly damaged home, scattered trees and downed power lines, but no major injuries. DTE Energy said roughly 22,000 customers remained without power Sunday. Indiana Michigan Power said crews were also were restoring power for thousands in Michigan and northern Indiana. More than 6 inches of rain fell Friday in parts of the Detroit area, overloading sewer systems. Some streets were completely flooded, and low-lying sections of freeways saw water deep enough to cover car tires and hoods.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Authorities are bracing for an extended wildfire season, saying the typical summer reprieve is looking more and more unlikely. Wildfires are typically at their worst in the spring and fall, slowing in the summer when trees and plants are fully green and rain increases. But more than half of the state is experiencing drought conditions and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expects dry weather to continue through the summer. More wildfires had broken out across the state by mid-June than in all of last year. The state typically has fewer than 1,200 wildfires a year, burning roughly 39 square miles, the Star Tribune reported. So far, more than 1,425 fires have burned nearly 55,000 square miles of forest and grassland, according to the Department of Natural Resources\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: The city has received more evidence that its economic outlook is returning to pre-pandemic levels. April’s sales tax collection numbers reported by Mississippi’s Department of Revenue and the city saw a new record set with $1,089,614. The city’s stadium tax for food and beverage and the tourism tax for hotels and motels also increased, The Oxford Eagle reported. The numbers are reported on a two-month delay. The sales tax was 3% higher than March’s revenue and 79% higher than April 2020, which was the first full month of the COVID-19 pandemic, when most businesses were closed or had operations greatly scaled down because of health restrictions. In April 2019, Oxford collected $856,149 in sales tax, which was $233,465 less than this year. The food and beverage tax collected $387,876 in April, a 2% increase from March and 79% higher than April 2020. The tourism tax collected was $48,215 in April, up 34% from March and 347% from April 2020.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Missouri’s rivers are rising, and with heavy rain possible through most of the week, parts of the state are under flood warnings and flash-flood watches. Minor flooding was happening Monday at several points on the Missouri River. Damage was minimal, though several roads and streets were under water. The Mississippi River was nearing technical flood stage from St. Louis south through Cape Girardeau, with crests expected early this week. The rising rivers followed heavy weekend rain – some areas got up to 10 inches of rain. One person died and two others were rescued Saturday when their vehicle became stuck in floodwaters in Clinton County. Forecasts call for occasional storms through at least Thursday in much of the state.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Legislation aiming to protect businesses from COVID-19 restrictions imposed by local authorities was signed into law by Gov. Greg Gianforte more than a month ago, but across the state, elected officials, public health officers and attorneys are left with wildly different interpretations of what the new law does. In Bozeman, officials said they will be taking a more hands-off approach to everything from food safety regulations to sanitation requirements at local businesses, as they come to grips with a new law they believe has gutted their ability to enforce even the most basic health rules, the Montana State News Bureau reported. House Bill 257 was part of a stack of bills brought by Republicans during the recent session to address what they saw as overreach by public health officials during the pandemic. The relatively complex measure mainly sought to shield businesses from mask mandates and other instances in which local government comes between them and their customers. The legislation alters the sections of state law dealing with the powers of counties and municipalities to enact ordinances and resolutions. It prevents those actions from denying customers “the ability to access goods or services” or requiring businesses to do so. And in the part of state law dealing with local health board authority, it adds that same prohibition to regulations dealing with communicable diseases that apply to an entire jurisdiction.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Health officials are continuing to work to persuade residents of rural parts of the state, where coronavirus vaccination rates remain low, to get their shots. The Omaha World-Herald reported that vaccination rates in the state’s rural counties tend to lag far behind the rates in the state’s urban counties, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only about 40% of the adults in rural parts of Nebraska are fully vaccinated compared with more than 60% of those living in the state’s metropolitan areas. The state’s most populous counties have some of the highest vaccination rates: Lancaster County has 63% of its adults fully vaccinated, followed by Douglas at 62% and Sarpy at 58%. But 11 of the state’s rural counties have vaccination rates below 25%, including McPherson at 11%, Grant and Logan at 16% and Arthur at 17%. As part of the effort to reach rural areas. two top officials at the state Department of Health and Human Services plan to participate in a forum held by the Center for Rural Affairs on Tuesday. The agency’s CEO Dannette Smith and Chief Medical Officer Gary Anthone will answer questions about the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines during the event. The state has also promoted the vaccines in rural areas through advertisements, other town hall meetings and work with local health officials.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The U.S. Bureau of Land Management has issued a fire prevention order for all its lands in Nevada, including a ban on the use of fireworks, exploding targets and ammunition with steel components. BLM Nevada Fire Management Officer Paul Petersen said the order runs through Oct. 31. He said it’s necessary because Nevada is experiencing record dry conditions and much of the state is in severe drought. “The current national wildland fire potential outlook indicates that we could be in for a challenge this summer,” Peterson said. “It is important for the public to understand and comply with the fire prevention order to help keep human-caused wildfires from needlessly damaging natural and cultural resources.” The order makes it illegal to burn any explosive materials on BLM lands in Nevada. Several areas in the agency’s Southern Nevada District are subject to additional restrictions prohibiting building campfires, using charcoal barbecues or stove fires and smoking, except within an enclosed vehicle.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMilton: A 32-year-old man was accidentally shot in the head in New Hampshire after the bullet fired by his 8-year-old nephew ricocheted while they were shooting chipmunks, police said. The man was injured Friday in Milton and is expected to recover, the Fosters Daily Democrat reported. Police said a bullet shot by the 8-year-old ricocheted after killing a chipmunk and hit the man in the head. Milton Police Chief Richard Krauss called it a “truly just a freak accident.” “It’s not against the law for anyone to teach a child how to shoot and take them hunting, even at 8 years old,” Krauss aid. “There are kids who learn how to hunt and shoot a lot younger than that.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River:Councilman Daniel Rodrick said he will not be part of a committee set up to review whether Toms River should allow marijuana businesses in town. Rodrick said he will not change his mind about his opposition to recreational marijuana sales, and accused Council President Kevin Geoghegan of violating the state’s open public meetings act, or Sunshine Law, by making appointments to the committee during an executive session. But Councilwoman Laurie Huryk said the appointments were made at a meeting of the township’s land use committee. The committee is tasked with producing a recommendation by the council’s July 13 meeting. New Jersey residents approved legalizing recreational marijuana for adults in a November referendum. In Toms River, 63.7% of voters supported last year’s ballot measure legalizing weed for adults. The council had initially planned to adopt an ordinance barring companies that sell, manufacture or distribute marijuana from operating in town.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Home schooling nearly doubled in New Mexico last year as thousands of parents opted out of virtual learning programs offered in public schools. The unprecedented defection from the public school system is putting a strain on school budgets, which are rooted in student enrollment. Parents with the time and patience to school at home said they love the flexibility of home schooling and have learned how to give their children a more tailored education. “We had no interest in doing virtual learning through a public or charter school,” said Jennifer Fischer, 43, who moved with her partner and two sons from Los Angeles to Albuquerque during the pandemic in August. Raised by school teachers and experienced in teaching media classes, the filmmaker couple were unintimidated by the prospect of teaching their fourth-grade and fifth-grade boys. The number of children registered with the state as home schoolers nearly doubled from about 8,800 before the pandemic to about 15,400 this past school year, according to Public Education Department data. K-12 enrollment was already shrinking by about 1.1% each year following a decade of decreased births and more childbearing-aged people moving out of the state than moving to it.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City:Secretary Transportation Pete Buttigieg was to tour the century-old rail tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey on Monday as a long-delayed $11 billion project to build a new tunnel gains steam. The federal government gave the tunnel project key environmental approvals last month necessary to secure federal grants. That had been a sticking point during the Trump administration, as Schumer and others had accused formre President Donald Trump of purposely delaying the environmental approval for political reasons, a charge administration officials denied. The existing tunnel is more than 110 years old and prone to problems and delays because of aging infrastructure. Saltwater intrusion from Superstorm Sandy in 2012 accelerated the tunnel’s deterioration and forced Amtrak, which owns the tunnel, to embark on costly repairs to keep it functioning reliably. Hundreds of trains and hundreds of thousands of passengers pass through the tunnel a day, and delays can ripple up and down the East Coast between Boston and Washington. Once primary construction begins, the tunnel could take as long as six or seven years to complete. A new tunnel would allow the old tunnel to be overhauled, a process that would take roughly two years, and then returned to use. That could significantly increase rail capacity into and out of New York, though it would require additional tracks at New York’s Penn Station. A plan to expand and overhaul the station is in the early stages.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOcean Isle Beach: A shark bit a 7-year-old girl over the weekend at Ocean Isle Beach, according to Mayor Debbie Smith. WECT-TV reported that EMS responded to the scene on Sunday morning and the girl was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not thought to be life-threatening. There were no other sightings of sharks on Sunday and no additional warnings for swimmers, Smith said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Wildlife officials said North Dakota’s spring pheasant population estimate is up 3% from last year, but there is worry that an extended drought could cut into hunting prospects in the fall. “The statewide number might be a bit misleading since we are notably down in the southwest, while most of the state benefited from good reproduction in 2020 and a mild winter,” said R.J. Gross, upland game management biologist with the state Game and Fish Department. Pheasant crowing counts are conducted each spring throughout North Dakota. Observers drive specified 20-mile routes, stop at predetermined intervals and count the number of pheasant roosters heard crowing over a 2-minute period. The number of roosters detected this spring was up in the northwest, southeast and northeast regions. The southwest area, which is generally considered the state’s main pheasant hunting region, was recorded at 18.4 crows per stop, down from 19.6 in 2020, The Bismarck Tribune reported. Drought is causing delayed growth in nesting cover, brood-rearing cover and croplands across the state, according to Gross. Extended drought could prevent insect hatches, reducing food available to chicks.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:A volunteer picking up debris Monday morning along the banks of Alum Creek Reservoir in Delaware County found what is believed to be a human leg floating in a plastic bin. The man was in a kayak about a quarter-mile north of Cheshire Road, east of Africa Road, about 8:30 a.m. when he saw the floating tub. “As he got closer, he noticed the lid was slightly ajar and a human leg was protruding from it,” said Tracy Whited, spokeswoman for the Delaware County Sheriff’s office. The man immediately called 911. Investigators with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, Delaware County Coroner’s office and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources were on the scene and looking for other evidence, Whited said. Officials did not disclose other details, including what else might have been in the bin. Alum Creek Reservoir is a man-made reservoir that covers about 5 acres and is one of the main raw water supply sources for central Ohio.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:Oklahomans spent more than $1.5 billion on medical marijuana since it became legal to buy in 2018, according to an analysis of the latest tax collection figures from the Oklahoma Tax Commission. That level of retail means the state collected more than $110 million from the 7% marijuana tax, and another $138 million was levied in state and local sales taxes, according to the most recent data. There were record sales in April, when medical marijuana patients spent nearly $90 million and the state collected nearly $6 million from the marijuana tax and another $7.5 million in sales tax. If the growth continues at its present rate, Oklahoma’s cannabis sector is poised to become a billion-dollar-a-year industry based solely on retail sales. That doesn’t account for the value of farms, distribution and business services offered throughout the industry. This creates a sizable revenue stream for the state.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The city shattered its heat record Sunday, topping out at a sweltering 113 degrees. Temperatures in the city rose to 101 early in the day, and skyrocketed another 10 degrees by 3 p.m., quickly surpassing its record of 108 degrees set in 1981, 1941 and 1927, according to David Bishop, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Portland. At about 4:25 p.m. – and then again at about 5:10 p.m. – the city reached 113 degrees. Temperatures continued to fluctuate throughout the evening, but were still at 109 about 8 p.m., said Colby Neuman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Portland. National Weather Service officials issued an excessive heat warning for much of the Willamette Valley in effect through 11 p.m. Monday, urging the public to stay indoors and hydrate to avoid the potential for heat-related illnesses.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Pennsylvania lifted its mask mandate Monday, more than 14 months after the administration of Gov. Tom Wolf began requiring people to wear face coverings whenever they left home to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Department of Health will no longer require unvaccinated people to wear masks in public, though it said businesses, health care facilities, prisons and other places may still require them. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also requires masks on planes, trains, buses and public transportation hubs. Fully vaccinated people were allowed to shed their masks in most public places in Pennsylvania last month. According to federal data, 75% of Pennsylvania residents age 18 and over have received at least one vaccine dose, with nearly 60% of the adult population fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. People are considered fully vaccinated once they are two weeks beyond their last required dose of COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Community College of Rhode Island is holding two COVID-19 vaccination clinics this week in conjunction with enrollment events. The first is scheduled for Tuesday at the Warwick campus, and the second is scheduled for Wednesday at the Providence campus. Prospective students interested in attending CCRI will be able to apply for free, receive assistance with filing for financial aid, schedule or take the placement exam, and register for classes. The vaccination clinics, which will be administering the Pfizer shot, are open to the prospective students and their families. CCRI is requiring all students attending on-campus activities this fall to be vaccinated. This year’s high school graduates can also learn about the RI Promise Scholarship program, which provides two years of free tuition for full-time CCRI students.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGalivants Ferry: U.S. Sen. Tim Scott launched his reelection campaign Monday, arguing in a series of stops across the state that he and other Republicans represent progress and stability for voters in this deeply conservative state. “Sometimes you’ve got to go back to the future, and that’s a future I want to go back to,” Scott said in North Charleston, referencing the accomplishments of the Trump administration, as well as his hope that Republicans can recapture the U.S. Senate majority in next year’s midterm elections. Scott, 55, has said the 2022 Senate run would be his last. The chamber’s only Black Republican, he has become one of the GOP’s go-to standouts, particularly on issues of race and policing. Scott has also begun to be mentioned as a potential 2024 GOP presidential candidate, with his name appearing in a straw poll conducted at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference. He also gave the party’s response to President Joe Biden’s maiden address to Congress this year, accusing Democrats of dividing the country and suggesting they’re wielding race as “a political weapon.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Summer camps are back in full swing this year after some limited enrollment or closed completely during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Dakota. And at some camps that stayed open and in-person last summer, COVID-19 spread in a matter of days. At Camp Judson in Keystone, the South Dakota Department of Health reported 96 cases by Aug. 3, 2020. Days before, on July 27, the department reported less than 10 cases at the camp. Camp Judson closed its doors to campers that week. This year, though, places such as Leif Ericson, the YMCA’s day camp that hosts campers from ages 4 to 15 in Sioux Falls, is seeing a resurgence of campers in enrollment numbers for its five two-week sessions throughout the summer. The camp is finally back to normal in 2021 after floods ravaged the site in 2019, and after COVID-19 limited enrollment in 2020. Camp director Mike Murphy said the camp anticipated a normal summer in 2020 until mid-March. He capped the capacity at 1,500 last year, kept a waiting list and shortened the duration of the sessions. All the staff wore masks. They also offered a virtual camp option and kept sessions limited from July to mid-August.\n\nTennessee\n\nSevierville: Police said two people face charges after officers found a dead monkey inside a hot car parked outside of a waterpark. According to the Sevierville Police Department, officers last Wednesday found the dead 9-week-old marmoset monkey and a 5-week old monkey that was alive in the car parked at Soaky Mountain Waterpark after the facility’s management notified police. Police said the other monkey was taken to an animal hospital and was very dehydrated but improving. One of the monkeys’ owners is charged with aggravated animal cruelty and the other with animal cruelty. Both are from Indiana. Police said additional charges are possible and the investigation is ongoing.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A group of Texans assisting each other in two Facebook groups are suing to prevent Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton from opting out of a COVID-19 pandemic relief program that added an extra $300 to their weekly unemployment pay. Abbott last month said the state was ending its participation in the enhanced benefits as of Saturday, two months before the added payments are to end nationally. Their lawsuit, filed in Travis County, alleged that the Texas constitution does not give Abbott the authority to make this decision alone, but instead requires a determination by the Texas Workforce Commission. TWC is the state agency that processes unemployment claims and pays out benefits. Abbott “exceeded his power” in opting out of the program, according to the lawsuit. It seeks a temporary restraining order to keep the benefits from ending on Saturday. Attorney David Sibley, who is working with the Facebook groups, said the case will be heard Friday afternoon. The two groups, Texas Unemployment Updates and Unemployment Petition and Peaceful Protest, contain more than 30,000 members combined.\n\nUtah\n\nOgden: Reports of violations of the city’s water-use guidelines have spiked since the city declared a water shortage on June 4 and called for increased water conservation, said Matt Haack, Ogden’s water conservation coordinator. Haack said more than 200 complaints have been received, more than the 100 to 150 that had been reported in all between implementation of the city’s online water-waste reporting form in 2017 and the June 4 declaration, the Standard-Examiner in Ogden reported. The calls have generally been about excessive lawn watering, watering that causes runoff into sidewalks and streets and lawn watering during prohibited times, 10 a.m.-6 p.m., which is the hottest part of the day. So far, the city hasn’t issued any fines, said Brady Herd, Ogden’s public utilities manager, instead focusing on education and providing information.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Johnsbury: A major construction plan at the Fairbanks Museum has been postponed because of pandemic-related pricing and labor and subcontractor shortages, museum officials said. The museum bid out the Science Annex project in the spring and planned to start construction in July until the project came in at $2 million or 68% above construction estimates, the Caledonian Record reported. “We were just honestly stunned to see the costs come out where they did,” Adam Kane, the museum’s executive director, wrote in an email to project donors and supporters on Friday. The museum has decided to postpone construction to early spring of 2022, hoping to drive down costs and do additional fundraising, he said. Kane is also hopeful that the Science Annex will be supported by additional federal funding. The project is designed as a 6,000-square-foot, three-story annex on the rear of the museum that will house hands-on exhibits for astronomy and meteorology. Plans are for it to also provide a future home for Community College of Vermont operations in St. Johnsbury.\n\nVirginia\n\nCentreville: A Virginia man was arrested last week after police said he posed as an officer while trying to force his way into his neighbors’ homes, then fought with responding police officers. WTOP-FM reported that it happened early Wednesday in Centreville, when a 36-year-old man left his home after a domestic incident. Fairfax County police said the man tried to force his way into two of his neighbors’ homes while identifying himself as a police officer. When officers arrived, he was being “held down” by one neighbor, police said in a news release. Once officers tried to detain the man, police said he fought them. The man was arrested and charged with burglary, assault on law enforcement, two counts of destruction of property, simple assault and impersonating a police officer.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: Orchardists in Central Washington are trying to save the cherry crop as a heat wave grips the region, using canopies, deploying sprinklers and sending out workers in the night to harvest cherries. Temperatures are expected to exceed 100 degrees this week, with a predicted high near 115 on Tuesday. The heat wave hit as Washington’s cherries are ripening, the Yakima Herald reported. Cherry growers are moving 500,000 boxes a day, said B.J. Thurlby, president of the Washington State Fruit Commission. So far, the cherries appear to have good color and sugar, he said. This heat wave is a new experience, Thurlby said. “We have not been in these waters before,” Thurlby said. If the cherries get too hot, they will sunburn and dry out, he said. There are strategies to take the edge off the heat. Sprinkler systems under cherry trees can, through evaporation, knock off 10 to 15 degrees from the air temperature around the fruit, Thurlby said. But it’s not a foolproof solution. Shade netting is also another strategy that orchardists use to fight heat and birds. The large polyethylene sheets can knock down temperatures 10 to 15 degrees, as well as prevent sunburn on fruit.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia Chief Justice Evan Jenkins has suspended many of the court health protocols that arose last year from the coronavirus pandemic. Jenkins’ administrative order contained some exceptions. Courts should continue using remote technology when possible for hearings and proceedings, Jenkins’ order said. They should also continue avoiding the use of call dockets to cut back on extended waiting periods in lobbies, common areas and court rooms, he wrote. Protocols for people in prison or jail remain in effect, and hearings for such people should continue to use video conferencing to reduce the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak in a jail or corrections facility, Jenkins wrote. If circumstances change or a local outbreak occurs, additional steps can be taken.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:A plan to develop “tiny homes” for homeless veterans on Milwaukee’s northwest side is proceeding after an important part of the developer’s financing package was obtained. The developer, Veterans Outreach of Wisconsin Inc., has received approval for a $700,000 loan from the Milwaukee Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit business lender affiliated with the city of Milwaukee. That loan will provide bridge financing as Veterans Outreach continues its fundraising efforts to develop up to 48 homes on 7 acres at 6767 N. 60th St., according to MEDC. The Common Council and Mayor Tom Barrett in 2019 approved selling the city-owned site for $35,000. With the MEDC loan, Veterans Outreach plans to complete its land purchase next week and break ground on the project soon after, said Brad Behling, the nonprofit group’s executive director. The rest of the $2.2 million project’s financing is coming from grants and donations. The project’s first phase will include 24 single-family small houses, and a 10,000-square-foot community center with a communal kitchen, showers and offices to host services for the residents. Veterans Outreach hopes to have residents moving in by spring, Behling told the Journal Sentinel. Each house would have 240 square feet.\n\nWyoming\n\nMoose: Plans to rebuild and pave a road will close one of the driving routes into Grand Teton National Park for much of 2022. Moose-Wilson Road connects the communities of Wilson and Teton Village just south of Grand Teton, with the park headquarters at Moose. It’s one of the less busy ways to get into the park in western Wyoming. About 1.4 miles of the 8-mile road is unpaved. Park officials plan to close the road between where it enters the park and the Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve in the spring of 2022. They plan to reopen the road on weekends during the busy summer tourist season but close its southern stretch entirely again after Labor Day. The new road’s features will include about 20 vehicle pullout areas. A second phase of work focusing on the road’s northern end will occur in 2024-25, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reported. Each phase costs roughly $13 million. The $26 million has been secured through a federal fund created by the Great American Outdoors Act.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/29"}]}

He alleged that the company had “breached its duties as a data controller” by collecting web-browsing data from around 4.4 million Apple iPhone users between 2011 and 2012.\n\nBut the 60-page judgment said that Lloyd’s case hadn’t proven “what, if any, wrongful use was made by Google of the personal data of any individual” affected by the data breach. Because of this, it added, “a claim for damages cannot succeed”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

Sign up\n\nLloyd, who was representing more than four million iPhone users in England and Wales, said he was “bitterly disappointed” by the ruling.\n\n“Although the Court once again recognised that our action is the only practical way that millions of British people can get access to fair redress, they’ve slammed the door shut on this case by ruling that everyone affected must go to court individually,” he said.\n\n‘Safari workaround’\n\nLloyd was suing Google over the company’s alleged capture of data containing information about health, race, ethnicity, sexuality and finance a decade ago. The data in question was collected illegally through Apple’s Safari web browser, even when iPhone users selected a “do not track” privacy setting, he claimed.\n\nThe case states that Google bypassed Safari’s privacy settings to track users’ internet browsing history and then sell targeted advertising, using a method which has since been dubbed the “Safari workaround”.\n\nWhen the workaround was discovered by Stanford University researcher Jonathan Mayer in 2012, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, Google said the loophole was unintentional. “We didn’t anticipate that this would happen,” said Rachel Whetstone, senior vice president of communications and public policy.\n\nRepresentative action\n\nLloyd was not only representing himself but also millions of residents in England and Wales whose data was collected in this way during that period. This was a landmark case because it was the first time in UK history that an individual brought a class action on behalf of many others, without all those affected actively opting in.\n\nThis was also where the case faltered, with the court ruling that it was “doomed to fail”, reported The Law Society Gazette. It would have had a “real prospect of success” if pursued by Lloyd as an individual but could not be proven on behalf of millions of others.\n\nThe judge “did not rule out the possibility of future mass-action lawsuits if damages could be calculated”, said the BBC, which will “have implications for similar mass-action lawsuits”.\n\nIndeed, a similar case concerning the use of children’s data was recently launched against TikTok by Anne Longfield, the former children’s commissioner, on behalf of millions of young people in the EU and UK. Facebook is also involved in a lawsuit, which alleges that user data was improperly handled.\n\n‘A dark day’\n\nLloyd has been supported by the campaign group Google You Owe Us, which works to ensure “that big companies like Google respect our privacy in the future”.\n\nThe group said the Supreme Court’s ruling was a “bitter blow to UK consumers”. In a statement, Lloyd’s solicitor James Oldnall described it as “a dark day when corporate greed is valued over our right to privacy”.\n\n“The ruling today gives Google and rest of Big Tech the green light to continue misusing our data without consent, knowing they will go unpunished,” he added.\n\nSee more\n\nLandmark case\n\nLloyd vs. Google was described as “one of the most significant cases in recent legal history”, said Sky News. In Lloyd’s letter of claim, he suggested that affected users should each receive £750 in compensation, a sum which could have totalled more than £1bn if the judges had ruled against Google.\n\nThe legal action was funded by Therium, a global litigation financing firm. Even though the lawsuit has been blocked, the millions of claimants who are part of this representative action are not liable for any costs.\n\nLloyd vs. Google had been ticking along for around four years. It was initially dismissed by the High Court, “which ruled it was difficult to calculate how many people had been affected or whether they had suffered damage as a result of the breach”, said the BBC.\n\nBut a later Court of Appeal ruling in October 2019 determined that Lloyd’s case was a suitable method for people to seek mass redress for data breaches. Google argued against this decision, which is why the matter went to the Supreme Court.\n\nArguments for the case were heard earlier this year, with the judgment finally handed down today.\n\n‘Open the floodgates’\n\nThose critical of Big Tech’s power will be disappointed by the ruling. Writing for The Times earlier this year, former Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said he hoped that the judges “make the decision the technology firms fear”.\n\nLloyd vs. Google could have made it “easier to bring collective damages claims for data breaches against corporate miscreants in the civil courts”, he wrote. “That could cost the tech giants billions and finally provide an incentive for them to acknowledge the primacy of our data and privacy rights.”\n\nTech UK, the trade group which represents Google and other technology companies, earlier warned that the ruling could “open the floodgates” to mass litigations being brought on behalf of millions of people, which could adversely affect smaller businesses.\n\nIn response to the judgment, Google said: “This claim was related to events that took place a decade ago and that we addressed at the time. People want to know that they are safe and secure online, which is why for years we’ve focused on building products and infrastructure that respect and protect people’s privacy.”", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Becca Stanek", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Uk", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Justin Klawans", "Theara Coleman", "Devika Rao"], "publish_date": "2021/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/komando/2023/04/30/how-enable-life-saving-settings-your-iphone-and-apple-watch/11747387002/", "title": "How to enable life-saving settings on your iPhone and Apple Watch", "text": "Kim Komando\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nI was a Boy Scouts leader (long story), so I know you always need to be prepared.\n\nOn your smartphone, the right apps can make a world of difference. Here are the essentials you need in an emergency.\n\nThe Apple Watch is a lifesaver, and I don't mean it because you can answer texts from your wrist. There's story after story about it identifying heart problems or contacting emergency responders after an accident.\n\nDon’t have one? Your iPhone can do a lot on its own. I’ll show you that first and then advanced Apple Watch tricks.\n\nGet my free daily email trusted by over 400,000 people like you.\n\n1. Steadiness\n\nWith your iPhone in your pocket, the Health app uses custom algorithms to assess your balance, strength, and gait. You can set up a notification if your level of steadiness drops. That’s important because that could mean you’re more at risk of falling.\n\nHere’s how to set up Steadiness Notifications:\n\n• Open the Health app and tap your profile at the top right. If you don’t see your picture or initials, tap Summary or Browse at the bottom, then scroll back to the top.\n\n• Tap Health Checklist.\n\n• Tap Set Up for Walking Steadiness Notifications and follow the onscreen instructions.\n\nIs carrying your phone in your pocket (guys) or your bra (ladies) safe? Here’s my answer.\n\n2. Heart rate variability\n\nHeart rate variability, or HRV, measures time intervals between heartbeats when you’re at rest. Your Apple Watch checks for irregular rhythms, sends you a notification and records the data in the Health app.\n\nIrregular rhythms could indicate atrial fibrillation (Afib), where the heart’s upper chambers beat out of sync with the lower chambers. Seriously dangerous stuff.\n\nHere’s how to check up on your HRV data:\n\n• Open the Health app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap Browse in the bottom right corner.\n\n• Tap Heart > Heart Rate Variability.\n\n• At the top, choose to view your data by day, week, month, half-year, and year.\n\nHere’s how to enable irregular rhythm notifications:\n\n• Open the Health app.\n\n• Tap Browse in the bottom right corner.\n\n• Tap Heart > Irregular Rhythm Notifications.\n\n• Once enabled, turn irregular rhythm notifications on or off in the Apple Watch app on your iPhone:\n\n• Open the Apple Watch app, tap the My Watch tab, then go to Heart > Irregular Rhythm.\n\nA nursing student said an Apple Watch notification helped detect a rare abnormality. Amazing stuff.\n\n3. High and low heart rates\n\nYour Apple Watch checks for low and high heart rates that could indicate an underlying condition. You can be notified when your heart rate goes above 120 bpm or drops below 40 bpm while inactive for 10 minutes.\n\nYou can turn on heart rate notifications when you first open the Heart Rate app on your Apple Watch or at any time from your iPhone:\n\n• Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap the My Watch tab, then tap Heart.\n\n• Tap High Heart Rate and choose a BPM.\n\n• Tap Low Heart Rate and choose a BPM.\n\n4. Respiratory rate\n\nYour respiratory rate refers to the number of times you breathe in a minute. This goes up as you exercise and down as you sleep. When you wear your Apple Watch to bed, it automatically measures and records your respiratory rate.\n\nWhen your respiratory rate is significantly higher or lower than usual while you sleep, it could indicate illness or a health condition.\n\nTo track your respiratory rate, you’ll need to set up the sleep features on your iPhone:\n\n• Open the Health app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap Get Started under Set Up Sleep and tap Next.\n\n• Follow the onscreen prompts.\n\n• Turn on Track Sleep with Apple Watch. This option is available during setup if you’ve paired your Apple Watch with your iPhone beforehand. If you pair your Apple Watch after setup, you can turn on Track Sleep with Apple Watch later.\n\nTo view your respiratory heart rate:\n\n• Open the Health app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap Browse at the bottom right of the screen.\n\n• Tap Respiratory > Respiratory Rate.\n\n5. Activity\n\nActivity Rings track your movement, exercise, and time on your feet. The rings fill up as you go through the motions. Addicting, right?\n\nYou can check your daily progress and activity history on your iPhone at any time:\n\n• Open the Fitness app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap Activity in the Summary tab to see details about your activity.\n\n• Tap the calendar to see your progress for the month.

While nothing is more powerful than real physical human connection, the digital virtual tech-driven world was the big story for media and entertainment in 2021.\n\nIn particular, 2021 marked the coming out party for the blockchain – a kind of transformational decentralized Web 3.0 world. In the world of media, the headline blockchain story took its form in so-called non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Will the blockchain’s adoption in media accelerate in 2022?\n\nMy Magic 8-Ball says “Signs point to ‘YES’.”\n\n►What's an NFT:A guide to what they are and why someone spent $69 million for one\n\nHere are 10 predictions for the coming year in which we hope that we finally get COVID under some kind of real long-term control.\n\n1. Blockchain blows up in 2022\n\nAfter early experimentation in 2021, 2022 will mark the year creators truly begin to embrace and leverage the power of the blockchain at scale. Just like iPhones ushered in a whole new mobile-first world of content 15 years ago, so-called Web 3.0 ushers in a whole new transformational world for originators of intellectual property, or IP, to directly reach and monetize their audiences. In the process, creators take back at least some of the power of mega tech platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Apple that built their trillion-dollar-plus valuations on their backs.\n\n2. NFTs a new venue for fans\n\nAnd 2022 will mark the year superfans will use their collective decentralized power to fuel creativity from their favorite artists via blockchain-related opportunities. Most in the entertainment world still focus on Beeple’s $69-million digital art NFT as being the blockchain’s poster child.\n\nBut instead they should be thinking of NFTs as new direct and directly monetizing channels of super-fandom – opening up membership into exclusive new clubs. If few in the world of media now know of CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club and DAOs in general (decentralized autonomous organizations), that changes in 2022. The blockchain, NFTs and DAOs are no momentary fads. They are long-term game-changers. Like it or not, the Los Angeles-based Staples Center’s new “Crypto.com Arena” moniker is here to stay. Hey, brands out there, you better claim your \".eth\" web address now. (Here's why.)\n\n►Decoding the lingo:10 cryptocurrency terms people use every day\n\n►Crypto tithes:With fewer young parishioners carrying cash, more churches accept bitcoin as offering\n\n3. Big action to come against Big Tech\n\nThe new mega-media platforms of Facebook (or Meta, actually), Google, Apple, and Amazon face a more immediate threat than the blockchain and related new decentralized social platforms in 2022, as big government finally takes big action against big tech in advance of 2022’s mid-term elections. Facebook and Zuckerberg are first to feel the pinch, as the Feds force Facebook to shed Instagram (and perhaps set some real rules to limit unbridled ad and AI-driven algorithmic devastation, both on young people and society itself). These “unlockings” of tech conglomerates will unlock more content innovation across more competing tech platforms.\n\n►The Facebook Papers:Facebook fed posts with violence and nudity to people with low digital literacy\n\n4. Apple leads the way to the metaverse\n\nFaced with these threats, Facebook tries to run and hide with its new Meta moniker (the quintessential “lipstick on a pig”), but real metaverse innovation comes from others, including Apple. Yes, Apple’s AR glasses ultimately will drive some of that innovation. But Apple already sports the ultimate wearable – AirPods (now a $20-billion business by itself). AirPods will become the first major gateway into the metaverse – outside of the games industry – much like Apple drove mass consumer adoption in the mobile world with the iPhone. Expect micro-cameras to be incorporated into higher-end, extremely expensive versions of AirPods that will enable visual experiences. I can see you lining up at your local Apple store already.\n\n►What is the metaverse anyway? Everyone wants to own the metaverse including Facebook and Microsoft\n\n5. Games + crossovers = metaverse magic\n\nSpeaking of games, that industry will continue to lead all other categories of entertainment content by an order of magnitude and increasingly show the way for artists and creators to emerge and build audiences. Before the tragedy of Astroworld, Travis Scott broke out into the metaverse in 2020 via \"Fortnite\" to the tune of 50 million viewers who drove a No. 1 hit. Ariana Grande shattered those numbers this past year, and the marriage of games and music grows stronger in 2022 as music licensing for games becomes a massive new revenue stream.\n\n►From Facebook to Fortnite:The metaverse is calling. Are we ready?\n\n6. Get paid to play\n\nMedia and tech business models will continue to fundamentally evolve, particularly in light of the havoc wreaked by ad-driven business models from the two major culprits of Facebook and Google. We’ve already seen the shift from single transactions to subscription-based recurring revenue bundles (Amazon Prime, Apple One, Disney+). That will accelerate in 2022. And move over “free to play” business models in the world of games. Now, thanks to the blockchain, welcome to an entirely new “play to earn” model that literally pays players to play (and gives them fractional ownership in the games they play). Why work when you can play? Other parts of the entertainment industry will continue to look to the world of games for inspiration and innovation, because that’s where it’s happening.\n\n7. In battle for screen dominance, Disney beats Netflix\n\nDisney+ will grow more rapidly than Netflix – and begin to close the gap in terms of global paid members – as the Mouse House begins to unlock significantly more dollars to produce originals. And don’t forget Disney’s “special sauce” that Netflix can’t touch – Disney’s priceless crown jewels of content – i.e., the Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, Avengers, and Disney Princess franchises. Just imagine the NFTs Disney can (and will) create with those timeless characters (which, in turn, will drive more Disney+ subscriptions/memberships). Meanwhile, Amazon and Apple will also quietly raise their own originals ante as they too accelerate their media ambitions – but for decidedly different ends. Amazon and Apple use content as marketing and to drive customer loyalty – to draw us in and create an ongoing customer relationship so we spend more time (and cash) in their walled gardens. And in the thirst for new content, expect more media production company acquisitions in 2022. The big buy in 2021 was Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine. Indie idol A24 will be the big prize for 2022.\n\n8. Musicians to harness the power of NFTs\n\nMusic will continue its double-digit growth – fueled by accelerating streaming via broader global broadband connectivity, entirely new royalty-paying platforms (Facebook, TikTok, Peloton), the growing ubiquity of smart speakers and, yes, transformational blockchain-fueled opportunities like NFTs. Perhaps most notably – and most notably absent in the minds of most executives still today – superfans will directly drive significantly more dollars into the pockets of their favorite artists. Billions have been left on the table in the past. Not any longer.\n\n►Making music and history:In her return, singer Shontelle deploys NFTs in song of empowerment\n\n9.You could help finance the next big Hollywood entertainment project\n\nExpect the retail market – that's you and me, the superfans – to directly finance and even buy fractional pieces of content from our favorite artists. In a world of content increasingly being “king,” private equity has pumped billions of dollars into the world of music acquisitions for the likes of Stevie Nicks and Bob Dylan. But that kind of content ownership will not be just for the “big boys” in 2022. NFTs will help fuel the way. And superfan-fueled crowd-funding and IP ownership aren’t just for the world of music. The retail market will open up an entirely new world of financing for producers of film and television. Hey, Hollywood, check out “The Chosen.” If you don’t know about it, you should.\n\n10. Live entertainment is back, but forever changed\n\nMusic festivals and other mega-live entertainment experiences will continue to open up in 2022 due to pent up demand for real, physical interaction and lasting shared experiences in our increasingly heads-down digital, virtual world. But these large-scale live events are forever changed as a result of the twin tragedies of COVID and Astroworld. Crowd control, mitigation and broader safety and security efforts and focus will transform overall planning and execution – not to mention the overall “festival experience” for those who attend.\n\nThere you have it – 10 predictions for our increasingly tech-driven world of media and entertainment in 2022.\n\nPeter Csathy is the chairman of CREATV Media & Deep Cuts Media, a media, entertainment & tech-focused business development, M&A and advisory firm.

Sign up here.\n\nBoston CNN —\n\nThis week’s newsletter is coming out a little later than normal – but for a good reason. We wanted to bring readers along to the grand finale of the Prince and Princess of Wales’ US visit – the Earthshot Prize Award ceremony.\n\nThe star-studded ceremony concluded on Friday evening in Boston, capping a challenging couple days for Prince William and Catherine.\n\nTheir first overseas visit in their new roles should have been an opportunity to showcase the modern monarchy and highlight the work the family does. But no sooner had they landed in America, than controversy blew up at home.\n\nThe timing couldn’t have been worse as allegations of racism emerged from within palace walls; a royal aide resigned and apologized over complaints that she had repeatedly asked a Black charity executive where she was “really from” during a reception hosted by the Queen Consort.\n\nBuckingham Palace was quick to act as the scandal erupted and a spokesman for the Prince of Wales was forthright in condemning the incident during a press briefing around the visit in Boston.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales arrive for the second annual Earthshot Prize Awards Ceremony at the MGM Music Hall at Fenway, in Boston, Massachusetts. Kirsty O'Connor/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nStill, the first major controversy to grip the newly reorganized institution immediately overshadowed a visit that has been months in the making and dragged the royal family back into a debate from which it had sought to distance itself.\n\nMany still vividly remember the comments the Duchess of Sussex made last year to Oprah Winfrey of her own experience of racism within the household.\n\nBehind closed doors, the royals will be devastated that the issue of institutionalized racism has reared again. In recent years, the family has been trying to show how they are evolving the monarchy to reflect a more modern Britain and bolster diversity and inclusivity.\n\nWhatever the senior royals may have been feeling privately, William and Kate embodied the British spirit of keeping calm and carrying on – even in the face of disastrously wet weather and traffic congestion – as they kicked off their trip with a special welcome and lighting ceremony for the climate prize on Wednesday. That first event saw further setbacks after two of the attendees – US Ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy and US climate envoy John Kerry – were unable to join at the last minute.\n\nRefusing to be distracted from their goal of bringing the Earthshot Prize to the hometown of the man whose words inspired William to launch it – President John F. Kennedy – the second day of the trip saw the couple visit environmental tech entrepreneurs and a non-profit supporting disadvantaged young people at risk of urban violence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Woman at center of Buckingham Palace controversy speaks out 05:10 - Source: CNN\n\nBut then, another unexpected development: a trailer for the Duke and Duchess of Sussexes’ Netflix docu-series dropped online out of the blue. No one had expected it and, once more, conversation was sidetracked from the tour.\n\nThere would have been a huge amount of frustration among William’s team that attention was once again being diverted elsewhere. It’s an unwritten rule that working royals don’t distract from one another’s trips. Prince Harry isn’t a working royal any longer and doesn’t need to abide by those rules, though we don’t know if he had any say over the streaming giant’s PR push.\n\nFriday saw some semblance of royal trip normality return as the pair embarked on solo engagements: Kate visiting the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University while William headed to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. It was there he also met US President Biden, who was in Massachusetts Friday for a fundraising event.\n\nDuring their half-hour catch-up, which Kensington Palace described as “friendly and substantive,” the two men shared “warm memories” of the late Queen Elizabeth II. The president was said to be interested in learning about some of the Earthshot Prize finalists and William “shared his global, long-term ambition for the prize.” The prince also used the moment to thank Biden for traveling to the United Kingdom in September for the late Queen’s funeral service.\n\nThen the main event was upon us – the Earthshot Prize awards. As has been the case all trip, excited royal well-wishers turned out en masse. For the last three days, substantial crowds have gathered at engagements to warmly welcome the couple, several holding hand-made posters and bouquets of flowers for the pair. Many told us seeing the new Princess of Wales was a particular draw in deciding to brave the brisk temperatures.\n\nWilliam and Kate greet well-wishers after visiting Roca Inc, an organization working to reduce urban violence through community engagement efforts, in Chelsea, Massachusetts. Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnd they didn’t seem disappointed – ear-splitting screams erupted at the sight of William and Kate on the recycled green carpet at the MGM Music Hall at Fenway. Eagle-eyed fans noticed quickly that the princess was wearing a necklace owned by the predecessor of her new title, Diana.\n\nIt was a star-studded occasion with the likes of Oscar winner Rami Malek, actress Shailene Woodley and Catherine O’Hara of “Schitt’s Creek” fame on hand to present some of the awards. The show also featured musical performances from Annie Lennox, siblings Chloe x Halle and Ellie Goulding.\n\nChatting with CNN on the carpet before the event, Malek commended William for carving out his role as the new royal champion of the environment.\n\n“It’s extraordinarily inspiring. He is finding answers and the £1 million that are given to these five people, these five organizations, is something that keeps us from looking at the gloom and doom and the pessimism of it all, and looking toward the future of what we can come to do because when we put our ideas together, we can do extraordinary things,” said the 41-year-old “Bohemian Rhapsody” star.\n\nHe said he loved that William was inspired by former President John F. Kennedy and his challenge in the early 1960s to push Americans to accomplish greatness. “I think that’s exactly what’s happening here. We can push ourselves collectively to come up with extraordinary ideas, to do extraordinary things so we get to make sure that we enjoy this extraordinary world,” he continued, adding that he was “proud” to have been called upon to help.\n\nThe royal couple chat with actor Rami Malek at The Earthshot Prize Awards on Friday.

Ryan/Pool/The Boston Globe/AP\n\nMeanwhile, Lennox said she was keen to lend her support to William’s initiative for future generations. “It looks like a very almost glamorous event, but the situation is deadly serious and it needs to be taken far more seriously,” she told CNN. “It encourages me to see that the prince and princess have taken action on this.”\n\nShe shared that she had met with the couple the evening before, and described all the “distractions” of the week as “put aside” as they focused on their climate work.\n\nShe continued: “I think it’s very important that they actually play a significant role. A role that people can identify with truly, not just in a symbolic sense.”\n\nRoyal visits tend to come with their own challenges – and this trip perhaps a few more than anticipated. But the attention also meant everyone was watching the couple’s every move, asking why they were in America in the first place, and learning about Earthshot along the way.\n\nHERE ARE THE WINNERS OF THE 2022 EARTHSHOT PRIZE\n\nThe Earthshot Prize was created to try to find solutions to help us, in William’s words, “overcome our planet’s greatest challenges.” The competition is based around five “Earthshots” or environmental goals: “Protect and Restore Nature,” “Clean Our Air,” “Revive Our Oceans,” “Build a Waste Free World,” and “Fix Our Climate.” After a rigorous selection process, the five 2022 winners have finally been announced. Let’s meet the chosen few:\n\nClean Our Air: Mukuru Clean Stoves, Kenya.\n\nSometimes the best solutions are the most quotidian. This start-up provides cleaner-burning stoves to women in Kenya, aiming to prevent them having to cook on open fires and cookstoves, which can fill homes with toxic chemicals and endanger families’ health. This company was founded by women aiming to put a stop to these avoidable deaths.\n\nProtest and Restore Nature: Khetyi, India.\n\nWith each year, India is being forced to adapt to life on the front line of climate change, as severe heat waves and pests devastate certain crops. But there may be a solution: the “Greenhouse-in-a-Box.” Rather than leaving crops exposed to the increasingly harsh elements, this initiative helps some of India’s 100 million small-hold farmers to shelter what they grow in compact greenhouses, which requires less water and increases yields. The scheme has been so successful that Khetyi’s farmers have reported doubling their incomes – and the start-up is hoping to scale up its initiative in the coming years.\n\nRevive our Oceans: Indigenous Women of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia.\n\nWhat do you get when you combine 60,000 years of indigenous knowledge with digital technologies to protect the land and sea? A worthy recipient of this year’s Earthshot Prize. This program is run by indigenous women sharing their wisdom with the next generation of women rangers, as they develop new conservation approaches by telling stories and collating new data. The insights gained from this collaboration are used to continue to protect one of the most important ecosystems on the planet – the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nBuild a Waste-free World: Notpla, United Kingdom.\n\nAlso on the list was a start-up closer to home for William. Notpla, a London-based start-up, aims to wean the planet off its unhealthy addiction to plastic by wrapping produce in seaweed – a natural and biodegradable material. This year alone, Notpla has made over 1 million takeaway food boxes, and aims to replace more than 100 million plastic containers in Europe in the future.\n\nFix our Climate: 44.01, Oman.\n\nRather than allowing CO2 to clog up our atmosphere and warm our planet, two childhood friends from Oman have developed a technique to turn CO2 into rock, so it can be permanently stored underground. That’s right: CO2 doesn’t have to end up as a greenhouse gas, but can be turned into peridotite – a rock commonly found in Oman and elsewhere across the globe. Their start-up is aiming to turn 1 billion tons of CO2 into rock by 2040.\n\nPHOTOS OF THE WEEK\n\nIt’s been a whirlwind three days for William and Kate. While the stateside trip is not an official royal tour, the pair made time for a jam-packed three-day programme so that they could also learn about Boston, put their spotlight onto initiatives in some of its most hard-pressed communities and meet with local indigenous leaders.

Carolyn Sung/CNN\n\nRoyal fans gush over William and Kate.\n\nThey’ve turned out in droves, from near and far, for the chance to witness a real-life royal sighting. Despite some pretty relentless weather conditions this week, crowds have stood by cordons, patiently waiting in layer upon layer for the moment the senior royals emerged. The sun was finally shining on the final day of the visit as eager royal-watchers took up their positions outside the MGM Music Hall at Fenway on Friday afternoon.\n\nOn this cold but beautiful day, college student Lily Christopher was one of the first here, having traveled to the city for the day from Syracuse, New York. “It’s so inspiring how [William and Kate] do this project and these amazing things. I think that it’s important for the environment that they’re getting this incredible awareness,” she told CNN. “It’s important that the environment is shaped and changed so people of our generation are able to enjoy the earth just like previous ones.”\n\nAs the clock ticked closer to the ceremony, the upbeat crowd – which would sporadically break out into song – continued to grow. Jen and Katie Resmini told CNN they took a vacation day to head down from New Hampshire to be here. “I’ve been following William since I was in high school and I’ve always just loved seeing what they do. Kate’s been a great addition to the family. This is like a once-in-a-lifetime thing – when are we ever going to see a future king and queen again?” Katie added.\n\nDON’T MISS\n\nAn artist's impression of the proposed new Chinese Embassy in London. CBRE\n\nChina is planning an embassy in London on land with a royal past. Residents want King Charles to intervene.\n\nResidents of an apartment complex that sits on a historic parcel of land opposite the Tower of London want Britain’s King Charles to buy it back, claiming that its current owner, China, will turn it into a hub for shadowy diplomatic activity.\n\nThe British monarchy sold Royal Mint Court, a 5.4-acre plot that was once home to the facility that manufactured Britain’s coinage, to a property company in 2010. Beijing bought the site in 2018, and now plans to invest several hundreds of millions of dollars transforming it into its new embassy in the UK.\n\nThe Royal Mint Court Residents’ Association, which represents around 300 people living in the buildings, say they are fearful of how China would interpret and implement such rules once its embassy is built next door. China has been accused of using its diplomatic outposts, loosely affiliated community associations, in effect, as overseas police stations to monitor Chinese citizens abroad and coerce them to return home. British lawmakers have expressed concerns over reports of three such premises in the UK.\n\n“I fear a diplomatic incident will occur because the powers available to the Chinese government are far reaching and excessive,” wrote David Lake, chairman of the residents’ group, in a letter to King Charles, seen by CNN.\n\nThe residents want China and the UK to agree a deal to transfer ownership of the part of the freehold that relates to their buildings. “We feel it is wrong for the Chinese government, as a global superpower, to have the same rights over us as Queen Elizabeth had when she agreed our leases,” wrote Lake in his letter to the monarch.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?\n\nSussexes faced ‘disgusting and very real’ threats, ex-counterterror chief reveals.\n\nMeghan and Prince Harry faced “disgusting and very real” threats from right-wing extremists, a former counterterrorism police chief has said. In an interview with Britain’s Channel 4 News on Tuesday, Neil Basu said the threats against Meghan were serious and credible enough that authorities had assigned teams to investigate them. “If you’d seen the stuff that was written, and you were receiving it … you would feel under threat all of the time,” said Basu, who was in charge of royal protection during his time at the Metropolitan Police. “People have been prosecuted for those threats,” said the former Met assistant commissioner.

In the video, O’Brien subjected Varallo-Speckeen to an interrogation that sought to extract a confession. Her tactics are common in law enforcement, but many experts say they can coerce false confessions and should be abandoned.\n\nO’Brien talked over Varallo-Speckeen, interrupted and rejected or cut off denials and repeatedly pushed O’Brien’s theory — that Varallo-Speckeen had broken the legs of the 15-month-old girl.\n\nMaybe she was too rough changing a diaper, or maybe she accidentally hurt the child, O’Brien suggested time and again. Varallo-Speckeen insisted that she wasn’t too rough, that she didn’t hurt the toddler, that she had not changed the baby’s diaper during the hours in question.\n\nAfter nearly two hours in the interrogation room, Varallo-Speckeen relented. It happened when Varallo-Speckeen recalled the moment her girlfriend first said the child’s legs were broken.\n\nVarallo-Speckeen: And so then she was, like, 'Well, her legs are broke,' and then I was confused, like, 'How? How did that happen?' That was my reaction.\n\nO’Brien: OK. So what do you think now?\n\nVarallo-Speckeen: I think it was because I was changing her diaper.\n\nLooking back on that day, July 24, 2013, Varallo-Speckeen, now 26, said she believes O’Brien coerced that confession.\n\nThe detective and Moline police officials declined several requests for interviews over several months about the case and interrogation practices.\n\nO’Brien’s tactics mirrored the Reid Technique of Interviewing and Interrogation, which researchers describe as the gold standard for interrogating suspects. A majority of law enforcement officials are trained to use it or another method based on it.\n\nCritics of the technique say more than a fourth of wrongfully convicted suspects later exonerated with DNA evidence had given a false confession or incriminating statement, according to the Innocence Project, a nonprofit that works to exonerate the wrongly convicted.\n\nSome critics point to policies used in the United Kingdom as an effective and fair alternative. Andy Griffiths, a retired United Kingdom detective superintendent with a doctorate in major crime interviewing, said his country no longer sees cases going to the appeals court because of false confessions.\n\nBut Joseph Buckley, president of John E. Reid & Associates, stands by the technique, saying it is an ethical and efficient way to obtain justice, and he denies that false confessions and the Reid Technique are related.\n\nHow the Reid technique works\n\nTo understand police interrogation techniques, IowaWatch interviewed experts, read police records of the case, analyzed the video and transcript of Varralo-Speckeen’s interrogation and compared it to Reid methods. The video was provided by Sharon Varallo, Varallo-Speckeen’s mother.\n\nStatements heard in the interrogation video indicate that two others and possibly a third were alone with the child during the time in which she was injured.\n\nVarallo-Speckeen had moved from Rock Island, Ill., to Moline after being adopted at age 11 by Sharon Varallo, a college professor. She had been abused as a child. She and Sharon moved to Iowa City, where she graduated from Iowa City High School before they returned to the Moline area. She often worked as a babysitter for different families but rarely held a stable, long-term job.\n\nThe events in July 2013 that put Varallo-Speckeen in an interrogation room began about two months earlier, when she and her girlfriend, Jennifer Schafer, 30, moved into a basement apartment in the home of Schaefer’s friend, Jami Kepple. Kepple’s mother, Kim Linhart, and cousin, Brad Hessell, lived in the apartment upstairs.\n\nAt 5 a.m. on July 22, Kepple took her daughters to the apartment of her mother, Linhart, before leaving for work. Normally, Linhart watched her grandchildren, but Hessell, the cousin, said he watched the girls that day because Linhart was ill.\n\nAround 7:30 a.m., Hessell took the girls downstairs for Varallo-Speckeen and Schafer to watch while he went to work. Hessell told Schafer that the baby was not feeling well and to give her Tylenol. She slept until 11 a.m., when Schafer changed her diaper.\n\n“When I picked her up to change her diaper, she was real fussy,” Schafer told IowaWatch. “Like, every time you moved her, like when I picked up her legs to slide the diaper in and out, she just kind of screamed a little at me; I thought maybe her belly hurt, thought maybe when I pulled her legs up it squished on her belly.”\n\nLater, Schafer took Kepple’s eldest daughter outside to play while the baby and Varallo-Speckeen napped on the couch. When Schafer returned about 45 minutes later, Varallo-Speckeen was awake, but the baby was still sleeping on Varallo-Speckeen’s chest.\n\nWhen Kepple returned from work at 1:30 p.m., she drove the baby to Illini Hospital in Silvis, Ill.\n\n“There was clearly something wrong, but nobody knew what,” Schafer said. “She just wasn’t acting herself.”\n\nSchafer told O’Brien that Kepple said the hospital found nothing wrong with the child.\n\nThe next day, July 23, both of the baby’s legs were swollen, and Kepple took her to Trinity East Hospital in Moline, where staff discovered the child’s legs were broken.\n\nPolice were called, and O’Brien soon focused on Varallo-Speckeen.\n\nThe interview\n\nWhen the Reid Technique was introduced in 1974, it was meant to replace interrogation tactics that involved threats, beatings and even torture. The creator of the technique was a former Chicago detective, John E. Reid, and he had elicited his first confession using it in 1955.\n\nWhether O’Brien had received Reid training could not be determined because she refused repeated interview requests. However, her tactics followed its technique.\n\nStarting with a “behavioral analysis interview,” investigators are taught to ask non-threatening questions to understand the individual’s demeanor, then decide whether they are lying, based on verbal and non-verbal cues.\n\nBut Reid’s opponents say it is impossible to detect deception accurately.\n\n“You simply cannot tell whether a person is lying or telling the truth based on those cues,” said Stephanie Madon, an Iowa State University psychology professor who researches why individuals confess to crimes they didn’t commit.\n\nThe Reid Technique tells interrogators that there is not any one cue or response that can determine deception and that all behavioral cues need to be analyzed.\n\n“But in the course of a high-pressure investigation, these are snap judgments being made by detectives, and they’re often wrong,” said Steve Drizin, legal director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions, which works to exonerate the wrongfully convicted and reform the justice system.\n\nWhy would a person falsely confess?\n\nSome trained in the technique say the behavioral analysis interview causes tunnel vision.\n\n“You’ve already decided a person is guilty, so now you’re looking for confirmation,” said James Trainum, author of How the Police Generate False Confessions and a former Washington, D.C., homicide detective.\n\nTrainum said he realized this after eliciting the confession of a woman he was sure was guilty in 1994. When evidence proved she could not have committed the killing to which she had admitted, he began to wonder what had gone wrong.\n\n“The truth you are trying to get is the truth you believe in,” Trainum said. Reid, he says, focuses too much on confessions and not enough on gathering information.\n\n“That confession is the most powerful piece of evidence in the court of law, and it ends up corrupting the quest for truth,” Drizin said.\n\nHowever, Buckley, the Reid and Associates’ president, said the Reid Technique’s core principles are in place to prevent false confessions. To safeguard against false confessions, interrogators should get corroborating details in the suspect’s written statement.\n\nThe interrogation\n\nIn the interrogation stage, investigators can move through nine steps, starting with directly accusing the suspect of the crime or of knowing something about it.\n\n“So obviously something happened in your care,” O’Brien told Varallo-Speckeen. “Now, do I think it was on purpose? Absolutely not. I don’t think that you guys — or most people — are the type of person who intentionally hurt a baby. I think that type of thing would be an evil person who would do that — I mean, if you’re going to hurt a baby, you would have to be a very mean, evil person and plan that. I don’t think that was the case. I think what happened was an accident.”\n\nThroughout the interrogation in Varallo-Speckeen case, O’Brien told Varallo-Speckeen she was guilty or knew what happened to the baby 36 times.\n\nThe second step of Reid teaches investigators to develop a theme, giving the suspect justification or excuses for committing the crime. Investigators deflect denials by talking over the suspect and using gestures to cut the suspect off.\n\nThey may try to convince suspects a victim provoked the suspects or try to minimize blame by suggesting the crime was an accident or that the behavior was an anomaly for the suspect.\n\nThat tactic leaves suspects with two options: admit to the crime using the given justification or confess without it, leaving the suspect to appear like a monster, Drizin said.\n\nEither way, “innocence is off the table,” he said.\n\nO’Brien presented Varallo-Speckeen with a variety of accidental ways the injuries could have occurred. It was O’Brien’s suggestion that it could have happened during a diaper change, although Schafer and Varallo-Speckeen told O’Brien that Schafer was the only one to change the baby’s diaper on July 22.\n\nWhen Varallo-Speckeen said she didn’t remember doing anything that could have hurt the baby, O’Brien cut her off. In the two-hour interrogation, split between Schafer and Varallo-Speckeen, O’Brien interrupted her 71 times.\n\nReid methodology teaches investigators to share stories about others who have made similar mistakes, a tactic that either minimizes or maximizes the severity of the crime. O’Brien told Varallo-Speckeen about past cases where children had fractured skulls and bleeding on the brain.\n\n“On a scale of things, this is not that severe,” O’Brien said. “Bones heal. Bruises go away. It’s not going to be something that’s going to be a horrible impact for the rest of their life. Unlike when I have babies who are shaken or thrown into walls and they have brain damage — that’s never going to get fixed.”\n\nO’Brien told her repeatedly that Varallo-Speckeen was the only person who had been alone with the baby, although statements given to O’Brien by Hessell, Schafer and Varallo-Speckeen and viewed by IowaWatch show that is not true. Presenting false evidence is another Reid tactic, made legal by the U.S. Supreme Court case Frazier v. Cupp.\n\nInterrogation scholars have pushed to change this law, and in other countries, it is illegal to lie to a suspect about evidence.\n\nO’Brien told Varallo-Speckeen the two of them could plan a way to tell Schafer and Kepple that would put Varallo-Speckeen in a favorable light, that O’Brien wouldn’t throw Varallo-Speckeen “out to the wolves.”\n\n“I can do that for you,” O’Brien said. “But we can’t help you if you don’t help us. And that’s what I need. I need you to help me, so I can help you with this. Because you don’t want me going back and putting you in unfavorable light to them, do you?”\n\nThe confession\n\nAs the interrogation continued, O’Brien repeatedly insisted that Varallo-Speckeen must have broken the baby’s legs while changing her diaper.\n\nAt one point, O’Brien handed her a baby doll, instructing her to demonstrate how she changed diapers. O’Brien watched as Varallo-Speckeen put a diaper on the doll. But O’Brien didn’t accept her demonstration.\n\n‘That wouldn’t be enough force,” O’Brien said.\n\n“Well, that’s how I change diapers,” Varallo-Speckeen responded.\n\nNevertheless, the detective continued pressing, and Varallo-Speckeen began to waiver. If O’Brien believed Varallo-Speckeen was guilty, that must be what happened, she told O’Brien, adding she was willing to take the consequences.\n\nStill, the detective was not satisfied; why would Varallo-Speckeen take responsibility for something she didn’t do, O’Brien asked her.\n\n“I just want it over,” Varallo-Speckeen told O’Brien.\n\nIn an IowaWatch interview, Varallo-Speckeen said: “I feel like I admitted to a story that I was told.”\n\n“I didn’t think I had, but the way she kept telling me that, obviously, I had done it, I was, like, 'Maybe I turned wrong'” and rolled over the baby during their nap. But Varallo-Speckeen said she doubts that because the child never woke up crying.\n\n“I feel like I just agreed to get it off the table, to just get it out of there, to just get it done,” Varallo-Speckeen said. She said she maintains that she never changed the baby’s diaper.\n\nVarallo-Speckeen was charged with felony aggravated battery against a child. Two years later, she accepted a plea bargain, pleading guilty to misdemeanor battery causing bodily harm.\n\n“I’d rather be guilty of the lesser charge and only have to have one to two years of consequences versus going to trial and chancing six to 30 years, where my life is gone for something I know I didn’t do,” she said.\n\nThe month she spent in jail in 2013 was counted toward her sentence, and she remained under court supervision for 12 months.\n\nVarallo-Speckeen says media coverage of the case ruined her reputation, ending her babysitting work and costing her friends.\n\nFollowing the charges, the baby’s mother, Kepple, told Schafer in a Facebook message that she didn’t know who hurt her daughter, that she didn’t trust the police and that she just wanted the baby to be OK. Kepple declined to talk to the press then and declined to comment for this story.\n\nSource of debate\n\nReid critics say other interrogation methods would prevent false confessions and that police need more training in interviewing and interrogating. But Reid’s proponents don’t believe that the techniques cause false confessions, nor that other options would help close cases.\n\nWicklander-Zulawski and Associates, an Illinois consulting firm that has trained thousands of law enforcement officials nationwide, stopped offering Reid training in 2017.\n\nShane Sturman, the company's chief executive officer, said Wicklander-Zulawski officials listened to academics, police interrogation researchers and law enforcement officials and decided the non-confrontational methods they have offered since 1983 work just as well.\n\n“It’s not the Reid method that’s the problem as much as the misuse of the Reid Technique,” Sturman said.\n\n“I do not believe that Reid or anyone else teaching intends to elicit a false confession,” Sturman said, but that the confrontational nature of Reid could explain missteps.\n\nBuckley, the president of Reid & Associates, said if a false confession occurs, it is not a matter of misusing the Reid Technique but rather not using it at all.\n\n“When you research false confessions, the majority of them come when officers participate in inappropriate behavior,” Buckley said.\n\nReid methods say interrogators should treat subjects with respect, not make promises of leniency, threaten physical harm or inevitable consequences, deny their rights or the opportunity to satisfy physical needs.\n\nTrainum, the author and former detective, said a three-day seminar typically offered to law enforcement to be certified in the Reid Technique doesn’t fully cover Reid’s textbook. He said it spends considerable time on core principles and false confessions, but the seminars don’t cover the different issues a detective might encounter.\n\nAt the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy, officers get six hours of interviewing and interrogation training, instructor Molly Jansen said. Any further training would be conducted by local departments, she said.\n\nDavenport Police Chief Brent Biggs said that in the past, many officers attended Reid seminars, but that recently, more go to Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers. There, they learn about eliciting admissions, addressing and mitigating denials, countering interviewee questions, and advanced evidence and theme presentation.\n\nBuckley said that the Reid textbook can’t be covered in the three-day seminar because it is more than 400 pages long, but that the safeguards and principles are. He said police get on-the-job training by spending more time talking to people than anything else they do.\n\nReid critics recommend a technique used by officers in the United Kingdom called PEACE, which is similar to the “Participatory Method” that Wicklander-Zulawski uses, Sturman said. It focuses more on gathering information rather than getting confessions.\n\nSteps to 'PEACE' interviewing\n\nThe PEACE method was developed in the early 1990s through a collaboration of law enforcement experts and psychologists in England and Wales and implemented in response to the U.K.’s Police and Criminal Evidence Act of 1984.\n\nBefore this, Griffiths, the former U.K. detective, said officers weren’t trained in interviewing and interrogation methods. He said the courts threw out several confessions in the 1970s because officers were misbehaving and forcing people to confess. The act gave interviewees more rights, including requiring that all interviews of suspects be recorded.\n\nPEACE follows a five-step approach that focuses on asking interviewees for their version of events and determining if that information is reliable. Interrogators do not accuse suspects of guilt.\n\nNow, every officer learns PEACE in a five-day seminar, and others take another three-week advanced course. A national standard says only advanced interviewers should interview suspects and victims of rape, murder or kidnapping.\n\nIn contrast to PEACE, the Reid interrogator “does all the talking — not the suspect,” Trainum said. “How do you get information if the suspect isn’t talking?”\n\nBuckley, however, contended that PEACE cannot accomplish the goal of solving cases. “They have fewer false confessions, but they also have fewer cases they solve because they have fewer cases where the deceptive person tells them what they did.”\n\nWhen asked for supporting data, Buckley did not provide it.\n\nGriffiths rejected Buckley’s contention. Confession rates before and after PEACE are roughly the same, he said, adding that the United Kingdom always has had a smaller case resolution number because plea-bargaining doesn’t exist there.\n\nRegardless of what causes false confessions, many agree something needs to be done to prevent the imprisonment of innocent people.\n\n“We need to have a major change in the culture in law enforcement, unfortunately,” Trainum said. “Our problem is we are so focused on closing cases and locking up criminals, we kind of lost our perspective that our real goal is to gather information that is admissible and reliable and unbiased.

They will have billboards touting Ohtani all over Southern California. There will be lucrative Japanese advertising in the rotating signs behind home plate at Dodger Stadium. There will be sponsorships. Merchandise. Jerseys. Caps. Licensing. You name it, Ohtani will be on it.\n\nSure, $700 million is a lot of money, but you know what, Ohtani is going to be worth nearly $50 million a year to the Dodgers in marketing and licensing. Ohtani brought in $25 million a year to the Angels, and with the Dodgers, that should be doubled.\n\nOhtani already is making friends by letting everyone know that he’s deferring an “unprecedented\" portion of his contract to provide the Dodgers enough flexibility to be competitive as possible and add even more stars, with the team still pursuing Japanese pitching sensation Yoshinobu Yamamoto.\n\n\"Shohei is thrilled to be a part of the Dodgers organization,\" agent Nez Balelo said in a statement. “He is excited to begin this partnership, and he structured his contract to reflect a true commitment from both sides to long-term success.’’\n\nOhtani’s decision not only has Dodgers’ fans running out to renew their season tickets, but thrills MLB, with the biggest star in the game playing in the second-largest market in America. Nothing against Toronto, perhaps the most beautiful city in North America, but this is where Ohtani belongs.\n\nThe Dodgers are the best-run organization in baseball. They’ve dominated the National League West for 11 years, and should continue to do for at least another decade.\n\nThey now have three of the biggest stars in all of baseball with Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman and Ohtani, winners of five MVP awards.\n\nThey will be must-watch TV, the greatest traveling show in the game, with fans flocking wherever they go.\n\nAnd sure, the critics already are out there.\n\nWho in their right mind would spend $700 million on a DH with no guarantee that Ohtani will pitch again?\n\nOhtani plans to be back in 2025, but he missed nearly two full seasons after his first Tommy John surgery, and now he’s five years older.\n\nNo matter.\n\nThe guy can still hit, and he’s the easily the greatest attraction in the game, where he’ll generate more money than any player who ever put on a baseball uniform. He earned $40 million in endorsements playing for the Los Angeles Angels a year ago. The next highest? Mike Trout at just $5 million.\n\nYep, he has that kind of appeal, and Ohtani realized that it made no sense leaving the comfortable confines of Los Angeles to go anywhere else.\n\nSure, maybe traffic will be a bit tougher if he continues to live in Newport Beach.\n\nHe’s got to get used to a lot more media filling that clubhouse than in Anaheim.\n\nHe’s going to have to talk to reporters more than once or twice a month.\n\nBut, finally, for the first time since coming to the United States, he will be on a winner.\n\nYes, an honest-to-god winning franchise that’s in the playoffs every year.\n\nWelcome back home, Shohei.\n\nYou’re going to love life on the other side of town.\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/mlb/2023/12/09/shohei-ohtanis-contract-record-breaking-sports-history/71816520007/", "title": "Shohei Ohtani's record-breaking contract sits atop impressive list", "text": "Two-time American League MVP Shohei Ohtani is a superstar. Check that, he's a super duper megastar. Not only is he one of the best players in MLB, but he's one of the most marketable athletes of all-time. Wherever he goes, dollars follow. With all that in mind, it was clear months ago that Ohtani was on track to set a new standard in the MLB free agent market, just as his teammate Mike Trout did years ago.\n\nOriginally, reports indicated that Ohtani could earn the first ever $500 million MLB contract. Trout's contract, which was the largest contract in North American sports history when he signed, ended up being 12 years, $426.5 million.\n\nBut Ohtani wound up signing for $700 million with the Los Angeles Dodgers, the two-way star announced on his Instagram Saturday.\n\nHere are some of the other biggest contracts in North American sports history.\n\nBy the numbers:How does Shohei Ohtani's $700M contract compare to other global superstars?\n\nHOT STOVE UPDATES: MLB free agency: Ranking and tracking the top players available.\n\nBiggest contracts in North American sports history:\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers SP/DH Shohei Ohtani (MLB) - $700 million\n\nWhat do you pay for a true two-way player who can knock the cover off the ball and rack up Ks from the mound? The answer seems to be an unequivocal $700 million over 10 years.\n\nAlong with his other accolades, Ohtani is now the winner of the biggest contract in North American sports history.\n\nKansas City Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes (NFL) - $450 million* (not fully guaranteed)\n\nPatrick Mahomes earned this contract in 2020 after winning his first Super Bowl, a 31-20 victory over the San Francisco 49ers. Since then, Mahomes has led his team to three consecutive AFC Championship Games as well as two Super Bowls and one Super Bowl victory. Oh, he also earned another MVP award along the way.\n\nLos Angeles Angels OF Mike Trout (MLB) - $427 million\n\nTrout signed this contract in 2019. He was the first player in North American sports history to eclipse $350 million and he blew that figure out of the water.\n\nPrior to his contract, Trout had earned two American League MVP Awards and was top-five in voting every year of his career. Trout earned a third AL MVP in his first year under the new contract, but has constantly battled injuries since then.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers OF Mookie Betts (MLB) - $365 million\n\nIn three full seasons since signing his contract, the former American League MVP has recorded two top-five MVP finishes. He has also raised his average, home runs and OPS+ every season.\n\nCanelo Alvarez, DAZN (Boxing) - $365 million\n\nFor the small, small price of $365 million, streaming service DAZN earned the rights to stream 11 of Alvarez's fights over the following five years.\n\nAlvarez signed that deal in 2018. It's now 2023, and all 11 fights have come and gone. Alvarez went 10-1 with his only loss coming to Dmitry Bivol on May 7, 2022.\n\nNew York Yankees OF Aaron Judge (MLB) - $360 million\n\nFresh off an AL MVP award and setting the AL home run record (62), Judge signed a massive contract. He even reportedly turned down a bigger offer from the San Diego Padres in order to stay in New York.\n\nIn his first year under the new contract, Judge battled injuries but still managed to smack 37 dingers and finish 15th in AL MVP voting in just 106 games.\n\nSan Diego Padres 3B Manny Machado (MLB) - $350 million\n\nMachado opted to leave the Los Angeles Dodgers for a different SoCal team prior to the 2019 season. He struggled in his first season with the Padres, but put it all together in 2020, 2021, and 2022, leading his team to the NLCS in 2022 as well.\n\nMachado did not put together his typical MVP-caliber season in 2023, but still managed a 115 OPS+ and 30 home runs.\n\nNew York Mets SS Francisco Lindor (MLB) - $341 million\n\nIn three seasons with the Mets, Lindor has recorded two top-ten MVP finishes. Too bad the Mets have not been able to do anything in the postseason.\n\nSan Diego Padres OF Fernando Tatis Jr. (MLB) - $340 million\n\nThe Padres thought they scored a great deal when they agreed to this contract with Tatis. He rewarded them with 42 home runs and a top-three NL MVP finish in 2021. Unfortunately for the Padres, Tatis was caught using performance-enhancing drugs and was suspended in 2022. Somehow, the Padres reached the NLCS without him.\n\nTatis returned in 2023 and set career-lows in batting average (.257), on-base percentage (.322), slugging percentage (.449), and OPS+ (113).\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies OF Bryce Harper (MLB) - $330 million\n\nAlthough Bryce Harper has just one All-Star appearance in five years with the Philadelphia Phillies, he has been one of the best players in baseball when healthy. He not only won an MVP award in 2021, but has a multitude of electric postseason moments that have put him in the upper echelon of all-time postseason performers.\n\nHarper helped lead the Phillies to the World Series in 2022 and his team was one game away from returning in 2023, but lost in Game 7 to the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nNew York Yankees DH Giancarlo Stanton (MLB) - $325 million\n\nAfter securing the NL MVP Award in 2017, Stanton donned pinstripes. His tenure with the Yankees has been defined by injuries though. In 2023, Stanton hit under the Mendoza line. Although his power is still elite, he's swinging and missing more than ever before.\n\nTexas Rangers SS Corey Seager (MLB) - $325 million\n\nAfter a lackluster first year with Texas, Seager went berserk in 2023. He finished second in AL MVP voting and helped lead the Rangers to their first ever World Series win. Seager was named World Series MVP as well.\n\nNew York Yankees SP Gerrit Cole (MLB) - $324 million\n\nCole has been arguably baseball's best pitcher since signing this deal in 2019. He has finished top-ten in Cy Young voting every season and finally earned the first Cy Young of his career in 2023 after leading the league in both ERA (2.63) and innings pitched (209).\n\nBoston Red Sox 3B Rafael Devers (MLB) - $314 million\n\nAlthough Devers had one of his worse seasons in 2023, he still raked, recording a 126 OPS+ and 33 homers in his first season under the new contract. That said, he also posted his lowest slugging percentage in three years.\n\nBoston Celtics SF Jaylen Brown (NBA) - $304 million\n\nBrown earned this contract after recording 26.6 PPG in 2022. Brown has cooled off in 2023, but is still scoring a solid 22.2 PPG. He is the second-leading scorer on the best team in the Eastern Conference. Although more was expected of him, it's hard to argue he's not living up to his price tag.\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies SS Trea Turner (MLB) - $300 million\n\nEven though Trea Turner had a down season in 2023, he rallied in the second half to help lead the Phillies to their second consecutive NLCS. Phillies fans may have even turned Turner's season around after refusing to give up on him after his rocky first half.\n\nIn the second half of the season, Turner posted a triple-slash of .292/.348/.554 with 16 home runs. If he can keep up that pace moving forward, this deal will be one of the best in baseball.\n\nSan Diego Padres SS Xander Bogaerts (MLB) - $280 million\n\nIn his first season with the Padres, Bogaerts put up a respectable 120 OPS+, but did not live up to his lofty contract. Bogaerts posted his fewest RBIs (58) in a season since 2014 and poste his lowest OPS (.790) since 2017.\n\nColorado Rockies 3B Nolan Arenado (MLB) - $260 million\n\nArenado signed this massive deal and was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals a year later. As always, Arenado has continued to play stellar defense at the hot corner and finished top-three in NL MVP voting in 2022.\n\nDenver Nuggets C Nikola Jokic (NBA) - $276 million\n\nWhat hasn't Jokic done? Two-time MVP, NBA champ, NBA Finals MVP. Jokic has already lived up to this contract and he's only been under that contract for a year and a half.\n\nNew York Yankees 3B Alex Rodriguez (MLB) - $275 million\n\nThis is the oldest contract on the list.\n\nAlthough Alex Rodriguez's career has been defined by his PED usage now, he was clearly one of the best players in baseball when he signed this contract following an AL MVP in the 2007 season. Rodriguez never reached that height again, but was well-worth every penny.\n\nCoincidentally, Rodriguez also signed a $252 million deal with the Texas Rangers in 2000. He almost made this list twice.\n\nT-No. 20 Cincinnati Bengals QB Joe Burrow (NFL) - $275 million\n\nBurrow signed this contract prior to the 2023 NFL season. In his first three seasons prior to the contract extension, Burrow led the Bengals to two AFC Championship Games and a Super Bowl appearance. Burrow also finished fourth in NFL MVP voting in 2022.\n\nBurrow battled injuries at the beginning of 2023 which led to a very slow start. Just as he was picking things up, he suffered a season-ending injury to his throwing hand.\n\nWhere is Ohtani playing next season?\n\nShohei Ohtani shared on his personal Instagram that he has decided to play with the LA Dodgers.\n\nEmbedded content: https://www.instagram.com/p/C0pR_vyvLpR/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\n\nWill Ohtani pitch next season?\n\nOhtani is recovering from elbow surgery on his pitching arm, and therefore, will not be able to pitch until the 2025 season. His bat alone makes this deal very worth it for the Dodgers though.\n\nLatest on Shohei Ohtani:Braves a potential spot; Dodgers among favorites", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/dodgers/2023/12/11/shohei-ohtani-contract-los-angeles-dodgers-heavy-deferrals/71885939007/", "title": "Shohei Ohtani deferring 97% of massive $700 million contract with ...", "text": "Shohei Ohtani’s 10-year, $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers is actually worth $460 million because of its heavy deferrals, according to MLB’s calculations, a high-ranking executive with direct knowledge of the contract told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThe person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the exact terms of the deal hadn't been made public.\n\nOhtani will be paid just $2 million a season for 10 years, two persons with direct knowledge of the contract said, with the deferred payments beginning in 2034 with no interest.\n\nThe persons all spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details of the contract have not been officially announced.\n\nThe deferred payments, easily the most in baseball history, permits the Dodgers to lower their luxury-tax salary from $70 million to just $46 million a year. The annual salary is calculated at $28 million because of the 10% interest rate used by the Basic Agreement.\n\nHOT STOVE UPDATES: MLB free agency: Ranking and tracking the top players available.\n\nIt was Ohtani’s idea to keep the payment low, two persons close to baseball star said, enabling the Dodgers to keep adding players to their payroll without the worry of luxury tax repercussions.\n\nOPINION:Why Ohtani will be worth every penny of $700 million contract for Dodgers\n\n“The concept of the extreme deferrals in this contract came from Shohei himself,’’ a person close to Ohtani said. “He had been educated on the implications and process of deferrals and felt it was the right thing to do. So, when negotiations were getting near the level where they ended up, Shohei decided he wanted to defer almost all of his salary.’’\n\nStill, it’s a staggering discount, with the contract worth about $387 million in today’s market, according to a 4% inflation rate that is used by the players union.\n\nYet, considering Ohtani earned about $40 million in endorsements last year, easily a record for a baseball player, it’s hardly as if it will affect his modest lifestyle. Besides, deferring such a massive amount of money saves Ohtani from paying about 13.3% in California state taxes. If he moves from California after his contract expires, he’ll avoid the high taxes. Effective on Jan. 1 the state income tax rate increases to 14.4%.\n\nOPINION:In MLB's battle to stay relevant, Ohtani's contract is huge win for baseball\n\nOhtani’s decision to defer the $680 million certainly indicates how badly he wanted to play for the Dodgers. Finalists like the Toronto Blue Jays, San Francisco Giants, Los Angeles Angels, and Chicago Cubs could have easily matched such a team-friendly deal, but Ohtani wanted to stay in Southern California after spending the last six years with the Angels.\n\nDodgers officially announce Shohei Ohtani signing\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers released a long statement on Monday night officially announcing the team's 10-year deal with Ohtani.\n\n\"On behalf of the L.A.

In this time, Murray could not specifically be \"engaged in any other activity that may distract his attention (for example, watching television, playing video games or browsing the internet) while such material is being displayed or played.\"\n\nArizona eventually removed the clause from Murray's contract.

Our confidence in Kyler Murray is as high as it's ever been and nothing demonstrates our belief in his ability to lead this team.\"\n\nIchirzo Suzuki's rent clause\n\nBy 2007, Suzuki had racked up a sizable number of awards. Six consecutive All-Star game and Gold Glove awards as well as one AL MVP and AL Silver Slugger nod in his first six seasons in the majors.\n\nDespite the Seattle Mariners' struggles at the time, Suzuki signed a five-year, $90 million extension with the team. Clauses in that deal included a personal trainer, interpreter, four round-trip airline tickets to Japan each year, and either a new Jeep or Mercedes SUV.\n\nBut most unusual of all, Suzuki received at least $32,000 per year as a housing allowance. Current median Seattle rent prices aren't too far from that but in 2007 that was a big boost to ensuring Suzuki had his pick of housing options.\n\nMichael Jordan's 'love of the game' clause\n\nJordan enjoyed unprecedented success on the court: six NBA titles, five NBA MVPs, 14 All-Star teams, two Olympic Gold Medals, and an NCAA title, among many other accolades. The icon could seemingly do no wrong on the court.\n\nHe didn't want to confine himself to just NBA or international basketball courts and even got that in writing. Jordan had a \"Love of the Game Clause\" written into his contract with the Chicago Bulls that allowed him to play basketball against anyone, anywhere, at any time.\n\nRick Mirer's 'end of the world' clause\n\nA three-year starter at quarterback in college, Mirer wrapped up his Notre Dame career with comparisons to fellow Irish legend Joe Montana. The Seattle Seahawks drafted Mirer second overall in the 1993 NFL Draft.\n\nMirer finalized his deal with the Seahawks and one phrase made him the subject of jokes during training camp. Mirer's deal stated that he gets paid under all conditions, \"up to and including the end of the world.\"\n\nLuckily, he didn't need to find out what American dollars would be worth post-apocalypse. Mirer played four seasons with the Seahawks and didn't live up to lofty expectations, going 20-31 as a starter.\n\nMonica Abbott's crowd clause\n\nAbbott is one of the best pitchers in American softball history, winning two Olympic Medals and three Women's Softball World Cup gold medals. Her NCAA records for strikes and wins still stand 15 years after she graduated from the University of Tennessee.\n\nShe started her professional career in the National Pro Fastpitch (NPF) softball league in 2007. By 2015, she'd won three MVP awards and four championships.\n\nSo it's no surprise the expansion Scrap Yard Dawgs signed her to the first million-dollar contract in league history ahead of the 2016 season. The six-year, $1-million contract started out as just $20,000 yearly. With a salary cap of $150,000 per year, the Houston-area team had to get creative to meet the $1 million total.\n\nThe solution? Attendance bonuses requiring at least 100 fans at the game, regardless of location or whether or not Abbott was pitching. It paid off with a championship for the expansion team in 2017.\n\nBig market prices:The Shohei Ohtani effect: Jersey sales, ticket prices soar after signing coveted free agent", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2023/12/10/shohei-ohtani-rumors-free-agent-mlb-reporters/71867634007/", "title": "Shohei Ohtani free agency hysteria should be reckoning for MLB ...", "text": "Shohei Ohtani, baseball’s most glorious talent, one that we may never see again, has managed to bring out the absolute worst in us.\n\nWe baseball writers have disgraced ourselves, becoming an embarrassment to the journalism community.\n\nIn our breathless quest to be first on where Ohtani would sign his free agent contract, it was comical that Ohtani broke his own news Saturday on his Instagram account.\n\n\"BREAKING NEWS: Ohtani signs 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers; baseball writers still following private plane\" would have made a good headline.\n\nWe have made fools of ourselves plenty of times before in the history of baseball media, anywhere from criticizing the integration of the sport, to calling Ohtani a fraud in his first spring training, but we have taken this to new heights.\n\nHOT STOVE UPDATES: MLB free agency: Ranking and tracking the top players available.\n\nLook no further than the Friday news cycle.\n\nIt was reported early Friday morning that Ohtani’s decision was imminent.\n\nWell, that was news to Ohtani and his agency, who had a private appointment later in the day, and knew there would be no announcement.\n\nIt’s then reported that there’s a private plane, a Bombardier Global 5000, that leaves John Wayne Airport in Orange County at 9:10 in the morning and arrives at 3:54 p.m. at Toronto Pearson International Airport.\n\nOhtani was still sleeping at his home in Newport Beach when the flight took off, but that didn’t stop furious reporting, with TV and radio reporters tracking the flight in real time. There were nearly 3,500 people monitoring the plane on FlightRadar24, which was the most watched flight in the world.\n\nEarly in the afternoon, a Los Angeles writer reports that Ohtani has chosen to play for the Toronto Blue Jays, and it would be officially announced Friday evening.\n\nThe report is immediately shot down as being inaccurate but, hey, what about that flight?\n\nA national reporter goes on the air, which is also splashed on TV, saying that Ohtani is definitely on a flight to Toronto.\n\nA photographer from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is hurriedly dispatched to the tarmac, ready to shoot historic pictures of Ohtani’s steps off the plane, which would have been a giant leap for all of Canadian baseball-kind.\n\nOnly to watch Canadian entrepreneur Robert Herjavec, a Shark Tank judge, stepping off the plane.\n\nOhtani never left his house in Southern California.\n\nThe night ended and no decision was made.\n\nThe only thing that happened during the day was us embarrassing ourselves and infuriating baseball fans even further.\n\nWhat in the world are we doing?\n\nHere are Ohtani and his agent, Nez Balelo, operating in total radio silence, but we were so pompous and arrogant that we actually criticized the way they were handling their free-agent negotiations.\n\nWe would rather have them leaking the teams involved in the bidding, reporting who’s in, who’s out, and wildly throwing out numbers to see if we can have teams bidding against themselves.\n\nThe way Ohtani conducted his free agency should be praised, not criticized.\n\nMy God, it was so refreshing not having Ohtani and Balelo leak a single thing, and actually announce their own signing, complete with the contract figures.\n\nLet’s stop kidding ourselves into believing we are a conduit to fans in the offseason, delivering information on their favorite teams and favorite players.\n\nWe are being used and don’t mind, even embracing it.\n\nYou know how many of these stories are leaked by agents? Try 95%. Maybe higher.\n\nTeams can not divulge their free agent signings until the player passes his physical, so they keep their mouths shut. It doesn’t stop the agents from gladly revealing where his player is going to one reporter, offering the terms of the contract to another reporter, and giving opt-outs and incentives to the next.\n\nIf the team leaks it, they could be on the hook if the player flunks the physical. Why do you think MLB scolded Mets owner Steve Cohen last year when he publicly revealed that they signed Carlos Correa, before he didn’t pass his physical? The San Francisco Giants had the same medical issue with Correa, couldn’t say a word, and were lambasted for backing out.\n\nYou would think the Correa saga would discourage leaks, but they are more prevalent than ever before in this game.\n\nYou ever wonder why you’ll frequently see someone report that a player has been traded to a team without knowing what players are coming back in return? It’s nothing more than the agent telling the reporter that his client was traded, having no idea, of course, what other players were involved in the trade.\n\nWe can accurately predict which reporters will be breaking which free agent signings the rest of the winter, judging by a reporter’s relationship with an agent or a reporter who’s represented by the same agency.\n\n“It’s unbelievable as to how certain members of the media promote clients of certain agencies,\" one veteran agent said, “and more shameful is the fact there is little to no media accountability. No wonder why we have so many clubs and industry personnel being misled.\"\n\nOh, you’re telling us there are 10 teams involved in the free agent bidding for your client? Sure, we’ll tweet it. It’s now down to two teams, but the offers keep getting bigger? Sure, we’ll go with it.\n\nAnd once that contract is complete, and you were among the first to report it, you better believe we’ll hype your deal and tell everyone it was a stroke of genius, helping indirectly to recruit other clients.\n\nWe have agents who flat-out lie to us, but teams are prohibited from calling them out because of language in the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nI could report right now that the Kansas City Royals are the mystery team in the Ohtani sweepstakes, and have told Ohtani they will out-bid everyone for his services.\n\nAnd the Royals legally cannot publicly dispute it, according to the collective bargaining agreement. You’re permitted to say you’re interested in a free agent, but you can’t say you don’t want the player, and don’t even come close to offering your opinion on what a free agent may be worth on the open market.\n\nSorry, those are the rules, and if someone lies to us, we fall for it.\n\nLook, false reports happen. They’ll always happen in this age of social media with the burning desire to be first. You hear something, quickly judge the accuracy for yourself, and put it out there in a haste.\n\nI’ve been there, done that.\n\nNope, Trevor Bauer did not sign with the New York Mets. Just like Aaron Judge didn’t go to the Giants. Max Scherzer and Trea Turner weren’t traded to the San Diego Padres. And the Yankees never flipped Alex Verdugo to the San Diego Padres after acquiring from the Boston Red Sox.\n\nThis past week at the winter meetings, I tweeted that Chicago Cubs slugger Christopher Morel’s name surfaced in trade talks with the Tampa Bay Rays for pitcher Tyler Glasnow. Well, they’re engaged in trade talks and while the Rays may want Morel, I had received incorrect information and his name was never mentioned.\n\nJed Hoyer, Cubs president of baseball operations, who was on his way to address reporters in their media scrum, stopped me, and told me that I was wrong: Morel was not involved in the talks. They won't trade a prized commodity for a one-year rental in Glasnow.\n\nThe conversation lasted eight, maybe nine seconds.\n\nNext thing you know, a Chicago reporter breathlessly goes on his radio station and says that Hoyer and I got into a heated argument over the Cubs’ interest in Ohtani. The reckless report pops up on a Chicago website, and it goes viral.\n\nNever did Ohtani’s name come up. Never did Hoyer raise his voice.\n\nNever did this reporter ask Hoyer or myself what happened.\n\nInstead, hundreds of baseball executives, officials, agents and players came asking what happened, with our brief conversation getting exaggerated to the point that it was said we nearly came to blows. This of course set off vitriol across the internet.\n\nWe can’t even accurately report on ourselves now, let alone real baseball news.\n\nIt’s time we take a deep breath, and check ourselves before we further wreck ourselves.\n\nWe’ve caused enough damage, provoked heartache and have been irresponsible with fans’ emotions.\n\nIt’s a time to slow our roll – myself included – before we lose all of our credibility.\n\nIf we learned anything in this Ohtani hysteria, we should remind ourselves of the values and ethics of journalism that we learned when we broke into this business, and become more cautious, careful and accurate when delivering news.\n\nIt’s time to restore our values.\n\nLet’s make sure our embarrassing Black Friday never happens again.\n\nAround the basepaths\n\n– Prized free agent pitcher Yoshinobu Yamomoto is finding himself in a dream situation having the New York Yankees, Mets and Dodgers all clamoring for his services.\n\nMets owner Steve Cohen and president David Stearns flew to Japan to meet with Yamomoto last week and the Yankees are scheduled to meet with him Monday.\n\nThe price-tag for Yamomoto, including posting fees, is now likely to reach $300 million, one high-ranking MLB official said.\n\n– No team, publicly or privately, said they were engaged in trade talks with the Mets for All-Star first baseman Pete Alonso during the winter meetings, but several GMs believe the Mets will listen to offers.\n\nIf the Mets were fully intent in keeping Alonso, they have a funny way of showing it.\n\nThey have not had any talks of a long-term contract extension.\n\nAlonso, who’s represented by Scot Boras, is a free agent after the 2024 season.\n\n– Chicago White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf created a stir, and plenty of wild rumors, when he had dinner with the Nashville mayor Freddie O’Connell.\n\nBut no, the White Sox are not moving to Nashville.\n\nYes, Nashville remains a contender for expansion franchise with an ownership group led by Dave Stewart, who is a friend of Reinsdorf’s.\n\n– The Milwaukee Brewers are now expected to retain Cy Young winner Corbin Burnes instead of trading him, still wanting to compete for the NL Central title.\n\n– Scott Boras, who brought up the idea of a contract extension for Bryce Harper after Manny Machado turned his opt-out into an 11-year, $350 million extension this spring, should get his wish once they can figure out a fair price for paying him after his contract expires after the 2031 season when he’s 39 years old.\n\n“He feels that he’s been there five years, he’s showed them who he is and why he is a franchise player,” Boras said. “I think he’s changed in the player community how players view Philadelphia. Consequently, he came and said, ‘This is something I want off my mind. I want to know this is done because I know that I want to play well beyond the contract that I have.’”\n\nHarper’s contract pays him an average of $25.38 million, which ranks just 24th in baseball.\n\n“Bryce has certainly expressed to them that he wants to end his career in Philadelphia,” Boras said.\n\n– The Arizona Diamondbacks are hopeful of signing free-agent DH J.D. Martinez now that the Dodgers no longer need him, with Justin Turner also in play.\n\n– Clint Hurdle was all set to join Angels manager Ron Washington’s staff as bench coach, but Hurdle could never bridge the financial gap. There would have been at least 15 bench coaches earning more money if he had accepted the job, despite 17 years of managerial experience.\n\n– Chicago Cubs manager Craig Counsell’s record-setting, five-year, $40 million contract, may last only one year.\n\nSeveral teams have already expressed strong interest in Red Sox manager Alex Cora, who’s a free agent after the season.\n\n– Yankees GM Brian Cashman shrugged at the notion that Juan Soto could be only a one-year, $33 million rental, saying, the “future is always now.’’\n\n“Just another manifestation of the Steinbrenner legacy,” Cashman said. “I think George Steinbrenner always felt that the best players in the world should play here for the New York Yankees.’’\n\n– Now that Shohei Ohtani got $700 million, any guesses what Scott Boras will be asking for when Juan Soto hits the market?\n\n– Kudos to veteran Yankees scouting director Damon Oppenheimer, who stockpiled enough pitching talent to acquire Soto and outfielder Alex Verdugo from Boston. Why, if you include the Rule 5 Draft, the Yankees relinquished 10 pitchers.\n\n– How slow were the winter meetings?\n\nSeveral veteran executives said it was the least amount of action, or even trade talk, they had ever witnessed in their tenures.\n\nOne executive said his team met with only one team the entire time to discuss a trade.\n\n“Never seen anything like it,\" one official said.\n\n– The Twins continue to receive inquiries in Max Kepler and Jorge Polanco, who are on the trade block.\n\n– The Texas Rangers, who could lose their local TV rights deal, would love to have starter Jordan Montgomery back, but the price tag may be too high for their liking.\n\n– Funniest moment of the winter meetings: Jim Leyland, after meeting with the media on Monday after the Hall of Fame announcement, asked an official if he could step away in a private room for a quick smoke.\n\n“Jim, you’re a Hall of Famer,\" the official said, “you can smoke wherever you want in this place.’’\n\n– Agent Scott Boras, when asked if the Baltimore Orioles have reached out to discuss contract extensions for Gunnar Henderson and Jackson Holliday: “Only once or twice a day.’’\n\n– The Baltimore Orioles have never signed a free agent to a contract longer than one year since Mike Elias became a free agent.\n\nIf they want to put a stranglehold on the AL East, they need to start.\n\n– While everyone is talking about the home-run numbers left-handed slugger Juan Soto will have at Yankee Stadium with their short right-field porch, after hitting 35 last season in San Diego, it’s worth noting that he’s not a pull hitter.\n\nHe hit 196 balls into the air last season, according to Statcast, and just 49 balls (25%) were hit to right field. He hit 86 balls (44%) to center field and 61 balls (31%) to left field.\n\nSo, unless he changes his hitting approach, he suddenly isn’t going to start hitting homers like Aaron Judge.\n\n– The Dodgers spent one night during the winter meetings at the 100-acre ranch of country music star Brad Paisley.\n\n– Fabulous move by the Hall of Fame will honor Black baseball history with an East-West Classic in Cooperstown during Memorial Day weekend: A Tribute to the Negro Leagues All-Star Game. Hall of Famers Ken Griffey Jr. and Ozzie Smith will be the managers.\n\nThe Negro Leagues’ East-West All-Star Game debuted at Chicago’s Comiskey Park in 1933 and was played annually through 1962.\n\n“The East-West All-Star Game was he annual showcase for the Negro Leagues, and we are privileged to be able to honor the legacy of those stars,” former Cy Young winner CC Sabathia said. “As players, we are indebted to the pioneers who came before us, and recognizing the All-Stars of the Negro Leagues pays tribute not only to their playing ability but also to their courage and devotion to the game.”\n\nSabathia, who’s eligible to be inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2025, says he also can’t wait for the San Francisco Giants-St. Louis Cardinals’ game in June at historic Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Ala.\n\n“Hopefully there’s a kid out there that is watching the game and sees the players like, ‘Hey, I want to be like that,’” Sabathia said. “That was me with Dave Stewart. I got a chance to see Dave Stewart when I was 9 years old. He walked into my Boys & Girls Club and changed my life.\n\n“So just being able to be visible in these communities, especially in Birmingham, it’s super important for us to be able to tell those stories and be visible in that community.”\n\n– You know times have changed when the Orioles didn’t take a player in the Rule 5 Draft for the first time in 18 years.\n\nThat’s what happens when you win 101 games and have no room to protect a minor-leaguer on the major-league roster all season.\n\n– Yankees ace Gerrit Cole has an opt-out in his contract after this season, but the Yankees can eliminate that by tacking on a $36 million salary in 2029, bringing his total to $360 million over 10 years.\n\n“We would anticipate that those things are going to happen,” said Scott Boras, Cole’s agent.\n\n– Stephen Vogt on being hired as the Cleveland Guardians’ new manager after his playing career ended only a year ago: “The best way I would describe it is I got thrown into the deep end of the pool with my hands tied behind my back. I’m kicking ... and I’ve got one arm out so I’m able to get to the surface now.”\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2023/12/13/shohei-ohtani-to-be-introduced-at-dodger-stadium-on-thursday-after-record-700-million-deal/71909114007/", "title": "Shohei Ohtani to be introduced at Dodger Stadium on Thursday ...", "text": "BETH HARRIS and RONALD BLUM\n\nAP\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Shohei Ohtani can opt out of his $700 million, 10-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers if either of two key executives is no longer in place, a person familiar with the agreement told The Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\nOhtani, who will be formally introduced by the Dodgers at a news conference Thursday, would be allowed to terminate his deal if Mark Walter no longer is controlling owner or president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman no longer is with the team, the person said. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the terms were not announced.\n\nOhtani's deal, announced Monday, provides that 97% of the money be deferred without interest and not fully paid until 2043.\n\nThe Athletic first reported Wednesday that Ohtani's deal contained a provision allowing him to opt out at the end of a season if the Dodgers made specific personnel changes.\n\nThe deal is still in the form of a letter of agreement between Ohtani's representatives and the team, and a formal contract has not been submitted to Major League Baseball, the person said.\n\nHOT STOVE UPDATES: MLB free agency: Ranking and tracking the top players available.\n\nLed by Walter, the private partnership Guggenheim Baseball Management purchased the Dodgers in 2012 for $2.15 billion. In his early years as controlling owner, Walter was a regular at Dodger Stadium. But his presence gradually decreased and last season he attended only a handful of games.\n\nWalter's global financial services company, Guggenheim Partners, has headquarters in Chicago and New York. He is a native of Iowa.\n\nFriedman was hired by the Dodgers in 2014 after spending a decade with the Tampa Bay Rays. He gradually rebuilt that franchise and the team reached the World Series in 2008 despite operating with one of the sport's lowest payrolls.\n\nFriedman has an enviable record in Los Angeles, with the Dodgers winning nine division titles under his leadership, three NL pennants and the 2020 World Series during the pandemic-shortened season. He overhauled the club's farm system and reorganized and expanded the front office.\n\nOhtani’s contract calls for annual salaries of $70 million and of each year’s salary, $68 million is deferred with no interest, payable in equal installments each July 1 from 2034-43.\n\nMLB proposed as part of bargaining on June 21, 2021, to ban deferred compensation, but the union rejected the concept and MLB dropped it.\n\nOhtani will be introduced during a news conference in Dodger Stadium's Centerfield Plaza starting at 3 p.m. PST.\n\nMLB reported Wednesday that Ohtani broke Fanatics' record for the highest jersey sales within the first 48 hours of a release, topping soccer stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Ohtani was out of sight at the stadium on Wednesday, meeting with teammates, including seven-time All-Star outfielder Mookie Betts and reliever Joe Kelly.\n\n“I had a chance to talk to him,” Kelly said, surrounded by kids attending an outdoor holiday party with music blaring. “He was already working out, already grinding, getting bigger and stronger. His arm looked good to me.”\n\nOhtani’s deal includes a full no-trade provision and provides for a hotel suite on road trips, a premium luxury suite for home games and a fulltime interpreter. Ohtani will donate to the Dodgers’ charity an amount not to exceed 1%.\n\nOhtani last spoke with reporters on Aug. 9, two weeks before a pitching injury that required surgery and will keep him off a mound until 2025. He had the operation on Sept. 19, but the nature of the surgery was not fully announced. Ohtani had Tommy John surgery on Oct. 1, 2018.\n\nA unique two-way star as both a hitter and pitcher, the 29-year-old left the Los Angeles Angels as a free agent after six years.\n\nKelly is switching uniform numbers after finalizing his $8 million, one-year contract with the team on Monday, opening No. 17 for Ohtani, who thanked him for the gesture.\n\n“I wasn't going to give it up to just anybody,” Kelly said. “If Shohei keeps performing, he'll be a future Hall of Famer and I'll be able to have my number retired. That's the closest I'll get to the Hall of Fame.”\n\nAsked what Ohtani was giving him in return, Kelly said, “Oh, there's a list, but no comment.”\n\nOhtani spoke infrequently to the media during his years in Anaheim, leaving his teammates to be peppered with questions about the enigmatic superstar.\n\nKelly said he was prepared to entertain Ohtani questions “maybe once a week.”\n\nOhtani’s move from Anaheim to Hollywood has sent fans on both sides of the Pacific Ocean flocking to buy Dodgers merchandise and inquire about tickets on the secondary market. The team has yet to begin single-game ticket sales for next season.\n\n“It's going to be sold out every game,” Kelly said. “Every game that we’re a part of is going to be like a playoff atmosphere.”\n\nAhead of his 30th birthday on July 5, Ohtani has a .274 batting average with 171 homers, 437 RBIs and 86 stolen bases along with a 39-19 record with a 3.01 ERA and 608 strikeouts in 481 2/3 innings. Ohtani has 34.7 Wins Above Replacement (WAR), per Baseball Reference.\n\n“I think all around it’s a good gig for both parties,” Kelly said. “The Dodgers are competitive every year and this is one of those things, he’s the highest-paid player in all of sports, and we’re still going to be able to add to our team every single year he’s a Dodger.”\n\nThere are three different evaluations of what the contract is worth in present-day dollars.\n\n— For purposes of the luxury tax, a 4.43% discount rate is used and the value is $460,767,685. That is the federal mid-term rate as defined in Section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, using the October 2023 rate. The figure means the Dodgers' luxury tax payroll will be charged about $46.1 million annually for Ohtani.\n\n— For purposes of MLB regular payrolls, a 10% discount rate is used and the value is $282,107,876. That is the J.P. Morgan Chase prime rate plus 1% rounded to the nearest full percentage point, as defined in Article XV (K) of the collective bargaining agreement.\n\n— The players’ association evaluated the contract at $437,830,563.\n\n___\n\nBlum reported from New York.\n\n___\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2023/12/11/ohtani-s-dodgers-contract-has-680-million-deferred-lowering-tax-value-to-46-million-annually/71886106007/", "title": "Ohtani's Dodgers contract has $680 million deferred, lowering tax ...", "text": "RONALD BLUM\n\nAP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Shohei Ohtani will receive just $20 million of his $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers over the next 10 years, with $680 million payable from 2034-43 in an unusual structure that gives the team greater payroll flexibility in coming seasons.\n\nOhtani's record-setting deal, agreed to Saturday, calls for annual salaries of $70 million, according to details obtained by The Associated Press. Of each year's salary, $68 million is deferred with no interest, payable in equal installments each July 1 from 2034-43.\n\nFor purposes of baseball's luxury tax, the contract is valued as a yearly addition to the Dodgers' payroll of about $46 million. Under the collective bargaining agreement, for the calculation of a team's tax payroll the value of deferred money is discounted at the federal mid-term rate. For all agreements this offseason, the discounting will be at the October 2023 rate of 4.43%.\n\nOhtani's deal includes a full no-trade provision and provides for a hotel suite on road trips, a premium luxury suite for home games and a fulltime interpreter.\n\nA unique two-way superstar as both a hitter and pitcher, the 29-year-old Ohtani left the Los Angeles Angels as a free agent to sign with the Dodgers in a deal they announced Monday night.\n\nHOT STOVE UPDATES: MLB free agency: Ranking and tracking the top players available.\n\n“Dodger fans, thank you for welcoming me to your team,” Ohtani said in a statement released by the club. “I can say 100 percent that you, the Dodger organization and I share the same goal — to bring World Series parades to the streets of Los Angeles.”\n\nOhtani's contract, combined with those of Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, raises the Dodgers' total of deferred money owed to the three to $857 million from 2033-44.\n\nBetts has a $365 million deal covering 2021-32 that includes $115 million in deferred salaries payable from 2033-44 and has the final $5 million of his signing bonus payable from 2033-35.\n\nFreeman has a $162 million, six-year deal for 2022-27 that includes $57 million in deferred money payable from 2028-40.\n\nLos Angeles' high points of the deferred payments are 2038 and '39, when the trio will be owed $83 million, and 2040, when they will be due $84 million.\n\nBy receiving the vast majority of the money when he presumably will not be living in the United States, Ohtani also figures to have a tax benefit. California's top tax rate for residents is 13.3%.\n\nThe two-time AL MVP has a string of endorsement deals that significantly add to his earnings beyond his baseball salary.\n\n“On behalf of the L.A. Dodgers and our fans everywhere, we welcome Shohei Ohtani to the Dodgers, the home of Jackie Robinson, Sandy Koufax and Hideo Nomo, three of the sport’s most legendary and pathbreaking players,” said Mark Walter, chairman of the Dodgers and Guggenheim Baseball. “Shohei is a once-in-a-generation talent and one of the most exciting professional athletes in the world.\"\n\nOhtani’s total dollars are 64% higher than baseball’s previous record, a $426.5 million, 12-year deal for Angels outfielder Mike Trout that began in 2019.\n\nHis $70 million average salary is 62% above the previous high of $43,333,333, shared by pitchers Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander with deals they struck with the New York Mets. Ohtani’s average salary nearly doubles the roughly $42.3 million he earned with the Angels. It also exceeds the entire payrolls of Baltimore and Oakland this year.\n\nHowever, for the luxury tax he will count only slightly more than Aaron Judge, who is a $40 million annual charge to the Yankees' payroll as he enters the second season of a $360 million, nine-year contract.\n\n“Shohei Ohtani is a generational player and it was an honor to watch him make history throughout the six seasons he spent in an Angels uniform,” the Angels posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\n“We feel extremely fortunate that Angels fans were able to witness him redefine what is possible in our sport.

{"question_id": "20231215_5", "search_time": "2023/12/16/02:27", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/politics/biden-2024-intention-reelection/index.html", "title": "Biden says it's his 'intention' to run again in 2024 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Friday that while he has not made a formal decision about running for reelection in 2024, it is his “intention” to do so.\n\n“The reason I’m not making a judgment about formally running or not running, once I make that judgment, a whole series of regulations kick in and I have to be – I treat myself as a candidate from that moment on. I have not made that formal decision, but it’s my intention – my intention to run again. And we have time to make that decision,” Biden told MSNBC’s Jonathan Capehart in an interview at Delaware State University in Dover.\n\nThe question of Biden’s political future will be front-and-center for Democrats after November’s midterm elections, in which the party is fighting to keep control of Congress. Already, the President’s responses to whether he will mount another bid for the White House have injected questions into the developing 2024 race.\n\nLast month, Biden said it was “much too early” to make the decision on whether he would run again for president in 2024, opening the door to potentially not seeking another term.\n\nAt 79, Biden is already the oldest president in American history and, as CNN previously reported, his public schedule has before led to questions about how extensive a campaign he’d engage in if he runs.\n\nOn Friday, the President said that first lady Dr. Jill Biden thinks that the work they are doing is “very important.”\n\n“Dr. Biden thinks that – my wife – thinks that I – that we’re – that we’re doing something very important, and that I shouldn’t walk away from it,” Biden said.\n\nAsked what his late son Beau Biden would say to people who think the President is too old to run, Biden said: “It’s not so much [what] he’d say to those people. What he’d say to me in my view. The only reason to be involved in public life is can you make life better for other people. And depending on who the opponent is, if they have a view that is such the antithesis of what I believe democracy and I believe is good for average Americans, then his argument was, Dad, you have an obligation to do something.”\n\nIn the wide ranging interview, Biden also vowed to use his veto power to protect reproductive rights if Republicans win control of Congress in the midterms and pass laws to outlaw abortion nationwide.\n\nAsked how he would “protect women,” Biden said he would “veto anything” that Republicans put forward to restrict access to the procedure.\n\n“For them to outlaw Roe, outlaw the right of a woman to make a choice with their doctor, to not make exceptions for rape, and incest, and et cetera, and pass it out of the Congress to make it the law of the land, the president has to sign it. I’ll veto it,” Biden said of Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed a federal constitutional right to abortion until the Supreme Court overturned the ruling in June.\n\nThis comes after the President sought to mobilize voters in his party this week by promising to sign a law to codify abortion rights in January if voters elect more Democrats in order to ensure such legislation could pass.\n\nThe President’s vow echoed remarks from earlier in the week when he said of the prospect of a Republican-controlled Congress passing a bill banning abortions nationwide: “If such a bill would pass in the next several years, I’ll veto it.”\n\nOn the economy and inflation, the President brushed off polls showing the majority of voters disapprove of the direction of the economy, saying that “a lot of what we’ve done and we’ve passed has not kicked in yet.”\n\nHe argued the GOP does not have a plan to address Americans’ economic concerns, saying: “They don’t have a platform other than to tear down what I’ve been able to do, we’ve been able to do. And I don’t know what they’re for.”\n\nBiden also doubled down on his criticisms of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s recent comments calling into question the future of US aid to Ukraine.\n\n“I can understand somebody having that view who is uninformed, and believe it, because it costs so much money to help them,” Biden said Friday. “But there’s so much more than Ukrainians. It’s about NATO, about Western Europe. It’s about making sure that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is not able to succeed in a way that he is using the brutality of his activities.”", "authors": ["Sam Fossum Sonnet Swire", "Sam Fossum", "Sonnet Swire"], "publish_date": "2022/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/politics/biden-news-conference-midterms/index.html", "title": "Biden says midterm vote was a 'good day for democracy' and notes ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn his first speech since polls closed around the country Tuesday night, President Joe Biden called out detractors who he said doubted his “incessant optimism” about Democrats’ ability to stave off resounding Republican wins in the midterm elections – even as his presidency is now likely entering a new period of divided government.\n\nThe results, he said during a press conference at the White House Wednesday, are a sign American democracy is intact, despite coming under threat over the past several years.\n\n“We had an election yesterday,” Biden said. “And it was a good day, I think, for democracy.”\n\n“Our democracy has been tested in recent years, but with their votes, the American people have spoken and proven once again that democracy is who we are,” he continued, adding that “while the press and the pundits are predicting a giant red wave, it didn’t happen.”\n\nThe results were neither the “thumping” George W. Bush described during his own post-midterms press conference in 2006 nor the “shellacking’” Barack Obama said Democrats endured in 2010.\n\nInstead, the failure of a so-called “red wave” to materialize Tuesday night had Biden appearing confident, reflecting the mood of Democrats, including those inside the White House, who are feeling enthused and vindicated following an election season where the president’s political aptitude was questioned. At the time of Biden’s remarks, CNN has not been able to project the future majorities of the House or the Senate.\n\nThe president did concede that the results are not a ringing endorsement of his approach. Voters, he said, “were also clear that they are still frustrated. I get it. I understand it’s been a really tough few years this country for so many people.”\n\n“While any seat lost is painful … Democrats had a strong night. And we lost fewer seats in the House of Representatives than any Democratic president’s first midterm election in the last 40 years. We had the best midterm for governors since 1986,” Biden remarked.\n\nThe president, who turns 80 later this month, also said he is not in “any hurry” to announce a bid for reelection in 2024, reiterating that his timeline remains “early next year.”\n\n“Our intention is to run again. That’s been our intention, regardless of what the outcome of this election was,” he told reporters. Still, Biden added, he’s “a great respecter of fate,” calling another run “a family decision.\n\n“I think everybody wants me to run, but we’re gonna have discussions about it,” he said.\n\nAnd Biden had a message to those opposed to another presidential bid: “Watch me.”\n\nThe future of both parties\n\nThe president said he will be inviting leaders of both parties in Congress to the White House to discuss where they can work together when he returns from his upcoming overseas trip, adding that he’s prepared to work with elected Republicans on a number of issues. “The American people have made clear, I think, that they expect Republicans to be prepared to work with me, as well,” he added.\n\nStill, Biden drew a red line on a number of Republican proposals, saying he’d veto legislation he thinks could make inflation worse, cuts to Social Security and Medicare, as well as any attempt to introduce a national ban on abortion.\n\nBiden said he plans to speak with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy – who is mounting a run for House speaker – later on Wednesday.\n\nThe results appeared more likely to prompt soul-searching among Republicans than Democrats, as former President Donald Trump teases an imminent announcement that he is running for the White House again. Many of the candidates Trump endorsed in toss-up races lost or were locked in contests that were too early to call.\n\nFor his part, Biden said on Wednesday that he does not plan to do anything differently in the second half of his presidential term. Instead, he said as his agenda items begin taking effect, Americans would come to see their benefit.\n\n“They’re just finding out what we’re doing,” the president said. “The more they know about what we’re doing, the more support there is.”\n\nStill, Biden and his team still face the prospect of a difficult two years of governing should Republicans seize control of the House. The President’s agenda would likely be sharply curtailed without a Democratic majority. And Republicans have promised investigations into Biden’s administration and family.\n\nBiden said he believes the American public wants the government to “move on and get things done for them,” not lead investigations into him, his family or his administration.\n\n“It’s just, almost comedy,” Biden said of the possible probes. “I can’t control what they’re going to do. All I can do is continue to try to make life better for the American people.”\n\nExit polls also indicated still-simmering dissatisfaction among voters at the country’s economic health. Around three-quarters of voters nationally said the economy is “poor” or “not good,” and the same share said that inflation has caused them severe or moderate hardship. About two-thirds said that gas prices have been causing them hardship.\n\nVoters have a dour view about the way things are going in the country generally, with more than 7 in 10 saying they are “dissatisfied” or “angry.”\n\nFor the president, improving the country’s pervasive dark mood will be an ongoing challenge despite Democrats outperforming expectations Tuesday. Without a majority in the House, his tools to accomplish that will be more limited.\n\nBiden spent most of his campaign season focused on economic issues, including areas he’d taken action to reduce costs. But he drew some criticism, including from some Democrats, for expanding his closing message to including abortion rights and a defense of democracy.\n\nHeading into Tuesday, Biden advisers were prepared to defend the tactic and were prepared with historic data showing Democrats faring better this year than in previous midterm cycles, which typically result in losses for the sitting president’s party.\n\nUltimately, however, Biden is likely to avoid the finger-pointing and second-guessing. Even with the House losses, this year’s results are among the best for the party in power in recent memory.\n\nBy comparison, Democrats lost 54 seats in 1994, when President Bill Clinton was in office. And Obama’s first midterm election saw his party lose 63 seats.\n\nBiden addresses foreign policy issues and Elon Musk’s influence\n\nSpeaking in front of the press on Wednesday, Biden addressed challenges with two of the nation’s biggest foreign adversaries – China and Russia.\n\nBiden said the timing of Russia’s announcement on retreating from the city of Kherson, Ukraine, was “interesting.”\n\n“I find it interesting they waited until after the election to make that judgment, which we knew for some time they were going to be doing, and it’s evidence of the fact that they have some real problems – the Russian military,” Biden said. He added that where the withdrawal leads and “whether or not Ukraine is prepared to compromise with Russia” remain to be seen.\n\nBiden also said he was told that Russian President Vladimir Putin was not likely to attend the upcoming G20 summit in Indonesia. He also told reporters that he’s hopeful Putin will be more willing to discuss the release of WNBA star Brittney Griner, who remains detained in Russia, now that the elections are over.\n\nBiden confirmed expected talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping at next week’s G20 summit. Biden said he’s not planning to make any “fundamental concessions” and that they will discuss the economy and trade. But he declined to reveal what his message would be on US military support to Taiwan should China move on the self-governing island.\n\n“I’m gonna have that conversation with him,” Biden added, noting that they’ll lay out “what each of our red lines are.”\n\nThe president also told reporters that Twitter owner Elon Musk’s relationship with other countries was “worthy of being looked at,” but declined to say how that could be done.\n\n“I think that Elon Musk’s cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at, whether or not he is doing anything inappropriate,” Biden said, when asked if Musk was a threat to national security. “But that’s all (I’ll) say.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Maegan Vazquez", "Kevin Liptak", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/politics/kevin-mccarthy-house-gop-ukraine-funding-blank-check/index.html", "title": "Inside the House GOP effort to keep weapons flowing to Ukraine ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nAfter House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested last week that Republicans might pull back funding for Ukraine next year if they take the majority, the GOP leader has worked behind the scenes to reassure national security leaders in his conference that he wasn’t planning to abandon Ukraine aid and was just calling for greater oversight of any federal dollars, sources told CNN.\n\nMcCarthy told key Republican national security committee members – some of whom reached out to McCarthy – that his comments that Ukraine wouldn’t get a “blank check” in a Republican majority were being taken out of context, the sources said. Rather, McCarthy told his members he was simply saying that a GOP-led House would not automatically rubber-stamp a request from the administration for additional Ukraine aid.\n\n“McCarthy was not saying, ‘We wouldn’t spend money.’ McCarthy was saying, ‘We’re gonna be accountable to the taxpayer for every dollar we spend,’” one GOP lawmaker familiar with McCarthy’s thinking told CNN. “A ‘blank check’ means that people get whatever they ask for. What we’re saying is there’s going to be some thought, there’s going to be accountability, and taxpayer dollars are going to be used appropriately.”\n\nMcCarthy’s effort to soothe the House’s senior defense hawks, which has not been previously reported, underscores the fine line the aspiring speaker is walking on foreign policy as the war in Ukraine appears poised to grind into a second year. But it also offers a preview of the types of policy and political battles to come between the establishment and pro-Trump wings of the GOP, presenting a tricky balancing act — and potential headaches — for Republican leaders in a House majority.\n\nUkraine has led to messy politics for Democrats as well. On Monday, Progressive Caucus leader Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state abruptly withdrew a letter pushing the Biden administration to pursue diplomacy in Russia’s war with Ukraine, an about-face following furious internal backlash from Democrats.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Liberal Democrats abruptly withdraw letter on Ukraine policy amid anger 02:56 - Source: CNN\n\nGOP sources told CNN they believe that only a small faction of Republican lawmakers — the midterm elections will determine how many — are opposed to funding Ukraine’s battlefield efforts. What’s more likely to likely face cuts under a GOP majority, sources said, is the economic assistance and other non-military aid going to Ukraine, like the aid money going to the United Nations to help Ukraine rebuild its country and the money going to USAID to support Ukraine’s budget.\n\nIf Republicans win back the House, GOP sources say they are likely to ramp up overall oversight of the billions of dollars in aid going to Ukraine, such as examining end-use tracking of weapons. CNN has previously reported that the Biden administration doesn’t have perfect visibility into how or where US-provided weapons are used once they cross the border into Ukraine.\n\n‘Listening to Russian disinformation’\n\nStill, senior congressional Republicans who support robustly funding Ukraine’s war are watching warily as some more isolationist-minded colleagues have become increasingly vocal in recent weeks that they will heavily scrutinize – if not outright oppose – US money for Ukraine.\n\nFifty-seven Republicans in the House and 11 in the Senate voted against the $40 billion Ukraine aid bill in May. Some vocal GOP opponents like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Chip Roy of Texas jumped on McCarthy’s recent comments to argue that a Republican majority should scale back aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe anti-aid crowd also has influential voices like Fox’s Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump Jr. who have advocated for cutting off aid to Ukraine altogether.\n\n“They’re strong. Amongst Republicans, I call it the ‘Tucker Carlson’ effect,” the lawmaker said of House GOP skeptics. “I love Tucker on other issues, but he’s wrong on this. He’s listening to Russia disinformation. And he’s creating problems for us in our districts.”\n\nMcCarthy can’t afford to alienate or ignore the noisy skeptics in his conference who have raised concerns about indefinitely funding Ukraine’s war against Russia – whose votes he will need to become speaker, especially if Republicans win a narrow majority.\n\n“McCarthy cracked the door open here. He is leaning more towards our direction of pulling back. You also have Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham banging the drum on this,” said a source familiar with the ongoing discussions about Ukraine aid who favors tighter purse strings.\n\nA McCarthy spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n‘Bloated bureaucracy’\n\nLast week, McCarthy told Punchbowl News, “I think people are going to be sitting in a recession, and they’re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine.”\n\nThe comments prompted frantic outreach on Capitol Hill from Ukrainians and European allies alike, sources told CNN, intensifying long-running concerns that a Republican majority in Congress threatens to hamper US support for Ukraine’s war against Russia.\n\nThey also led some GOP national security hawks to begin planning a campaign for after the midterm election to ensure that the US doesn’t abandon Ukraine. That includes preparing a combination of education for their new and skeptical colleagues as well as examining ways to increase oversight of where the money and weapons are going inside Ukraine.\n\nTo help convince skeptics, Republicans are looking to tap former Trump administration national security leaders as expert voices – rather than Biden administration officials. Some of the voices that Republicans are considering bringing in to speak to new members include former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger, sources said.\n\n“They need to hear from people they trust. The administration isn’t necessarily the best messenger for this,” said one GOP congressional aide.\n\nThey’re also planning to hold briefings from Republican think tanks with conservative bona fides like the Heritage Foundation, congressional trips to the region and direct engagement with Ukrainian and European officials as part of an education campaign.\n\n“I don’t think the issue is one of lack of support of aid from Ukraine. It’s a signaling that Republicans do things differently,” Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican in line to chair the House Intelligence Committee next year, said in an interview with CNN.\n\nTurner, who just returned from a bipartisan congressional meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine, argued the bills that Democrats passed this year – such as a $40 billion aid package in May – included extraneous funding that he criticized as a “bloated bureaucracy,” such as money that went to the UN.\n\n“Kevin McCarthy supports providing weapons systems to Ukraine to continue to win on the battlefield,” Turner said in a roundtable with reporters on Monday.\n\nA Ukrainian serviceman as seen on a US-provided HIMARS artillery piece on July 1, 2022 in Eastern Ukraine. Anastasia Vlasova/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nDespite confidence among GOP hawks that they have the upper hand over the caucus’ more isolationist wing, lawmakers are beginning to lay the groundwork to convince new members in particular that the military support is vital spending.\n\nCongressional Democrats on national security committees told CNN that McCarthy’s comments didn’t raise major alarm bells – yet – as they still believe there’s significant support for Ukraine among their Republican colleagues. One Democrat noted that Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell is a stalwart supporter of funding Ukraine’s war – and the Senate often gets its way in funding fights.\n\n“There’s the Reagan block and there’s the Trump block. And the Reagan block wants to help,” said another House Democrat who works on national security issues. McCarthy, the Democrat said, was “signaling that he’s going to have resistance and it’s not going to be easy.”\n\nThe ‘Three Mikes’\n\nIn the House, the pro-Ukraine effort is likely to be led by the “three Mikes” poised to become committee chairmen: Turner of Ohio on Intelligence, Mike McCaul of Texas on Foreign Affairs, and Mike Rogers of Alabama on Armed Services.\n\nFrom left, US Reps. Mike McCaul, Mike Turner and Mike Rogers CQ-Roll Call, Inc/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAnother key voice will be Rep. Kay Granger of Texas, a defense hawk who is expected to become House Appropriations chairwoman in a Republican majority.\n\nIf he becomes chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, McCaul is considering holding his first hearing next year on Russian war crimes, according to one congressional source, to hammer home the egregiousness of Russia’s actions in Ukraine.\n\n“We’ve got to give them what they need. The Ukrainians, when we give them what they need, they win,” McCaul said on Bloomberg TV last week. “I do think you have broad bipartisan support for what’s happening in Ukraine, but I think you’ll see if we get the majority, more oversight and accountability in terms of the funding and where the money is going.”\n\nThe defense hawks are expected to make the case that the war with Russia goes beyond Europe. They argue that the US needs Ukraine to win in order to deter China from invading Taiwan, for instance. One senior Republican noted that Iranian drones now being used on the battlefield show how the war extends far beyond Ukraine’s borders.\n\nThe Ukrainians are also likely to make their own case directly to Congress. Ukrainian legislators and other top officials have held meetings with their American counterparts since the war began, telling US lawmakers that it is cheaper to invest in Ukrainian defense now than to defend Europe against wide-ranging Russian aggression later.\n\n‘Only for our country’\n\nUkraine skeptics both in Congress and on the campaign trail – along with influential outside voices – are preparing to ramp up their own campaign to try to curtail or outright stop the flow of US dollars to Ukraine.\n\nRepublican criticism of funding Ukraine has largely focused on the high costs of prolonging the war, as well as concerns about corruption in Ukraine and the need to devote more resources to domestic challenges. Earlier this month, the House Freedom Caucus wrote to McCarthy urging him to stand up a special inspector general on US involvement in Ukraine.\n\nGreene, a far-right Georgia Republican, posted a video on Twitter last month saying, “There is a country’s border that he (Biden) cares about and it is not this country’s border, it is Ukraine’s border. I believe our American tax dollars need to be used only for our country while we have so many problems, security crises.”\n\nAfter McCarthy’s comments last week, Rep. Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican who is seeking a House leadership post next year, tweeted, “A Republican-led House will put the needs of America first. We cannot continue with unlimited spending for any foreign nation while our people are struggling to get by here at home.”\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Rep Jim Banks of Indiana, at a press conference in June 2022. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Senate GOP conference could also soon have new members who have been vocal opposing the aid, such as J.D. Vance, the Senate GOP nominee in Ohio. “I think we’re at the point where we’ve given enough money in Ukraine, I really do,” Vance told local Ohio television station 13abc last month.\n\nBut McConnell also weighed in last week with a statement urging the Biden administration and US allies to “be quicker and more proactive to get Ukraine the aid they need” – comments that were in stark contrast to McCarthy’s statement and a sign that McConnell expects Senate Republicans to continue to support Ukraine’s war.\n\nDan Caldwell, vice president of foreign policy at Stand Together, a conservative non-profit that opposes open-ended spending in Ukraine, said those advocating for scaling back support to Ukraine are also gearing up to make their voices heard with new members in what’s expected to be a Republican-controlled Congress.\n\n“During the first few weeks of the new Congress, new members will have a lot of people trying to convince them to not keep their campaign promises to oppose interventionist policies in Ukraine,” Caldwell said. “Our community will make the argument to these members that not only is pursuing a more realist approach to Ukraine good policy, it is also good politics – especially considering domestic economic challenges and more important foreign policy priorities in other parts of the world.”\n\nLame duck funding push\n\nThe looming fight over Ukraine aid could come even before Republicans take control of Congress next year, as the Biden administration is considering pushing through another major Ukrainian assistance package before the end of 2022, administration officials told CNN. So far this year, Congress has approved more than $65 billion in aid toward Ukraine. While the administration believes that Republicans are unlikely to completely curtail support for Ukraine, they see value in locking in support now before things could get more challenging.\n\n“End of the year funding in Washington is going to be the wild, wild West of spending, especially if Republicans win the House,” Turner told reporters Monday, adding that Republicans could oppose a bill with extraneous items attached.\n\nRegardless of what it can get approved during the lame-duck session, the Biden administration will likely have to come back to Congress at some point next year to ask for money.\n\nWhile there is an acknowledgment that oversight will have to ramp up when reconstruction in Ukraine begins – which could be needed even before the war ends due to just how much help Ukraine will need – many congressional aides and administration officials believe that additional layers are not necessary at this time.\n\nEstonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur argued there already is clear accountability when it comes to weapons getting onto the battlefield.\n\n“I understand their position to have more accountability. I also have information from (Joint Chiefs Chairman) Gen. (Mark) Milley, who said to me that there is more of an accountability as ever, regarding the help sent to Ukraine, because they even have a barcode system to track basically each shipment which was sent to Ukraine,” he said. “I believe this is exactly what also Republicans want to hear that yes, there is accountability.”", "authors": ["Kylie Atwood Jeremy Herb Katie Bo Lillis Melanie Zanona", "Kylie Atwood", "Jeremy Herb", "Katie Bo Lillis", "Melanie Zanona"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/politics/biden-blue-states-midterm-election-analysis/index.html", "title": "Biden faces years of acrimony if Democrats get a midterm election ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nJoe Biden’s midterm pitch is increasingly stark and alarmist as he grapples for momentum in an election seemingly slipping away from Democrats that could land him with a Congress inflicting two years of misery on his White House.\n\nThe President was on the road Thursday – not in one of the most pivotal Senate swing states – but in New York to tout semiconductor manufacturing. The fact that he showed up in a state he won by more than 20 points two years ago shows how his low approval ratings limit his capacity to help his party climb out of a hole.\n\nBiden simultaneously argued that the economy was in far better shape than most Americans judge it to be and that if they win power next month, Republicans will crash what he framed as a recovery and put Medicare and Social Security on the chopping block.\n\nHis approach reflected the extraordinarily testing election environment facing Democrats, who are in danger of losing their control of the House of Representatives as their hopes of clinging onto the Senate appear to ebb.\n\nEleven days out from the election, Republicans are targeting deep blue territory that would enable them to build a wave that could translate into a significant House majority. Republicans only need a net gain of five seats to flip the chamber, and they could win enough seats in the Empire State alone to do that, CNN’s Harry Enten wrote Thursday.\n\nAnd races that will decide the fate of the Senate also appear to be narrowing, like in Arizona, for instance, where Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly once had a clear lead. Democrats were also rattled this week by a shaky debate performance by Pennsylvania Senate nominee John Fetterman, who is still facing auditory and processing issues after a stroke. The commonwealth represents the party’s best chance to pick up a seat and could be critical to their hopes of holding control of the 50-50 Senate, where Vice President Kamala Harris casts the tie-breaking vote. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, in a conversation overheard with Biden and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Thursday, said he thought the Pennsylvania debate “didn’t hurt us too much,” but expressed concern about the high-profile race in Georgia, saying it’s the state “where we’re going downhill.”\n\nThe loss of either chamber could be disastrous for the President, who is bracing for a barrage of Republican investigations targeting his administration, his handling of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the business affairs of his son, Hunter Biden, who is under investigation by the Justice Department.\n\nThere is sufficient uncertainty in polling following recent elections that it is far too early to properly judge the state of the race. But Biden’s speech on Thursday reflected Democrats’ burden in this election and suggested that the historical pattern of first-term presidents getting a midterm election drubbing may be reasserting itself, after his party nursed hopes of bucking the trend this summer in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nBiden is essentially being forced to make a case to Americans, who polls show are sour on the economy, that things are not as bad as they seem.\n\nHis speech demonstrated the political impossibility of highlighting undeniably positive aspects of the economy – including hopeful GDP growth figures released Thursday and a historically low jobless rate – when inflation is raging at near 40-year highs.\n\nBiden’s warnings of fierce political fights with Republicans over entitlements and government spending in a possible showdown over raising the debt ceiling, meanwhile, served as a preview for what may be acrimonious years to come in Washington if political control is split between the parties.\n\nThe President warned that GOP control of Congress would set off a “ticking time bomb” under the economy.\n\n“They’re coming after Social Security,” Biden said at his event in Syracuse.\n\n“They’re going to shut down the government, refuse to pay America’s bills for the first time in American history to put America in default… unless we yield to their demands to cut Social Security and Medicare.”\n\n“Nothing will create more chaos or do more damage to the American economy,” the President said, admitting that Democrats always charge Social Security is at risk in elections but also arguing that proposals by Republican Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin this time really do threaten the retirement program.\n\nAdministration counsels patience but voters are hurting now\n\nBiden’s speech made a case that when they come to full fruition, his policies will repair decades of declines in manufacturing and American industry. He argued that his signature bills passed during a legislative hot streak, including a bipartisan infrastructure measure, a law meant to ignite US semiconductor production and another that builds a clean energy economy, would bring jobs and prosperity. He declared that his social spending measure passed over the summer would make Americans more prosperous since it would cut some long-term health care costs.\n\nBut the issue is that all of those measures – if they succeed – will not unspool in time to be felt in this election. There’s a chance they could help Biden in 2024 if he decides to run for reelection, but for now, they are aspirational.\n\nCNN/SSRS polls this week in battleground states reflect the almost impossible political situation facing Democrats in races for Congress and governor.\n\nSome 47% of voters in Wisconsin, 46% in Michigan and 44% in Pennsylvania said that the economy and inflation was the most important issue affecting their vote. In each state, this more than doubled the number of those most exercised about the next-highest-ranking issue – abortion. Democrats had hoped outrage over the Supreme Court decision would have neutralized their economic liabilities heading into the November 8 election.\n\nAll the available evidence 11 days out suggests that it is not happening as Republicans lean into economic and crime messaging.\n\nThe latter has even made the gubernatorial race in New York – which hasn’t elected a Republican statewide in two decades – unexpectedly competitive. Biden was with Hochul on Thursday in Syracuse, which is also home to a competitive House race.\n\nIn a sign of the urgency, Democrats are deploying perhaps their best weapon: former President Barack Obama, who is making a five-state tour beginning in Georgia on Friday night and has recorded nearly two dozen television commercials for Democrats and the party’s campaign committees, with new ads popping up nearly every day this week.\n\nGood news on growth Biden’s economic disconnect\n\nBiden rode into his day on the back of some unexpected good news – the economy bounced back in the last quarter at an annualized rate of 2.6%, according to initial estimates. Biden held up the figures as “further evidence that your economic recovery is continuing to power forward.”\n\nThe problem, however, is that the President was conjuring a vision of an economy that many Americans do not recognize. The disconnect between the two realities – of an economy that is performing strongly in many areas, according to data, and the lived experience out in the country – could well doom Democrats.\n\nThis election is turning out to be an object lesson in the pernicious political impact of inflation – a force that many adult Americans have never experienced since it last cast its dark shadow over everyday life back in the 1980s.\n\nWhen a voter’s income is not keeping up with their costs, especially for the staples of everyday life like meat, bread, eggs and gasoline, they are bound to look for scapegoats. And Biden, as the president in power, gets the blame.\n\nBiden blames outside factors for the hike in living costs, including Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, which also pushed up gasoline prices – though these are now easing – and the aftermath of supply chain disruption during the pandemic. Republicans blame Biden for flushing the system with billions of dollars in cash and sending the economy into an overheating cycle.\n\nIn an interview with CNN’s Phil Mattingly on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen counseled patience since many of the measures the administration has taken to boost the economy will take time to come on line.\n\nBut she admitted, “Inflation is very high – it’s unacceptably high and Americans feel that every day,” in the interview broadcast on “Erin Burnett OutFront.”\n\nThe President finds himself in the familiarly difficult spot of trying to claim credit for the encouraging aspects of the economy while empathizing with the pain many Americans are feeling. When he was vice president in the Obama administration, the White House faced a similar problem. The economy was slowly coming back after the Great Recession but many Americans didn’t feel it at a time of high unemployment. Obama argued in the run-up to the midterm elections in 2010 that handing control of Congress to the Republicans would be like giving the keys of the car back to the people who drove it into a ditch. But voters weren’t happy and Republicans seized control of the House and made big gains in the Senate.\n\nNow Biden must tread a similar political tightrope on the punishing cost of living.\n\n“People are still struggling with inflation. I grew up in a community, in a place where when my dad would say, at the end of the month, if you – what you’re making didn’t cover all your expenses, you were in real trouble,” Biden said in a virtual fundraiser this week for Iowa Rep. Cindy Axne, who faces a tough reelection.\n\n“And even though inflation is lower here than in most advanced countries, I know that’s no solace to someone sitting at the kitchen table, trying to put food on the table,” the President said.\n\nHis comment showed that Biden understands acutely the problem that appears increasingly likely to doom Democrats this election season.

Gentlemen, we interfered, we interfere and we will interfere,” Prigozhin said.\n\n“Carefully, precisely, surgically and in our own way, as we know how. During our pinpoint operations, we will remove both kidneys and the liver at once,” he added.\n\nPrigozhin has no post in the Russian government, but his statement appeared to be the first admission of a high-level Russian campaign to interfere in US elections from someone close to the Kremlin.\n\nPrigozhin is reportedly one of Putin’s trusted confidants – so close that the Russian press dubbed him the “chef” to the Russian President after he began catering events for the Kremlin. Prigozhin subsequently won lucrative catering contracts for schools and Russia’s armed forces, and by 2010 he was a Kremlin insider with a growing commercial empire.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how serious Prigozhin was being in his comments, which appeared to have been made somewhat sarcastically. But the US has sanctioned Prigozhin for funding the Internet Research Agency, a notorious Russian troll farm accused of meddling in several recent US elections. Prigozhin was also charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States in 2018 by special counsel Robert Mueller in relation to the alleged election meddling.\n\nThe Kremlin has been accused of interfering in US elections since at least 2016, when Russia-linked hackers successfully hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Those documents were released during the homestretch of the campaign to embarrass the Democratic nominee.\n\nUS officials and prosecutors warned of similar hacking attempts and disinformation campaigns by Russia ahead of the 2020 presidential elections and Tuesday’s contest. Private researchers said Thursday that suspected Russian operatives have used far-right media platforms to denigrate Democratic candidates in Georgia, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\nRussian government officials, including Putin, have consistently denied interfering in American politics.\n\nUS officials appeared unsurprised by Prigozhin’s admission of election interference.\n\nState Department spokesperson Ned Price said it “didn’t tell us anything we didn’t already know.”\n\n“His full confession, if anything, appears to be just a manifestation of the impunity that crooks and cronies enjoy under President Putin and the Kremlin,” Price said at a State Department briefing.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said it’s “not surprising” that Russia is attempting to promote narratives “aimed at undermining democracy.”\n\n“We also know that part of Russia’s efforts includes promoting narratives aimed at undermining democracy and sowing division and discord. It’s not surprising that Russia would be highlighting their attempted efforts and fabricating a story about their successes on the eve of an election,” Jean-Pierre added.\n\nShe, however, did not weigh in on whether there are any ongoing attempts by Russia to influence the midterm elections, directing that question to the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nPrigozhin for years operated mostly in the shadows and behind the scenes. In recent months, however, he has developed a more public persona, possibly due to shifting power balances inside Russia as losses in Ukraine piled up.\n\nIn September, Prigozhin admitted to founding the Wagner Group – a private mercenary group accused of war crimes in Africa, Syria and Ukraine – after years of denying involvement with the outfit.\n\nMore recently, US and European officials alleged that Prigozhin is attempting to use the faltering war effort to jockey for increased influence in the Kremlin. Prigozhin reportedly confronted Putin directly about his belief that the conflict is being mismanaged.\n\nThe Kremlin has denied that officials have criticized the management of the war.", "authors": ["Uliana Pavlova"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/mike-pence-book-trump-january-6/index.html", "title": "Pence details fracture with Trump over his refusal to overturn 2020 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence wrote in his new memoir that former President Donald Trump warned him days before the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol that he would inspire the hatred of hundreds of thousands of people because he was “too honest” to attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nThe comments are part of the vivid ending of Pence’s new memoir, “So Help Me God.” It’s being released as Trump prepares what an aide has said will be the launch of his 2024 presidential campaign Tuesday night at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nPence has also hinted at his own potential 2024 run, recently telling ABC News he thinks “we’ll have better choices in the future” than Trump. But in his memoir, he largely defends Trump – touting the former president’s achievements, downplaying controversies and excusing Trump’s personal vendettas, including against the late Arizona Sen. John McCain.\n\nStill, Pence – who said Trump was “reckless” with his tweet attacking his vice president that day – was critical of Trump over the events surrounding the insurrection, writing that he told Trump directly afterward that he was angry and that what he’d seen that day infuriated him.\n\n“The truth was, as reckless as the president’s tweet was, I really didn’t have time for it. Rioters were ransacking the Capitol,” Pence wrote. “Some of them, I was later told, were chanting, ‘Hang Mike Pence!’ The president had decided to be part of the problem. I was determined to be part of the solution. I ignored the tweet and got back to work.”\n\nThe conversations between Trump and Pence have been one of the key themes of the House’s January 6 committee hearings, and the book gives Pence, who has not testified before the committee, the chance to weigh in on his exchanges with Trump.\n\nPence said that he’d begun election night in 2020 confident, but things changed later in the evening, he wrote, when results in states with large shares of mail-in ballots “began to shift” and the Trump-Pence ticket’s lead “started to vanish.”\n\n“The mood in the White House, initially ebullient, began to sour,” Pence wrote.\n\nHe described watching Trump claim in an early Wednesday morning speech that the election process had been “a fraud on the American public” and said the days that followed the election were “a little like the twilight zone,” as Trump’s team challenged states’ results.\n\nThe Saturday after the election, Pence wrote, Trump’s son-in-law and top aide Jared Kushner called him to ask whether he thought there had been fraud in the election. He told Kushner there likely was some fraud, but he doubted it was why they’d lost, according to the book.\n\nHere are other key moments Pence described in his memoir:\n\n‘What if we hadn’t had the rally?’\n\nWhile Pence acknowledges the reality of the electoral vote count, he does not describe Joe Biden as having won the 2020 race fairly, or take issue with the Trump campaign’s strategy of fighting swing states’ results in court. He discusses turning the Texas effort to challenge some states’ electoral votes into an applause line while campaigning in Georgia for two Republican senators in runoff elections.\n\nPence wrote that he asked his general counsel for a briefing on the procedures of the Electoral Count Act after Trump in a December 5 phone call “mentioned challenging the election results in the House of Representatives for the first time.”\n\nOver lunch on December 21, Pence wrote, he tried to steer Trump to listen to the White House counsel’s team’s advice, rather than outside lawyers.\n\n“I said, ‘You’ve got a good team at the White House,’ to which he grumbled, ‘No, I don’t,’” Pence wrote. “If the president had chosen to listen to those good men and not the gaggle of outside lawyers who took over the election challenges from the campaign, things would have been very different.”\n\nPence wrote that Trump told him in a New Year’s Day phone call: “You’re too honest,” he chided, predicting that “hundreds of thousands are gonna hate your guts” and “people are gonna think you’re stupid.”\n\n“Mr. President, I don’t question there were irregularities and fraud,” Pence wrote that he told Trump. “It’s just a question of who decides, and under the law that is Congress.”\n\n“With that, the president said that he guessed it probably just ‘takes courage,’ implying that was what I lacked,” Pence continued. “I paused before replying and, facing him from my seat in front of the Resolute Desk, said firmly, ‘Mr. President, I have courage, and you know that.’”\n\nPence wrote that Trump relented and “said with more than a little sadness, ‘Well, I’m gonna have to say you did a great disservice.’”\n\nPence, who said he refused to leave the Capitol on January 6, also wrote about his meeting with Trump in the days after January 6. Trump asked Pence, “Were you scared?” the former vice president wrote. “‘No,’ I replied, ‘I was angry. You and I had our differences that day, Mr. President, and seeing those people tearing up the Capitol infuriated me.’”\n\nPence wrote that he told Trump he was praying for him and encouraged him to pray. Trump didn’t say anything initially, Pence said, and then responded with “genuine sadness” in his voice: “What if we hadn’t had the rally? What if they hadn’t gone to the Capitol?”\n\nA personal warning to Putin\n\nPence wrote that in 2018, when he was representing the United States at the ASEAN conference in Singapore – the type of meeting he says Trump “was never big on” – he was approached at a plenary session with a tap on the shoulder by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n“I noticed that Putin projected a familiarity toward me. It came, I concluded, from his friendly meeting with Trump earlier in the year. It was as if we were old acquaintances,” Pence wrote. “I didn’t return the favor. I kept my expression firm and fixed, and the photo of me looking down at him with a furrowed brow and a grim expression was published around the world, just as I’d hoped it would be.”\n\nAt the end of the session, during a brief meeting requested by the Russians, Pence said Putin “was just inches from me, expecting a friendly chat.”\n\nWhen Putin wrapped up his comments about restarting nuclear nonproliferation negotiations, Pence said he told the Russian leader: “Mr. President, we know what happened in 2016, and it can’t happen again.”\n\n“Though Putin speaks English, he listened as his translator leaned in, relaying my message. His expression grew incredulous. He turned with a question to his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, presumably asking what I was talking about. The only word I recognized was ‘elections,’” Pence wrote. “Then he spoke through his translator, saying Russia had nothing to do with the election. To which I responded, ‘Mr. President, I’m very aware of what you’ve said about that, but I’m telling you we know what happened in 2016, and it can’t happen again.’ Putin seemed taken aback. Then he shrugged and changed the subject back to his upcoming summit in Argentina.”\n\nPence wrote that it was “absolutely right” for the FBI to investigate claims of Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, but pushed back on the idea “the investigation was into the Trump campaign’s alleged collusion with Russia and into Trump himself.”\n\nPence acknowledged that Russia did interfere in the 2016 election but insisted “its mischief had not elected Trump president” and called it an “attempt to sow discord, to destabilize US democracy, to spread false information across both left-wing and right-wing platforms so as to turn Americans against one another.”\n\n“I always had the impression that the president felt that acknowledging Russian meddling would somehow cheapen our victory,” he wrote. “But in my view, there was no reason for Trump not to call out Russia’s bad behavior; it wasn’t an admission of collusion but a declaration that our intelligence services knew what Putin’s regime had been up to. I had no problem calling Russia out.”\n\nMeeting with North Koreans at 2018 Olympics scrapped\n\nPence confirmed that he had been set to meet with North Korean officials during the 2018 Olympic Games, but the meeting was pulled down hours beforehand by Pyongyang.\n\nThe North Koreans had been the ones pushing for engagement in Pyeongchang, Pence said, also noting that former South Korean President Moon Jae-in had “wanted to politely force a meeting.”\n\nThe former vice president said that while the Olympics began, “the North Korean government was making back-channel overtures to me about having a meeting.”\n\n“I relayed the information to Trump. See what they have to say, he told me. If the meeting can be arranged, take it,” Pence recounted.\n\nThe meeting “appeared to be a go” and was arranged to take place on Pence’s last day in South Korea, at the Blue House. However, “two hours before the meeting was set to begin, we got word that the North Koreans were no longer willing to participate and we were told that the order ‘came from Pyongyang,’ leading to speculation that Kim Jong Un was irritated by my refusal to engage with his sister while the cameras clicked and the world watched.”\n\nPence had been seated in the same box with Kim Jong Un’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, at the Olympic Stadium, but as Pence put it: “I ignored her.”\n\nThe former vice president also described what he said were efforts by the former South Korean leader to get him to engage with the North Korean leaders.\n\n“Before the opening ceremony, there was a large reception and dinner for the two hundred national leaders in attendance,” he recalled, noting that Moon had arranged for he and the North Koreans to be seated at the head table, and that “a group photograph was arranged at the outset of the banquet.” Pence and former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe intentionally arrived late to the banquet and did not participate in the group photo.\n\n“That would have been a huge symbolic victory for North Korea. No chance,” Pence said.\n\nTrump’s relationship with Fauci\n\nPence delves into his role in the Trump administration’s battle against the coronavirus pandemic, and details the relationship between Trump and Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert.\n\nPence praised Fauci, writing, “I was glad he was there. He was a reassuring voice to the public; Mitch McConnell had advised me, correctly, that Fauci would be a valuable member of the team because of his stature.”\n\nHowever, Pence expressed how he didn’t understand why Fauci “was so insistent that Covid-19 had not emerged from a Chinese lab,” adding that he believed Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during most of the Trump administration, held a correct assessment in the lab leak theory.\n\n“Dr. Robert Redfield of the CDC always held that it had, and the more we have learned, the more I believe that Bob was right,” Pence wrote.\n\nPence commented on Trump and Fauci’s relationship, writing that it was “very good” initially.\n\n“Trump is from Queens, Fauci from Brooklyn, and Fauci was not put off by Trump’s New York brashness. He had grown up around it. He is a brash New Yorker, too,” Pence wrote.\n\nFrustration with McCain over Obamacare vote\n\nPence detailed the personal angst between Trump and McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee who died in 2018. Trump had attacked McCain during the 2016 presidential campaign, saying he didn’t consider the man who had been a prisoner of war in Vietnam to be a hero.\n\n“They were both sharp-elbowed men who punched back hard when attacked. But I always believed that had McCain lived, they would eventually have become friends,” Pence wrote.\n\nHe also made clear that he still resents the terminally ill McCain’s return to the Senate floor to cast the vote that would doom the Trump administration’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPence wrote that he had put Trump and McCain on the phone together. McCain, in Pence’s retelling of the call, told Trump he was honored by the call, and gave no indication he would vote against the GOP bill.\n\n“Then he walked out of the office, onto the Senate floor, caught the eye of the Senate clerk, gave a thumbs-down, walked over to his desk, and sat down,” Pence wrote. “There was an audible gasp. The effort to repeal and replace Obamacare was dead. The Trump administration had just been knocked back on its heels. Trump was irate. I was, too.”\n\nPence wrote that South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close friend of McCain, “deserved better” on the Obamacare repeal effort from his friend.\n\n“In a fitting twist, immediately after McCain voted down Obamacare repeal, Rand Paul blocked consideration of the fiscal-year spending for the Departments of Defense, Energy, and State, which was nicknamed the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act,” Pence wrote. “Trump was delighted. McCain was incensed. He actually said, ‘It is unfortunate that one senator chose to block consideration of a bill our nation needs right now.’ Takes one to know one.”", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Jeremy Herb Jennifer Hansler Maegan Vazquez Nikki Carvajal Veronica Stracqualursi Kit Maher", "Eric Bradner", "Jeremy Herb", "Jennifer Hansler", "Maegan Vazquez", "Nikki Carvajal", "Veronica Stracqualursi", "Kit Maher"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/30/americas/brazil-election-lula-da-silva-wins-intl/index.html", "title": "Brazil elections: Lula da Silva will return to Brazil's presidency in ...", "text": "Sao Paulo CNN —\n\nLuiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva has been elected the next president of Brazil, in a stunning comeback following a tight run-off race on Sunday. His victory heralds a political about-face for Latin America’s largest country, after four years of Jair Bolsonaro’s far-right administration.\n\nThe 76-year-old politician’s win represents the return of the left into power in Brazil, and concludes a triumphant personal comeback for Lula da Silva, after a series of corruption allegations lead to his imprisonment for 580 days. The sentences were later annulled by the Supreme Court, clearing his path to run for reelection.\n\n“They tried to bury me alive and I’m here,” he said in a jubilant speech to supporters and journalists on Sunday evening, describing the win as his political “resurrection.”\n\n“Starting on January 1, 2023, I will govern for the 215 million Brazilians, not just the ones who voted for me. There are not two Brazils. We are one country, one people, one great nation,” Lula da Silva also said.\n\nHe will take the reins of a country plagued by gross inequality that is still struggling to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. Approximately 9.6 million people fell under the poverty line between 2019 and 2021, and literacy and school attendance rates have fallen. He will also be faced with a deeply fractured nation and urgent environmental issues, including rampant deforestation in the Amazon.\n\nThis will be his third term, after previously governing Brazil for two consecutive terms between 2003 and 2010.\n\nSupporters of Lula da Silva react as they wait for results at Paulista Avenue, Sao Paulo, Brazil, October 30, 2022. Amanda Perobelli/Reuters\n\nThe latest in a leftist wave\n\nThe former leader’s victory on Sunday was the latest in a political wave across Latin America, with wins by left-leaning politicians in Argentina, Colombia and Chile. But Lula da Silva – a former union leader with a blue-collar background – has sought to reassure moderates throughout his campaign.\n\nHe has built a broad alliance including several politicians from the center and center-right, including historical opponents from the PSDB, Brazil’s Social Democrat Party. Among these politicians is his vice-president, former São Paulo governor Geraldo Alckmin, who has been cited by the Lula camp as a guarantee of moderation in his administration.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Lula da Silva has been reluctant to show his cards when it came to outlining an economic strategy – a tendency that earned sharp criticism from his competitors. “Who is the other candidate’s economy minister? There isn’t one, he doesn’t say. What will be his political and economic route? More state? Less state? We don’t know…,” said Bolsonaro during a live transmission on YouTube on October 22.\n\nLula da Silva has said that he would push Congress to approve a tax reform which would exempt low-earners from paying income tax. And his campaign received a boost from centrist former presidential candidate Simone Tebet, who came third in the first round earlier this month and gave Lula da Silva her support in the run-off. Known for her ties with Brazil’s agricultural industry, Tebet said in an October 7 press conference that Lula da Silva and his economic team had “received and incorporated all the suggestions from our program to his government’s program.”\n\nHe has also received the support of several renowned economists highly regarded by investors, including Arminio Fraga, a former president of the Brazilian Central Bank.\n\nHealing a divided country\n\nLula da Silva received more than 60 million votes, the most in Brazilian history, breaking his own record from 2006.\n\nBut despite the huge turnout from his supporters, his victory was by a narrow margin – Lula da Silva won 50.90% of the vote and Bolsonaro received 49.10%, according to Brazil’s electoral authority.\n\nHis biggest challenge now may be unifying a politically fractured country.\n\nHours after the results were announced, Bolsonaro had yet to concede defeat or make any public statement. Meanwhile, videos on social media showed his supporters had blocked highways in two states to protest against Lula da Silva’s victory.\n\n“We will only leave once the army takes over the country,” one unidentified Bolsonaro supporter said in a video taken in the southern state of Santa Catarina.\n\nLula da Silva will need to pursue dialogue and rebuild relationships, said Carlos Melo, a political scientist at Insper, a university in São Paulo. “The president can be an important instrument for this as long as he is not only concerned in addressing his base of voters,” he said.\n\nSupporters of Lula da Silva react as they gather on the day of the Brazilian presidential election run-off, in Brasilia, Brazil October 30, 2022. Diego Vara/Reuters\n\nWith more than 58 million votes cast for his rival Bolsonaro – who had been endorsed by former US President Donald Trump – Lula da Silva will have to form “pragmatic alliances” with parts of the center and the right that bought into his predecessor’s politics, adds Thiago Amparo, professor of law and human rights at FGV business school in São Paulo.\n\nAt the same time, he will have to deliver to match supporters’ expectations, Amparo added. “Many voters went to the ballot expecting that, not just to get rid of Bolsonaro, but with memories of better economic times during Lula’s previous governments.”\n\nMany will be watching for potential change to the 2017 Labor Reform Act, which subjected more workers’ rights and benefits to negotiation with employers, and made union contributions optional. Lula da Silva had said previously that he would revoke the act but recently changed the verb to “review” following criticisms from the private sector.\n\nHe may find that enacting his agenda is an uphill battle, Amparo warns, especially with a hostile Congress. Seats that were from the traditional right are now occupied by the far right, who are not open to negotiation and not easy to deal with, underlines Amparo.\n\nIn the latest elections, Bolsonaro’s Liberal Party increased its representatives in the lower house from 76 to 99, while in the Senate it doubled from seven members to 14. Lula da Silva’s Workers’ Party has also increased its number of deputies from 56 to 68 and senators from seven to eight – but overall, conservative-leaning politicians will dominate the next legislature.\n\nThat friction will require some compromises, points out Camila Rocha, a political scientist at the Cebrap think tank. “[Bolsonaro’s] Liberal Party will have the highest number of representatives and important allies and will make real opposition to the government, [Lula da Silva’s] Worker’s Party will have to sow a coalition with [traditional rightwing party] União Brasil in order to govern, which means the negotiation of ministries and key positions,” Rocha told to CNN.\n\nA supporter of Lula da Silva reacts while gathering with fellow supporters on the day of the Brazilian presidential election run-off, in Brasilia, Brazil October 30, 2022. Diego Vara/Reuters\n\nThe Amazon and climate leadership\n\nEnvironmentalists meanwhile will be watching Lula da Silva’s administration closely, as it assumes governance not only over the Brazilian nation but over the planet’s largest forest reserves.\n\nWith destruction of the vast Amazon rainforest reaching record levels under Bolsonaro’s presidency, Lula da Silva has repeatedly said during his campaign that he would seek to curb deforestation. He has argued that protecting the forest could produce some profit, citing the beauty and pharmaceutical industries as potential beneficiaries of biodiversity.\n\nIn an interview with foreign press in August, Lula da Silva called for “a new world governance” to address climate change and stressed that Brazil should take a central role in that governance, given its natural resources.\n\nAccording to the head of Lula da Silva’s government plan, Aloizio Mercadante, another tactic will be to create a group including Brazil, Indonesia and Congo ahead of the UN-led November 2022 Conference of Parties. The group would aim to pressure richer countries to finance the protection of forests as well as outlining strategies for the global carbon market.\n\nSeveral experts told CNN they believed his stance on environment and the climate issue could represent a fresh start in Brazil’s international relations.\n\nFor Amparo, environmental protection could indeed be springboard for Brazil’s global leadership, a major shift after Bolsonaro warned the world away from intervening in the destruction of the Amazon. “Lula would try to reposition, almost like a rebranding, Brazil in the international arena as a power to be taken into account,” he said.\n\n“We can expect a government that goes back to talking to the world, especially with a new stance in the environmental area,” said Melo, the Insper researcher.", "authors": ["Camilo Rocha"], "publish_date": "2022/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2017/10/20/russia-accuses-us-govt-of-pushing-for-its-olympic-exclusion/106827684/", "title": "Russia accuses U.S. government of pushing for its Olympic exclusion", "text": "AP\n\nMOSCOW (AP) — The Kremlin accused the U.S. government on Friday of pushing for Russia's exclusion from the Olympics.\n\nA day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said the IOC was coming under pressure from the U.S., his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin meant \"state (structures), including through social and non-government organizations.\"\n\nPutin said the effort aimed to ensure Russia was either barred from next year's Winter Olympics entirely or forced to compete under a neutral flag.\n\nIOC expects decisions on 'a number' of Russian doping cases next month\n\nOlympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney says she was victim of sexual abuse\n\nIn televised comments on Thursday, Putin said the IOC depended on sponsorship income \"and in turn clear signals are being given to these sponsors by certain American bodies. We aren't simply guessing about this, we know about it.\"\n\nMissing the Olympics or competing as neutrals would be \"degrading\" for Russia, Putin added, and suggested it might be meant to interfere in the Russian presidential election in March. Putin is widely expected to run for re-election but has yet to confirm that.\n\n\"If someone thinks that in this way they can influence the election campaign in Russia in the spring of next year, then they are deeply confused,\" Putin said.\n\nRussia is already under IOC investigation over allegations it operated a state-backed doping program including swapping out dirty samples at the drug-testing laboratory for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.\n\nNeither Putin nor Peskov specified which specific U.S. government bodies might be involved in the alleged pressuring of the IOC.\n\nThe U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, a non-government body which receives part of its funding from the U.S. government, is among a group of 37 national drug-testing agencies which have called for Russia to be barred from the Olympics, which start on Feb. 9 in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\n\nThe IOC has said its investigators expect to have \"a number\" of doping cases involving Russians at the Sochi Olympics resolved by the end of November, but they have no plans to dictate the eligibility of these athletes for Pyeongchang.\n\nPutin's suggestion of U.S. meddling in the Russian election comes amid investigations in the U.S. into alleged interference in last year's presidential vote.

He added a scary new twist at a time of global tensions, claiming the country was on the verge of tumbling into nuclear war.\n\nLaunching his bid for a third consecutive Republican presidential nomination, Trump conversely painted his own turbulent single term, which ended in his attempt to destroy democracy and a mismanaged pandemic, as a “golden age” of prosperity and American global dominance.\n\nThe new Trump – for the 2024 campaign – is the same as the old Trump.\n\nHe pounded out a message of American decline, highlighted raging inflation and slammed President Joe Biden as aged, weak, and disrespected by US enemies, while highlighting his own chummy ties with global dictators, like North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who seek to weaken American power.\n\nWhen the 76-year-old former property tycoon, reality star and commander in chief promised a new “quest to save our country,” he encapsulated the challenges that his new campaign poses for his own party and the rest of the United States.\n\nTo begin with, in the gold-leafed ballroom of his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump steered clear of the election denialism that helped doom multiple Republican nominees in the midterm elections and that has inspired skepticism of his viability among GOP lawmakers in Washington.\n\nBut as usual, his self-discipline didn’t hold, as he descended further into his personal obsessions the longer he went on, portraying himself as a “victim,” raising new suspicion about the US election system and slamming ongoing criminal probes against him as politicized and deeply unfair. The speech lacked the riotous nature and energy of his campaign rallies. But Trump’s material was a familiar rhetorical cocktail of grievance certain to enthuse his base supporters.\n\nHowever, it may have come across to many of the swing voters in the states that he lost in 2020 as authoritarian demagoguery. Many of those voters deserted Republicans yet again last week, as the party failed to win back the Senate and as it still waits to confirm it will win only a slim majority in the House. Many GOP lawmakers squarely blame the lack of a red wave on Trump – for foisting extreme, election-denying candidates on the party in key states. That’s why there is increasing interest in potential alternative candidates like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who roared to reelection last week, and has recently proved, unlike Trump, that he can build a broad coalition with Trump-style policies but without the chaos epitomized by the 45th president.\n\nAnd yet by launching his campaign so early – before the 2022 election is even finalized – the ex-president is seeking to freeze the GOP field. And there is so far no evidence that his devoted supporters will desert him.\n\nWhat could be the opening acts of a new election clash between Trump and Biden unfolded over multiple time zones. As Trump was speaking, the current president – who confounded historic expectations of a midterm election drubbing – was at another beach resort, in Bali, Indonesia.\n\nBiden spent the moments leading up to Trump’s speech huddled with other world leaders seeking a united response to a possibly alarming escalation in the war in Ukraine after an explosion on the territory of NATO ally Poland. There was some irony to the fact that Biden was leading the same Western alliance at a moment of peril that Trump frequently had undermined while in office. (Biden said after a day of rising global tensions that first indications were that the missile that fell onto a Polish farm, killing two people, did not originate in Russia.)\n\nEpitomizing the gulf between a president’s duties and the frivolity of the campaign trail, Biden, when asked if he had a comment on Trump’s launch, replied: “No, not really.”\n\nTrump seeks a historic comeback under the threat of criminal probes\n\nTrump referred briefly to the FBI search of his home at Mar-a-Lago for his hoard of highly classified documents and subpoenas sent to his family members. It was a reminder that his campaign raises the extraordinary scenario of a candidate for president running for a new term while facing multiple criminal investigations and the possibility of indictment by the Justice Department. Trump, who has not been charged with a crime, is being investigated over the classified documents, the run-up to the US Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021, and in Georgia over his attempt to steal Biden’s win in the crucial swing state in 2020.\n\nTrump has already claimed that he is being persecuted because Biden wants to stop him from becoming president again – an accusation likely to be embraced by his millions of supporters. Thus, the clash between his campaign and various investigations into his conduct promises to inflict even more damage on political and legal institutions that he kept under continuous assault as president.\n\nOne thing noticeably missing from Trump’s speech was acknowledgment of his unprecedented attempt to interrupt 250 years of peaceful transfers of power between presidents. But the Capitol insurrection is an indelible stain that is sure to haunt his campaign. CNN has exclusively reported that top DOJ officials have considered whether a special counsel would be needed during the Trump campaign to avoid potential political conflicts of interest.\n\nTrump is trying to pull off a historic feat accomplished by only one previous president – Grover Cleveland, who became the only commander in chief to serve nonconsecutive terms after he won a return to the White House in 1892.\n\nA Trump victory in 2024 would represent a stunning rebound given that he is the only president to have been impeached twice – once for trying to coerce Ukraine into investigating Biden, and secondly for inciting the mob attack on the Capitol, one of the most flagrant assaults ever on US democracy.\n\nA test for the GOP\n\nA return to the Oval Office for Trump would stun the world. His record of disdaining US allies and coddling dictators such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un fractured decades of US foreign policy and made the United States – long a force for stability in the world – into one of its most erratic powers.\n\nTrump left office in disgrace in 2021, after the assault on the Capitol, not even bothering to attend the inauguration of his successor and insisting ever since that the election was corrupt – despite no evidence and against the findings of multiple courts and his own Justice Department.\n\nEver since, the ex-president has made his lies about the 2020 election the centerpiece of a political movement that still has millions of followers – as was seen with the primary victories of some of his handpicked candidates in this year’s midterm elections.\n\nBut many Trump-backed candidates failed to win competitive general elections. And Trump’s 2024 campaign will test whether there are Republicans who, while they may be drawn in by Trump’s bulldozing style and populist, nationalist instincts, will tire of the drama and chaos that surround him. It will also pose a question of whether a new generation of Republicans, who have tapped into his political base and the “America first” principles of Trumpism – like DeSantis, for example – are ready to challenge the movement’s still wildly popular founder.\n\nTrump was already rejected by a broad general election audience once – he lost by more than 7 million votes in 2020. The same pattern appeared to exert itself as the GOP fell short of expectations in the midterms, which ironically will give Trump-aligned lawmakers strong leverage in what’s likely to be a narrow House Republican majority.\n\nAnd even if he secures the nomination again, it’s an open question whether he’ll be able to recreate his 2016 winning coalition after alienating moderate and suburban voters or whether a combination of motivated base voters and previously disaffected Republicans returning to the fold will be able to make up the difference.\n\nA norm-busting first term\n\nTrump’s first term between 2017 and 2021 was one of the most tumultuous periods in American political history.\n\nHe shattered the traditions and restraints of his office, subjecting political institutions – designed by the Founders to guard against exactly his brand of autocratic egotism – to their ultimate test.\n\nThe 45th president’s reputation was also stained by his negligent denial and mismanagement of a once-in-100-years pandemic. He skipped over his failed leadership in the emergency during his speech on Tuesday night.\n\nTrump’s flouting of science and public health guidelines came back to haunt him as he contracted Covid-19 in the fall of 2020. He survived a serious bout with the help of experimental drugs before theatrically ripping off his mask in a White House photo op when he returned from the hospital.\n\nOne important aspect of his pandemic strategy was a success, however. An early White House bet to invest big in vaccine development by private firms and scientists, under the title of Operation Warp Speed, put the US in better position than many other industrialized nations.\n\nThe coronavirus destroyed the roaring economy Trump had hoped to ride to reelection, leaving as his most important achievement the shaping of a conservative Supreme Court majority, which has already dramatically altered American society with its overturning of Roe v. Wade and could last a generation.\n\nBut history will most remember him for his two impeachments, both following abuses of power designed to manipulate the free and fair elections that are at the root of America’s democratic system in order to prolong his tenure in office.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the insurrection has uncovered damning evidence in Trump’s inner circle about his behavior in the run-up to January 6 and during the insurrection. Former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, for instance, testified that chief of staff Mark Meadows said Trump thought Vice President Mike Pence deserved the calls for him to be hanged by insurrectionists. There was also evidence of Trump’s vicious pressure on local officials and election workers in states such as Georgia.\n\nYet there remain questions about whether the committee will be able to hold accountable a man who has always dodged responsibility in a wild and whirling life in business, reality television and politics.\n\nEven if the committee advises the Justice Department that prosecuting Trump is merited, it’s unknown whether the evidence it has collected would be sufficient to secure a conviction. And Attorney General Merrick Garland would be faced with a massive dilemma given the extraordinary implications of bringing criminal charges against an active presidential candidate.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}]}

They are about the right to kill.\"\n\nThe UK's anti-euthanasia Care Not Killing alliance said that the law is also in place to protect the vulnerable \"from being pressured into ending their lives\".\n\nMaking her case against any law change, Ilora Finlay, a crossbench peer and palliative care physician, told the parliamentary inquiry that legalising euthanasia in Britain could result in between 5,800 and 58,000 assisted deaths a year, based on extrapolated data from countries where it is already legal. “Such demand would divert an already stretched workforce of NHS clinicians,” she said.\n\nPro: ending 'mercy killings'\n\nAccording to Dignity in Dying, 44% of people would break the law and help a loved one to die, risking 14 years in prison.\n\nLast year the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it was considering revising its stance on so-called mercy killings so that defendants are less likely to face criminal charges.\n\n\"We are not decriminalising any offence,\" Director of Public Prosecutions Max Hill, head of the CPS, told the i news site, but in offences \"born solely out of compassion\", justice can sometimes \"be achieved by not prosecuting\".\n\nCampaigners claim that UK police are also increasingly turning a blind eye to people travelling to other countries to assist loved ones to end their life.\n\n4. Con: ‘slippery slope’\n\nOpponents argue that normalising euthanasia would be a move towards legalised murder.\n\nThis \"slippery slope is real\", said James Mildred of Care (Christian Action Research and Education), which campaigns against assisted suicide. In a 2018 article in The Economist, Mildred cited \"a steady increase year on year in the number of people being killed or helped to commit suicide by their doctors\" in countries that have legalised assisted suicide, as the rules are loosened over time.\n\n\"Critics say this is happening in Canada,\" said New Scientist, \"with the criteria for assisted dying having expanded once already and a further change planned for next year.\" Canada, which introduced Medical Assistance in Dying, or MAID, in 2016, has seen the number of people choosing to end their life rise steadily ever since, with MAID deaths comprising over 4% of all deaths in 2022.\n\nPro: shifting opinion\n\nThere has been a significant shift in recent years among both the public and professional medical opinion regarding assisted dying for people with a terminal illness.\n\nRecent polling for The Guardian found 65% of people in the UK believe it should become legal for a doctor to assist an adult of sound mind with less than six months to live to voluntarily end their own life, subject to High Court confirmation.\n\nDignity in Dying claims this number is even higher, and also that 54% of GPs are supportive or neutral to a law change on assisted dying.\n\nCon: religious concerns\n\nMany religious people, especially Catholics, believe that life is the ultimate gift and that taking that away is usurping power that belongs to God only. In 2020, the Vatican reiterated the Roman Catholic Church's opposition to assisted suicide and euthanasia, describing them as \"intrinsically evil\" acts \"in every situation or circumstance\", The New York Times reported.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "The Week Uk", "Harold Maass", "The Week Us", "Harriet Marsden", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/14/coronavirus-updates-trump-may-get-tested-house-passes-relief-bill/5032571002/", "title": "Coronavirus updates: Trump emergency, NY death, Harris Teeter ...", "text": "The fallout from the coronavirus continues to reverberate across the nation and the world.

Wood is the first non-Jazz player to test positive, widening the potential scope of the outbreak. The Pistons played the Jazz at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit on March 7.\n\nIt is not known how Wood contracted the virus, but the Pistons have played the New York Knicks and Philadelphia 76ers since playing the Jazz.

T.J. Rainsford, a spokesman for the 18th Airborne Corps, said that as of Saturday morning, there were no positive cases of the new coronavirus at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the largest Army installation in the country.\n\nThe quarantining of the soldiers was directed by the Army, which said that troops leaving areas that are labeled Level 2 or higher by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should stay in quarantine for two weeks.\n\nWhile in quarantine, the paratroopers will be monitored for health and get appropriate medical treatment, according to the division.\n\n– Rachael Riley and Steve DeVane, The Fayetteville (N.C.) Observer\n\nAt least 20 states close all schools\n\nTwenty states and a number of large urban school districts – including Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest – are shutting down all K-12 schools as part of a sweeping attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nAlabama, Alaska, Delaware, Florida, Kentucky, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin have made plans to close all schools.\n\nIn addition to Los Angeles, major metropolitan districts in Atlanta, Austin, Denver, Miami-Dade County, San Francisco, San Diego and Washington, D.C., have also shuttered. A growing number of smaller districts around the country have also chosen to close.\n\nAccording to a count updated mid-afternoon Friday by Education Week magazine, about a quarter of American schoolchildren had been or were scheduled to be affected by a school closures – and that was before some states announced their actions.\n\nThe magazine said at least 46,000 schools were closed, are scheduled to close, or were closed and later reopened, affecting at least 21 million students.\n\nCustoms intercepts fake virus tests\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection is advising Americans to be aware of “bogus home testing kits for sale either online or in informal direct to consumer settings” after officers at Los Angeles International Airport intercepted a package containing suspected counterfeit COVID-19 test kits arriving from the United Kingdom, the agency said Saturday.\n\nThe officers discovered six plastic bags containing various vials while conducting an enforcement examination Thursday. The vials were filled with a white liquid and labeled “Corona Virus 2019nconv (COVID-19)” and “Virus1 Test Kit,” the agency said. The agency turned the shipment over to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for analysis.\n\n– Grace Hauck\n\nTrump adds UK, Ireland to travel restrictions\n\nTrump on Saturday said the United Kingdom and Ireland will be added to the Europe travel restrictions that went into effect late Friday. This means residents of those countries will not be allowed to travel to the United States for 30 days beginning Monday.\n\nU.S. residents and legal permanent residents won't be banned but they will face airport screenings upon their return and will be asked to self quarantine for 14 days.\n\nIn response to the broadened ban and the resulting falloff in travel demand, airlines are likely to sharply cut flights between the U.S. and London and Ireland. Delta Air Lines and American Airlines suspended all flights between the U.S. and the 26 European countries covered by the initial ban.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump said he is considering domestic travel restrictions \"specifically from certain areas\" after the Pentagon restricted service members' domestic travel. \"If you don't have to travel I wouldn't do it ... we want this thing to end.\" Read more here.\n\n– Dawn Glibertson\n\nCensus deadline could change\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Saturday the deadline to respond to the 2020 Census is still the end of July, but that could change if the coronavirus crisis impacts the national operation.\n\nCivil rights groups and community activists had called for the Census Bureau to consider extending the July 31 deadline as concerns increase about the impact of the outbreak on the decennial count.\n\nRoss said the agency has a $2 billion contingency budget and will adapt its plans to deal with the coronavirus crisis, including deadlines. Households have until July 31 to respond to the population survey.\n\nCivil rights groups said they’re worried about the safety of census takers and are concerned communities that have long been under counted may not respond.\n\nCensus officials have been scrambling to meet deadlines, including recruiting and hiring thousands of workers who will knock on the doors of people who don’t respond to the survey. The deadlines are critical as the Census is required to provide information to Congress. That information is used to distribute billions in federal funds and determine the number of members of Congress for each state.\n\n— Deborah Berry\n\nNCAA had, spent rainy-day fund\n\nThe cancellation of the NCAA’s Division I men’s and women’s basketball tournaments is likely to wreak financial havoc on colleges and universities that depend on the millions of dollars in revenue the games bring in.\n\nIt turns out the NCAA did have the foresight to begin planning for an unknown catastrophic event that would threaten its biggest and most lucrative event.\n\nBy 2014, the association had accumulated a nearly $400 million cushion as a hedge against a massive loss of revenue from the tournament.\n\nThen, at the direction of its governing board of college presidents, the NCAA distributed that money to schools to help them with increasing costs and spent it on their behalf in other ways, including a $208.7 million legal settlement.\n\n“The NCAA will be fine,” said Barbara Osborne, a sports administration professor at the University of North Carolina. “But all schools will be having huge belt tightening because of this.” Read more here.\n\n– Steve Berkowitz\n\nMnuchin says more bills coming on cruise, hotel, airline assistance\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin praised the legislation passed by the House early Saturday morning and said the next round of legislation would address the cruise, hotel and airline industries.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday in a letter to lawmakers the House would start work on a third legislative package to \"protect the health, economic security and well-being of the American people.\"\n\nThe House passed a bill early in the morning to provide paid sick leave and free coronavirus testing, and Mnuchin told reporters the bill \"delivers on what the president announced in his speech the other night.\"\n\n\"People who need to be quarantined, we want them at home and we don't want them to fear not getting paid,\" he continued.\n\nMnuchin said there was language agreed to with Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy that did not make it into the final bill, \"so there will be a technical correction Monday morning.\"\n\n- Nicholas Wu and Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump: Federal Reserve should be ‘more proactive’\n\nTrump again slammed the Federal Reserve on Saturday, saying the central bank hasn’t done enough to calm financial markets amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAt an unusual Saturday news conference, Trump offered praise to Congress, the American people and even the press for their response to the coronavirus scare. But the Fed – one of his favorite targets – got only presidential scorn.\n\n“I thought the Fed would be and should be much more proactive,” Trump said. “Our Fed is following.”\n\nTrump is frequently critical of the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he appointed to the chairmanship in 2017. Trump claims that interest rate hikes have slowed economic growth.\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates two weeks ago in a rare emergency move in response to the threat the coronavirus posed to the economy and financial markets. But Trump thinks it should be doing more.\n\n“Our Fed is not doing what they should be doing,” he said, arguing the U.S. shouldn’t have a rate higher than competitor nations such as Germany and Japan.\n\nAsked whether he intends to fire Powell, Trump said he has the authority to do so, “but I’m not doing it.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nFrance closes all schools, restaurants, Eiffel tower; Spain locks down 46M citizens, Israel bans gatherings\n\nFrance and Spain followed Italy's lead with tough new measures, leaving the Eiffel Tower and Louvre shuttered and 46 million Spanish citizens in a lockdown.\n\nItaly also invoked sharp new measures, including closing playgrounds and parks.\n\nFrance's orders closed cafes, restaurant and cinemas. The government has banned all gatherings of more than 100 people, ordered all schools closed and asked companies to allow workers to stay home.\n\nIn declaring a two-week state of emergency Saturday, Spain prepared to close all schools, universities, restaurants, bars and hotels nationwide.\n\nSpain’s declaration comes as coronavirus cases soared to over 5,700 with 136 deaths. The declaration also would allow the government to limit free movement, confiscate goods and take over control of industries and private facilities, including private hospitals.\n\nResidents of Madrid, which has around half the infections, and northeastern Catalonia awoke to shuttered bars and restaurants and other non-essential commercial outlets as ordered by regional authorities.\n\nIn Italy, mayors of many cities, including Rome and Milan, decided to close public playgrounds and parks as European countries fashion different polices to try to combat the spread of the virus.\n\nElsewhere, Denmark and Poland became the latest countries to shut their borders to most travelers.\n\nIsrael on Saturday banned gatherings of more than ten people and ordered that restaurants and movie theaters close.

It is intended to cut red tape that otherwise might hold up emergency relief, officials said.\n\nIt will apply to drivers hauling critical medical supplies like masks, hand sanitizer, soap and disinfectants needed by health care workers. Also mentioned are sanitation supplies for communities. Included, too, is food for emergency restocking of stores, workers and supplies for temporary housing or quarantine facilities related to COVID-19 and transportation of medical or other emergency-service personnel.\n\n\"This declaration will help America’s commercial drivers get these critical goods to impacted areas faster and more efficiently,\" said Jim Mullen, acting administrator of the department's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.\n\nThe order requires truckers be allowed to rest for a minimum of 10 consecutive hours if they say they need time off before returning to work at the terminal or their normal reporting location. Normally, truckers are subject to elaborate rules that limit them to 11 hours of driving a day during a 14-hour period after 10 hours of rest.\n\nThe administration's order includes stipulations to prevent abuse. It won't apply to commercial deliveries, for instance, or to mixed loads – items both considered part of the emergency relief shipped along with general cargo.\n\n- Chris Woodyard\n\nAhead of Pence briefing, White House checks temperatures for those around Trump, Pence\n\nAhead of a press briefing Saturday with Vice President Mike Pence, a member of the White House Physicians Office took the temperature of reporters and television crews.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, temperature checks are now being performed on any individuals who are in close contact with the President and Vice President,\" said White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere.\n\nOne symptom of the coronavirus, which has been named COVID-19, is a fever.\n\nOne reporter whose temperature was too high was escorted out by staff. Pence's press secretary Katie Miller said the White House Medical Unit took the person's temperature three times over a 15-minute period and that \"all three registered above the @CDCgov 100.4 guidelines.\"\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nGet daily coronavirus updates in your inbox: Sign up for the Daily Briefing.\n\nTrump awaiting coronavirus test results\n\nTrump said Saturday he had taken the test for the coronavirus following his recent exposure to two Brazilian officials who later tested positive for the virus.\n\nTrump told reporters his temperature was \"totally normal\" and that he took the test Friday night, and the results would take \"few days\" while it was sent to a lab.\n\nA White House doctor issued a statement late Friday saying the president didn't need to get tested or self-quarantined for coronavirus because he had not exhibited any symptoms.

Andrew Cuomo.\n\nThe unidentified woman, who died in a New York City hospital, was first admitted to the hospital March 3, Cuomo said.\n\nThe effects of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, can be significantly exacerbated by an underlying respiratory illness, like emphysema, that can cause shortness of breath.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases jumped to 524 on Saturday, a one-day increase of 103 cases.

Democrats and advocates have criticized the Trump administration for not doing enough to address the crisis.\n\n“I’m extremely concerned that our lack of preparedness ... would result in a Katrina-like response where there was vast inequities between who receive services and who did not receive services and that line was drawn based on race, primarily, and class,’’ Derrick Johnson, president of the national NAACP, told USA TODAY.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush and his administration came under fire in 2005 for the slow response to Hurricane Katrina. The hurricane left more than 1,800 dead in the region and devastated communities, many of them African American.\n\nThe tele-town hall scheduled for 8 p.m. EST will focus on how to identify symptoms and how to prepare. It aims to provide listeners with information on “how to navigate in this current reality,’’ said Johnson.\n\nYou asked, we're answering: Specific answers to readers' coronavirus questions\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat from California, who will be part of the town hall,said she’s concerned about the impact of the coronavirus on communities of colors and about whether there are enough tests. “As it connects to every other public health issue our folks are the last to have access to what is needed to allow them to be diagnosed and treated,” she said.\n\nJohnson said while all communities will be impacted, he’s worried about different response in communities of color.\n\n“I think our president has undermined the ability of our medical health professions both in government and outside of government from implementing an aggressive plan to address this pandemic,’’ said Johnson, adding that Trump hasn’t listened to medical professionals. “He is the problem on top of the problem.”\n\nSeparately, members of the congressional Tri-Caucus, called on health officials to provide information in languages other than English.

The talks came after Poland’s foreign ministry said late Tuesday that the “Russian-made missile” fell on the village of Przewodów. On Wednesday, Polish President Andrzej Duda said that the missile that landed in Poland on Tuesday was “probably an accident” from the Ukrainian side while intercepting incoming Russian missiles.\n\nThe statement appeared to confirm something that Biden alluded to earlier when speaking to the press after being asked if the missile was fired from Russia.\n\n“There is preliminary information that contests that,” he answered.\n\nHe added, “I don’t want to say that until we completely investigate. It’s unlikely in the minds of the trajectory that it was fired from Russia. But we’ll see.”\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry had denied that there were strikes made on targets near the Ukrainian-Polish state border.\n\nBiden and leaders from the G7 and NATO were in the roundtable. The meeting included Biden and leaders from Canada, the European Union, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Netherlands, and Japan, the officials said.\n\nThe president said that there was “total unanimity among folks at the table” about how to respond to the incident. He did not provide other information about the source of the missile.\n\nDuring a call with Duda earlier, Biden “expressed deep condolences for the loss of life in Eastern Poland earlier this evening,” the White House said in a readout.\n\n“President Duda described Poland’s ongoing assessment of the explosion that took place in the eastern part of the country near the border with Ukraine. President Biden offered full US support for and assistance with Poland’s investigation,” the readout continued.\n\nBiden “reaffirmed the United States’ ironclad commitment to NATO” and the leaders agreed to have their teams “remain in close touch to determine appropriate next steps as the investigation proceeds.”\n\nAt the summit, Biden and most G20 members have been slated to sign onto a statement condemning Russia’s war in Ukraine “and the human suffering it has caused both for Ukrainians and for families in the developing world that are facing food and fuel insecurity as a result,” according to a senior administration official previewing the statement. Such an expression of condemnation has been the work of months of diplomacy between G20 leaders. However, it’s not clear yet exactly which countries will sign onto the declaration.\n\nBefore beginning a long journey back to Washington, Biden participated in a mangrove tree planting with other G20 leaders. He also met with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of the United Kingdom for the first time since Sunak took office last month.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz, France's President Emmanuel Macron, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, U.S. President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Netherland's Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and European Council President Charles Michel attend an emergency meeting of global leaders after an alleged Russian missile blast in Poland, in Bali, Indonesia, November 16, 2022.

He is also the youngest person to take the office in more than 200 years.\n\nSplit screen moment\n\nWhite House officials were expecting a split screen moment this week as Biden met world leaders in Bali at the same moment his predecessor was announcing a third presidential run.\n\nBut the dynamic was amplified as Biden convened the emergency talks at the same hour Trump loyalists filled the Mar-a-Lago ballroom for former President Donald Trump’s announcement.\n\nBiden was leading the crisis talks with members of the G7 and NATO in Bali – two groupings Trump questioned the usefulness of when he was in office.\n\nLess than 10 minutes after he finished speaking to reporters, Trump walked on stage at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nHeading into the trip, Biden’s advisers were not particularly concerned about the split-screen and, after Democrats’ better-than-expected midterm elections, were even less wary of Trump announcing a third bid for president while Biden was in Asia.\n\nFor one, Biden officials are happy to take the comparison between the current president and the former on the foreign stage, given the general chaos that often trailed Trump as he traveled abroad.\n\nBiden’s team also believe the president’s newfound acclaim among Democrats compares favorably to Trump’s post-midterms status within the Republican Party — still an evolving picture, but showing signs of erosion.\n\nTrump’s announcement will surely prompt renewed attention on Biden’s on decision-making on running for reelection. By all accounts, including from his closest advisers, Biden will feel more propelled to seek a second term if Trump is in contention.\n\nThroughout the course of his meetings in Asia this week, Biden has been approached by fellow leaders bearing congratulations following the midterm results, a signal the American political contests were being closely monitored by leaders on the opposite side of the world.\n\nIt was a phenomenon that surprised some of his aides, particularly the specificity with which many of the leaders were watching. It was a sign, according to one senior administration official, that the stakes of the midterm elections extended well beyond US borders. Biden himself had framed the contest as putting democracy on the ballot — stakes that leaders in foreign capitals were highly attuned to as they work to determine which way the political winds are blowing in the United States.\n\nAhead of the elections, foreign diplomats posted to Washington traveled the country working to suss out the political temperature, all with the goal of determining whether Trump could be poised for a political comeback.\n\nIf the collection of election deniers and Trump acolytes vying for office amounted to a signal that the former president’s influence was still alive within Republican politics – and that his return to the White House remained a distinct possibility – the widespread rejection of those candidates last week sent an alternate signal abroad.\n\nFor Biden, the timing could not have been more opportune. The prospect of a midterm wipeout loomed over preparations for his around-the-world trip over the last several weeks. Widespread Republican wins – including by election deniers – would badly complicate the president’s bedrock message that Democracies will win out against autocracies.\n\nTrump’s tease of a campaign announcement at the very moment Biden would be rallying the world behind democratic ideals only elevated the stakes.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Maegan Vazquez", "Kevin Liptak", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/13/politics/joe-biden-xi-jinping-meeting-g20-bali/index.html", "title": "'I'm not looking for conflict': Biden discusses three-hour meeting with ...", "text": "Bali, Indonesia CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden held a three-hour talk Monday with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, their first in-person encounter since Biden took office and an opportunity that both sides appeared to hope would lead to an improvement in rapidly deteriorating relations.\n\nEmerging afterward, Biden told reporters he was “open and candid” with Xi about the range of matters where Beijing and Washington disagree. He cast doubt on an imminent invasion of self-governing Taiwan, and seemed hopeful his message about avoiding all-out conflict was received.\n\nStill, the US president was frank that he and Xi came nowhere near resolving the litany of issues that have helped drive the US-China relationship to its lowest point in decades.\n\n“I’m not suggesting this is kumbaya,” Biden said at a news conference, “but I do not believe there’s a need for concern, as one of you raised a legitimate question, a new Cold War.”\n\nBiden entered Monday’s talks hoping for an opportunity to take stock with Xi of the world’s most important bilateral relationship. He described Xi as not overly confrontational but instead “the way he’s always been: direct and straightforward.”\n\n“He was clear, and I was clear that we will defend American interests and values, promote universal human rights and stand up for the international order and work in lockstep with our allies and partners,” Biden said. “We’re going to compete vigorously but I’m not looking for conflict.”\n\nIn a sign both men arrived to meeting hoping to improve the souring relationship, Biden announced his Secretary of State Antony Blinken would visit China and said officials from each country would begin working together through issues. Formal talks on climate cooperation between the US and China are expected to resume as well as part of a broader set of agreements between Biden and Xi, two US officials tell CNN.\n\nChina previously halted talks – viewed by the Biden administration as a key area where the two nations must work together – as part of retaliation for the visit to Taiwan by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. The US and Chinese envoys for climate change are talking, but the Biden administration will see what China is prepared to do to make concrete progress, one of the US officials said.\n\nUS Climate Envoy John Kerry’s spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on whether formal climate talks between the two countries were back on.\n\nThe White House said in a statement after the meeting that Biden raised concerns about human rights and China’s provocations around Taiwan. But they found at least one area of apparent agreement – that nuclear weapons cannot be used in Ukraine, where that nation is trying to fight off a Russian invasion.\n\n“President Biden and President Xi reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war should never be fought and can never be won,” a White House readout said, referring to the threat of nuclear weapons use in Ukraine.\n\nBiden did underscore areas of potential cooperation with Xi, including on climate change, in talks that stretched past their expected time at a luxury hotel in Bali.\n\nAnd he sought to convince Xi that a nuclear armed North Korea was not in China’s interests – particularly because further nuclear or long-range missile tests by Pyongyang could prompt Biden to scale up American military presence in the region.\n\n“It’s difficult to determine whether or not China has the capacity” to convince Kim Jong Un to back off his tests, Biden said. “I’m confident China is not looking for North Korea to engage in further escalatory means.”\n\n‘Good to see you’\n\nThe meeting began in the later afternoon with Biden and Xi walking toward each other from opposite sides of a hotel lobby, shaking hands in front of a row of US and Chinese flags. They smiled for cameras and Xi – through a translator – appeared to say, “Good to see you.”\n\n“As leaders of our two nations, we share responsibility, in my view, to show that China and the United States can manage our differences, prevent competition from becoming anything ever nearing conflict and to find ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation,” Biden said as the talks got underway.\n\n“The world expects, I believe, China and the United States to play key roles in addressing global challenges,” he said.\n\nSpeaking second, Xi seemed to offer what could be interpreted as a pointed message to his counterpart, who has spent more than half-a-century on the world stage.\n\n“A statesman should think about and know where to lead his country,” Xi said through a translator. “He should also think about and know how to get along with other countries and the wider world.”\n\nThe two leaders’ talks Monday could have consequences stretching months or even years as the world’s largest economies veer toward increasingly hostile relations.\n\nThe moments spent together on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit here will amount to only a fraction of the time the two men have been in each other’s company since 2011. Biden has claimed that as vice president, he spent north of 70 hours with Xi and traveled 17,000 miles with him across China and the United States – both exaggerations, but still reflective of a relationship that is now perhaps the most important on the planet.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 leaders' summit in Bali, Indonesia, November 14, 2022. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nChina warns US not to cross ‘red line’ over Taiwan\n\nXi stated that Taiwan is the “first red line” that “must not be crossed” in China-US relations, according to a Chinese foreign ministry readout.\n\nReferring to the “Taiwan question” as the “very core of China’s core interests” and “the bedrock of the political foundation” of China-US relations, Xi stated that peace and stability across the Taiwan strait and “Taiwan independence” is “as irreconcilable as water and fire.”\n\nChina’s ruling Communist Party has long claimed the self-ruled democracy of 24 million as an inseparable part of its territory, despite having never ruled over it, and has pledged to take it back – by force if necessary.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporters explain one of the most contentious issues of US-China relations (2022) 05:31 - Source: CNN\n\nIn the meeting, Xi stated that basic norms of international relations and the three Sino-US joint communiques – which touches on the Taiwan issue – are the “most important guardrail and safety net” for bilateral relations and are “vitally important” for the two sides to “manage differences and disagreements and prevent confrontation and conflict.”\n\n“We hope that the US side will match its words with action and abide by the one-China policy and the three joint communiques. President Biden has said on many occasions that the US does not support ‘Taiwan independence’ and has no intention to use Taiwan as a tool to seek advantages in competition with China or to contain China. We hope that the US side will act on this assurance to real effect,” according to the readout.\n\nXi also defended China’s human rights records and governance system, saying that China has “Chinese-style democracy” that fits its national conditions, according to the readout. He acknowledged the differences between China and the US, but stressed that they should not become “an obstacle to growing China-US relations.”\n\n“The Chinese nation has the proud tradition of standing up for itself. Suppression and containment will only strengthen the will and boost the morale of the Chinese people,” the readout said.\n\nA meeting long in the making\n\nThe meeting Monday took place at a remarkably low moment in US-China ties. Biden hoped coming face-to-face again after nearly two years communicating only by phone and video-conference can yield a more strategically valuable result, even if he entered the talks with little expectation they would produce anything concrete.\n\nRelations have deteriorated rapidly amid economic disputes and an increasingly militarized standoff over Taiwan. The tensions have led to a decline in cooperation on areas where the two countries once shared common interests, like combating climate change and containing North Korea’s nuclear program.\n\nIn a national security strategy document released last month, Biden for the first time identified China as posing “America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge,” and wrote the country was the “only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that objective.”\n\nThere was almost no expectation among American officials that any of those issues could be resolved simply by getting Biden and Xi in the same room. Just arranging the meeting itself required US and Chinese officials to establish lines of communication after Beijing furiously cut off most channels following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan over the summer.\n\n“Every matter associated with this meeting, from phone calls to logistics, has been very carefully considered, negotiated, and engaged between the two sides,” a senior US administration official said.\n\nPlanning for Monday’s meeting predated Pelosi’s trip, and discussions continued between US and Chinese officials despite Beijing’s furor. The process was “serious, very sustained and professional in the best traditions of US-China diplomacy,” the official said.\n\nA second official acknowledged the talks setting up the meeting were not always friendly.\n\n“I won’t say that the conversations weren’t contentious because obviously there’s lots of areas where we have differences and challenges,” the official said. “The dozens of hours we have spent talking to our Chinese counterparts has definitely surfaced many of those issues.”\n\nFor his part, Biden takes meetings like this “incredibly seriously” and reads extensively beforehand. In meetings with advisers, he runs through various scenarios for how the meeting might go.\n\n“He goes through ‘if this happens, then should we handle it this way,’” the first official said. “He understands that this is, in many respects, the most important bilateral relationship. And it’s his responsibility to manage it well and he takes that very, very seriously.”\n\nOfficials said in Monday’s meeting they expected Biden’s senior-most advisers to accompany him as part of his official delegation. And they said they expected Xi to similarly surround himself with top aides, though the US team entered the meeting expecting to see some new faces on the Chinese side amid an ongoing transition inside Xi’s inner circle.\n\nBiden and Xi entered the meeting with momentum\n\nFor Xi, the trip to Bali also marked one of his first journeys abroad since the onset of the Covid pandemic, which prompted the Chinese government to impose strict lock downs and draconian restrictions. Xi’s reemergence on the physical world stage also comes on the heels of China’s Communist Party Congress in Beijing, during which he secured a norm-breaking third term as its leader.\n\nEven a week ago, most inside the White House were expecting Biden to enter the talks comparatively weakened by Democratic losses in the midterm elections. But better-than-expected results for Democrats left the president feeling as if he was entering his meetings this week with the wind at his back, according to top aides.\n\n“I know I’m coming in stronger, but I don’t need that,” Biden said of his own improved political fortunes on Saturday.\n\nUS officials previewing the meeting have stressed the Biden administration is not looking to come out of it with specific “deliverables,” including a joint statement listing areas of potential cooperation. Rather, the setting is aimed at offering both Biden and Xi a significant opportunity to better share their respective countries’ goals and perspectives.\n\n“Xi is not an enigma to President Biden,” a senior administration official told CNN. “He knows him. And he is mindful of where Xi is trying to take China. He sees China as a competitor, and he feels confident the US can win that competition.”\n\nChina’s pandemic-era isolation, US officials say, had made it relatively harder in recent years to get a read on Beijing’s intentions abroad as Xi declined to travel outside of China – but they believe that is all about to change.\n\n“We can expect them to be more assertive on the world stage,” the senior administration said. But, they added: “What that looks like is difficult to know right now.”\n\nSullivan said this week that finally substituting the pandemic-era video calls with a face-to-face meeting for the first time since Biden took office “takes the conversation to a different level strategically and allows the leaders to explore in deeper detail what each of them see in terms of their intentions and priorities.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Mj Lee", "Kevin Liptak", "Mj Lee"], "publish_date": "2022/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/21/politics/zelensky-biden-washington-visit-ukraine-russia-war/index.html", "title": "Zelensky delivers impassioned plea for more help fighting Russia on ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a historic speech from the United States Capitol Wednesday night, expressing gratitude for American support in fighting Russian aggression since the war began – and asking for more.\n\n“I hope my words of respect and gratitude resonate in each American heart,” Zelensky said during the joint meeting of Congress, later adding, “Against all odds, and doom and gloom scenarios, Ukraine didn’t fall. Ukraine is alive and kicking.”\n\nBut alongside Zelensky’s gratitude was a plea, emphasizing that his armed forces are outnumbered and outgunned by the Russian military even as they fight on. At one point, Zelensky drew laughs from the chamber when he said, “We have artillery, yes. Thank you. We have it. Is it enough? Honestly, not really.”\n\nZelensky’s visit to Washington marks his first trip outside his homeland since it was invaded 300 days ago, arriving Wednesday afternoon to set a course for the future of the war alongside a key Western ally.\n\nOn “the frontline of tyranny,” Zelensky argued during his speech to Congress, American support “is crucial not just to stand in such (a) fight but to get to the turning point to win on the battlefield.”\n\n“The world is too interconnected and too interdependent to allow someone to stay aside and at the same time to feel safe when such a battle continues,” he added. “Our two nations are allies in this battle and next year will be a turning point, I know it – the point where Ukrainian courage and American resolve must guarantee the future of our common freedom, the freedom of people who stand for their values.”\n\n“Your money is not charity,” he asserted to Congress. “It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.” Zelensky also called on lawmakers to strengthen sanctions against Russia.\n\nStill, despite that disparity in resources, Zelensky said, “Ukraine holds its line and will never surrender.”\n\nIn his speech, Zelensky harkened back to American history, referencing the Battle of the Bulge, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Battle of Saratoga. Just like “brave American soldiers which held their lines” and fought against Adolf Hitler’s Nazi Germany in 1944, Ukrainian soldiers “are doing the same to Putin’s forces this Christmas,” Zelensky said.\n\nHe also briefly discussed a 10-point peace formula and summit that he told US President Joe Biden about during an earlier meeting at the White House. Zelensky claimed Biden supported the peace initiatives.\n\nZelensky also recalled his recent visit to the frontlines – Bakhmut in Donbas – which has been under siege since May. There, he said, “every inch of that land is soaked in blood, roaring guns sound every hour.” In the climatic moment of the speech, he unveiled a Ukrainian flag signed by soldiers fighting in Bakhmut that he gave as a gift to the Congress.\n\n“The occupiers have a significant advantage in artillery. They have an advantage in ammunition. They have much more missiles and planes than we ever have. It’s true, but our defense forces stand,” he added.\n\nRussia, Zelensky argued in strong terms, has “found an ally” in Iran.\n\n“Iran’s deadly drones sent to Russia in hundreds became a threat to our critical infrastructure. That is how one terrorist has found the other,” he said. “It is just a matter of time when they will strike against your other allies if we do not stop them now.”\n\nZelensky’s White House visit\n\nEarlier Wednesday the Ukrainian leader visited the White House, where he met with Biden and held a joint news conference, during which the duo displayed a united front on their approach to the war.\n\n“I think … we share the exact same vision, and that a free, independent, prosperous and secure Ukraine is the vision – we both want this war to end,” Biden told reporters in the White House East Room.\n\nAt the start of the news conference, Biden relayed that he felt it was “particularly meaningful” to speak to Zelensky in person and “look each other in the eye.” The Ukrainian president’s leadership, Biden said, has inspired the world.\n\n“We understand in our bones that Ukraine’s fight is part of something much bigger,” Biden continued.\n\nBiden said Zelensky has shown his “strong stand against aggression in the face of the imperial appetites of autocrats,” and said the US was standing alongside Ukraine in maintaining “core principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.”\n\nBoth Biden and Zelensky addressed the Russians during the news conference, with the Ukranian president repeatedly calling Russian forces “terrorists” and Biden underscoring the importance of being “clear” about Russia’s actions.\n\n“It is purposely attacking Ukraine critical infrastructure, destroying the system to provide heat and light (to) Ukrainian people during the coldest, darkest part of the year. Russia is using winter as a weapon, freezing people, starving people, cutting them off from one another,” Biden said. The war, Biden later argued, “could end today if Putin had any dignity at all and did the right thing and just … pulled out. But that’s not gonna happen.”\n\nBut the two leaders, it seems, still have different perspectives on their approach to pursuing peace with Russia.\n\nEarly in the news conference, Biden said Zelensky was open to pursuing a “just peace.” Later, when asked by a reporter to share his idea of a fair way to end the war, the Ukrainian leader responded, “For me, as a president, just peace is no compromises as to the sovereignty, freedom and territorial integrity of my country, the payback for all the damages inflicted by Russian aggression.”\n\n“There can’t be any just peace in the war that was imposed on us by these … inhumans, I would say,” he added.\n\nMeeting comes at a critical moment\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky addresses Congress as Rep.

NA/Ukrainian Presidency In pictures: Zelensky's wartime visit to US Prev Next\n\nZelensky arrived to the South Lawn just after 2 p.m. ET, eschewing a suit for his now-familiar military green shirt. A military honor guard lined the White House driveway as his black vehicle pulled toward the building.\n\n“I understand that we have very important topics and we’ll discuss them, everything, so many challenges in Ukraine, in Europe, in the world, from energy to the situation on the battlefield,” Zelensky said in the Oval Office. “But first of all, really, all my appreciations from my heart, from the heart of Ukrainians, all Ukrainians, from our nation.”\n\nThe wartime visit was meant to demonstrate in stirring fashion the continued American commitment to Ukraine at a moment when Biden’s ability to maintain that support at home and abroad is being tested.\n\nIt has also been an opportunity for Biden and top American officials to sound out Zelensky on how he views the trajectory of the conflict, and to offer their thoughts on what it would take to bring the war to an end.\n\n“Together with our partners, we’re also going to impose costs on the Kremlin and will support Ukraine in pursuing a just peace,” Biden said in the Oval Office, a reference to how Zelensky has said he hopes to see the war end. “President Zelensky, the United States stands with the brave people in Ukraine.”\n\nSitting before a roaring fireplace, Zelensky offered Biden a military cross medal from a Ukrainian soldier serving on the front lines.\n\n“He said, ‘Give it to a very brave president,’” Zelensky said.\n\n“Undeserved but much appreciated,” Biden replied as he accepted the medal, asking if it would be possible to contact the Ukrainian soldier.\n\nA surprise visit\n\nThe trip, which US and Ukrainian officials arranged in secret over the past week, came with heavy risks. After arriving in Poland by train, Zelensky flew to Washington aboard an American military aircraft, US officials said. He arrived in the US shortly after midday at Joint Base Andrews, just outside the nation’s capital.\n\nUS President Joe Biden and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington, DC on December 21, 2022. - Zelensky is in Washington to meet with US President Joe Biden and address Congress -- his first trip abroad since Russia invaded in February.

A formal invitation was extended a week ago that Zelensky accepted, launching joint consultations on the security parameters of the risky, highly secretive trip.\n\nZelensky, who the official said was “very keen” to visit the US, determined those parameters met his needs, and the US set to work executing them. The trip was finally confirmed on Sunday.\n\nTight security was enforced around Zelensky’s visit amid concerns that Russia wants to incapacitate the Ukrainian president, a source close to the Ukrainian leader told CNN on Wednesday. Because of this ongoing threat, senior top government officials – as well as embassy staff in the US – were not informed about the schedule of the visit.\n\nAccording to the source, the military risk had to be calculated allowing the Ukrainian president to make the short overseas trip without jeopardizing the military situation. Scheduling also had to be worked with the White House to assess availability for this to happen.\n\nIn weighing a visit, Zelensky suggested he did not want to travel had there not been a significant development in the bilateral relationship between Ukraine and the US. Zelensky viewed the US decision to send Patriot missile defense systems to Ukraine as a major shift in the relationship between the two allies.\n\nThe new, $1.8 billion package Biden unveiled includes a Patriot surface-to-air missile system, which has been a longstanding request of Ukraine’s to fend of Russian air attacks. CNN was first to report the US was expected to send the Patriot systems to Ukraine.\n\nUnlike smaller air defense systems, Patriot missile batteries need much larger crews, requiring dozens of personnel to properly operate them. The training for Patriot missile batteries normally takes multiple months, a process the United States will now carry out under the pressure of near-daily aerial attacks from Russia.\n\nThe system is widely considered one of the most capable long-range weapons to defend airspace against incoming ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as some aircraft. Because of its long-range and high-altitude capability, it can potentially shoot down Russian missiles and aircraft far from their intended targets inside Ukraine.\n\nDuring the news conference, Biden told CNN’s Phil Mattingly that the missile system is defensive, not escalatory. Zelensky said the system is “something that will strengthen our air defense significantly.”\n\n“Every dollar of this investment for the United States is going to be a strengthening of global security and I know that the American leadership will be strong and will play important role in global scope,” Zelensky added.\n\nHe also suggested Ukraine would want more of the systems.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Maegan Vazquez", "Kevin Liptak", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/10/politics/biden-foreign-trip-north-africa-asia-cop27-g20/index.html", "title": "COP27 and G20: Biden aims to assert American leadership abroad ...", "text": "Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt CNN —\n\nIt’s a story President Joe Biden tells at nearly every opportunity: last year, meeting his new counterparts at his first international summit, he proudly informed them, “America is back.”\n\n“For how long?” one of them asked.\n\nAs Biden departs this week for a weeklong around-the-world trip, the question still resonates.\n\n“They’re very concerned that we are still the open democracy we’ve been and that we have rules and the institutions matter,” Biden said Wednesday during a news conference.\n\nBiden hopes his stops at a climate meeting here on the Red Sea, a gathering of Southeast Asian nations in Cambodia and a high-stakes Group of 20 summit on the Indonesian island of Bali will assert American leadership in areas former President Donald Trump either ignored or actively shunned.\n\n“If the United States tomorrow were to, quote, withdraw from the world, a lot of things would change around the world. A whole lot would change,” Biden said ahead of his trip.\n\nHe and his advisers believe they are entering the series of high-stakes meetings with a solid argument his version of the US role in the world will endure. He resisted historical and political headwinds in this year’s midterm elections while many of Trump’s handpicked candidates lost. And over the past year, he secured passage of a major climate investment and rallied the world behind efforts to support Ukraine and isolate Russia.\n\nYet the anxieties of American allies persist over the future of US commitments – to Ukraine, to fighting climate change, to treaty partners and, perhaps most urgently, to upholding Democratic norms. Foreign diplomats have watched intently as the midterm political season played out, searching for clues at how the American electorate was judging Biden’s first two years in office and reporting back to their capitals on voter dissatisfaction that could fuel Trump’s return to office.\n\nRepublicans appeared to be moving toward gaining control of the House of Representatives as of Wednesday night. And Trump is readying a third presidential bid, potentially to be announced while Biden is on the opposite side of the planet.\n\nWhite House aides have not voiced concern at the potential split-screen, believing foreign policy to be among the president’s strengths, particularly when compared to Trump’s chaotic style of diplomacy.\n\n“We just have to demonstrate that he will not take power,” Biden said Wednesday. “If he does run, making sure he, under legitimate efforts of our Constitution, does not become the next president again.”\n\nPresidents have often turned to foreign policy, where they can act with relatively few congressional restraints, at moments of domestic political turmoil. President Barack Obama launched a similar tour of Asia after his self-described “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms.\n\nFour defining global threats will loom over Biden’s trip: Russia’s war in Ukraine, escalating tensions with China, the existential problem of climate change and the potential for a global recession in the coming months. Other flashpoints, like North Korea’s rapidly accelerating provocations and uncertainty over Iran’s nuclear program, will also factor in.\n\nOf those, defending Ukraine and combating climate change could be the most impacted by results from this week’s election.\n\nAt the G20 summit, Biden hopes to rally leaders from the world’s developed economies behind his 10-month effort to isolate and punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. He isn’t planning to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, who won’t be attending the meeting in person and is considering whether to participate virtually.\n\nGlobal economic headwinds have tested international resolve for the pressure campaign, however, and world leaders have worked with varying levels of intensity toward finding a diplomatic end to the conflict.\n\nSome Trump-aligned House Republicans have called for cutting funding to Ukraine, though other GOP defense hawks have vowed not to abandon the country amid its war with Russia.\n\nHouse Republican Leader McCarthy, in an interview with CNN this week, attempted to reaffirm his support for Ukraine while saying they would not automatically rubber stamp any additional requests for aid.\n\n“I’m very supportive of Ukraine,” McCarthy said. “I think there has to be accountability going forward. … You always need, not a blank check, but make sure the resources are going to where it is needed. And make sure Congress, and the Senate, have the ability to debate it openly.”\n\nAt the United Nations climate summit in Egypt, Biden arrives having signed the largest US investment in fighting climate change ever, a dramatically different scenario from previous international meetings – including last year’s gathering in Scotland – where American commitments to carbon reduction weren’t backed by law.\n\n“We’ve seen the United States go from a global laggard to a global leader in less than 18 months,” a senior administration official said this week.\n\nThe $375 billion commitment will provide Biden leverage as he works to convince other countries to step up their own efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, all with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nIn his speech, Biden will call on nations to “really keep their eyes on the ball when it comes to accelerating ambitious action to reduce emissions,” the official said. And he will highlight his administration’s intent to propose a rule this week requiring large federal contractors to develop carbon reduction targets and disclose their greenhouse gas emissions, leveraging the federal government’s purchasing power to combat climate change in the private sector and bolster vulnerable supply chains.\n\nBut Republicans have said they will work to repeal parts of the law, and have accused Biden of contributing to rising energy prices by blocking the extraction of fossil fuels, which contribute to climate change.\n\nWhen Trump was president, he withdrew the US altogether from the Paris Climate Accord, the agreement leaders are meeting to discuss the week.\n\nEven absent the American political uncertainty, there are concerns rising energy costs and a looming recession could dampen resolve toward transitioning to cleaner energy. US officials have moderated expectations for this year’s summit, which Biden is only expected to attend for a few hours.\n\nIn Congress, Biden has achieved more bipartisan success in his efforts to counter China, the other major issue he will confront this week. A recently passed law meant to bolster the American semiconductor industry earned Republican and Democratic votes, partly because it promised to wean the US off its dependence on Chinese products.\n\nBiden’s aides worked over the past month to arrange his first face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping since taking office, even as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing. The meeting will take place on Monday at the G20 in Indonesia. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit in August to self-governing Taiwan enraged Chinese leaders and led to a near-shutoff of communication with the US.\n\nBiden said Wednesday he and Xi would lay out “what each of our red lines are” and discuss issues they each believe are in their own “critical national interests” during the meeting.\n\nIn his recently released National Security Strategy, Biden identified China as “America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge,” and he hopes an in-person meeting with Xi – who has just resumed international travel following the Covid-19 pandemic – can help establish lines of communication.\n\nXi arrives at the G20 fresh from an historic Communist Party conference that elevated him to an unprecedented third term – a sharp contrast to Biden’s current political situation.\n\nIt’s not yet clear how that disparity will manifest in Bali.\n\n“The big question is are the two leaders going to come in a sort of more conciliatory mode or sort of a more defiant one,” said Matthew Goodman, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n“They’ve both gotten through their political events of the year and they might come in a little more liberated for one reason or another to try to reach out and find common ground,” Goodman said. “There are the kind of global challenges that really affect both the US and China – whether it’s growth, or pandemics, or climate change. And so there’s possibility of some kind of conciliatory approach from both sides.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/26/politics/white-house-state-dinner/index.html", "title": "Biden to host French President Macron at White House for first state ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden will host his first state visit at the White House for French President Emmanuel Macron on December 1, the White House confirmed, marking the return of a tradition not seen since before the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“We’d like to announce that President Joe Biden and first lady Dr. Biden will host President Emmanuel Macron and Mrs. Brigitte Macron of France for a state visit to the United States on December 1st, 2022. This will be the first state visit of the Biden-Harris administration,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during Monday’s press briefing.\n\nThe state visit, which will include a state dinner, “will underscore the deep and enduring relationship between the United States and France – our oldest ally,” Jean-Pierre said.\n\n“Our close relationship with France is founded on our shared democratic values, economic ties and defense and security cooperation. The leaders will discuss our continued close partnership on shared global challenges and areas of bilateral interest,” she added.\n\nBiden is holding his first state dinner more than halfway through his term in office – later than previous US presidents. Jean-Pierre acknowledged Monday that “Covid certainly has delayed many of the in-person events a president traditionally hosts at the White House,” but highlighted previous White House visits by world leaders earlier in Biden’s term.\n\nThe tradition of the White House state visit – which is typically a multi-day affair that entails formal ceremonies, meetings and a glitzy black tie dinner – has been dwindling.\n\nThe Trumps welcomed the Macrons for their administration’s first state dinner in 2018. Their second and final state visit took place in 2019, when the White House hosted then-Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The Trumps were also slated to host the King and Queen of Spain in 2020 – an event that was postponed indefinitely due to the pandemic.\n\nMacron and Biden have spoken to one another several times since Biden took office in January 2021. Most recently, they met last week in New York as world leaders gathered for the United Nations General Assembly. The two discussed the ongoing war in Ukraine, Iran, the Indo-Pacific and challenges posed by China, according to the White House.\n\nBiden and Macron held their first formal meeting in June 2021 during the G7 Summit in England, walking away having relayed that they were on the same page. Macron heaped praise on Biden as being “part of the club” following a more fraught relationship with former US President Donald Trump.\n\nMacron, now in his second term, has emerged as the leading voice to advocate for the European Union. Since the warm G7 meeting, a number of global challenges have emerged, setting Macron up to distinguish himself on the world stage.\n\nA failed deal for France to produce nuclear-powered submarines for Australia caused a major international rift.\n\nIn September 2021, the French government recalled its ambassadors to the US and Australia for consultation in response to an announced national security partnership that would provide the US-produced submarines to Australia – abandoning a $90 billion existing deal with France to provide their submarines to the country.\n\nLater that fall, Biden admitted that his administration was “clumsy” in its handling of the deal, saying he was “under the impression that France had been informed long before that the deal was not going through.” And earlier this summer, France’s defense minister said the country aimed to rebuild its relationship with Australia.\n\nWestern leaders, including Biden and Macron, have broadly united in their opposition to combat Russia’s ongoing war on Ukraine.\n\nFrance has also been a key player in negotiations to curb Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nPressed on Monday whether the decision to host France was about mending ties following some rifts earlier in Biden’s term, Jean-Pierre responded, “We deeply value our relationship with France. … We work closely with France on the full range of global challenges, as you all know, including the war in Ukraine. It is for these reasons that the President and first lady thought it was important to welcome this close and valued partner to the White House for their first state visit.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Jim Acosta", "Maegan Vazquez", "Jim Acosta"], "publish_date": "2022/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/politics/biden-g20-summit-bali/index.html", "title": "G20: Biden steps into summit in Indonesia aiming to unite leaders in ...", "text": "Bali, Indonesia CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden is confronting competing issues at home and abroad while he’s at the Group of 20 Summit in Bali this week, using the moment on the world’s stage to lean into international support for condemning Russia’s aggression while also facing the prospect of hearing Donald Trump announce his next run for the presidency.\n\nAdministration officials previewing Biden’s G20 summit activities had their sights set on the coalition’s efforts to voice its opposition against the war in Ukraine, which could send a powerful signal amongst a group that’s so far had fragmented approaches to the Kremlin’s aggression.\n\nThis marks the first time the group has gathered in-person since the start of the invasion, and most G20 members are expected to sign onto a statement condemning Russia’s war in Ukraine “and the human suffering it has caused both for Ukrainians and for families in the developing world that are facing food and fuel insecurity as a result,” a senior administration official said.\n\nSuch an expression of condemnation has been the work of months of diplomacy between G20 leaders. However, it’s not clear yet exactly which countries will sign onto the declaration.\n\nAlthough the G20 is comprised of world powers who have long backed Ukraine during the war, it also includes other nations that have been tepid in their response to Russia’s aggression – including India, China, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, the host of this year’s summit. The coalition, which is broadly focused on the global economy, also includes Russia itself. But Russian President Vladimir Putin is not making an appearance at the summit this year.\n\nSince the spring, US officials have anticipated a showdown at this year’s G20 over the war. Biden has stated Russia should no longer be a member of the bloc, though expelling Moscow would require support from all of the G20’s members.\n\nAs of now, no official “family photo” is listed on a schedule, a sign of the deep acrimony within the G20 spurred by the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe president’s diplomatic Tuesday – a day working alongside leaders, including a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan – is expected to precede a 2024 presidential campaign announcement by Biden’s predecessor, Trump, from the other side of the world. The prospective announcement would set the stage for a two-year battle for the American presidency, having the power to cast a shadow over Biden’s efforts to unify world leaders – some already personally stung by Trump’s nationalist approach.\n\nBiden and his team have already spent time during his multi-leg, cross-continental trip abroad addressing domestic politics, suggesting the issue has not only loomed on their minds, but also among their foreign counterparts in meetings throughout their travels.\n\nOn Sunday, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that “many leaders” at the ASEAN Summit addressed the midterms with Biden, that many leaders were “following them closely” and that the president now feels he has a strong position on the international stage.\n\nVote counts for midterm races last Tuesday continue to trickle in, with Democrats only securing their continued majority in the US Senate this past weekend and the future of the US House of Representatives remaining up in the air. But Biden – who has frequently cast the US’ dynamic with other world powers as a global fight between democracy and autocracy – brought up the political headwinds working in his favor on Monday in Bali after he took part in a roughly three-hour meeting with Xi Jinping.\n\nAt a news conference after his meeting with Xi, Biden sought to cast the election results seen so far as a victory for the future of American democracy – a matter he had said was at stake at the polls.\n\n“The American people proved once again that democracy is who we are. There was a strong rejection of election deniers at every level from those seeking to lead our states and those seeking to serve in Congress and also those seeking to oversee the elections,” Biden said at the start of his remarks after the Xi meeting.\n\nThe president also met with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy. The meeting with Meloni was Biden’s first chance to confer with the new Italian prime minister in person since she took office in October – when she became the country’s most far-right leader since Benito Mussolini.\n\nIn a readout, the White House said the pair discussed a range of issues, but most notably the war in Ukraine.\n\n“The two leaders also discussed their commitment to continue providing Ukraine the support it needs to defend itself and to holding Russia accountable for its aggression,” a US readout said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden participated in working sessions and a luncheon with leaders at the summit. He also co-hosted an event on the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which the White House said “aims to mobilize $600 billion in the next five years with G7 partners to deliver sustainable infrastructure and advance U.S. national security and economic security interests.”\n\nBiden spoke about a range of investments by the US and multilateral institutions around the world at the event, saying that “this is something that we have an obligation to do.”\n\nBiden ticked through investments announced previously by a group formed by the Group of 7 nations, widely seen as a counter to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. “I want to emphasize the word ‘investments.’ Investments that are driven by local needs,” Biden said.\n\nBiden then announced the Just Energy Transition Partnership with Indonesia (the White House has released a fact sheet), which seeks to mobilize $20 billion in public and private money “to support Indonesia’s efforts to reduce emissions” and transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy.\n\nThe global infrastructure initiative event follows a launch in 2021 amongst G7 partners to better position the US and its allies to compete with China. China’s Belt and Road Initiative, first announced in 2013 under Xi, aims to build ports, roads and railways to create new trade corridors linking China to Africa and the rest of Eurasia. The Chinese-funded, cross-continental infrastructure initiative has been seen as an extension of the country’s sharp ascent to global power.\n\nOther topics at the summit, the senior administration official said, include economic coordination, climate change, and the Covid-19 pandemic, with new announcements expected on digital infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific and solar power in Honduras.\n\nBiden ended up skipping a leaders dinner on Tuesday to attend to other matters, an administration official said.\n\n“It’s not Covid,” the official made clear. Biden had tested negative earlier Tuesday after coming into contact with the Cambodian prime minister, who tested positive for the virus.\n\n“He just had spent a full day in meetings and needed to attend to a few things tonight (nothing urgent!),” the official said. Biden spoke to Indonesian President Joko Widodo to send his regrets for not attending the dinner.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Kevin Liptak Betsy Klein", "Maegan Vazquez", "Kevin Liptak", "Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/politics/biden-rail-strike-congressional-leaders/index.html", "title": "Biden 'confident' rail strike will be avoided though congressional ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Tuesday he is “confident” a rail strike will be avoided while meeting with the top four congressional leaders, though any one senator could slow down the process of approving legislation that would avert such a strike – and at least one said he was planning to do so.\n\n“I asked the four top leaders in Congress to ask whether they’d be willing to come in and talk about what we’re gonna do between now and Christmas in terms of legislation and there’s a lot to do, including resolving the train strike,” Biden said while meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n“It’s not an easy call but I think we have to do it,” Biden said. “The economy is at risk.”\n\nOn Monday, Biden called on Congress to “immediately” pass legislation to avert a railroad shutdown by officially adopting a September tentative agreement approved by labor and management leaders. Rank-and-file members of four unions have rejected the agreement and are prepared to go on a railroad strike on December 9 without either a new labor agreement or congressional action.\n\nBiden, a longtime labor ally, along with Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and other administration officials helped unions and management reach a tentative deal averting a freight railroad strike in September.\n\nA railroad strike could clog supply chains and lead to a spike in prices on necessities such as gasoline and food – dampening an economy that many fear is heading toward a recession. It could also cost could cost the US economy $1 billion in its first week alone, according to an analysis from the Anderson Economic Group.\n\nMichael Baldwin, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, one of the four unions whose members voted no on the deal, said Tuesday that Biden has let the union and its members down.\n\n“We’re trying to address an issue here of sick time. It’s very important,” Michael Baldwin, the president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on “Newsroom.” “This action prevents us from reaching the end of our process. It takes away the strength and the abilities that we have to force bargaining or force the railroads into a situation to actually do the right thing.”\n\nPelosi said Tuesday the chamber could vote as soon as Wednesday on legislation to adopt the September tentative agreement and avert a possible rail strike. Once passed, Senate action could occur later this week or next, several Senate sources have told CNN. The Senate is expected to have the votes to break a filibuster on the bill to avert a potential railway strike, the Senate sources also said. There are likely to be at least 10 Republicans who will vote with most Senate Democrats to overcome a 60-vote threshold.\n\nAfter the meeting, McConnell expressed openness to backing the legislation, and told reporters “We’re gonna need to pass a bill.”\n\nBut any one senator can slow the process down as timing agreements to move along legislation typically require unanimous consent from all 100 members of the chamber. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, criticized the proposed deal to avert a rail strike on Tuesday. Sanders reiterated his threat to slow down rail measure unless he gets sick-leave amendment vote in a tweet Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“At a time of record profits in the rail industry, it’s unacceptable that rail workers have ZERO guaranteed paid sick days. It’s my intention to block consideration of the rail legislation until a roll call vote occurs on guaranteeing 7 paid sick days to rail workers in America,” he wrote.\n\nAny one member can delay a quick vote and potentially put off final action until after the December 9 deadline to avert a strike.\n\nSome Republicans are still skeptical of congressional intervention, arguing they would rather the issue be dealt with administratively.\n\nMaine Sen. Susan Collins, a frequent swing vote, told CNN that the measure “deserves careful consideration.”\n\n“I’m going to wait and listen to the debate at lunch today before reaching any kind of conclusion,” she said.\n\nIowa Sen.

As of this point in his presidency, Biden has spent more than a quarter of his time working from his home state of Delaware, either at his house in Wilmington or his Rehoboth Beach property.\n\nSome 21 months into his term, Biden has made 55 visits to Delaware, totaling some or all of 174 days as of Sunday, according to a CNN analysis of presidential schedules and a tally kept by Mark Knoller, the longtime unofficial statistician of the White House press corps. In addition, Biden has made 19 visits, or all or part of 64 days, to the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland.\n\nHe has now surpassed even the getaway time of former President Donald Trump, so often criticized by Democrats for his regular departures from the White House to stay at one of his personal homes. At this point in his tenure, Trump had spent about 135 days at either his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, or his home at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump also had spent 23 days at Camp David.\n\n“President Biden is deeply proud of his roots and his family and it has been a staple of his time in public life to never lose touch with either,” White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said to CNN. “Presidents of the United States are constantly on the job, regardless of their location – whether they’re on a state visit overseas or just 100 miles from the White House for a short trip to Wilmington, DE. And as all Americans can agree, it’s important for leaders to avoid becoming ensconced in Washington, DC.”\n\nThe comforts of home can be a salve for the commander in chief while carrying out one of the world’s most demanding jobs. The American president is never truly “off,” and – in fact – Biden, like all presidents, has a whole remote White House apparatus that travels with him to facilitate that round-the-clock enterprise, with the most state-of-the-art capabilities, resources and technology traveling with him wherever he goes.\n\nSome argue that Biden can now lean into the normalcy of working from home, which millions of Americans had to rely on when Covid-19 forced isolation from offices and public spaces. “WFH” is not just a shorthand for being productive at the home office, it’s become a professional way of life for many.\n\n“It is 2022, not 1922. If the rest of the country can work from home, so can the president of the United States,” said Michael LaRosa, a director at a DC-based public affairs firm and former press secretary to first lady Dr. Jill Biden.\n\n“He spent (practically) every weekend in Delaware during his 36 years in the Senate, and his eight years as vice president,” LaRosa said. “This is nothing new. The Bidens have never lived in Washington, DC.” When he was a senator, Biden commuted back to Delaware almost every night by train – earning the nickname “Amtrak Joe” – and the train station in Wilmington is named for him.\n\nThe physical presence of a president is, however, meaningful for some, at least in ritual.\n\nThe statistics – 236 days away from the White House in Delaware and Maryland in less than two years on the job – are significant for the modern presidency. The job has been set in the nation’s capital near the Congress and the Supreme Court, in part for its symbolic power, for more than 220 years. Being in that power center brings a higher level of transparency thanks to the proximity to the national media, along with White House rules about press access and public records about who comes and goes.\n\nWhenever the president is actually in the Oval Office, for example, that presence is honored by the solemn watch of a stone-faced US Marine posted outside the West Wing.\n\n“A special challenge that Biden faces, because of his age, is that people will assume the worst if he’s not always visible. That is something that comes with being the oldest president in office,” said Tim Naftali, a CNN presidential historian, who notes presidents have had a “moveable Oval Office” for decades. “Perception is important in American politics.”\n\nThe optics of WFH or WFWH\n\nA president of the United States who doesn’t consider the White House his primary home does not go unnoticed by the media, or critics. But the executive mansion’s primary residents have generally found it stifling.\n\n“I always say I don’t know whether it’s the finest public housing in America or the crown jewel of the prison system,” former President Bill Clinton famously mused during a 1993 interview.\n\nKnoller, who during his 32-year career with CBS News covered the personal habits of six presidents, concurs.\n\n“It may look luxurious, but it can be suffocating to live and work there day in and out,” Knoller said.\n\nTrump’s trips to Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster were fodder for op-eds and lent themselves to critics painting a portrait of a president unwilling to give up the trappings of a luxe off-duty lifestyle. And though many days were spent on the golf course – 125 or so at this point in Trump’s presidency, compared to Biden’s 19 on the links – Trump was still the leader of the free world. Biden’s former boss, Barack Obama, traveled home much less frequently while in office but was frequently dinged – by Trump, among others – for the amount of golf he played.\n\n“(Ronald) Reagan and (George W.) Bush both spent lots of time at their private ranch homes,” said Knoller of two other former presidents who escaped the White House with regularity.\n\nKnoller tabulated time away for presidents, he says, because the numbers “added color to my reporting and gave insight to the president’s needs and activities.”\n\nAccording to Knoller’s count, George W. Bush spent all or part of 490 days – more than a year – at his Texas ranch during his eight years in office. Reagan spent nearly a year, all or part of 349 days, at his California ranch during his two terms. If Biden were reelected and kept up his current pace of trips to Delaware until the end of a second term in office, he would far surpass both Reagan and Bush in time away from the White House.\n\nHowever, post-pandemic culture has blurred the boundaries of what defines a workplace.\n\n“Our concept of being ‘on the job’ has shifted, and that may actually change the way we think about where our president needs to be,” Naftali said.\n\nSome of Biden’s biggest political wins came this summer, after all, when he was isolating in the residence of the White House after testing positive for Covid-19. Photos showed him tie-less, often working in the second-floor Treaty Room or reading papers with his feet up on the Truman balcony, Commander by his side.\n\nIt was a view into what Biden’s work from home life may be like when he’s in Wilmington or Rehoboth.\n\n“It’s a bit antiquated to think that because he is not physically in the White House on the weekends, that he is not working,” LaRosa said. “He never stops being President and he never stops working. Just ask the first lady.”\n\nA weekly ritual\n\nBiden has the advantage of a more normalized routine in his trips away from Washington.\n\nThe White House residence staff has by now perfected the choreography of managing, packing and planning the departure of the President and first lady most Fridays, the day, statistically, the Bidens normally split town.\n\nThe ushers know which bags are to be brought downstairs – it’s a light-pack, most of the couples’ needed belongings are already in their Delaware homes, a person familiar tells CNN. While Biden occasionally plays golf at a local course when in Wilmington, his other activities – seeing his grandchildren, taking casual social visits, going to church – don’t require multiple outfit changes.\n\nIn Rehoboth, he rides his bike and he and the first lady like to set up a big, blue umbrella on the sandy beach in front of their house and sunbathe or read in reclining chairs. Outside of swimsuits, joggers and polo shirts, it’s not a multiple-suitcase situation.\n\n“The biggest issue is usually the pets,” said the person familiar with the weekend planning for a presidential getaway to Delaware.\n\nCommander, now one year old and no longer a small puppy, and Willow, the barn cat adopted by Jill Biden, are “almost always” on the Delaware visits. While many American families leave their pets at home with caretakers for the weekend, or book them at pet-sitting facilities, the Bidens take theirs with them.\n\nThey like to be around their pets at all times – when Joe Biden was isolating at the White House with Covid-19 this summer, he was kept company by Commander; likewise, when Jill Biden had her bout with Covid, she spent the her rebound case isolation period in Rehoboth, with Willow.\n\nThe animals frequently travel to Delaware via van, with support staff, but occasionally they are in vehicles solely dedicated to their transportation, says the person. Willow, in particular, is not a fan of noisy, whirring helicopter blades, said another person familiar with the feline’s habits. In June, there was a rare sighting by White House press members of Willow in her crate, being carried by a residence staffer to Marine One for a weekend at Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThe Biden’s Delaware visits, of course, no matter how quick, have a significant footprint beyond those of the paws of their pets.\n\nSecret Service coordinates with law enforcement on all movements – several highway exits must close for the presidential motorcade, locals in both Wilmington and Rehoboth must at times wait on traffic patterns or be swept by agents with handheld magnetometers just to walk down the beach if one of the Bidens is there, as one neighbor of the Bidens in Rehoboth Beach told CNN.\n\nThe large presidential apparatus helps ensure that the President is able to perform his duties with the full input of his advisers, even if they’re not with him in person.\n\n“Unless we discover his being away from Washington results in him bobbling the ball as JFK did on the eve of the Bay of Pigs operation, there shouldn’t be an issue,” says Naftali, referring to Kennedy’s canceling of an air strike on a Sunday, without full consultation and full consideration, a move the former President later regretted.\n\n“But if Biden is in touch virtually and telephonically, in this era, leadership doesn’t have to involve always being physically present in Washington, D.C.”", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/politics/emmanuel-macron-white-house-visit/index.html", "title": "Emmanuel Macron arrives in DC at key moment in France-US ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron walked into a small holding room on the margins of the Global Fund conference in New York this fall, their aides had only allotted 10 minutes for the two men to briefly touch base.\n\nBut sitting in the cramped room at 538 Park Avenue with a handful of aides, the two leaders ignored repeated attempts by US and French officials to end the meeting and usher the two men to the ballroom where several heads of state were waiting to begin the conference. About 45 minutes later, they finally relented.\n\n“They just kept talking and talking and talking. And so you eventually had protocol people from both sides just continuing to step forward. I was actually wondering if they were about to physically grab them and drag them out of the room,” a senior administration official said, describing the meeting on the condition of anonymity. “I think if they had been left to their own devices, they probably would have sat there for another two hours and just kept talking.”\n\nThe September meeting typified the close working relationship that aides say has emerged between the two men. And it belied the fact that it fell almost exactly one year after French-American relations sunk to their lowest point in decades, with Macron taking the extraordinary step of recalling his ambassador to Washington for consultations over a US-Australia submarine deal that blindsided the French and cost them a multi-billion dollar defense contract.\n\nThose tumultuous weeks are now far from the minds of either men or their respective administrations as Macron touches down in Washington on Tuesday evening for an official state visit, the first time Biden has bestowed that honor on any leader since taking office nearly two years ago.\n\nThe visit will put on display the critical alliance and the increasingly close working relationship between the two men, brought even closer in the nine months since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last February, according to US and French officials. And it will be an opportunity for the pair – who both place a premium on personal relationships as a tool of international diplomacy – to deepen their personal relationship as well, with a private dinner with their spouses on Wednesday night ahead of the lavish state dinner the following day.\n\nSaul Loeb/Geoffroy Van Der Hasselt/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBiden and Macron have met several times on the sidelines of international conferences and speak regularly over the phone to coordinate the West’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – including at least seven one-on-one calls so far this year and a dozen joint calls with other leaders. During the midterm campaign, Biden frequently invoked an anecdote involving Macron to make his case about the importance of protecting democracy.\n\nAnd when Biden turned 80 earlier this month, Macron sent the US president a handwritten birthday card, a US and French official said, wishing Biden a happy birthday and congratulating him on his granddaughter’s wedding, which took place the same weekend.\n\nAbove all, senior administration officials indicated that France’s selection for Biden’s first state visit was intended to highlight the premium Biden has placed on the US core alliances, his view of the importance of democracies in a world being tested by rising autocracies and France’s central role in both of those principles – both as the US oldest ally and Macron’s starring role in its defining battles.\n\n“I mean, if you look at what’s going on in Ukraine, look at what’s going on in the Indo-Pacific and the tensions with China, France is really at the center of all those things,” said John Kirby, the National Security Council’s coordinator for strategic communications. “President Macron has been the dynamic leader inside the G7, particularly there in Europe. And so the President felt that this was exactly the right and the most appropriate country to start with for state visits.”\n\nOther natural candidates to highlight the US core alliances in Europe have become less obvious choices. The United Kingdom has been riven by political turmoil and Germany became a lesser-known quantity on the international stage following the departure of longtime Chancellor Angela Merkel. Meanwhile, Macron is the longest-serving European leader within the G7 and has sought to establish himself as Europe’s preeminent head of state.\n\n“France has in many respects jumped to the head of the queue and become America’s go-to partner when it comes to advancing transatlantic cooperation,” said Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former senior director for European affairs at the National Security Council. “And I think that’s in part because of Macron himself, who leans into Europe’s role in the world and who in comparison with most other European leaders is quite active and quite ambitious.”\n\nUS President Joe Biden (back to camera) shakes hands with French President Emmanuel Macron during the Global Fund Seventh Replenishment Conference in New York on September 21, 2022. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUS and French officials do not expect the visit to yield any major deliverables, but both sides see it as an opportunity for the two countries to deepen their partnership on a slew of global challenges, from the war in Ukraine to policy toward China and the challenges posed by Iran’s nuclear program. The two sides will also advance working group discussions which were launched in the wake of last year’s submarine affair to step up cooperation on space, cyberspace and energy issues.\n\n“We’re in an extremely strong place with France. There has been a tremendous convergence of our policy on all the big ticket items,” a senior administration official said.\n\nUkraine will be “front and center” in Biden and Macron’s discussions, the official said, from coordinating their efforts to supply Ukraine’s military, to continuing to punish Russia for its invasion and mitigating the economic and energy fallout on the West. Those discussions come as Europe braces for the stinging effects high energy costs and tight supply will have and as Ukraine’s recent battlefield advances have ratcheted European calls for negotiations with Russia.\n\nThe US and Europe’s policy in the Indo-Pacific and toward China is expected to be a close second, following Biden’s recent meeting with Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 in Indonesia and as Macron prepares to make a trip to Beijing early next year.\n\n“The two presidents are going to want to compare notes on that,” a senior administration official said. “Our views on China are not identical, but I think there is a strong view that we should be speaking from a common script in response to China.”\n\nWhile the US and France are closely aligned on both big ticket items, that’s not to say there aren’t also areas of disagreement and divergence. As a difficult winter approaches, calls in Europe for Ukraine to move toward negotiations have begun to grow louder and concerns are emerging about preserving Western unity as the war drags on. On China, Biden will look for Macron to link arms with him in confronting the country over its trade practices and military moves in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nPerhaps the biggest point of tension will be over billions of dollars in electric vehicle subsidies included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which applies only to those manufactured in North America. Macron has slammed the measure as protectionist and French officials said he intends to raise the issue in meetings with Biden and congressional leaders. The Biden administration has stood up a working group with the European Union to address the issue, but the text of the law limits the administration’s ability to act.\n\nA French flag flies alongside the US flag in front of the White House in preparation for this week's state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, in Washington, U.S., November 29, 2022. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nMacron’s forward-leaning stance on the issue underscores another dynamic of the Biden-Macron relationship: despite the closeness of the relationship and overarching agreement on top global issues, Macron has not been shy about carving out his own space on the global stage – including by pursuing and maintaining backchannel communications with Russian President Vladimir Putin – and publicly disagreeing with Biden at times.\n\nIn March, Macron warned against the risk of escalation after Biden called Putin a “butcher” who “cannot remain in power.” The next month, he warned again about an “escalation of words,” disagreeing with Biden’s decision to call Russian war crimes in Ukraine a genocide. And in October, Macron urged “prudence” after Biden warned of the risk of nuclear “Armageddon.”\n\nMacron’s approach has rankled US officials at times, but officials and experts say the free-wheeling nature of the comments point to a relationship with Biden – and the US – built on more than just personal connection.\n\nMacron had also secured the first state visit of President Donald Trump’s term in office, after pursuing a charm offensive that left some calling the relationship a “bromance.” But that “bromance” struggled to survive as Trump repeatedly cast doubt on the US commitment to the NATO alliance, leading to a war of words between the two men.\n\nNow, both sides know they have a partner fundamentally committed to the alliance – tactical and stylistic differences notwithstanding – particularly in the face of the war in Ukraine.\n\n“The irritants in the relationship are completely overwhelmed by partnership and solidarity,” said Kupchan, the former NSC senior European affairs director under President Barack Obama. “I think with Biden, (the French) know they have an Atlanticist. And they have someone who has transatlantic partnership in his DNA.”", "authors": ["Jeremy Diamond"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/politics/biden-us-africa-leaders-summit/index.html", "title": "Biden welcomes African leaders for summit as China and Russia ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden welcomed nearly 50 leaders from Africa on Wednesday for a summit intended to reset Washington’s commitment to a region where China and Russia are also working to expand their influence.\n\n“When Africa succeeds, the United States succeeds. Quite frankly, the whole world succeeds as well,” Biden said during his first appearance at the multi-day US-Africa Leaders Summit, being held in Washington.\n\nThe gathering, coming nearly two years into Biden’s term, will focus on issues critical to the continent’s future, including climate change, public health and food security. Already, the administration has announced billions of dollars in economic aid and voiced support for a permanent seat at the Group of 20 for a representative from the African Union.\n\nIn his speech, Biden announced billions of dollars in new trade investments and an effort to help expand internet access on the continent, which the President said was necessary to boosting economic growth.\n\n“Improving Africa’s infrastructure is essential to our vision of building a stronger global economy that can better withstand the kinds of shocks that we’ve seen in the past few years,” Biden said during his remarks.\n\nLater this week, Biden is also expected to unveil plans to travel to the continent – he hasn’t visited Sub-Saharan Africa since taking office – and to appoint a new special representative for implementing the summit’s commitments.\n\nFollowing his speech Wednesday, Biden was hosting a small group of African leaders at the White House “for a discussion on upcoming presidential elections in 2023 in Africa and US support for free, fair and credible polls across the continent,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Monday, a sign of Biden’s focus on issues of democracy on the continent.\n\nFour nations’ leaders were excluded from the summit invite list following recent coups. But otherwise, all of the continents’ countries will be represented, including some with dire human rights records. The gathering is one of the largest collection of foreign leaders in Washington in recent years, and has led to traffic jams and tightened security for the dozens of motorcades and officials.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Biden will host the heads of delegation and their spouses for a dinner at the White House before kicking off Thursday’s program and closing the day “with a discussion on food security and food systems resilience” in Africa, which Sullivan said has been disproportionately affected by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe goal, according to senior administration officials, is to build more robust ties with African nations in the hopes of addressing the significant challenges the continent faces and to cultivate beneficial economic and security partnerships.\n\n“The United States is all in on Africa’s future,” Biden said in his speech.\n\nIt’s not the first time African leaders have heard a similar message from an American president. President Barack Obama held his own US-Africa Leaders Summit in 2014, complete with gala dinner under a tent on the White House South Lawn. He promised then to take action to help build more prosperity and security in Africa.\n\nBut his predecessor Donald Trump largely ignored Africa, never visiting the continent and even rudely disparaging certain African nations in a 2018 meeting as “shithole countries.”\n\nMeanwhile, other nations have made inroads on the continent. China has worked to grow trade relations with African nations and has developed major infrastructure projects there. Russia has expanded its military influence, including through mercenaries like the Wagner Group.\n\n“We see Russia continuing to peddle cheap weapons,” US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday at a summit session. “And also, we see Russia employing mercenaries across the continent, and that is destabilizing as well.”\n\nThose countries, along with the European Union and Turkey, have each held their own summits for African leaders in recent years.\n\nIn previewing this week’s US summit, American officials have been careful to avoid framing Africa as a pawn in a larger geopolitical strategy. Instead, they have sought to emphasize Biden’s interest in cultivating ties that would benefit both the US and Africa, and finding ways to harness the continent’s potential.\n\n“The Summit, just to take a step back, is rooted in the recognition that Africa is a key geopolitical player,” Sullivan said. “The continent will shape the future, not just of the African people, but also the world.”\n\nYet the creeping leverage that Beijing and Moscow have exerted in Africa is a source of growing concern in Washington, particularly amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Some African nations have been wary of criticizing the invasion, even as they are burdened by its aftereffects, including global food shortages and high energy costs.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}]}

Elise Stefanik was seeking, Gay, when pressed, replied that \"antisemitic rhetoric when it crosses into conduct, that amounts to bullying, harassment, intimidation, that is actionable conduct, and we do take action.\"\n\nShe elaborated on her comments on social media and in an interview with The Harvard Crimson, the Ivy League institution's student newspaper.\n\n“There are some who have confused a right to free expression with the idea that Harvard will condone calls for violence against Jewish students,” she said in a statement posted on the social media platform X the day after the hearing. “Let me be clear: Calls for violence or genocide against the Jewish community, or any religious or ethnic group are vile, they have no place at Harvard, and those who threaten our Jewish students will be held to account.”\n\nNevertheless, Stefanik announced investigations of Harvard, MIT and Penn late last week.\n\nColleges consider legacy in admissions:New data finds hundreds of institutions look at family ties.\n\n'Redoubling the university's fight against antisemitism'\n\nIn its statement, the Harvard Corporation acknowledged Gay's missteps during the testimony and noted her apology.\n\n\"So many people have suffered tremendous damage and pain because of Hamas’s brutal terrorist attack, and the University’s initial statement should have been an immediate, direct, and unequivocal condemnation. Calls for genocide are despicable and contrary to fundamental human values,\" the statement continued. \"President Gay has apologized for how she handled her congressional testimony and has committed to redoubling the University’s fight against antisemitism.\"\n\nHer fate differs from that of another president who faced congressional questions: On Saturday, University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill, who appeared alongside Gay and Massachusetts Institute of Technology President Sally Kornbluth, resigned after a similar critique.\n\nDespite the furor, Gay drew petitions in support of her presidency, including one by 700 faculty and another by Black faculty.

And Harvard's most prominent alumni group unanimously backed Gay in a letter sent to the university's governing boards on Monday, according to a copy of the letter provided by the university to USA TODAY.\n\n“The suggestion that she would not stand boldly against manifestations of antisemitism and any suggestion that her selection as president was the result of a process that elevated an unqualified person based on considerations of race and gender are specious and politically motivated,” the petition by Black faculty reads.\n\nHarvard, MIT, Penn under a microscope:Pressure mounts on Ivy League universities to address antisemitism after presidents testify\n\nStudents, however, seemed far less attuned to the leadership tussle than lawmakers and the media.\n\nSeveral passing through campus' Science Center Plaza, just outside the gates of Harvard Yard, said they were not well informed or did not care enough about the issue to comment.\n\nThe few who were willing to talk told USA TODAY they support Gay.\n\nRiley Cullinan, a member of the Harvard class of 2027, said she sees Gay as someone who is trying her best in an incredibly difficult situation.\n\n“If the staff is rallying behind her, there’s probably a reason,” said Cullinan, who hasn’t yet decided on a major. “She deserves a chance to settle in.”\n\nFreshman Jacob Winter, of Lovettsville, Virginia, agreed Gay should be given a longer chance at the presidency, praised her for her commitment to free speech and said she should not be held to unrealistic standards of perfection.\n\n“Her remaining feels like a victory for something,” said Winter, who was still forming an opinion about the matter as he headed away from the freshman dining hall with his breakfast shortly after noon. “I think it would have been wrong if she would have been forced out because some student held unpalatable views.\n\n\"She was being held hostage by the donors and I think that was wrong.”\n\nWinter said he knew a little about the tension between the Israelis and Palestinians before the war, but has quickly educated himself since it began and now says he sympathizes with both sides. On campus, he said, he doesn’t think Jewish students should face antisemitism but nor should students who speak out in favor of Palestinians be doxxed or have their futures taken away merely for expressing their opinions.\n\nSo far on campus, he said, he’s seen only “spirited debate and openness” to considering all sorts of views.\n\n“That’s what college is for,” he said.\n\nConcerns raised about integrity of Gay's work, thesis\n\nThe Harvard board also addressed accusations about Gay’s dissertation. Gay earned her doctorate from Harvard and joined the faculty in 2006 as a professor of government before becoming a dean.\n\nThe board said it learned in late October of concerns about three articles Gay published and at her request launched an independent review of her published work. The review found “a few instances of inadequate citation.”\n\n“While the analysis found no violation of Harvard’s standards for research misconduct, President Gay is proactively requesting four corrections in two articles to insert citations and quotation marks that were omitted from the original publications,” the board statement said Tuesday.\n\nStefanik, in a post on X reacting to Gay retaining her post, excoriated the Harvard president.\n\n“There have been absolutely no updates to @Harvard’s code of conduct to condemn the calls for genocide of Jews and protect Jewish students on campus,” Stefanik wrote. “The only update to Harvard’s code of conduct is to allow plagiarists as president.”\n\nStudent Chiamaka Ihejirika, a freshman and computer science major, however, blamed a “smear campaign” for the negative publicity about her comments and the concerns about possible plagiarism in her scholarship, which Ihejirika dismissed as issues of attribution. “We’ve had worse” presidents of Harvard, she said.\n\nWhat is the Harvard Corporation?\n\nThe Harvard Corporation is the top governing body of Harvard, and its members have backgrounds in finance, academia, international relations and business.\n\nThe group was founded in 1650 and is the “oldest corporation in the Western Hemisphere,” its website says. The corporation, together with the university’s Board of Overseers, functions like a board of trustees.\n\nMost members of the Harvard Corporation − called fellows − have at least one degree from the institution.\n\nFellows Biddy Martin and Shirley Tilghman have decades of experience leading other selective colleges. Martin is a past president of Amherst College in Western Massachusetts and Tilghman, a molecular biologist, led Princeton University from 2001 to 2013.\n\nMany fellows of the Harvard Corporation have ties to big companies and business: Kenneth Chenault is CEO of American Express; Penny Pritzker was secretary of commerce under President Barack Obama; and Karen Gordon Mills was head of the Small Business Administration, also in the Obama administration.\n\nWhat's different about Harvard and Penn?\n\nHarvard and Penn, though both members of the Ivy League athletic conference, have significantly different financial resources, and therefore different relationships with – and reliance upon – their alumni. Harvard, for instance, is the wealthiest university in the U.S., with a roughly $50 billion endowment. Penn, on the other hand, has an endowment less than half that size.\n\nAnd their population of Jewish students is different, too. According to the most recent estimates from the Jewish student group Hillel, the amount of Jewish undergraduates at Harvard is less than half of the number enrolled at Penn.\n\nProfessors, free speech advocates condemn Magill's exit\n\nMagill's resignation on Saturday, and the ensuing calls for the other presidents to step aside, alarmed a number of professors and free speech advocates, who decried what they saw as a frightening precedent.\n\n\"I can't shake the feeling that this could embolden new political or donor led campaigns to exert undue control over universities,\" wrote Jonathan Friedman, director of free expression and education programs at the free speech organization PEN America, on X.\n\nThe Penn chapter of the American Association of University Professors, a prominent national faculty group, wrote in a statement Saturday responding to Magill's resignation that donors, lobbyists and politicians had successfully waged a campaign to \"destabilize\" the school.\n\n\"These distortions and attacks on our colleagues have not addressed the scourge of antisemitism − a real and grave problem,\" they wrote. \"Instead, they have threatened the ability of faculty and students to research, teach, study, and publicly discuss the history, politics, and cultures of Israel and Palestine.\"\n\nPenn announced Tuesday that Dr. J. Larry Jameson, executive vice president of the University of Pennsylvania for the Health System and dean of the Raymond and Ruth Perelman School of Medicine, will serve as interim president at Penn effective immediately.\n\nContributing: Claire Thornton", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/11/us/russian-oligarchs-philanthropy-ukraine-war-invs/index.html", "title": "'It's shameful': Russian-linked billionaires have given enormous ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTheir names are etched in stone alongside some of the most powerful people and companies in American history – the Rockefellers, the Walgreens, and the Coca-Cola company.\n\nThey’ve sponsored fellowships at Ivy League schools, have educational centers named after them, and sit on the boards of leading cultural institutions in the United States and Western Europe. They’re celebrated philanthropists and patrons of the arts.\n\nBut there’s something else these donors share that other well-heeled benefactors do not: Deep financial ties to Russia.\n\nWhile there is nothing new about the reputation laundering of the oligarch class, it is facing renewed scrutiny in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The recent renaming of the “Russian Lounge” at Washington’s John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts underscores the sensitivity surrounding such relationships.\n\nVladimir Potanin acquired his “philanthropic leadership” at the Kennedy Center – where his name is inscribed on the polished marble walls along with General Motors, Boeing and Capital One – with a $5 million donation in 2011.\n\nPotanin – Russia’s wealthiest businessman who plays hockey with Putin and has so far dodged Western sanctions – made his fortune devising a system for Russian business leaders to loan money to the cash-strapped administration of then-president Boris Yeltsin in the mid-’90s. When Russia could not repay the loans, the businessmen were allowed to buy key state assets for pennies on the dollar. At the time, Potanin and his business partner bought 38% of the mining and metal company Norilsk for $170.1 million, a stake that would be worth nearly $20 billion 15 years later.\n\nAround the time of the Kennedy Center donation, he said that he hoped it would “present an image of contemporary Russia to the American audience, stepping beyond the clichés about our country.”\n\nBut contributions like this appear to serve another purpose.\n\nIt is “the classic example of essentially trying to buy a better reputation … to distract from the fact that you’re still very much tied to an authoritarian regime,” said Jordan Gans-Morse, professor of corruption in the post-Soviet era at Northwestern University.\n\nAn old American playbook\n\nPotanin, who was identified by the US Treasury Department in 2018 as one of nearly a hundred influential Russian billionaires with close ties to the Kremlin, isn’t the first or only oligarch to use his wealth to attempt to sway the opinion of Western elite. In fact, it’s a page straight out of an old American playbook.\n\nNineteenth century robber barons famously splashed their names across orchestra halls and museums to shed their reputations as ethically dubious industrialists who amassed enormous wealth on the backs of America’s most vulnerable. It worked: When most Americans hear the name Andrew Carnegie, they probably think of Carnegie Hall or Carnegie Mellon and not one of the deadliest labor confrontations in American history, which occurred at one of his steel plants in 1892.\n\nA more recent example is the way the Sackler family behind Purdue Pharma reportedly donated tens of millions of dollars in what critics say was an effort to obscure the deadly legacy of its blockbuster drug OxyContin. Prestigious Western cultural institutions, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Louvre in Paris, have had to reckon with donations from the Sackler family in the aftermath of the opioid crisis. The National Portrait Gallery in London turned down a $1.3 million donation from the family in 2019 and others have also pledged not to take Sackler money in the future.\n\nA sign welcomes visitors to the Sackler Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 2019. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nIn much the same way, Putin’s inner circle – many of whom are oligarchs who have profited off corruption and made their wealth in illicit ways – use philanthropy in the West to launder their reputations and gain access to American and European high society, according to experts.\n\nDartmouth sociology professor Brooke Harrington said oligarchs of any nationality typically target three kinds of institutions with their donations – cultural, political, and educational.\n\nWhile most universities are required to disclose gifts and contracts with foreign actors exceeding $250,000 a year under federal law, a 2020 report by the Department of Education found widespread noncompliance. Yale, the report states, “underreported its foreign gifts and contracts by $375 million.” Harvard, in turn, “appears to possess inadequate institutional controls over its foreign donations and contracts,” the report found. Yale acknowledged the issue at the time saying the university failed to submit reports between 2014 and 2017, but had since corrected this. Harvard said it had identified “a wider range of contracts” and updated its reports accordingly.\n\nSeven Russian billionaires donated hundreds of millions of dollars to American universities, charities, museums and foundations just since 2009, according to an analysis from the Anti-Corruption Data Collective and CNN reporting.\n\nSome experts say cultural and educational institutions can do more to prevent the reputation laundering of their donors.\n\nRespected institutions have a responsibility not to glorify those who built their wealth through illicit trade, said Louise Shelley, a public policy professor at George Mason University.\n\nNow, some cultural centers and universities are grappling with what to do with oligarchs’ donations.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Inside the American steel mill tied to a Russian oligarch 05:19 - Source: CNN\n\n“If they can co-opt the thought leaders, as well as the political leaders, as well the cultural leaders – it becomes much harder to stop whatever it is that Putin wants to do,” Harrington, the Dartmouth professor, said.\n\nViktor Vekselberg’s partnership with MIT: “It is just absolutely wild”\n\nA decade ago, Putin wanted to stop the brain-drain of scientists and engineers to the West and cultivate home-grown tech at a $3 billion Moscow-based innovation center.\n\nAt the time, Washington and Moscow were attempting a closer relationship and the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology provided the perfect combination of knowledge, credibility and reputation for the Russian project.\n\nThe Skolkovo Foundation – led by one of Putin’s close allies Viktor Vekselberg – entered into a partnership with MIT in 2011 to build the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, or “Skoltech,” outside of Moscow.\n\nKeith Stevenson, Skoltech’s provost, told CNN in an interview that the main premise of the relationship was to develop “academic excellence and research that could be contributing to the growth of the economy around the world.”\n\nVekselberg, like many other oligarchs, made his money during the privatization of Russia’s natural resources, specifically oil and metals, after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe collaboration with Skolkovo provided MIT with over $300 million, half of which was earmarked to develop Skoltech’s curriculum and the other half to use “for its own development,” according to Boston’s WGBH News.\n\nAt the start, Russia was “an ally,” MIT professor and former President of the Skolkovo Institute Edward Crawley told WGBH News, and said the relationship was similar to one the university would have with any other foreign institution.\n\nHowever, Vekselberg and Skolkovo quickly caught the attention of federal investigators.\n\nA few months after the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014, Boston’s local FBI office published an unusual warning:\n\n“The [Skolkovo] foundation may be a means for the Russian government to access our nation’s sensitive or classified research development facilities and dual-use technologies with military and commercial application,” the assistant special agent in charge wrote.\n\n“This type of activity does not go on at Skoltech,” said Stevenson, claiming the FBI was “talking to people that had really no true understanding of who was initiating the project.”\n\nMIT, too, was quick to dismiss the concerns and even renewed Vekselberg’s appointment to its Board of Trustees in 2015.\n\nViktor Vekselberg attends a meeting at the G20 Summit in 2013 in St. Petersburg, Russia. Handout/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nVekselberg made at least four donations to the university between 2015 and 2017, according to the Anti-Corruption Data Collective, and had a scholarship named after him.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, MIT confirmed Vekselberg has not donated to the university since 2017.\n\nInvolving Vekselberg to build the “innovation ecosystem” at Skoltech was “perfectly logical,” Stevenson said. “He’s a very well-experienced, internationally-known businessman.”\n\nStevenson added he could not comment on Vekselberg’s relationship with the Kremlin but said that, at Skoltech, his involvement “has been completely on a professional level to help build innovation.”\n\nVekselberg did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nCasey Michel, an expert on kleptocracies and illicit finance and author of a book on foreign investments in the US, sees it differently.\n\n“It is just absolutely wild how one of the most notorious oligarchs to emerge from Russia was able to obtain a seat on the actual board of one of the most prestigious universities in the United States of America,” Michel said.\n\nMIT scrubbed its website of Vekselberg’s name and removed him from its board only after he was sanctioned by the US in 2018 for benefitting from Putin’s regime. The US Treasury Department said he played “a key role in advancing Russia’s malign activities” – including the occupation of Crimea, supplying weapons to the Assad regime, attempting to subvert Western democracies and malicious cyber activities.\n\nIt did not, however, end its partnership with Skolkovo.\n\nEven a federal investigation into the financial relationship between MIT and Skolkovo didn’t stop the leading research center from renewing its collaboration with the Russians in 2019. That was just months after MIT’s Media Lab was forced to publicly apologize for its American dirty donor Jeffrey Epstein, who was accused of running an underage sex trafficking ring before he committed suicide in August 2019.\n\nIn April 2019, MIT announced an enhanced vetting process for accepting donations. In a statement to CNN earlier this month, MIT said its review process “examines risks related to national security, protection of intellectual property, compliance with federal laws, data security and access, and other relevant issues while seeking to support the free and open pursuit of knowledge.”\n\nTwo months ago, after the invasion of Ukraine, MIT finally severed ties with the Russian foundation saying “this step is a rejection of the actions of the Russian government in Ukraine. We take it with deep regret because of our great respect for the Russian people and our profound appreciation for the contributions of the many extraordinary Russian colleagues we have worked with.”\n\nMIT President L. Rafael Reif said the termination of the relationship with Skoltech “comes with considerable sadness, but the actions of the Russian government made our choice clear… This does not diminish our pride in the work we did to develop Skoltech and in the first-rate research that has flowed from the relationship.”\n\nHarrington, the Dartmouth professor, said that when considering donations, institutions must remember who they are supposed to serve.\n\n“It’s the obligation of these institutions to ask themselves: does it serve the public good?” Harrington said. “Do they exist to do reputation laundering and facilitate the agenda of what is obviously now an enemy state?”\n\nWhat’s more, Michel argues that universities, especially elite institutions like MIT, have extensive resources in-house to determine where big donors’ money comes from.\n\n“They have to understand themselves as having those resources to be able to actually examine and understand what the implications of these donations, these open doors of access, may be,” Michel said.\n\n“It is incumbent upon them,” he added, “to understand the source of this wealth.”\n\nA Soviet-born billionaire was knighted, but his donations still raise eyebrows\n\nPerhaps the most prodigious example of Russian reputation laundering is that of Len Blavatnik. The Ukrainian-born billionaire made his money during the privatization of state-owned commodities like aluminum and oil following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nBlavatnik, who holds both British and US citizenship, was awarded knighthood in the UK for his philanthropy and has rubbed elbows with some of Hollywood’s most famous – and infamous – people, including Harvey Weinstein, with whom he used to host a luncheon on his yacht during the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nLen Blavatnik and Harvey Weinstein attend a private dinner in Moscow on June 11, 2015. Victor Boyko/Getty Images\n\nBlavatnik has repeatedly denied having connections to the Kremlin. “Mr. Blavatnik is not Russian. He’s an American citizen, and has been for almost 40 years, (he) was born in Ukraine. He has no involvement in Russian politics or in the Russian government,” a spokesperson for his company Access Industries said in a statement provided to CNN.\n\nHowever, Blavatnik is close to Vekselberg. Three years ago, Vekselberg – Blavatnik’s college friend and business partner who was sanctioned by the US back in 2018 – told the Financial Times: “All his main money, he made here in Russia, with me.”\n\nBlavatnik and Vekselberg owned major stakes in Russia’s largest aluminum company, Rusal.\n\n“That is the most corrupt industry in one of the most corrupt countries in the world. You can’t disentangle the sources of this wealth from the initial sources of the corruption,” said Michel.\n\n“You cannot have made that money without specific political connections or connections to organized crime or connections to other oligarchic figures,” he added.\n\nAs a result, Blavatnik’s donations and ties to oligarchs have raised eyebrows in the past.\n\nWhen Oxford University accepted more than $100 million from Blavatnik in 2010 to establish the Blavatnik School of Government, critics, in a letter published in the Guardian, insisted the school “stop selling its reputation and prestige to Putin’s associates.”\n\nFollowing the invasion of Ukraine, the university said its government school would continue to be named for the businessman. “Without (Blavatnik’s) generosity, the creation of the School would not have been possible. He has always respected the academic independence of the School and never attempted to direct its activities,” according to a statement from Oxford University published by its student paper.\n\nSince then, Blavatnik has made several other sizable donations, including $25 million to Carnegie Hall in New York – which named a seating section after him; $65 million to London’s Tate Modern – which named a building after him; $35 million to Yale – which named a fellowship after the business tycoon; as well as several multi-million-dollar grants to Stanford University, Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2018, Blavatnik made the largest ever donation to Harvard’s medical school – a whopping $200 million.\n\nAnti-corruption activists warned about Blavatnik’s efforts to export “Russian kleptocratic practices to the West” in a 2019 letter to the board of the Council on Foreign Relations, which named an internship program after Blavatnik following a $12 million donation.\n\n“It is our considered view that Blavatnik uses his ‘philanthropy’ – funds obtained by and with the consent of the Kremlin, at the expense of the state budget and the Russian people – at leading western academic and cultural institutions to advance his access to political circles,” the group of 55 American and European foreign policy experts and anti-corruption activists wrote. “Such ‘philanthropic’ capital enables the infiltration of the US and UK political and economic establishments at the highest levels.”\n\nFederal law prohibits foreign nationals – and thus, most Russians – from donating to US political campaigns. But Blavatnik, with his US citizenship, is a major donor to the Republican party. He has also made some smaller donations to Democrats and was photographed with former President Bill Clinton at a gala at Lincoln Center in 2013.\n\nLen Blavatnik, left, and former US President Bill Clinton speak at a gala at Lincoln Center in New York in 2013. Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBlavatnik’s success in improving his reputation as an American and British citizen “is just head and shoulders above all these other oligarchs,” said Michel, who believes the businessman owes part of that success to his nationalities.\n\nHis passports would also shield him from sanctions, Michel explained.\n\n“There is no capacity for the US to sanction its own citizens, to seize its own assets and to effectively bar them from ever visiting the United States of America – and the same would go for the United Kingdom as well,” he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'The last straw': Former oligarch on renouncing Russian citizenship 03:49 - Source: CNN\n\nInstitutions grapple with what to do\n\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, western institutions have scrambled to distance themselves from oligarchs and their donations.\n\nThe Tate Modern in London severed ties with Vekselberg and another oligarch, Petr Aven, who until recently headed Alfa-Bank in Russia and is sanctioned by the European Union.\n\nOther institutions, such as Harvard University, are taking a softer approach.\n\nHarvard’s Medical School, which opened the Blavatnik Institute after the $200 million donation from the businessman four years ago, has not said it would return the funds or rename the institute. Rather, it has funded several visiting trainee positions at the school for Ukrainian scientists eager to flee their war-torn country.\n\nHarvard declined to comment.\n\nYale, which has a grant program named for Blavatnik, said the university would not allow individuals subject to US sanctions to make donations.\n\nPotanin resigned from his role as trustee of the Guggenheim Museum in New York after nearly 20 years. The Council on Foreign Relations also dropped him from their board.\n\nThe Kennedy Center’s “Russian Room” reopened in March under the name the “Opera House Circles Lounge.” A spokesperson told CNN that the term limit for the name of the room had expired, but separately referenced the war in Ukraine as a factor in the renaming.\n\n“Due to the tragedy in Ukraine, the Kennedy Center and the [Potanin] Foundation have mutually agreed to no longer use the name Russian Lounge,” the spokesperson said.\n\nPotanin did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nStill, Potanin’s name remains carved in the marble walls of the Kennedy Center.\n\n“It’s embarrassing,” said Michel. “It’s shameful. It’s a blight on the Kennedy Center itself and its only going to continue aging poorly.”\n\nThis story was updated to include a post-publication comment from Len Blavatnik’s company, Access Industries.

They had been hired at the outset for their expertise as Supreme Court litigators.\n\nSizing up the affirmative action controversy destined to affect campus diversity nationwide, Burroughs said: “It is the sort of case that I suspect will ultimately be decided above my pay level.”\n\nThe Supreme Court will indeed now take it up, on Monday, in one of the most closely watched disputes of the current session.\n\nAmong those in the spectator seats in April 2015 was Edward Blum, a conservative activist who’d created an entity called Students for Fair Admissions and begun raising millions of dollars from right-wing donors for this broadside against affirmative action at Harvard and, in a case filed simultaneously in November 2014, against the University of North Carolina.\n\nBlum had previously enlisted White students to sue over race-based admissions at the University of Texas – and lost. He added a new dimension to the Harvard case, claiming that high-achieving Asian American applicants were unlawfully disadvantaged by screening policies that favored traditionally underrepresented Blacks and Hispanics.\n\nA former stockbroker who never went to law school, Blum, now 70, has a talent for fashioning cases that appeal to the increasingly conservative high court. Using many of the same lawyers over the years, he engineered a series of lawsuits against the 1965 Voting Rights Act culminating in Shelby County v. Holder, the 2013 decision that curtailed the reach of the Voting Rights Act over designated states with a history of discrimination.\n\nIn the pending effort against affirmative action, Blum’s legal team failed to persuade Burroughs or any of the other lower court judges that heard the challenges that consideration of an applicant’s race, among other criteria, violated federal law or the Constitution.\n\nYet this high court venue now appears more promising to the challengers since the cases were filed nearly eight years ago. The bench is now dominated by six conservatives, with only three liberal justices.\n\nThe court, which already had demonstrated an aversion to racial remedies, in June showed a startling disregard for precedent when it reversed the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that guaranteed a right to abortion nationwide.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions wants the justices to throw out Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, the 1978 case that first validated universities’ use of race in determining who was selected for a coveted place on campus, and Grutter v. Bollinger, a significant 2003 decision reinforcing Bakke.\n\nThe Harvard admissions program was held up as a model in the Bakke case, based on the principle that diversity is essential to the educational mission and that while schools may use race to lift an applicant’s prospects, they may not engage in quotas.\n\nSFFA has sued under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits schools receiving federal funds from discriminating based on race, and under the 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection of the law, which covers state institutions.\n\nLawyers for Harvard and UNC describe race as a “plus” factor, considered along with a student’s academic record and test scores, extracurricular activities and personal attributes. Race shapes one’s life experiences, they say.\n\nBack in 2015, Judge Burroughs noted that advocates for Black and Hispanic students were seeking to intervene in the case. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law argued that a verdict for Students for Fair Admissions would especially disadvantage minority students who’d experienced fewer academic opportunities and that they should be represented at trial.\n\n“UNC needs race-conscious admissions to achieve the diversity,” David Hinojosa, of the Lawyers’ Committee, wrote in their brief to the Supreme Court, “in part, because of the University’s sordid history of excluding Black applicants well into the twentieth century and its present-day effects, which impede the University’s ability to attract, enroll, and retain Black, Latino, and Native American students, in particular.”\n\nHinojosa added that one student “testified regarding several confederate relics on UNC’s campus” and said “having to walk past the ‘racist wallpaper … every day adds to that feeling of not being valued … .’”\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court’s newest member and its first African American female justice, will hear only the UNC dispute, having recused herself from the Harvard case because she previously served on its board of overseers.\n\nThe Blum genesis\n\nBlum, whose home is in Penobscot Bay, Maine, has been originating lawsuits against racial policies since the early 1990s when he lived in Houston. After he ran unsuccessfully for the US House of Representatives in Texas, he became part of a group of plaintiffs who sued the state over its congressional district maps.\n\nIn part to compensate for past discrimination, Texas had created Black-majority and Hispanic-majority districts to increase the chances for minorities to elect a candidate of their choice. The Supreme Court struck down the Texas plan in the 1996 case of Bush v. Vera, finding that the map violated the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee because race was the predominant factor in the map lines, at the expense of traditional districting criteria such as compactness.\n\nBlum turned his attention to higher education in the early 2000s, bringing a case against his alma mater, the University of Texas at Austin, on behalf of Abigail Fisher, a White student denied admission who was also the daughter of a Blum friend.\n\nIn a CNN interview, Blum described race-based admissions as polarizing. “No one is suggesting diversity is a bad thing,” he said, “but just treating people differently because of their race and ethnicity, that’s a different element in the quest for diversity.”\n\nAfter two Supreme Court rounds, Fisher lost that case against UT in 2016, as a sharply divided court upheld the principles of Bakke and Grutter, allowing schools to look to race as one criterion among many.\n\n“As this Court has said,” Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote, “enrolling a diverse student body ‘promotes cross-racial understanding, helps to break down racial stereotypes, and enables students to better understand persons of different races.’ Equally important, ‘student body diversity promotes learning outcomes, and better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society.’”\n\nKennedy has since retired, as has Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, who penned the 2003 Grutter decision. In such racial disputes, no justice has replaced them as a centrist jurist brokering the middle ground.\n\nThe Asian-American dimension\n\nBlum developed the cases against Harvard and the University of North Carolina while the University of Texas lawsuit was ongoing. The Asian American element in the claim against the storied Harvard campus – emphasized by the challengers as they recall caps on Jewish students at Ivy League institutions decades ago – has drawn more national attention, compared with the UNC lawsuit.\n\nNo individual Asian American students were named in the Students for Fair Admissions complaint. Blum attributed that to fears of personal attacks, whether on social media or in person at a campus dormitory.\n\nIn its filings, Students for Fair Admissions asserted that as Harvard engaged in unlawful “racial balancing,” it held Asian American applicants to higher standards than Black and Latino students. SFFA also contends admissions officers adopted stereotypes as they applied to “personal ratings,” categorizing Asian Americans as one-dimensional, lacking leadership qualities and falling short on traits such as “likeability.”\n\nAfter a 15-day trial, Judge Burroughs found no intentional discrimination at Harvard and rejected claims of racial animus. The 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision.\n\nIn the University of North Carolina case, US District Court Judge Loretta Biggs upheld the schools use of race among many criteria, emphasizing that state institutions of higher education must be “open and available to all segments of our citizenry.”\n\nA firebrand law firm\n\nBlum has partnered with William Consovoy and Thomas McCarthy for more than a decade, including in the consequential case of Shelby County v. Holder, which curtailed the reach of the Voting Rights Act over states, mainly in the South, that had a record of electoral discrimination. Before Consovoy and McCarthy founded their own boutique firm in 2014, as the affirmative action cases were being developed, they were part of a larger Washington, DC-based law firm that had represented Blum back in the 1990s.\n\nTo pay the legal fees, Blum has collected millions of dollars from conservative benefactors through Donors Trust, which raises tax-exempt funds and channels them to various projects.\n\nConsovoy, a former law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas who appeared before Burroughs from the start in 2015 and argued the SFFA appeal at the 1st Circuit in 2020, is currently being treated for brain cancer. Another partner, Cameron Norris, also a former Thomas clerk, will represent SFFA in the Harvard case on Monday.\n\nWaxman will be back at the lectern for Harvard. In the UNC case, Patrick Strawbridge, another former Thomas clerk at Consovoy McCarthy, will represent SFFA, and North Carolina state solicitor general Ryan Park, a former law clerk to the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, will appear for the university.\n\nConsovoy McCarthy, often taking the helm in ideologically driven cases, represented then-president Donald Trump as he lodged election-related lawsuits in multiple states before the November 2020 presidential contest.\n\nAt the same time, Waxman, who was US solicitor general during the Clinton administration and is now in private practice at WilmerHale, was one of three former Democratic solicitors general who worked behind the scenes on a legal plan to counteract claims by Trump and other Republicans.\n\nBiden administration enters case\n\nJoining the veterans in the case will be current US solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar, siding with the universities on behalf of the Biden administration. (The Trump administration had earlier backed Students for Fair Admissions.)\n\nPrelogar, who held consecutive clerkships for Ginsburg then Justice Elena Kagan, will present arguments in both cases Monday, highlighting the importance of diversity in higher education at West Point and other military academies. “The Nation’s military leaders,” she wrote in a brief, “have learned through hard experience that the effectiveness of our military depends on a diverse officer corps that is ready to lead an increasingly diverse fighting force.”\n\nBlum, who insists that any policy of diversity based on race is wrong, will be in the spectator section of the courtroom on Monday.\n\nHe hopes that the high court is now ready to end the use of race in admissions, yet he adds with some caution, “After working on eight Supreme Court cases, I’ve learned that litigants can be very surprised” at a final decision.", "authors": ["Joan Biskupic"], "publish_date": "2022/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/06/30/affirmative-action-ruling-college-admissions-what-students-can-expect/70371168007/", "title": "College admissions changes are coming after affirmative action ruling", "text": "Big changes are coming to how elite colleges choose future students – and how those applicants vie for coveted seats.\n\nA Supreme Court ruling Thursday concluded that Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated the 14th amendment to the Constitution by considering students’ race as one of many factors in admissions decisions. This form of affirmative action, which is common at the country’s several hundred highly selective institutions, is no longer allowed.\n\nStudents of color say the decision is devastating and sharply changes their outlook on the admissions process. “It made me wonder immediately, how is this going to affect my senior year?” said Rikka Dimalanta, 17, who will be a senior this fall in Los Angeles. “If our identity as students isn’t going to be taken into account, what else am I supposed to put on my application?”\n\nThere are other ways for colleges to pursue diversity goals, however, and for students of color to access those institutions, including in some cases by bringing race into the conversation.\n\nHere’s an early look at how college admissions could change.\n\nFor most colleges, business as usual\n\nThough Thursday's decision is historic, it’s important to note it won't mean much for many colleges. Of the more than 1,000 institutions that use the Common Application, just 70 admit fewer than 25% of their applicants, CEO Jenny Rickard has said.\n\nAnd plenty of schools are in one of the states that banned affirmative action in college admissions before this week's ruling, including Arizona, California, Florida and Michigan. Arizona State University quickly declared Thursday that it was one of those institutions that won’t be affected. It “will have no impact on the diversity of the Arizona State University student body or ASU’s commitment to having a student body which reflects the population of the State of Arizona,” the university said.\n\nWill affirmative action ruling matter?Thousands of college and universities already accept almost everyone\n\nHow the decision affects college admissions tests, essays\n\nEven before the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing number of highly selective colleges began making standardized test scores an optional part of applications. One of the hopes was that it would lead to a more diverse student population. Then when the pandemic hit, test-optional policies became the default for logistical reasons: As of this past spring, submitting SAT or ACT scores was still optional at most schools.\n\nAlthough studies have shown the shift from these tests has meant only small changes in what the student body looks like at small, private institutions, experts predict the court's affirmative action decision will cement those policies. And that could mean more emphasis on personal statements and essays – an area where race often comes up.\n\nObservers have focused on one line in particular from the ruling: “Nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise.”\n\nBut the justices also wrote – directly challenging the dissent – “universities may not simply establish through application essays or other means the regime we hold unlawful today.”\n\n“For any students my age – myself included – this decision doesn’t prevent us from talking about the way that race has impacted us,\" said Aina Marzia, 17, a rising senior in El Paso, Texas, who was infuriated by the court's decision. \"It’s just that we don’t have a box to check for our application this fall.”\n\nAnurima Bhargava, a civil rights lawyer who formerly served with the U.S. Department of Justice, urged future applicants not to shy away from highlighting their racial identity when applying to colleges.\n\n“It’s not that diversity isn’t something that universities can pursue. It’s not that you can’t tell your own stories, stories of your racial experiences, about your identity or your background,” she said in a discussion Thursday hosted by Whiteboard Advisors, a research and consulting firm. “How universities are going to take account of that is still going to be a question for them, but it’s not that students can’t tell those kinds of stories.”\n\nJeff Selingo, a higher education journalist who spent a year behind the scenes with college admissions officers, said one next step for those gatekeepers is to deliberate what to make of students whose essays deal with race.\n\nWhat to know:A breakdown of the Supreme Court's affirmative action decision\n\nWhat does this mean for legacy admissions?\n\nAnother item for college officials to deliberate: legacy admissions, the practice of giving preference to applicants whose family members attended the institution.\n\nRichard Kahlenberg, a progressive scholar who served as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the Harvard and UNC cases, said he believes at least some elite colleges will abandon the practice now that they can no longer consider race in admissions.\n\n“If our identity as students isn’t going to be taken into account, what else am I supposed to put on my application?” Rikka Dimalanta, who will be a high school senior this fall in Los Angeles\n\nBefore, he said, affirmative action allowed them to achieve some racial diversity without necessarily ensuring their campuses were socioeconomically diverse as well. One study found more than half of Harvard’s students, however racially diverse, for example, came from the top 10% of the country’s income distribution. Another analysis found that 43% of Harvard’s white admits in 2019 were legacy students, recruited athletes, children of faculty and staff or on applicants affiliated with donors.\n\nBefore, he said, affirmative action allowed them to achieve racial diversity without necessarily ensuring their campuses were socioeconomically diverse as well.

Another analysis found that 43% of Harvard’s white admissions in 2019 were legacy students, recruited athletes, children of faculty and staff or on applicants affiliated with donors.\n\nSome highly selective universities, including in states that banned affirmative action, already had stopped practicing legacy admissions. They include the University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, Los Angeles. Elsewhere, Texas A&M University and the University of Georgia also have ended the practice.\n\nIn remarks denouncing the court's ruling, President Joe Biden also said he is asking the federal Education Department \"to analyze what practices help build a more inclusive and diverse student bodies and what practices hold that back, practices like legacy admissions and other systems that expand privilege instead of opportunity.\"\n\nA shift to using affirmative action – in recruitment\n\nThe onus will be on colleges to recruit from a wide range of communities at the front end of the admissions process, said Forrest Stuart, the vice president of enrollment management at Lafayette College.\n\n“This is really about building a diverse applicant pool,” Stuart said. “There’s nothing in the decision that I’ve seen that says you cannot ensure that the applicant pool is representative of all backgrounds.” Lafayette, a small private college in Pennsylvania where about a quarter of students are people of color, has under Stuart’s leadership partnered with community-based organizations to ensure students from underrepresented backgrounds put their names in the hat as well.\n\n“It really helps because you’re then choosing from a broader base,” said Stuart, who expects this affirmative action-esque approach to recruitment to gain more popularity as colleges work to ensure diversity on campus without considering race in the actual admissions process. “If your net is cast wide enough and broad enough on the building of your applicant pool, I don’t think it’s going to be as difficult for us – at least at Lafayette.”\n\nBiden also encouraged colleges to build a diverse class by factoring in applicants' family’s income and where they grew up and to consider students’ experiences with hardship or discrimination, including racial discrimination.\n\nCounselors: Colleges need to send a new message to students\n\nWithout proactive measures like diversifying applicant pools, educators worry, many students who would’ve applied in an affirmative action world will decide it’s not worth it.\n\nAt the American School Counselors Association, Executive Director Jill Cook has been fielding lots of questions. Many counselors are worried students of color will decide against applying to their reach or dream schools because they don’t think they’ll get in. What if some students choose not to apply at all, perceiving higher education to no longer be a welcoming place? (Legislation seeking to ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs at colleges can make the campuses seem even less inviting.)\n\nThere are also high school counselors who worry about the reverse – students overexerting themselves and applying to too many schools because they fear their chances of getting in are reduced after the court’s ruling.\n\nDavid Hawkins, chief education and policy officer for the National Association for College Admission Counseling, said his group will continue to urge high school counselors to push students to meet with admissions officers at their schools of interest.\n\n“Colleges are looking for a diverse group of students, and the decision should not discourage students at all from applying,” Hawkins said. “We will be swimming against the tide, and it can be discouraging. But we also want to ensure that students know it won’t change the fact that colleges are looking for them.”\n\nSome students may take that message to the extreme.\n\nAllen Koh, founder/CEO of Cardinal Education, an educational consulting firm in California catering to the very affluent, said he has seen mostly white clients move to states like Montana and Wyoming to pursue a perceived geographic advantage based on what they see as a desire on the part of elite universities to boast student enrollment from all 50 states.\n\n“Harvard calls these states ‘sparse country,’ and different universities call them different things,” he said. “But if you think about the sparse population that ‘sparse country’ implies, the pool of students you’re going after isn’t very large. So they actually get a significant advantage.”\n\nCan anything really replace what the court struck down?\n\nProbably not.\n\nEducation experts say universities will likely become less diverse as a result of the ruling, and while the court nonetheless acknowledged the importance of diversity in higher education and left the door open for schools to achieve it through other measures, such efforts could take years to see results – if at all.\n\n“Those measures will be expensive and take years to bear fruit,” said Jennifer McAward, an associate professor of law at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. “In the meantime, we are likely to see a substantial drop in racial diversity at highly selective universities.”\n\nSome point to California, where voters in 1996 passed a proposition prohibiting race-conscious college admissions. Despite numerous outreach efforts, University of California system officials have been unable to restore enrollment to levels of diversity representative of the state.\n\nMore:Ahead of Supreme Court affirmative action case ruling: Do Harvard, UNC discriminate?\n\n“The shortfall is especially apparent at UC’s most selective campuses,” they wrote in an amicus brief filed to the Supreme Court last summer, “where African American, Native American and Latinx students are underrepresented and widely report struggling with feelings of racial isolation.”\n\nAnd even with race conscious admissions for years, Black enrollment in college has dropped nationwide over time.\n\nAt elite colleges, admissions will always feel 'arbitrary'\n\nAccording to Mitchell Chang, a UCLA chancellor and professor of higher education and organizational change and Asian American studies, the decision will do little to make college admissions seem more equitable.\n\n“There’s always going to be this sense that it’s unfair,” he said, pointing to the Ivy League and other elite schools that admit fewer than 10% of their students and enroll classes of just a few hundred people. “If we remove race-conscious admissions, it’s not like these institutions are going to accept more students. The numbers and percentages of winners will remain the same.\n\n“Someone’s always going to be upset that they didn’t get admitted yet were highly qualified, because in many ways, when you’re trying to select between hyper-qualified people, the difference between getting in and rejected is almost arbitrary.”\n\nContact Alia Wong at (202) 507-2256 or awong@usatoday.com.

Sasse is going to have to address.”\n\nSasse is scheduled to meet with faculty, students and staff on Monday, while UF’s board of trustees is scheduled to formally consider his candidacy at its Nov. 1 meeting. He said in a written statement released Thursday that UF “is the most interesting university in America right now” and that he is \"thrilled about the opportunity to work alongside one of the nation’s most outstanding faculties.\n\n\"The caliber of teaching and research at UF is unmistakable, carried out through the core principles of shared governance and academic freedom,\" Sasse said.\n\nAn investigative report:How a Florida university system 'stacked' with mega-donors became 'blatantly political'\n\nA changing campus:Accreditor: Did University of Florida violate academic freedom standards by blocking professors' testimony?\n\nRising in rank:'We're doing sustained good work.' UF remains a top five public university\n\nNew law allows secrecy\n\nUF reported that a national search of more than 700 candidates was conducted, but its search committee focused attention on a dozen candidates that included nine sitting presidents at major research universities.\n\nSasse was the committee's unanimous choice, according to UF.\n\nA new state law blocks the public from knowing exactly who else was considered and other details about the process. SB 520 allowed UF to conduct much of the presidential search outside of the requirements of Florida’s open meetings and public records laws.\n\nUnder the measure, the university was allowed to keep the names of candidates secret and only publicly announce the names of any finalists.\n\nState Rep. Chuck Clemons, a Newberry Republican who voted in support of the measure, said the law is meant to shield earlier applicants in the process from public disclosure that might hurt their standings at their current jobs.\n\nClemons said he didn’t expect that just one finalist would be named and was open to tweaking the law to require more finalists to be announced before a final choice was made. Ultimately, he said, UF’s search committee is responsible for making a final recommendation.\n\n“The only people that had a vote are the ones on the selection committee,” he said.\n\nOrtiz, who is president of the UF chapter of the United Faculty of Florida union, said that there was more transparency when current President Kent Fuchs was hired. Fuchs met with many members of the UF community and worked to build trust, Ortiz said.\n\nBryn Taylor, co-president of the Graduate Assistants United union, said UF promised students and faculty there would be a transparent process and that hasn’t been the case.\n\n“Nobody understands this choice at all. It is an extremely political pick at a time when UF is making extremely political rules,” Taylor said. \"I don’t understand why they would do something like this. His track record in office is awful. He is vehemently anti-abortion, ant-LGBTQ rights and anti-student loan forgiveness.\"\n\nSasse's controversial positions\n\nSasse’s votes and political positions taken as U.S. senator also have other students questioning his selection. A petition has been started on Change.org to protest the choice of Sasse, which had garnered more than 300 signatures as of Friday afternoon.\n\n“This decision is met with indignation from the student body as Ben Sasse has political views that do not align with the values that the students at the University of Florida hold,” the petition reads. “They are discriminatory and non-representative of our student population.\"\n\nSasse has opposed abortion, same-sex marriage and the forgiveness of student debt during his time as a senator. After Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage, he issued a statement that the ruling was “a disappointment to Nebraskans who understand that marriage brings a wife and husband together so their children can have a mom and dad.”\n\nSasse spent five years as the president of Midland University in Nebraska, and previously was a faculty member at the University of Texas at Austin. before being elected to the Senate. In August, he spoke out against President Joe Biden's plan to forgive $10,000 in student loans.\n\n\"This deeply regressive action — which fails even to acknowledge that most debt is held by folks with graduate degrees — will do nothing to jumpstart the reform higher education desperately needs,” he said.\n\nAllan Frasheri, co-president of Young Democratic Socialists of America, said his group is among those organizing protests against Sasse's hiring outside public meetings with him Monday at Emerson Hall. UF College Democrats, Planned Parenthood Generation Action and the Alachua County Labor Coalition are also part of the effort.\n\nFrasheri said if Sasse is chosen for the role, he's going to have to establish trust among the UF community.\n\n\"The only way he can do that is by showing that he is committed to academic freedom and show that he cares about LGBTQ students, the bodily autonomy of our students, our tuition and the burden that students have to go through,\" Frasheri said.\n\nSasse also faces skepticism from the other side of the political aisle, due to his criticism of former president Donald Trump. Sasse was one of seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump of incitement of insurrection in his second impeachment trial.\n\nTrump posted Thursday on his social media platform, Truth Social, that Sasse's expected resignation from the Senate was \"great news” but that the “University of Florida will soon regret their decision to hire him as their President.”\n\nNate Monroe:Nate Monroe: The plundering of the University of Florida\n\nA 'transformational leader'\n\nBut other Republicans praised the selection. Rep. Clemons said he was “surprised” but “pleased” with the choice of Sasse, saying that the senator’s political experience would benefit the university\n\nUF needs a president “who can navigate the political waters” in the state and nationally, Clemons said.\n\nClemons has experience in politics and higher education himself, working as vice president of Santa Fe College's Office for Advancement and as executive director of the Santa Fe Foundation. He said Sasse’s academic background — which includes five degrees, four from Ivy League institutions — should allow him to go toe-to-toe intellectually with university professors.\n\nClemons said he met Sasse six years ago in Washington, D.C., at a conference for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s education foundation. Clemons said he came away “impressed with (Sasse’s) understanding of higher education in America.”\n\nBut Sasse would come into a university that has been dogged with questions of political interference since it was revealed last fall that faculty were barred from testifying in court against policies backed by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Legislature. UF also fast-tracked the hiring of COVID-19 skeptic Joseph Ladapo as a professor, paving the way for DeSantis to appoint him as Florida's surgeon general.\n\nRahul Patel, a UF trustee and chair of the UF Presidential Search Committee told The Sun there was no political influence when it came to the committee unanimously choosing Sasse as the sole finalist. Patel said when the committee held listening sessions with faculty, staff, alumni and students, they expressed the desire for someone who would take the university to new heights.\n\n\"We would need as our next leader a visionary, an innovator, a big thinker and someone who will differentiate us from others, a leader who is truly transformational. Ben Sasse is our transformational leader,\" Patel said.\n\nLaura Rosenbury, dean of UF’s Levin College of Law and a search committee member, said in a prepared statement that Sasse “embodies academic freedom\" due to his commitment to engaging with different people. Sasse told the Tampa Bay Times that he is “an academic freedom and free speech guy” and that it was “incredibly important that speech and dissent and debate flourish at an institution of higher learning.”\n\nOrtiz said UF has “been under siege in terms of academic freedom” and faculty members “have made it clear we're not retreating one inch\" no matter who is the next president.\n\n“We're going to defend the integrity of the University of Florida regardless of who's on the board of trustees, who's the president and who's the governor,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/daniel-bice/2021/08/13/us-senate-candidate-alex-lasry-is-bucks-vice-president-dad-is-marc-lasry-worked-in-obama-white-house/5459367001/", "title": "US Senate candidate Alex Lasry worked in Obama White House ...", "text": "U.S. Senate candidate Alex Lasry made perhaps the best political and business decision of his life a little more than 34 years ago.\n\nHe picked the right parents.\n\nIndeed, at almost every step in his short career, Lasry has had the support — financial and otherwise — of his father, New York billionaire hedge fund manager Marc Lasry, and his mother, Cathy Lasry.\n\nAlex Lasry's mother sat on the board of the exclusive private school that he and his siblings attended. His parents bought a New York mansion once occupied by mega-pop star Michael Jackson when Alex was 14, selling it years later for $32 million.\n\nBoth parents donated big bucks to and funded endowed professorships at the universities where Alex got his degrees. His father raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for President Barack Obama, in whose White House Alex worked.\n\nAnd his father, of course, was part of the ownership group that bought the Milwaukee Bucks in 2014, and Alex Lasry then moved from New York to Wisconsin to take a job as the team's executive vice president in Milwaukee. He would not be running for one of Wisconsin's two U.S. Senate seats had it not been for this major acquisition by his father.\n\nBut that is not all. At just 26, Alex Lasry bought his own 1% share of the NBA team in 2014 with about $5 million in cash from his own pocket, his campaign says, an asset that has escalated in value since then.\n\nAnd his parents have placed their Bucks ownership shares in trusts for each of their five children, the campaign confirmed. Alex Lasry's trust is valued at more than $50 million. A full accounting of his holdings is expected to be released in a public filing next week.\n\nBoth political parties take note\n\nThis level of wealth and privilege for a U.S. Senate candidate has prompted criticism from members of both parties. Lasry, 34, is one of 10 Democratic candidates running for the seat held by U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who has not said if he is running for a third term.\n\n\"New York trust fund baby Alex Lasry has spent his life accomplishing nothing and benefitting from the best connections that daddy could buy,\" said Republican Party spokeswoman Anna Kelly. \"Wisconsin voters aren’t interested in electing a third U.S. senator for New York.”\n\nAnd the other Democratic campaigns are already drawing contrasts between Lasry's silver-spoon upbringing and the more humble backgrounds of the other candidates.\n\n\"Wisconsin has a track record of electing true progressives who fight for the working class, not Wall Street,\" said Irene Lin, spokeswoman for Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson, the first candidate to announce his candidacy.\n\nLasry isn't denying that he isn't a typical Wisconsin politician.\n\nFormer U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl, the previous owner of the Bucks, had deep pockets and funded his own campaigns, but unlike Lasry, he had deep Wisconsin roots. The last candidate like Lasry was former Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele, the son of a Boston billionaire.\n\nIn a lengthy statement in response to a number of questions about Lasry's background, his campaign said the Democratic candidate sees his success as a combination of factors.\n\n\"Alex does believe that his accomplishments and achievements are due in large part to his hard work,\" said Mike Tate, Lasry's senior campaign advisor. \"He acknowledges that his parents' success, being a white male and the advantages that come from this privilege have benefited him throughout his life.\"\n\nTate noted that Marc Lasry immigrated to the United States decades ago without money or English language skills. His father believes his education was a key to his success, and both of his parents have been involved in Alex's education from the outset.\n\nLasry's academic history\n\nAlex Lasry attended The Day School, now Trevor Day School, from first grade through high school, as did all of his siblings (except one sister, who attended a different high school). The New York City school currently has a tuition of $56,000 per year for students in its middle and high schools.\n\nRecords indicate that Lasry's mother served on the school's board beginning in at least 2002, as did Lynn Edens, the wife of Wes Edens, who joined Marc Lasry in buying the Bucks seven years ago. Cathy Lasry left the board when Alex graduated high school.\n\nIn 2005, Alex Lasry began attending the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League school where he got a bachelor's degree in political science and government.\n\nA year before he was admitted, his parents endowed a chair for a professor in race relations, according to a news release from the school. An endowed chair is a position permanently paid for with the revenue from a fund set up for that purpose.\n\n\"Established in 2004 by Cathy and Marc Lasry, Parents ’07, this chair was created to support a preeminent scholar and teacher whose interests lie in the field of African American studies,\" the news release says. The professor selected for the post was Tukufu Zuberi, then the director of the Center for Africana Studies at UPenn.\n\nIn 2012, Lasry's parents endowed a second chair, this one in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. Vijay Balasubramanian, a theoretical physicist, was named to the post and still holds it.\n\nIn addition, Marc and Cathy Lasry served as the joint chairs of the Penn Parent Leadership Committee, and Cathy Lasry previously was a member of the Board of Advisors for the Department of Arts & Sciences.\n\nTate declined to say how much the Lasrys donated to the university. He noted that four of their children attended UPenn, including Alex Lasry's older sister.\n\n\"Alex’s parents were able to do what many parents do, and many others wish they had the time to do, which is to actively participate in their children’s school,\" Tate said. \"They made donations prior, during and after the time Alex and his siblings matriculated there.\"\n\nThree years after getting his undergraduate degree, Alex Lasry went to New York University to get his master’s degree in business administration.\n\nRecords indicate that his parents are members of the Sir Harold Acton Society, a group created in 1995 to honor those who have given at least $1 million to NYU. Inside Philanthropy also has reported that they gave to the university's Stern School of Business, which Alex attended.\n\nIt is not known when the family gave those donations.\n\nTate pointed out that two of Alex Lasry's siblings, his brother and a younger sister, also attended NYU.\n\n\"The Lasry family has made numerous donations to educational institutions,\" Tate said. \"Some are public, many have been given anonymously. The anonymous gifts both amount and year given are private. We don’t dispute any dates or amounts you have found online.\"\n\nBetween undergraduate and graduate school, Alex Lasry held several jobs.\n\nFrom September 2009 to January 2010, he served as a White House intern. Lasry said he does not recall how he learned of the internship. Tate said Lasry's parents had no role in his landing this position. Alex Lasry graduated cum laude from UPenn, Tate noted, and was on the dean's list twice.\n\nTies to Obama White House\n\nAlex Lasry then went to work for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee for two months and then spent four months as an analyst for Goldman Sachs. Then he headed back to then-President Barack Obama's White House, where he spent much of his time in a paid position as an aide to senior adviser Valerie Jarrett.\n\n\"No calls or any other communications were made by Marc or Cathy Lasry on behalf of Alex in support of him being hired,\" Tate said. \"Alex found out about the opening through his former supervisor in the White House from when he was an intern. She encouraged him to apply. He went through the normal process and was hired.\"\n\nRecords show that Marc Lasry was initially a financial supporter of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2008 primary against Obama. Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, even worked at Marc Lasry's hedge fund, Avenue Capital Group, for a short stint.\n\nBut once Obama won the primary, Marc Lasry emerged as a major supporter.\n\nMarc Lasry hosted a fundraiser for Obama at the Four Seasons restaurant in New York City in July 2010, according to the New York Post. Then the Lasrys hosted a fundraiser for Obama's campaign at their New York City townhouse in May 2011 while Alex Lasry was a staffer at the White House, said the Washington Post. Obama's campaign manager attended the event.\n\nTate said Alex Lasry was not at the fundraiser, which was held at the mansion previously rented by Jackson, the \"king of pop,\" and Russian artist Marc Chagall. The red brick townhouse, which has seven bedrooms and eight bathrooms, once appeared on the TV show \"Gossip Girl.\"\n\nThe Lasrys sold the mansion for $32 million in 2018.\n\nIn 2012, Marc Lasry was one of Obama's top bundlers, bringing in $500,000 to the then-president's campaign, according to Open Secrets. He also bundled nearly $1.3 million in each of the next two presidential elections for the Democratic nominees in 2016 and 2020. In all, he has pumped more than $3 million into the last three presidential elections.\n\nAlex Lasry is also listed as having raised $20,000 for Clinton in 2016 and about $50,000 for President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nDespite all this, Tate said the Democratic candidate believes there is too much money in politics. Tate said Alex Lasry favors a constitutional amendment that would overturn the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which reversed century-old campaign finance restrictions.\n\n\"Until that happens, Alex does not believe that Democrats should unilaterally disarm and allow Republicans to swamp Democrats with their overwhelming money advantage,\" Tate said.\n\nAlex Lasry continues to benefit from his parents' deep pockets and wide-ranging connections in the current race.\n\nHe has outpaced his opponents by raising $2.1 million in his Senate campaign fund since entering the race earlier this year.\n\nFederal Election Commission records indicate that nearly $850,000 of that sum has come from people living in New York, his home state.\n\nThat includes donations from both his parents and all four of his siblings. Lasry's immediate and extended family members have contributed at least $100,000. He also loaned the campaign $50,000.\n\nAlex Lasry, who is on leave from his job with the Bucks, clearly can give more. His campaign confirmed that he is a minority shareholder in the team, a stake he acquired when the team was purchased from Kohl in 2014 when Lasry was 26.\n\nHis campaign said he paid about $5 million to acquire a 1% share of the team, which had a total purchase price of $550 million seven years ago. His campaign said he paid the amount out of his own pocket. None of the cash was borrowed.\n\nForbes recently placed the value of the team at $1.625 billion, meaning Lasry's share could now be worth as much as $16 million. That valuation occurred before the Bucks won the NBA title in July.\n\nIn addition, Lasry's parents have placed their share of the team in trusts for each of their five children. The trusts contain other, small investments, but it is believed the Bucks' stock is the primary asset in each of the trusts. The Lasry family is thought to own roughly one-third of the team.\n\nNBA rules prevent team owners from borrowing against their stake in a team, meaning Alex Lasry could not use his trust for a loan for his Senate campaign.\n\nThe first-time candidate is required to submit his personal financial disclosure statement with the U.S. Senate next week, and that should provide further details on his wealth. His campaign said his trust exceeds $50 million in value.\n\nDespite all his family's connections and money, Tate said it is important not to undervalue what Lasry has accomplished in his career. Tate pointed to his work with the Bucks, the Democratic National Committee's 2020 Bid Committee, his education and his time at the White House.\n\n\"You can ask anyone who has worked with Alex in any of these capacities, and they will tell you that he is one of the hardest workers in any room he is in,\" Tate said. \"Alex leads the efforts, he does the work, he makes the calls and he gets results.\"\n\nDaniel Bice at (414) 313-6684 or dbice@jrn.com.

Meanwhile, in reddening Florida, there’s DeSantis, the son of a Nielsen box salesman, who in public cleaves less to his two Ivy League degrees than to the anti-elitist, reactionary politics that have consumed the GOP.\n\nNewsom now is going on the air against DeSantis in Florida – with what he says is not the first ad of the 2024, or even the 2028, presidential race – with the goal of trying to get Democrats to reclaim a sense of collective identity that could enable them to beat Trumpism in the long term.\n\nWith $105,000 on Fox News, Newsom’s new ad, first provided to CNN and set to air on July 4, is a mashup of a classic campaign spot, business investment pitch and one of those California tourism commercials full of celebrities saying how much better it is there, wrapped in the existential terror that’s wracking progressives these days.\n\nFlorida Freedom - July 4th\n\n“It’s Independence Day – so let’s talk about what’s going on in America,” Newsom says in the ad, standing in the California sun, tieless, as “America the Beautiful” fingerpicks in the background. “Freedom is under attack in your state.”\n\nThose last words flash across the screen in red, followed by a photo of DeSantis shaking hands with former President Donald Trump, and then another of the Florida governor as Newsom ticks through Florida laws to ban books and restrict voting, speech and access to abortion.\n\n“I urge all of you living in Florida to join the fight – or join us in California, where we still believe in freedom: Freedom of speech, freedom to choose, freedom from hate, and the freedom to love,” Newsom says as the images proceed from an aerial shot of the Santa Monica Pier to a rainbow flag waving in the hands of two women with arms around each other. “Don’t let them take your freedom.”\n\nThe ad is paid for by Newsom’s reelection campaign, though this clearly isn’t about racking up potential absentee voters who have retired to the Sunshine State for what’s expected to be an easy win for California governor in November.\n\n“He’s running for president,” Newsom told CNN last week. “I care about people. I don’t like people being treated as less of them. I don’t like people being told they’re not worthy. I don’t like people being used as political pawns. This is not just about him, but he is the poster child of it.”\n\n“We’re as different,” Newsom said of both the governors and their states, “as daylight and darkness.”\n\nOver the course of a 20-minute phone interview, Newsom called DeSantis a bully, a fraud, an authoritarian, a fake conservative, a betrayer of Ronald Reagan’s legacy and, several times, “DeSantos.”\n\n“Everybody’s got portions of the playbook,” Newsom said, comparing DeSantis to other Republicans. “He’s writing it.”\n\nDeSantis declined a request for an interview, but those around him say he’s happy to have this fight.\n\n“Gavin Newsom might as well light a pile of cash on fire,” DeSantis campaign spokesman Dave Abrams said. “Pass the popcorn for his desperate attempt to win back the California refugees who fled the hellhole he created in his state to come to Florida.”\n\nThe enmity between the two governors has been building for months. DeSantis has said California was letting a “coercive biomedical apparatus” guide its closure-heavy Covid-19 approach, and he called San Francisco – a city Newsom once led – a “dumpster fire.” Newsom has said that DeSantis’ approach to the pandemic would have killed an extra 40,000 Californians and that he does “not look for inspiration to that particular governor.”\n\nIt’s also a question of style. When Newsom was caught having gone maskless to a birthday party at an exclusive Napa Valley restaurant in November 2020, he sheepishly apologized. When DeSantis was spotted maskless at the Super Bowl months later in February 2021, he sniped, “How the hell am I going to be able to drink a beer with a mask on?” His campaign put the quote on a koozie and sold it online.\n\nDeSantis on the rise\n\nDeSantis’ popularity among Republicans soared during the pandemic, when he bucked medical experts and pushed Florida toward normalcy months before the rest of the country. DeSantis welcomed comparisons between Florida’s laissez-faire approach and California, where leaders implemented mask mandates and lockdowns dictated by public health metrics such as case rates.\n\nLook no further than how each state handled its House of Mouse. Disney World, outside Orlando, reopened in July 2020, just as Florida became the epicenter of the country’s deadly Covid-19 summer. Disneyland, in Anaheim, California, cautiously welcomed back visitors about 10 months later in April 2021.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Pollster says Republicans are moving away from Trump after poll in key state 01:09 - Source: CNN\n\nThe stark differences in approach became fodder for both governors.\n\nIn a recent sit-down with conservative political commentator Dave Rubin, DeSantis recalled a fundraising trip to California in June 2021 (he’s received more donations from residents of the Golden State than from any other state besides Florida, and most of them $100 or less). He’d made a point of telling staff he wouldn’t abide by any Covid-19 restrictions while in the state and recalled an incident that he said showed how much he was resonating there.\n\n“These two guys in masks come scurrying over to me,” DeSantis said. “I’m like, ‘Oh, God. Here we go.’ One guy gets right in front of me, pulls down his mask, looks me right in the eye and says, ‘I wish you were our governor.’”\n\nIf DeSantis versus Newsom ever moves beyond a cross-country shouting match and into a real campaign, Republicans in Florida believe they have the ultimate winning argument: Florida is a growing state and California’s population is on the decline, though there’s a long way to go before the two approach each other; Florida has more than 21 million residents and California has about 40 million.\n\n“We have a working product in Florida,” said Christian Ziegler, vice chairman of the Florida GOP. “The No. 1 way you can measure success of states is economy, job performance and people moving to or moving from states. And the state of Florida is winning that battle. They’re losing people. People are fleeing California. And a heckuva lot of them are coming to Florida.”\n\nBut unlike Texas leaders, who revel whenever a Silicon Valley company sets up shop in the Lone Star State, DeSantis lately has urged California CEOs to stay away from Florida for fear a progressive wave of tech workers would offset the GOP sanctuary he is building. When other Republican leaders in Florida publicly courted Elon Musk to move Twitter to the Sunshine State, DeSantis pushed back, saying, “They enjoy our lower taxes, but you know, what are they really providing?”\n\nNewsom pushes back\n\nFor the California governor, this goes deeper than a personal grudge match, or political angling as he pushes legislation and lawsuits that spin away from the rightward trend of recent US Supreme Court decisions and further embrace the “California Republic” on the state flag.\n\nDeSantis isn’t Newsom’s only GOP target. The California governor joined Trump’s social media site purely for the sake of trolling the former President and his supporters. He knocked Texas Gov. Greg Abbott repeatedly and tweeted a retort targeting Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who signaled last month he would be comfortable defending the state’s defunct anti-sodomy law if the US Supreme Court reverses its 2003 decision to strike down the statute.\n\n“Hell of a thing. Not to mention during pride month,” Newsom wrote. “Hey, corporate America – where are your values? Stand up to these hateful states and come to California.”\n\nNewsom insists he’s not taking digs at President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi when he says he’s trying to prod his party into getting angrier and more activated. He called the hearings held by the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol a “master class” but said Democrats need to be looking past Trump and toward how Trumpism is evolving. After spending much of the pandemic watching and reading right-wing media, Newsom said he’s grown more and more alarmed to see how much is taking root.\n\n“My expression is one of frustration, watching now for many years, in many ways predating the current climate and the current administration,” Newsom said in the interview. “The success of the right to define the terms of the debate, the success of the right to dominate the narrative … they’re winning in ways that are alarming to me.”\n\nThe ad, he promised, will be the start of much more to come.\n\n“Things have changed, rules of engagement have to change,” Newsom said. “You’ve got to take the fight to them.”", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere Steve Contorno", "Edward-Isaac Dovere", "Steve Contorno"], "publish_date": "2022/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/us/harvard-slavery-legacy-fund/index.html", "title": "Harvard commits $100M to redress its complicity with slavery | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nHarvard University is dedicating $100 million to create a fund to research and redress its “extensive entanglements with slavery,” university President Lawrence Bacow said Tuesday.\n\nThe university’s attempt to reckon with its past is detailed in a report titled “Harvard & the Legacy of Slavery,” which documents how the slave trade in the 17th and 18th centuries “comprised a vital part of the New England economy, and powerfully shaped Harvard University.”\n\n“The report makes plain that slavery in America was by no means confined to the South,” Bacow said in a message to members of the Harvard community.\n\n“It was embedded in the fabric and the institutions of the North, and it remained legal in Massachusetts until the Supreme Judicial Court ruled it unconstitutional in 1783.”\n\nBacow said slavery and racism played a significant part in Harvard’s institutional history and enslaved people worked on campus and supported students, faculty, staff and university presidents. Their labor “enriched numerous donors and, ultimately, the institution.”\n\nFor nearly 150 years – from the founding of the university in 1636 until Massachusetts abolished slavery – Harvard presidents and others enslaved more than 70 people, according to the report, which lists the names of some in an appendix.\n\n“Enslaved men and women served Harvard presidents and professors and fed and cared for Harvard students,” the report said.\n\nThe university and its donors benefited from the slave trade into the 19th century, the report said.\n\n“These profitable financial relationships included, most notably, the beneficence of donors who accumulated their wealth through slave trading; from the labor of enslaved people on plantations in the Caribbean islands and in the American South; and from the Northern textile manufacturing industry, supplied with cotton grown by enslaved people held in bondage.”\n\nThe report said Harvard’s financial investments included “loans to Caribbean sugar planters, rum distillers, and plantation suppliers along with investments in cotton manufacturing.”\n\nUniversity presidents and professors also promoted “race science” and eugenics and carried out abusive “research” on enslaved people, the report said.\n\n“I believe we bear a moral responsibility to do what we can to address the persistent corrosive effects of those historical practices on individuals, on Harvard, and on our society,” the university president wrote.\n\nDennis Lloyd, 74, a real estate developer who splits his time between Massachusetts and Georgia, is a descendant of Cuba Vassall, a woman who was born in Antigua and enslaved by the family of Isaac Royall Sr. A donation from Royall’s son in the late 18th century funded the first Harvard professorship of law. The Royall family had a sugar plantation in Antigua and moved to Medford, Massachusetts, following a planned slave revolt. They brought several slaves with them.\n\n“I think it’s a step in the right direction,” Lloyd told CNN on Tuesday, calling Harvard’s plan an opportunity to promote “a better understanding of the history that has been lost … and stolen from African Americans as a result of slavery.”\n\nThe report includes recommendations to redress that legacy “through teaching, research, and service” and the commitment of $100 million for the creation of a legacy of slavery fund.\n\n“Some of these funds will be available for current use, while the balance will be held in an endowment to support this work over time,” Bacow said.\n\nThe fund is intended to support the implementation of the report’s recommendations, including the expansion of educational opportunities for the descendants of enslaved people in the Southern US and the Caribbean, establishing partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and identifying and building relationships with the direct descendants of enslaved people who labored at Harvard.\n\nThe report said the fund signifies the university’s acknowledgment “of wrongdoing and a responsibility to undertake a sustained process of repair: financial expenditures are a necessary predicate to and foundation for redress.”\n\nLloyd, a graduate of Howard University, praised the Ivy League university’s pledge to provide financial and educational support to the direct descendants of enslaved people and its vow to build ties with HBCUs.\n\n“Harvard’s resources and pockets go very deep,” said Lloyd, a Vietnam War veteran. “Let’s see how everything is implemented.”\n\nHarvard’s announcement comes as other universities across the nation attempt to reckon with their complicity with slavery.\n\n“While Harvard does not bear exclusive responsibility for these injustices, and while many members of our community have worked hard to counteract them, Harvard benefited from and in some ways perpetuated practices that were profoundly immoral,” Bacow said.", "authors": ["Ray Sanchez"], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/business/bankman-fried-parents/index.html", "title": "Parents of Sam Bankman-Fried face scrutiny over their roles in FTX ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nSam Bankman-Fried’s multibillion-dollar crypto empire was run primarily by “grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals” who failed to institute basic corporate controls and even relied on QuickBooks to do their accounting, according to investigators.\n\nBut standing by Bankman-Fried as his companies FTX and Alameda grew (and subsequently collapsed) were two respected Ivy-League trained lawyers who, potentially, should have spotted the red flags.\n\nNow, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, the FTX founder’s parents, may face legal troubles of their own.\n\nBankman-Fried, his parents and other employees “used FTX customer funds for a variety of personal expenditures, including luxury real estate purchases, private jets, documented and undocumented personal loans and personal political donations,” according to a civil lawsuit filed this week by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US derivatives market regulator.\n\nA representative for Bankman and Fried didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Bankman-Fried’s lawyer declined to comment when asked about scrutiny of his parents.\n\nBarbara Fried and Joseph Bankman From Stanford University\n\nBankman-Fried, who was arrested on Monday night at his luxury residence in the Bahamas on eight federal criminal counts, told the New York Times before his arrest that his parents “weren’t involved in any of the relevant parts” of the business.\n\nBankman and Fried, both Stanford University law professors, weren’t identified by name in the CFTC suit, and haven’t been charged in their son’s case, which prosecutors are calling one of the biggest financial frauds in US history.\n\nBut now their role in their son’s crypto business is under investigation by FTX’s new management, which is working closely with federal prosecutors and US markets regulators.\n\nBankman is a Yale-educated scholar in the field of tax law, as well as a clinical psychologist who writes on the intersection of law and psychology. That expertise could become a liability if he is eventually charged with wrongdoing.\n\n“He is a highly knowledgeable and deeply expert person in areas that concern the set-up and operation of complex companies,” said Yesha Yadav, professor of law at Vanderbilt University. “Arguably, his qualifications and academic stature can work against him as part of any legal case, because the argument may be made that he really should have spotted problems.”\n\nFried, whose “scholarly interests lie at the intersection of law, economics, and philosophy,” according to her Stanford bio, earned her law degree from Harvard.\n\n“I can’t imagine a world where Bankman-Fried’s parents were not his financial and legal advisers,” said Matthew Barhoma, a criminal defense attorney in Los Angeles, who is not involved in the case.\n\nThe new CEO of FTX is John Ray III, a restructuring expert tasked with shepherding the company through its complex bankruptcy.

Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill (SB 1438) to block venues from admitting children to \"adult live performances, \" defining them as “any show, exhibition, or other presentation that is performed in front of a live audience and in whole or in part, depicts or simulates nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, specific sexual activities, … lewd conduct, or the lewd exposure of prosthetic or imitation genitals or breasts.” A last-minute amendment also blocked government entities from issuing licenses for them.\n\nThe bill was one of more than 400 pieces of legislation nationwide aimed at transgender people and the LGBTQ community.\n\nBut what is drag, and why are GOP-led states trying to restrict or ban it?\n\nAnti-LGBTQ laws?Four new Florida laws target transgender, broader LGBTQ community. Here's what they do\n\nBreaking down the impact:What is Florida's new drag show law, SB 1438?\n\nSouthern drag:Drag shows have a long history in the South. Why are they drawing threats now?\n\nWhat is drag?\n\nDrag is an art form in which a person dresses in elaborate clothing and makeup designed to present an exaggerated, over-the-top version of a man or woman, often of the opposite sex.\n\nFemale impersonators have been a part of popular entertainment for centuries. Ancient plays in Greece included men dressing as women, and traditional mummer's plays in Britain required it. In Shakespeare's time, when women were forbidden from the stage, it was commonplace for men to play women's parts. Many boys' schools and Ivy League universities have traditions of slapstick productions involving drag. Southern churches, both Black and white, held womanless weddings and pageants as fundraisers, historian John Howard said. They’d play on gender roles by making “the most pompous macho man the bride, the shortest, thinnest man the groom,” Howard said.\n\nIn the 19th century, female impersonators began performing in vaudeville shows as individual acts rather than part of a larger play, taking the practice from simple cross-dressing to performance. Drag was a big part of the underground New York City ballroom culture during the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s and became associated with the marginalized and hidden LGBTQ+ community. Popular support grew after the Stonewall Riots in 1969, when the local LGBTQ+ community rose up to protest a raid on New York City's Stonewall Inn — a gay bar that also included drag shows —and kickstarted the gay rights movement.\n\nBallroom culture became mainstream in the 90s with the documentary \"Paris is Burning\" and Madonna's \"Vogue\" music video. In more recent times, drag has been positively featured in movies like \"The Birdcage,\" \"Hairspray,\" \"Kinky Boots, \"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar,\" \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,\" and \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" as well as many TV shows such as \"Monty Python's Flying Circus,\" \"Pose,\" about 40 Bugs Bunny cartoons and, notably, the popular reality competition \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" which made drag a household name and stars of its contestants. Nationwide, drag shows have become commonplace and widespread.\n\nWhat are drag shows?\n\nDrag shows are live performances where drag performers do stylized routines that may involve lip-syncing to popular songs, telling jokes or singing. Drag shows intended for adult audiences often use explicitly adult language or raunchy comedy. Drag intended for children, such as Draq Queen Story Hour events, do not. Drag shows rarely include nudity; if anything drag performers are often more covered than any woman on TV, favoring full-length ball gowns or elaborate creations of their opwn. While some drag shows certainly may be risque, many contain no more exaggerated sexuality than, say, a Dolly Parton concert.\n\nDrag has developed into a multifaceted art form that challenges how we think about gender identity and personal expression. It helps provide LGBTQ+ youth with representation and has positively impacted how they felt about themselves, according to Psychiatric Times. And drag can help normalize gay, trans and nonbinary people for the larger community.\n\nFor some people, that may be the problem.\n\nDragged into political wars:Polk performers say they don't present danger to children\n\nWhat is a drag queen?\n\nDrag queens dress in exaggerated women's clothing to glorify feminity, often with false breasts and form-altering clothing. Performers often create different personas for their drag personality and may use different pronouns when in character.\n\nThere are also drag kings — performers dressed in exaggerated male's clothing and hairstyles — who take the stage as masculine as they can be, and some performers who change back and forth or blur gender entirely.\n\nAre drag queens all homosexual?\n\nNo. While traditionally many drag queens have been gay men, anyone can be a drag queen (or drag king), male or female, nonbinary or trans, of any sexual orientation.\n\nDrag is a performance and differs from cross-dressing (the act of wearing clothes associated with a different gender, for whatever reason) and being transgender (someone whose gender identity or gender expression does not correspond with the sex they were assigned at birth who may dress to present themselves in a way that feels more natural), although there can be overlap.\n\nWhy are drag shows under fire?\n\nThe most common reason given is to make sure children aren't exposed to sexual material.\n\nHowever, the moves against drag shows are part of a growing movement that seems to want to prevent children from being exposed to any LGBTQ+ content or people in any context and to remove all support for transgender children. In Florida, DeSantis' Parental Rights Law, more commonly known as \"Don't Say Gay,\" explicitly prevents discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation and, due to vague language in the law, has resulted in what critics call censorship of LGBTQ+ voices and a rise in the harassment of queer students, teachers, administrators and their allies.\n\nNew laws were passed to ban transgender girls from competing in high school girls and college women's sports, and then to ban all gender-affirming care for trans minors, later expanded to block such care for anyone. Efforts to ban books with any LGBTQ+ content at all from school libraries have risen drastically in the last few years. Across the country, armed people have protested in front of Drag Queen Story Hour events, where drag performers read books to children, and performers and venues have received death threats.\n\nMore from the Legislature:A rundown of Florida bills causing 'massive panic' in transgender, LGBTQ communities\n\nDrag an early focus:Florida House speaker draws criticism for drag show comments in wake of Colorado shooting\n\n‘No one felt safe’:Florida schools, students feel effects of so-called ‘Don't Say Gay’ law\n\nSome of the opposition stems from the belief that queer and trans behavior goes against the Christian God’s will, making even family-friendly drag shows deviant and unacceptable.\n\n“With the children, we’ve got a crisis. The building is on fire,” said Sharayah Colter, a member of the Conservative Baptist Network’s steering council. “It’s not right to be questioning the identity that God has given people when he has created them — he creates them male and female.”\n\nWhile LGBTQ activists have said the blitz of bills effectively aims to erase their community, accusations that gay people are trying to groom or convert children are familiar and increasing.\n\n“If it means erasing a community because you have to target children, then damn right we oughta do it. I just don’t think you have to inherently say ‘cause you’re lesbian or gay you have to target children,’\" said bill sponsor Rep. Randy Fine (R-Melbourne). \"I find that statement to be offensive to them.”\n\nHowever, there is zero evidence that LGBTQ people are more likely to molest children. Science has found sexual orientation and gender identity are innate, \"influenced by genetic factors,\" GLAAD spokeswoman Barbara Simon said.\n\nAttacking marginalized communities also may be a way to consolidate a political base in an increasingly polarized country.

Knowingly allowing a child to attend an adult performance would be a first-degree misdemeanor.\n\n'Hostile to the LGBTQ community':LGBTQ, immigrant advocacy groups issue Florida travel advisory over DeSantis policies\n\nDoes Florida's anti-drag bill affect Pride parades?\n\nLooks like it. Drag has long been a major part of pride celebrations and parades, but an amendment to the bill abruptly filed by Sen. Clay Yarborough while the Senate was already in session bans cities, counties and other governments from issuing permits for events that feature such performances. Event organizers could face a first-degree misdemeanor for anything that could be labeled an \"adult performance\" that happens at the event, whether it's under the control of the organizer or not.\n\nWhile Yarborough said he wasn't targeting specific events with the bill or amendment, the sponsor of the bill's companion in the Florida House of Representatives was more explicit.\n\n\"I've never been to a Pride parade. It's not my thing, not my group,\" Rep. Randy Fine, R-Palm Bay, said in an interview. \"But I have seen photos and videos from these things where you see participants behaving in ways that would not be appropriate in front of his bill.\"\n\nFine said those tasked with enforcing the law \"would focus on the conduct of the folks in the parade ... so it will be up to folks to make sure they follow the law.\"\n\nDrag at Pride:Are Pride celebrations the Florida Legislature's next target?\n\nFighting back:DeSantis targeted LGBTQ Floridians like no previous governor. Now they’re working to defeat him.\n\nWould Florida's anti-drag bill affect other shows?\n\nUnclear.\n\nThe bills prohibit a child from attending an \"adult live performance\" when it's offensive to \"prevailing standards\" in society and is \"without serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for the age of the child present.\"\n\nSupporters say the bill addresses all adult performances, not just drag, but the definition of \"adult performance,\" similar to the Supreme Court's classic definition of obscenity, remains a matter of opinion.\n\nCritics of the bill say it's difficult to understand what is specifically prohibited and how it would be enforced.\n\n\"This bill doesn't ban drag but is designed to discourage LGBTQ-friendly businesses, and now cities and counties, from opening their doors to drag performers,\" organizers with Tallahassee Pride said in a statement. \"The language is written broadly and threatens entities with excessive fines and misdemeanor charges with the intention of sparking fear and intimidation that will lead to self-censorship.\"\n\nDid DeSantis shut down a bar in Miami for hosting a drag show?\n\nThe DeSantis administration filed a complaint against the R House bar and restaurant after a TikTok video was posted of a drag show where children were visible in the audience. Subsequent investigations, according to the governor, observed children in the audience and said \"the sexualized nature of the Brunch performances is pervasive.\"\n\nR House is accused of violating provisions in state law targeting public nuisances, lewd activity, disorderly conduct and indecent exposure, according to the complaint.\n\nThe owners of R House said in a statement issued by a public relations firm that the state's actions are based on \"a misunderstanding,\" but didn't elaborate.

Writers, who are essential to the process both as nominees and the people who provide jokes and patter for the show, had been on strike for more than two months when the nominees were announced June 11. Then just three days after \"Succession,\" \" White Lotus,\" \" The Last of Us \" and \"Ted Lasso\" were named as the top nominees, leaders of the actors union announced they would join writers in a historic Hollywood work stoppage.\n\nWith union rules allowing no interviews, panels or awards-show participation, acting nominees had just a few days to do the kind of media promotion that is usually rampant after a nomination. Writers couldn't do it at all.\n\nMore:Emmy Awards announces rescheduled date for January 2024 due to Hollywood strikes\n\nNew January date puts Emmys in prime awards season\n\nThe Television Academy and Fox TV, which was scheduled to air the show this year, initially kept the original Sept. 18 show date in place, with hopes the strikes would end quickly.\n\nBut with no realistic prospects for resolution, Fox and the academy decided in mid-August to change the show date to Jan. 15, 2024, Martin Luther King Day, at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles. No host has been announced.\n\nThe January date in many ways makes sense. Because they are still tied to the traditional fall-through-spring broadcast television season, the Emmys have been among the few awards shows held in September. That TV model, as the strikers know all too well, has been upended by cable and streaming structures that observe no such conventions. That traditional Emmy scheduling was starting to create odd situations. Voters were casting ballots for season one of the \"The Bear\" — which got 13 nominations — after season two had already aired. And now the results won't be known until nearly a year after the second season premiere.\n\nThe January date will put the Emmys within the rest of Hollywood's awards season, when red carpets rule and performers are on the promotional prowl. The show is slated for about a week after the Golden Globes and about six weeks before the Screen Actors Guild Awards — both ceremonies that honor television along with movies.\n\nThe date also puts it in line with the Emmys' early years in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when they were held in January or February.\n\nMore:Emmy nomination list: Television Academy rewards 'The White Lotus,' 'Succession,' more\n\nThe delay is the first time the Emmys have been postponed since 2001, when the 9/11 attacks came just five days before the planned ceremony. Then the launch of the war in Afghanistan, which came hours before the rescheduled October show, prompted another postponement until November, when a small, restrained show hosted by Ellen DeGeneres finally ran.\n\nThe 2020 ceremony, dominated by \" Schitt's Creek \" and dubbed the \"Pandemmies\" by host Jimmy Kimmel was seriously scaled back because of the coronavirus, with nominees accepting trophies and making speeches from remote locations, but the date was never moved.\n\nThe Emmy votes are all in\n\nWith nothing else normal about the Emmys, the Television Academy at least wanted the voting process to go on as planned, and for the results to be as close as possible to what they would have been without the upheaval.\n\nThe Emmys are decided by votes from the nearly 20,000 members of the Television Academy. The membership is divided into 31 peer groups including animators, performers, directors and writers. Members of each group vote for Emmy winners in those categories, and all eligible voters can cast ballots for the awards that go to entire shows, including best drama series and best drama series.\n\nThis year's ballots went out as planned on Aug. 17 and had to be returned by Aug. 28. That means the winners are already decided, but it will be four months — at least — before the envelopes are opened revealing them.\n\nMore:Hollywood writers aim to resume strike negotiations with film, TV studios after failed talks\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe new date looked a long way off when it was scheduled, but Emmy organizers may have to face the prospect that the strikes could still be going on in January. Writers have currently been off the job for 4 1/2 months, the actors for two months. The stoppages spilling into next year would make them historically long, and go well past initial predictions.\n\nNegotiations between writers and studio s have been slow in restarting. There have been no talks, and none are planned, between studios and actors.\n\nProlonged strikes could mean another Emmys postponement, or a show transformed into a glorified news conference, as happened with some awards during the pandemic.\n\nIt would also throw the Oscars, and the entire awards season, into doubt.\n\nMore:Drew Barrymore to return amid writer's strike.

Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.\n\nCNN —\n\nYou can learn a lot from a search history.\n\nThis month, Google released its annual “Year in Search” list to show which terms saw the highest spikes over the past year. The roundup offers some insight into what internet users around the world cared about, were curious about and concerned about in 2022.\n\nOne big topic is noticeably absent this year: Covid-19. Last year, vaccination and preventing infection were of great interest, but this year saw no mention of coronavirus in the top health and wellness searches.\n\nInstead, this year’s searches focused on physical and mental recovery — how to get stronger physically and how to cope with issues like anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of 2022 in Google searches and some ways to address these topics going into 2023.\n\nWorkouts\n\nWorkouts were a big focus of conversation this year: “Body weight workouts,” “weekly workouts,” “exercising for mental health,” and “core workouts at the gym” all were among the popular health searches.\n\nBody-weight workouts are a good access point for exercise because you don’t need expensive equipment, and you can build a foundation for eventual weight training, said Dana Santas, CNN fitness expert and a mind-body coach in pro sports, in a previous story.\n\nShe laid out a 10-minute workout to get started.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Try this 10-minute body-weight workout 10:46 - Source: CNN\n\nIf you are looking to go further and build a regular exercise routine, a 2021 megastudy found that the keys are to make a plan, build in reminders and reward yourself for sticking to it.\n\nCoping with difficult emotions\n\nGoogle users asked “how to handle stress,” “how to stop a panic attack,” “how to cure depression” and “focus with ADHD.” They also looked up good mental health practices for little ones, with searches for breathing exercises for kids.\n\nIt might not be surprising that many people were focused on coping and stress, especially in light of an ongoing global pandemic, economic concerns, and the adjustments associated with returning to school and workplaces.\n\nWhile stress is a normal physiological reaction that all people experience, it can slide into a severe condition like anxiety or depression if left unchecked. One thing to look for is whether the feeling goes away after a stressful event has ended, said Dr. Gail Saltz, clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City.\n\nStress can also exacerbate mental conditions like depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder, Saltz said in a 2021 interview with CNN.\n\nIf you suspect you might have chronic stress or another mental health disorder, you should talk to a trusted friend or family member to see whether they have noticed differences and reach out to a mental health professional, said Dr. Alfiee Breland-Noble, psychologist and founder of the AAKOMA Project, a youth mental health nonprofit, in a 2021 story.\n\nJournaling, podcasts and books\n\nThe quest for better mental and physical health didn’t stop at a quick internet search, according to the data.\n\nAmong the popular terms were searches for more resources on mental health, like books, podcasts and journaling techniques aimed at improving wellness.\n\n“Expressive writing works for a number of reasons,” said James Pennebaker, a psychologist, researcher and professor at the University of Texas at Austin. Acknowledging an upsetting event has value, he added in a previous CNN story. “And writing about it also helps the person find meaning or understand it.”\n\nThere are also guided and formatted journals to help keep you going.\n\nDial 988\n\nOne significant change this year was the addition of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline for mental health crises. The number is as simple as three digits: 988.\n\nThose numerals were among the health-related searches that saw a surge this year.\n\nThe dialing code is available across the United States and is meant to be easier to access for people in mental health crises, similar to 911.\n\n“One of the goals of 988 is to ensure that people get the help they need when they need it, where they need it.

TikTok trend ...", "text": "How often do you think about the Roman Empire?\n\nIf you've been approached by someone in your life or heard others discussing their propensity for pondering the ancient civilization over a causal brunch date and found yourself confused, you're not alone.\n\nIn fact, you're in good company. Google Trends data showed a 10-year high in searches for the term \"Roman Empire\" this month, which nabbed a spot as the top trending query related to ‘\"facts\" with +600% searches over the past week.\n\nIf you're a man, you're likely to think about it pretty often — at least according to a trend that is sweeping TikTok and the internet at large.\n\nWhat do women think about:The Roman Empire is all over TikTok: Are the ways men and women think really that different?\n\nOf course, the breakout term is \"do guys think about the Roman Empire?\"\n\nNo need to run to Google now, though. Read more about the trend, how it came about and what it means below.\n\nWhat is the Roman Empire trend?\n\nPut simply, the trend operates on the premise that men think about the Roman Empire more often than women, so often, in fact, that the women in their lives are shocked by the frequency.\n\nBorn out of a response to an Instagram post, the trend now mostly lives on TikTok, where the hashtag #RomanEmpire has garnered 1.2 billion views.\n\nTo participate, users, most often women, simply pick up their phone cameras, approach a man in their lives and, without any context or preface, ask some variation of \"how often do you think about the Roman Empire?\"\n\nEnough men began answering that they thought about it rather frequently, sometimes even multiple times a day, to the point of prompting mass confusion.\n\n\"There's no way this is real, right? My (partner, dad, brother, friend, etc.) couldn't possibly think about ancient Rome that often,\" wondered users who would eventually approach their own people to ask the same question and, many times, receive a similar answer.\n\nPeople began posting these videos to the app, prompting more and more to crop up in response. Among the reasons men in these videos think about the Roman Empire so much?\n\n\"There's so much to think about,\" said one, while another responded that he thinks about the sewage system created during the empire every time he uses a bathroom. Another argued that we should all think about it more often, as so many aspects of our modern life are influenced by its history.\n\nAnother mentioned thinking about Roman soldiers whenever he fights. Some men embarked on full tangential speeches about the empire, while one, who happened to be Paris Hilton's husband, simply answered \"togas.\"\n\nUnited Airlines capitalizes on trend:How often do you think of the Roman Empire? United Airlines wants to take you there.\n\nHow did the Roman Empire question start?\n\nWhile viral trends this widespread can be hard to place, some of the earliest TikTok videos on the subject reference an Instagram post made by Gaius Flavius, a Roman reenactor who posts historical content.\n\nThe original, seemingly innocuous post was made on Aug. 19 and has racked up 55,000 likes, a misleadingly small number in comparison to its true reach. The post read simply, \"Ladies, many of you do not realise how often men think about the Roman Empire. Ask your husband/boyfriend/father/brother - you will be surprised by their answer!\"\n\nWhile this call to action could have easily faded into the annals of the internet like so many thousands of posts a day do, it piqued enough interest to draw the attention of a few TikTokers.\n\nSoon, more women began stitching or dueting these posts, meaning they essentially responded to the original videos with their own, until it became a full-blown trend with hundreds of independent videos and a hashtag #romanempiretrend which currently has 31.1M views.\n\nRoman Empire trend is silly, but does it have a deeper meaning?\n\nSo, does it mean anything? It depends on who you ask. While some see the phenomena as another lighthearted moment to revel in a shared experience online, the trend, like any, has the potential to tell us something about ourselves.\n\nWhile it's true this is all a silly social media craze, experts told USA TODAY that it also illustrates something deeper about what takes up space in the social consciousness of two different genders.\n\nUSA TODAY talked with experts on how the Roman Empire speaks to the male psyche and masculinity and what the \"female equivalent\" might be.

These requests are submitted via written letters, emails, phone calls and even sometimes submitted to the city's Communications Department. The requests can cover everything from milestone birthdays to wedding anniversaries and business recognitions.\n\n\"It's the mayor's prerogative,\" he said. \"He can sign off on proclamations in some instances and it won't include the entire commission.\"\n\nMayor Bill Mutz can sign off on these celebratory proclamations independently, while larger public proclamations presented by the full commission are reviewed by all. He signed a proclamation recognizing \"Kailasa\" on December 13, 2021.\n\nMutz was out of the country on Friday and could not immediately be reached for comment by The Ledger.\n\nBartow Mayor Steve Githens said the city has a similar process for proclamations where residents and organizations can request one for special events. Recently, Bartow has honored SYFY Bartow and the American Red Cross for its help in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian.\n\nGithens said he remembers the request coming in from Kailasa.\n\n\"It was the strangest thing,\" he said. \"I remember showing it around.\"\n\nGithens said there isn't any specific review process used, that requests are usually fulfilled in recognition of the individual or group, and should not be misconstrued as a sign of support.\n\n\"We try to be good citizens, good neighbors when someone reaches out to use for recognition,\" he said. \"It was a courtesy.\"\n\nThe proclamation was likely voted on as part of Bartow commission's consent agenda, Githens said, as the organization wasn't local and there was no expectation of someone picking it up. More personal proclamations are usually printed, signed and mailed out.\n\nSherrouse said Lakeland received numerous requests asking for further recognition of Kailasa and an offer for a \"sister city\" arrangement that were not acted on. The city manager said the process of becoming sister cities undergoes more strict review than a proclamation.\n\n\"When you start getting multiple requests from the same entity but also requests for a sister city type arrangement, there is more research done and we won’t go far without getting the entire commission involved,\" Sherrouse said.\n\nLakeland does have five sister cities, starting with Richmond Hill, Canada, in 1990. It often accepts international students from its sister city of Imbari, Japan.\n\nBartow does not have any sister cities, Githens said, and to his knowledge did not receive any request to establish such a relationship with Kailasa.\n\n\"You can rest assured I'll be looking closer at requests that come across my desk in the future,\" he said.\n\nSara-Megan Walsh can be reached at swalsh@theledger.com or 863-802-7545.

The action means dealers and customers may soon struggle in the service lane.\n\n\"These are extremely profitable for GM and Stellantis primarily because if you get your vehicle serviced at a dealership, you pay full sticker price for replacement parts,\" said Art Wheaton, director of Labor Studies at Cornell University. \"The dealerships are already struggling to hire enough certified mechanics to fix them and now you’re telling the struggling dealership that they don’t have the parts to fix the cars either.\"\n\nWheaton said dealers and customers will feel this pain.\n\n\"So now you have the end customer screaming at GM,\" he said. \"GM is trying to win the public relations war and they are losing badly.\"\n\nIn a statement, GM said it has contingency plans but did not offer details.\n\nIt also could endanger Michigan's economic future if consumers start buying imports or other nonunion brands such as Tesla and the Detroit automakers can't compete, said Glenn Stevens, executive director of MICHauto and vice president of Automotive and Mobility Initiatives for the Detroit Regional Chamber.\n\n\"The current strike is damaging Michigan companies, communities, and our reputation,\" Stevens said in a statement. \"If this strike continues, and if our companies cannot compete, Michigan’s leadership position, ability to develop and attract talent, and our economy will be at risk.”\n\nThe auto industry is worth more than $300 billion annually to the state of Michigan, Stevens said.\n\nProgress with Ford\n\nThe UAW has been negotiating separately, yet simultaneously, with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis since midsummer. The automakers have each made offers and counteroffers to the union, but no tentative agreement has been reached.\n\nEarlier this week, Fain warned that a second wave of plants could face a strike if the automakers did not make \"substantial progress\" in talks by noon Friday. Fain has complained that the automakers have dragged their feet on making substantive offers since the union presented its list of \"audacious\" demands to them earlier this summer. He said GM and Stellantis only made serious offers after the union filed unfair labor charges against them with the National Labor Relations Board, which is currently investigating the allegations.\n\nBut Fain said in recent days, the union has made some \"real progress\" with Ford, but \"We’re not there yet.\"\n\nStill he said, Ford's latest offer includes:\n\nReinstating the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) to offset increases in inflation over the life of the contract, a provision that the union lost in 2009.\n\nAgreeing the union has a right to strike over any plant closures.\n\nOffering two years pay and health care coverage for laid-off workers.\n\nAgreeing to immediately convert all temporary workers with at least 90 days employment upon ratification.\n\nAgreeing to an enhanced profit-sharing formula that would have resulted in a 13.3% increase for the average employee in payouts last year.\n\n\"I don’t have to tell you that this is an important victory,\" Fain said. “All that represents serious movement on tiers, pay and job security. We want to recognize that Ford is serious about reaching a deal. At GM and Stellantis, it’s a different story.\"\n\nIn a statement to the Detroit Free Press, Ford wrote: \"Ford is working diligently with the UAW to reach a deal that rewards our workforce and enables Ford to invest in a vibrant and growing future. Although we are making progress in some areas, we still have significant gaps to close on the key economic issues. In the end, the issues are interconnected and must work within an overall agreement that supports our mutual success.\"\n\nGM fires back at Fain\n\nFain also said the union has \"won a serious victory\" ending two wage tiers at GM's parts distribution and component holdings facility workers. Those workers would now be on the same wage scale as assembly workers. Tier wages are when workers are paid different amounts for doing similar work. The UAW wants the same pay across all of the automakers’ facilities and jobs.\n\nGM's first offer was a 0% raise for those workers. But without COLA and without strong job security, those gains are not protected, the union said. But the progression to the top wage is still eight years and the union wants to shorten that and boost the top wage, currently $25 an hour, to the same as that in the assembly plants, which is closer to $33.\n\nStellantis has not proposed killing the sub-tier pay for its parts distribution centers, Fain said.\n\nHe said GM and Stellantis are not offering to reinstate COLA, they rejected profit-sharing improvements, job security proposals and converting temporary employees to permanent.\n\nStellantis responded in a statement that it had made significant counterproposals including “a very competitive offer yesterday that includes all our current full-time hourly employees earning between $80,000 and $96,000 a year by the end of the contract (a 21.4% compounded increase. ... And significant product allocation that allows for workforce stability through the end of the contract,” spokeswoman Jodi Tinson said. “And yet, we still have not received a response to that offer. We look forward to the UAW leadership’s productive engagement so that we can bargain in good faith to reach an agreement that will protect the competitiveness of our company and our ability to continue providing good jobs.”\n\nGM provided the following statement in reaction to the expanded strike: \"Today’s strike escalation by the UAW’s top leadership is unnecessary. ... We have contingency plans for various scenarios and are prepared to do what is best for our business, our customers, and our dealers.\"\n\nGM said it had so far presented five separate economic proposals that are \"historic,\" addressing employees' demands while still allowing GM to thrive into the future. It will continue to bargain in good faith with the union to reach an agreement as quickly as possible, the statement said.\n\nIn an op-ed that ran in the Detroit Free Press on Wednesday, GM President Mark Reuss defended GM's most recent offer to the UAW made last Thursday.\n\n\"The record offer we proposed on Sept. 14 recognizes the many contributions our represented team members make to our company — past, present and future,\" Reuss wrote. \"And it addresses, directly, what they’ve told us matters most: wage growth, job security and long-term stability.\"\n\nUAW Vice President Mike Booth wrote an op-ed in response noting that Reuss touted the wages of 85% of GM’s workforce, \"What about the other 15%? We’re fighting for 100% fairness for 100% of our members.\"\n\nFain's invitation to join the picket line\n\nAn audience of about 50,000 tuned in to listen to Fain’s update on the UAW’s Facebook page. He thanked the workers who have been on the picket line since last week for showing \"leadership, courage and creativity on the picket line.\n\n“Reinforcements are coming. As we said for weeks, we’re not going to wait around forever for a contract from the Big Three,\" Fain said. \"We can and we will go all out if our national leadership thinks we can’t move. Right now, we think we can get there. Obviously, Stellantis and GM will need some pushing.”\n\nFain declared a strike as contract talks failed before the current contract expired at 11:59 p.m. Sept. 14. Fain announced the first wave of plants the union would strike as: Ford Michigan Assembly Plant (Final Assembly and Paint only) in Wayne where it builds the Bronco, Stellantis Toledo Assembly Complex in Ohio where it builds some Jeep vehicles and GM's Wentzville Assembly where GM makes its midsize Chevrolet and GMC pickups and cargo vans.\n\nAs Fain announced the expansion Friday, he invited anyone who supports the union to join members on the picket line, \"from friends and families all the way up to the president of the United States.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced later that he plans to visit Michigan on Tuesday. Biden has been a staunch supporter of unions and their rights to collectively bargain. Last Friday, Biden said he believed automakers should provide better wages and benefits to the workers.\n\nMore:Auto suppliers say if the UAW strikes more plants, it could mean the end for many\n\nMore:Unifor, UAW chose different bargaining strategies. 1 has a deal.

Ratifying the contract could take about three weeks, according to previous statements from O'Brien, and Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman.\n\nOf the 176 local unions with UPS members, 14 did not show up for a meeting in Washington, D.C., to review the tentative agreement.

But it does nothing to ...", "text": "Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt CNN —\n\nThe world has failed to reach an agreement to phase out fossil fuels after marathon UN climate talks were “stonewalled” by a number of oil-producing nations.\n\nNegotiators from nearly 200 countries at the COP27 UN climate summit in Egypt took the historic step of agreeing to set up a “loss and damage” fund meant to help vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters and agreed the globe needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half by 2030.\n\nThe recent devastating floods across Pakistan are just one example of the suffering caused or made worse by the climate crisis. Fida Hussain/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe agreement also reaffirmed the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n\nHowever, an attempt to address the biggest source of the planet warming emissions that are causing the climate crisis ended in a fiasco after a number of nations, including China and Saudi Arabia, blocked a key proposal to phase out all fossil fuels, not just coal.\n\n“It is more than frustrating to see overdue steps on mitigation and the phase-out of fossil energies being stonewalled by a number of large emitters and oil producers,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement.\n\nAddressing the summit early on Sunday morning, the European Union’s Climate Chief Frans Timmermans said the EU was “disappointed” with the final outcome of the summit.\n\n“What we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and planet … we should have done much more,” Timmermans said.\n\nVictory for climate crisis victims\n\nThe agreement to help the world’s most vulnerable countries deal with loss and damage represents a breakthrough, however, in what has been a contentious negotiation process.\n\nIt marks the first time countries and groups, including longtime holdouts like the United States and the EU, have agreed to establish a fund for nations vulnerable to climate disasters made worse by pollution disproportionately produced by wealthy, industrialized nations.\n\nNegotiators and non-governmental organizations observing the talks praised the deal as a significant achievement, after developing nations and small island countries banded together to amplify pressure.\n\n“The agreements made at COP27 are a win for our entire world,” Molwyn Joseph, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said in a statement. “We have shown those who have felt neglected that we hear you, we see you, and we are giving you the respect and care you deserve.”\n\nThe creation of the fund also became one of the key demands of activists attending the summit. Unlike in previous years, when huge protests and loud calls for action become part of the event, demonstrations were muted this year.\n\nProtests are rare and mostly illegal in Egypt and the Egyptian government put strict limits on protesters attending the conference.\n\nStill, the biggest protest of the summit saw hundreds of activists marching through the venue last weekend, demanding climate payments. On Friday, 10-year-old Ghanian activist Nakeeyat Dramani received a standing ovation in the plenary after calling on the delegates to “have a heart and do the math.”\n\nClimate activists staged a number of protests during the conference, demanding end of fossil fuels and climate finance. Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nThe fund will focus on what can be done to support loss and damage resources, but it does not include liability or compensation provisions, a senior Biden administration official told CNN.\n\nReaching the agreement was not easy. The summit was originally scheduled to end on Friday, but went well into overtime with negotiators still trying to hammer out the details as the conference venue was being dismantled around them.\n\nThe US and other developed nations have long sought to avoid such provisions that could open them up to legal liability and lawsuits from other countries. And in previous public remarks, US Climate Envoy John Kerry had said loss and damage was not the same thing as climate reparations.\n\n“‘Reparations’ is not a word or a term that has been used in this context,” Kerry said on a recent call with reporters earlier this month. He added: “We have always said that it is imperative for the developed world to help the developing world to deal with the impacts of climate.”\n\nDetails on how the fund would operate remain murky. The text leaves a lot of questions on when it will be finalized and become operational, and how exactly it would be funded. The text also mentions a transitional committee that will help nail down those details, but doesn’t set specific future deadlines.\n\nAnd while climate experts celebrated the win, they also noted the uncertainty going forward.\n\n“This loss and damage fund will be a lifeline for poor families whose houses are destroyed, farmers whose fields are ruined, and islanders forced from their ancestral homes,” World Resources Institute CEO Ani Dasgupta said. “At the same time, developing countries are leaving Egypt without clear assurances about how the loss and damage fund will be overseen.”\n\nAn outcome on a fund came this year in large part because the G77 bloc of developing nations stayed unified, exerting increased leverage on loss and damage than in past years, climate experts said.\n\n“They needed to be together to force the conversation we’re having now,” Nisha Krishnan, resilience director for World Resources Institute Africa told reporters. “The coalition has held because of this conviction that we did need to stay together to deliver this – and to push the conversation.”\n\nFor many, the fund represents a hard-fought years-long victory, pushed over the finish line by the global attention given to climate disasters such as Pakistan’s devastating flooding this summer.\n\n“It was like a big buildup,” former US climate envoy Todd Stern told CNN. “This has been around for quite a while and it’s getting all the more aggravating to vulnerable countries because there’s still not a lot of money getting put into it. As we can see the actual disaster impacts of climate change are getting more and more intense.”\n\nThe EU's Frans Timmermans speaks to reporters during the summit. Thomas Trutschel/Photothek/Getty Images\n\nText on 1.5 degrees remains\n\nGlobal scientists have for decades warned that warming must be limited to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels – a threshold that is fast-approaching as the planet’s average temperature has already climbed to around 1.1 degrees.\n\nBeyond 1.5 degrees, the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages will increase dramatically, scientists said in the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.\n\nBut while summit delegates affirmed the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, climate experts expressed dismay about a lack of mention of fossil fuels, or the need to phase them down to keep global temperatures from rising. As it did last year at the Glasgow summit, the text calls for a phasedown of unabated coal power, and “phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies,” but does not go further to call for a phase-out of all fossil fuels, including oil and gas.\n\n“The influence of the fossil fuel industry was found across the board,” Laurence Tubiana, CEO European Climate Foundation, said in a statement. “The Egyptian Presidency has produced a text that clearly protects oil and gas petro-states and the fossil fuel industries. This trend cannot continue in the United Arab Emirates next year.”\n\nIt took some dramatic action to even hold onto the 1.5-degree number struck in Glasgow last year.\n\nOn Saturday, EU officials threatened to walk out of the meeting if the final agreement failed to endorse the goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In a carefully choreographed news conference, Timmermans, flanked by a full line-up of ministers and other top officials from EU member states, said that “no deal is better than a bad deal.”\n\n“We do not want 1.5 Celsius to die here and today. That to us is completely unacceptable,” he said.\n\nThe talks were further complicated by the fact that Kerry, who was leading the US delegation, tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday. He continued to communicate with his team and his foreign counterparts by phone, but his physical absence was noticeable during the crunch time at the summit.\n\nUS Climate Envoy John Kerry gestures toward his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua at the COP27 summit. Nariman El-Mofty/AP\n\nThe US and China resume climate talks\n\nAside from the final agreement, the summit brought several other significant developments including the resumption of formal climate talks between the US and China – the world’s two largest greenhouse gas emitters.\n\nAfter China froze climate negotiations between the two countries this summer, US President Joe Biden and China President Xi Jinping agreed to reestablish US-China communications when they met last week at the G20 summit in Bali, paving the way for Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua to meet again formally.\n\n“Without China, even if the US is … moving towards a 1.5-degree program, … if we don’t have China, nobody else can make … that goal,” Kerry told CNN last week.\n\nThe two sides met throughout the second week of COP, trying to pick up where they left off before China suspended the talks, according to a source familiar with the discussions. They were focused on specific action points, such as enhancing China’s plan to reduce emissions of methane – a powerful greenhouse gas – and their overall emissions target, the source said.\n\nUnlike last year, there was no big, joint climate announcement from the two countries. But the resumption of formal communication was seen as an encouraging sign.\n\nLi Shuo, a Beijing-based global policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia said this COP “saw extensive exchanges between the two sides, led by Kerry and Xie.”\n\n“The challenge is they should do more than talk, [and] also need to lead,” Shuo said, adding the restarted formal dialogue “helps to prevent the worst outcome.”", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Ella Nilsen Rachel Ramirez", "Ivana Kottasová", "Ella Nilsen", "Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/09/10/syria-airstrikes/90183372/", "title": "Airstrikes kill, wound dozens in Syria ahead of cease-fire", "text": "Bart Jansen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAirstrikes killed and wounded dozens in Syria on Saturday hours after the U.S. and Russia reached an agreement on a cease-fire set to begin Monday\n\nThe airstrikes on parts of Aleppo and nearby towns killed at least 45 people and wounded dozens more, the Aleppo Media Center said, according to the Associated Press.

The four unions that have voted no will remain on the job until at least early next month while negotiations are held to try to avoid a strike that could cause widespread disruptions in the nation’s still struggling supply chain and overall economy.\n\nIf even one of the dozen railroad unions were to go on strike, the other 11 would honor the picket lines, shutting down the railroads.\n\nIf a strike goes on for an extended period, it could cause shortages and higher prices for goods including fuel and food. If the four unions that rejected the deals are unable to reach new deals before strike deadlines, Congress could order the railroad workers to remain on the job or return to work.\n\nThe two unions that released voting results Monday are the transportation division of the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, Transportation union (SMART-TD), which represents about 28,000 conductors and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), which represents about 24,000 engineers. The engineers and conductors make up the two-person train crews.\n\nBoth unions reached tentative deals in September in a marathon 20-hour negotiating session just hours before their earlier strike deadlines.\n\nPresident Joe Biden called those deals “a win for tens of thousands of rail workers and for their dignity and the dignity of their work.” He had directly intervened in the final round of talks, but his praise of the deals wasn’t enough to win approval from rank-and-file members of the conductors’ union.\n\nThe deals nearly got the support they needed to be ratified by both unions. One was ratified by the engineers, with 53.5% voting yes, while the other was a very slim defeat by the conductors with either a small majority or a near majority voting for ratification.\n\nThe conductors’ vote ultimately failed because the union’s rules require each of five classes of workers within the union to approve the deal for it to pass.\n\nAlthough 64.5% of “yardmasters,” which includes 1,300 of the union’s membership, supported the deal, 50.87% members of train and engine service members of the union voted against ratification. The union did not release the overall vote totals for SMART-TD members.\n\nThe no vote follow similar contract rejections by the rank-and-file members of three other rail unions – one representing track maintenance workers, another whose members maintain and operate the signal system, and a third who represent locomotive mechanics and welders.\n\nThe Association of American Railroads, the industry trade group, told CNN last week that the railroads are still hopeful of reaching new deals that can be ratified by membership without a strike taking place. It repeated that hope Monday after the latest vote.\n\n“While railroads remain committed to reaching agreements with these remaining unions, the timeline for those to occur is short,” said the AAR’s statement.\n\nOne of those unions which earlier rejected its deal, the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division (BMWED), announced Monday it was moving its strike date back to Dec. 9, to be in sync with the strike date for the conductors and one of the other unions.\n\nAnd it suggested all four unions should negotiate together ahead of a common Dec. 9 strike date.\n\nThe one union that might go on strike before Dec. 9, the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen [BRS], could go on strike at 12:01 am ET on Dec. 5. Last week the BRS President Michael Baldwin told CNN the union did not intend to push back its strike deadline “at this time.”\n\nLucrative deals get rejected\n\nEven within many of the unions that voted in favor of the deals, there was significant opposition, as was shown in the 46.5% of engineers who voted no.\n\nThe deals being voted down are lucrative for union members. They include an immediate 14% raise with back pay dating to 2020, as well as pay raises totaling 24% during the four-year life of the contracts, which run through 2024. Union members also would receive cash bonuses of $1,000 a year.\n\nAll told, the backpay and bonuses will give union members an average payment of $11,000 per worker once the deal is ratified.\n\nBut it’s not the pay that has been the sticking point in the negotiations. It’s the work rules and quality of life issues, such as staffing levels and paid sick time, which the tentative agreements do not include.\n\nSo far railroad management has rejected proposals from union negotiators to add sick pay as a way to win ratification from the rank and file.\n\nCongressional action possible\n\nCongress is already facing calls from a wide range of business groups to act to prevent a strike. About 30% of the nation’s freight moves by rail, when measured by the weight of the freight and the distance it travels.\n\nThe AAR joined those calls for Congressional action if new deals can’t be reached.\n\n“Congress has historically intervened to prevent rail system disruptions. In the event that the four unions remain unwilling to enter agreements … Congress must be prepared to act and institute the terms supported by the majority of the unions, guaranteeing certainty for rail customers and the broader economy,” it said in its statement.\n\nLabor Secretary Marty Walsh, who was involved in the negotiations that reached the deals that averted a strike back in September, told CNN earlier this month that while he prefers to reach a new round of negotiated agreements, it would be necessary for Congress to act to prevent a strike.\n\nThe White House said Monday they are looking to labor and industry parties involved in negotiations to resolve a rail dispute on their own ahead of a critical December deadline.\n\n“As the President has said from the beginning, a shutdown is unacceptable because of the harm it would inflict on jobs, families, farms, businesses and communities across the country,” a White House official told CNN.\n\nThe official added: “A majority of unions have voted to ratify the tentative agreement, and the best option is still for the parties to resolve this themselves.”\n\nAsked Monday by CNN’s Jeremy Diamond what he was doing to avert a rail strike, President Biden responded, “We’re going to be talking about that today.”\n\nBut unlike July, when Biden was able to block the unions from going on strike by naming a panel to try to come up with a solution both sides could live with, it now rests with Congress, not Biden, to act if new labor deals can not be reached.\n\nThe unions are all opposed to Congressional intervention and want to be allowed to strike to raise pressure on the railroads to achieve their bargaining goals, though they would not be opposed to the Labor Department once again facilitating negotiations.\n\n“We don’t think it should require the influence or cajoling of any outside party to get the railroads to be reasonable on behalf of their business or workers,” said the BMWED in a statement. “But it would be helpful for these third parties to start to facilitate the discussion. It’s clear railroads won’t engaged with us meaningfully unless they are forced to.\n\nAn added challenge: it would take bipartisan cooperation in the “Lame Duck” session of congress to pass legislation that will prevent or quickly end a strike.\n\n– CNN’s Betsy Klein and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Vanessa Yurkevich", "Chris Isidore", "Vanessa Yurkevich"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/middleeast/azerbaijan-armenia-artillery-strikes-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Russia claims ceasefire reached between Armenia and Azerbaijan ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia claimed it has brokered a ceasefire between Armenia and Azerbaijan after fighting erupted on the border between the two countries this week, bringing a decades-old conflict to the brink of reigniting.\n\n“We call on the parties to refrain from further escalation of the situation, exercise restraint and strictly observe the ceasefire in accordance with the trilateral statements of the leaders of Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia of November 9, 2020, January 11 and November 26, 2021,” a Russian foreign ministry statement said.\n\n“We are in close contact with Baku and Yerevan. An appeal was received from the Armenian leadership to assist in resolving the situation … We expect that the agreement reached as a result of Russian mediation on a ceasefire from 9.00 am Moscow time on September 13 will be carried out in full,” it added.\n\nThe statement follows a call between Armenia’s Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and President Vladimir Putin earlier Tuesday. Local media in Azerbaijan also reported on the ceasefire but said it had already been broken.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the Armenian Defense Ministry claimed Azerbaijan Armed Forces conducted artillery strikes toward Armenian border towns. The strike included drones and large-caliber firearms fired in the direction of Goris, Sotk, and Jermuk, according to the Armenian Defense Ministry.\n\nThe Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense responded with a statement acknowledging the strikes, but said the strikes are “small-scale” and “aim to ensure the security of Azerbaijan’s borders.”\n\nOn Monday, Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense accused Armenian forces of firing in small arms in the directions of the Novoivanovka settlement of Gadabay region and Husulu settlement of Lachin region near the border of the two countries. Armenia denied the allegations.\n\nIn 2020, the two countries clashed over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, a landlocked area between Eastern Europe and Western Asia that is populated and was controlled by ethnic Armenians but located in Azerbaijani territory. Hostilities ended after Armenian-backed separatists agreed to relinquish control over territories in the restive region.\n\nThe unrest in the region is decades old, dating back to the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the region, backed by Armenia, declared independence from Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has long claimed it will retake the territory, which is internationally recognized as Azerbaijani.\n\nOn Tuesday, Armenia called on Russia to implement a 1997 defense treaty that stipulates the countries will defend each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty in the event of an attack by a foreign country.\n\n“A decision was made to officially apply to the Russian Federation for the implementation of the provisions of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, to the Collective Security Treaty Organization and the UN Security Council regarding the aggression against the sovereign territory of the Republic of Armenia,” a statement from the Armenian Prime Minister’s office read.\n\nThe request came after a session with the Armenian Security Council and a call between Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to a statement from Pashinyan’s office.\n\nRussia previously deployed what it termed peacekeeping forces to the region after brokering a ceasefire agreement in early November 2020, ending an almost two-month conflict that killed at least 6,500 people, according to Reuters.\n\nPashinyan also spoke with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken Tuesday, asking for an “adequate reaction” from the international community in response to what Pashinyan referred to as “the aggression launched by Azerbaijan against the sovereign territory of Armenia,” his office said in a statement.\n\nOn Monday evening, Blinken called for the “immediate cessation of hostilities.”\n\n“The United States is deeply concerned about reports of attacks along the Armenia-Azerbaijan border, including reported strikes against settlements and civilian infrastructure inside Armenia,” Blinken said in a statement. “As we have long made clear, there can be no military solution to the conflict. We urge an end to any military hostilities immediately.”", "authors": ["Philip Wang Ellie Kaufman Anna Chernova Tara Subramaniam", "Philip Wang", "Ellie Kaufman", "Anna Chernova", "Tara Subramaniam"], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2021/11/08/us-travel-ban-requirements-international-tourists/6303811001/", "title": "US lifts international travel ban: Changes affect most travelers", "text": "A rush of international travelers headed into the United States Monday as the COVID-19 travel ban ended and people from dozens of countries begin flooding in, more than 600 days since they were barred from entry.\n\nThat's more than 86 weeks.

The bridge – usually a wall of slow-moving cars and trucks – was an empty ribbon of asphalt. The border had been closed to tourists or people visiting family, although a wide variety of essential workers had been permitted to cross during the closure. During that time, Mexican nationals holding tourist cards were banned from traveling over the land border; air travel between points in the interior of both countries never ceased.\n\n\"It's been two years,\" said Lizbeth Castellanos. \"We're going to Marshalls and Walmart.\"\n\nThe crossing reopened at just after midnight Eastern time. At 6 a.m. Eastern, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported no significant crossing delays at either the Mexico or Canada borders.\n\nSusana Hernández of Juárez was crossing for the first time since the pandemic restrictions to buy clothes in El Paso for her business. She smiled and flashed her vaccine card.\n\n\"We're happy,\" she said. \"We're home, we feel like we're back home.\"\n\nCross-border traffic of essential travelers between El Paso and Juárez reached nearly 800,000 crossings of passenger vehicles in August, according to the Border Region Modeling Project at the University of Texas at El Paso.\n\n\"Nobody anticipated that this pandemic would last as long as it has, in terms of travel restrictions,\" said Hector Mancha, U.S. Customs and Border Protection director of field operations in El Paso. \"People have not crossed over and visited with family in going on two years...

At the pandemic's worst, that number dropped to 30,000, and New York businesses hope the flood of tourists will boost their finances.\n\nTJ Witham, the vice president of communications for the Times Square Alliance, told USA TODAY the alliance chose the red steps as it is an \"iconic meeting place\" for people visiting the Big Apple.\n\nChris Dickson, a 41-year-old bus scheduler from Newcastle, England, flew to New York City on Monday for 48 hours, using credit from a British Airways trip he'd had to cancel seven months ago.\n\nDickson planned to drop his bag at his Brooklyn hotel and start exploring the city he last visited more than two years ago.\n\n\"I just wanted to come to America at the first opportunity,'' he said. \"I'm going to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, I'm going to go through Central Park, I'm going to do some running, some jogging in that area.

British Airways Flight 1 and Virgin Atlantic Flight 3 took off at 3:51 a.m. ET and landed within minutes of each other. The airlines are rivals but teamed up to commemorate the reopening of foreign travel to the U.S., and British Airways' CEO was aboard his company's flight, which touched down about 11 a.m. ET\n\nAmerican Airlines, which is a BA travel partner, saw bookings from London to US surge 70 percent in the past week, with a lot of the travel for remainder of 2021, said Chief Revenue Officer Vasu Raja.\n\nClive Wartten, who runs a business-travel group in the UK, arrived on the British Airways flight and was headed for a run in Central Park before meetings with colleagues.

It was a bit of a holiday party flight.\"\n\nWartten, who is the CEO of the Business Travel Association, later tweeted that he made it from the plane to one of New York's famed yellow taxis in just seven minutes.\n\n\"This is a big step for us to come back and open business travel with our US friends,\" he told USA TODAY while passing through the terminal.\n\nBritish Airways CEO Sean Doyle has been pushing the Biden administration to ease travel restrictions between the UK and the US for months because it is one of the busiest travel corridors in the world. At one point during the spring, he said, the second runway at Heathrow was closed because the airport hadn't seen such a limited number of flights since World War II.\n\n\"This has been a crisis like no other,'' he said Monday after arriving in New York.\n\nDoyle believes the border reopening took too long – the UK and European Union started welcoming US tourists back over the summer – but on Monday said he didn't want to dwell on the past. Instead, he gushed about what the reopening means to British Airways and its passengers.\n\n\"The North Atlantic is very important to British Airways and today's a very, very important turning point and milestone in the future of the country,'' he said.\n\nIs he worried travel restrictions could return if COVID cases spike on either side of the Atlantic?\n\n\"You always have to keep an eye on things,'' he said. \"But I do think that we're seeing a sort of pragmatic framework emerge across a number of jurisdictions.''\n\nHe said he hopes that that framework – basing entry requirements on vaccination and testing – remains despite any COVID trends going forward.\n\n— Dawn Gilbertson, Morgan Hines, USA TODAY\n\nAnticipation at airports\n\nAhead of the British Airways first flight arrival, family members waited in the Terminal 7 arrivals area at New York's John F.

So we've just kind of been hanging on a string,\" Bell said. \"It was a little bit confusing to get him here, just because he didn't know he needed a negative (test) so that three days prior we actually had to make that last minute. And he came back negative. He's already fully vaccinated. I'm vaccinated. I got my booster yesterday, just in case — I'm just excited to see him.\"\n\nBell said she's excited to just watch a movie together — for months, they've been watching movies simultaneously but separated by the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\"We're homebodies. We like to game together. But yeah, that's mostly what we're looking forward to — just being in the same space together,\" she said. \"This is going to be our first Thanksgiving together, his first Thanksgiving period. He's never celebrated. So we're actually gonna make the big meal and have all my family come over. He's a little nervous. But you know, he loves my dad. They're both ex-army. So they get along great.\"\n\nAnd Rosa Chorra, 37, eagerly awaited her parents' arrival from Spain, waiting with her 10-month-old Aurora for their plane to land in Atland. Chorra's parents missed her pregnancy and granddaughter's birth, although Chorra was able to take Aurora to visit them three months ago. She said she missed having the help they could have provided with a newborn.\n\n\"It was absolutely horrible. I think it's been the hardest time of my life. I mean, when she was born, the first months that are the hardest, and it's been tough,\" Chorra said.\n\n— Dawn Gilbertson, Morgan Hines, Eve Chen, USA TODAY\n\nHeaded to Disney World\n\nFor UK resident ﻿Emma Barbour and her family, the border reopening means one thing: Florida's Disney World with their 10-year-old daughter.\n\nThey usually come annually, but put those plans on hold after 2019, and rescheduled this trip three times as they waited for the Biden administration to lift the ban. Barbour, 41, said the airports were busy but staff seemed cheerful despite long lines.\n\n\"We honestly wouldn't travel if we felt unsafe or nervous, we are fully vaccinated and will wear our masks. I definitely won't let it tarnish our time there by worrying about it,\" she said from Paris as they waited to board their Atlanta-bound flight.\n\n— Eve Chen, USA TODAY\n\nThe British are coming\n\nSam Nagy and his family are headed to Florida, to the Universal Orlando Resort, their first trip to the U.S. since 2018. He said lines at the Manchester, England, airport were smooth, raising his hopes for the family vacation they've rescheduled four times already.\n\n\"That once-a-year trip is so much more to us than just a vacation, it honestly feels like it's ‘home' as cliché as that may be to say,\" said Nagy.\n\nPaul Richards is flying from London to New York on Virgin Atlantic and described the airport scene as chaotic, with long check-in lines this morning. He is headed to New York City for vacation to celebrate his son's 21st birthday.\n\n\"They are working really hard to get people through, however, some passengers hadn't completed the attestation forms or just stood in the wrong queue,'' he said. \"Once through check in, security was pretty slick.''\n\n— Dawn Gilbertson, USA TODAY\n\nLines at the Canada-US border\n\nAt th Sweetgrass, Montana, border crossing, wait times climbed to 240 minutes -- four hours — according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Normal wait time is about 45 minutes.\n\nWindsor, Ontario, Mayor Drew Dilkens said a Canadian travel requirement – having negative polymerase chain reaction test that can cost $200 – is likely to prevent many who want to drive from Ontario to Michigan from doing so.\n\nHe explained the testing provision doesn't make sense for day-trippers nor does it provide the kind of health assurance the government thinks it does because someone could easily contract the virus during their visit.\n\nHe wants to see that requirement lifted.\n\n— Frank Witsil, Detroit Free Press\n\nHow did the international travel ban start?\n\nThe travel ban barred most foreign nationals who had been in the listed countries in the past 14 days from entering the U.S., regardless of vaccination status. The country also cut off nonessential travel across the U.S. land borders with Mexico and Canada in March 2020.\n\nIt wasn't until September that the White House announced that it would end the travel ban for fully vaccinated travelers – months after many other nations reopened to U.S. tourists.\n\nThe new U.S. entry requirements, which went into effect Monday, require foreign air passengers to test negative for the virus before boarding a plane to the country and, if they are 18 or older, show proof of full vaccination. Travelers entering the U.S. on land or by ferry for nonessential reasons also need to show proof of vaccination.\n\nAs airports and border crossings get adjusted to the new travel rules, international travelers should prepare for lines.\n\nThe first flight from a country listed the travel ban is set to fly into Chicago from Dublin just before 7 a.m. CT, according to flight tracker Flight Aware and flight-data firm OAG.\n\nPlenty more will follow; there are more than 2 million international flights scheduled to arrive in the U.S. next month, compared to just 728,820 in December of 2020, according to OAG and Flight Aware.\n\n— Bailey Schulz, USA TODAY\n\n► US drops travel ban:Expect bottlenecks at airports under strict entry rules", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/05/19/biden-mccarthy-debt-limit-ceiling-talks-takeaways/70232365007/", "title": "Biden, McCarthy deal: What to know about 2023 debt ceiling talks", "text": "The clock is ticking for Congress to raise the debt ceiling. The country is less than two weeks out from the Treasury Department’s earliest projected \"X-Date,\" the day the United States could run out of cash to fully pay all of its obligations.\n\nNegotiations between the Republican-controlled House and the White House hit a snag Friday as Republican negotiators walked out of a closed-door meeting with White House officials.\n\nHouse GOP lawmakers have pressed for slashes to the federal budget in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, but President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats have opposed to demands such as expanded requirements for recipients of welfare programs.\n\nThe White House has maintained the ongoing budget talks are completely isolated from raising the debt ceiling, but House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and his fellow Republicans think otherwise, saying their pressure on the debt limit has brought Biden to the negotiating table.\n\n“I’m confident that we’ll get the agreement on the budget, and America will not default,” Biden said before departing for an overseas trip cut short due to the debt ceiling talks.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the debt ceiling negotiations this week.\n\nStay in the conversation on politicsSign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nNegotiations come to abrupt halt before critical weekend\n\nNegotiations on raising the debt ceiling came to an abrupt halt Friday as Republican negotiators walked out of a closed-door meeting with White House officials, leaving the two sides at a stalemate heading into a critical weekend.\n\nRep. Garret Graves, R-La., who is leading negotiations for House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, told reporters it's time to \"press pause\" on negotiations \"because it's just not productive.\" He said negotiations became “just unreasonable” and that it was unclear when talks would resume.\n\nRep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., another Republican negotiator said, “There is a “serious gap” between the sides. \"We're in a tough spot.\"\n\nA White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, \"There are real differences between the parties on budget issues and talks will be difficult. The president’s team is working hard towards a reasonable bipartisan solution that can pass the House and the Senate.”\n\nThe White House believes several of the top demands of Republicans would not get the support needed from Democrats in Congress for passage, according to a source familiar with negotiations.\n\nOne major sticking point, according to the source, remains expanded work requirements for federal benefits such as food stamps that Republicans covet but President Joe Biden and Democrats oppose. Several Democratic lawmakers have characterized stricter work requirements for welfare as a nonstarter.\n\nYellen's default warning: 'Severe hardship to American families'\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen reaffirmed her department's previous projection the U.S. could default on its debts as early as June 1 in a stark warning to Congress.\n\n“We have learned from past debt limit impasses that waiting until the last minute to suspend or increase the debt limit can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence, raise short-term borrowing costs for taxpayers and negatively impact the credit rating of the United States,” Yellen wrote in a letter to congressional leaders.\n\n“If Congress fails to increase the debt limit, it would cause severe hardship to American families, harm our global leadership position, and raise questions about our ability to defend our national security interests,” Yellen warned.\n\nYellen issued a similar warning on May 1, which prompted Biden to schedule a meeting with the top four party leaders in Congress to discuss the debt ceiling after talks stalled.\n\nBiden cancels parts of overseas trip for debt ceiling negotiations\n\nBiden was originally scheduled to visit Australia and Papua New Guinea after meeting with other world leaders at the Group of Seven Summit in Hiroshima, Japan, but those extra stops were canceled for him to return to debt ceiling negotiations.\n\n“I'm cutting my trip short. I'm postponing the Australia portion of [the] trip and my stop in Papua New Guinea in order to be back for the final negotiations with congressional leaders,” Biden said Tuesday at an event celebrating Jewish American Heritage Month.\n\nHe is scheduled to hold a press conference Sunday on the debt limit before heading back to the U.S. for negotiations.\n\nBiden leaves door open for tougher work requirements in debt limit deal, drawing concern from progressives\n\nBiden has left the door open for stricter work requirements for federal aid programs such as food stamps, an issue that has proven to be a top sticking point in negotiations. It is unclear what those changes could entail, as Biden pushed back on work requirements that would “go much beyond” rules he previously supported as a senator in the 1990s.\n\nThe White House’s refusal to completely take work requirements off the table has drawn concern from progressives and top Democrats on what Biden is willing to give up for a debt ceiling agreement.\n\n“We have to be very clear that this kind of hostage-taking cannot be rewarded,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said in an interview with USA TODAY.\n\nHouse Minority Leader, Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told CNBC that tougher work requirements are a “nonstarter” in any budget proposal.\n\n'Hostage-taking cannot be rewarded':Liberals worry Biden is caving in debt-ceiling talks\n\nCircle of negotiators on debt limit gets smaller\n\nIt's unclear where progress on negotiations stand. McCarthy told reporters Thursday morning he can “see the path that we can come to an agreement,” but they “haven’t agreed to anything yet.”\n\nBut the circle of key negotiators has grown smaller and more focused, which could indicate a deal could come soon. For House Republicans, McCarthy has tapped ally Rep. Garret Graves R-La., to lead negotiations alongside McCarthy’s own aides.\n\nThe White House has chosen Steve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and Shalanda Young, director of the Office of Management and Budget, to work with Louisa Terrell, director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, to negotiate on behalf of the Biden administration.\n\n'I'm much more scared now':Veterans of 2011 debt ceiling crisis say this year's fight is different\n\nMcCarthy risks backlash from right flank in debt limit deal\n\nMcCarthy could face backlash from hardline conservatives in his own conference if a debt ceiling proposal is brought to the House floor.\n\nHouse Republicans are working with a slim majority and any debt-ceiling agreement struck between McCarthy and Biden could draw the ire of the chamber’s most conservative lawmakers.\n\nOne of the key concessions McCarthy made to his far-right flank to become speaker was restoring the motion to vacate and allowing one single member of the House to initiate a vote to oust the speaker. That concession could come back to haunt him, depending on lawmakers' reaction to a deal blessed by Biden and McCarthy.\n\nFor now, one lawmaker who held up McCarthy's speaker vote said a motion to vacate is not on the table, even if hardline conservatives come out to be against an agreement.\n\n“Nobody’s talking about that. We support our speaker. We want him to be successful because the country needs for him to be successful,” Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., said on MSNBC Wednesday.\n\nRelated:Last-minute deal on debt ceiling could still spark recession even if US avoids default\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/19"}]}

Arrows should not be pulled back at more than half strength.

Why the worst may be ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nTarget just demonstrated how quickly things can change in the world of retail, posting a terrible quarter after nearly two years of soaring profits and record revenue growth. But the big box retailer is promising things will change in the other direction just as fast.\n\nTarget was widely seen as one of the winners of the pandemic, gaining new customers as shoppers not wanting to go into brick-and-mortar stores were drawn to its growing curbside pickup and home delivery.\n\nBut after a disappointing fiscal first quarter when profits fell 40%, Target just had an even worse second quarter. Profits plunged 90% compared to a year earlier.\n\nInflation-weary shoppers shifted to buying essentials such as food and gas rather than “nonessential” general merchandise that is central to Target’s sales and profits. It was a stark contrast to larger rival Walmart (WMT), which posted only a narrow drop in profits for the quarter.\n\nBut many analysts believe Target is still in good position going forward, that it’s not at risk of joining some of the other pandemic winners who are now struggling, like online retailer Wayfair (W). Friday it announced it had to cut 5% of the staff due to expanding too fast during the good times.\n\nTarget’s profit plunge came from the deep discounts it had to offer on much of its general merchandise, such as clothing, electronics and home goods. The hit to earnings from such deep discounting was unavoidable. But company executives insist it was the right choice.\n\n“Consider the alternative: we could have held on to excess inventory and attempted to deal with it slowly, over multiple quarters or even years. While that might have reduced the near-term financial impact, it would have held back our business over time,” said CEO Brian Cornell to investors. “The vast majority of the financial impact of these inventory actions is now behind us.” He predicts a meaningful improvement in operating margin rates in the fall season.\n\nMany analysts agree that Target did the right thing taking the hit. Several say the sudden shift in consumer buying habits was not the fault of miscalculation by management.\n\n“All last year the supply chain was very, very tight. Stores were out of stock of many items. They were ordering for a level of demand that was very reasonable,” said Bobby Griffin, retail analyst at Raymond James. “Then there was a very fast change in consumer behavior.”\n\nDiscretionary purchases being made by consumers shifted away from goods to things like travel, Griffin said.\n\nOther experts say that Target management wasn’t quite blameless for being caught with too much of the wrong inventory.\n\n“My sense is that this [problem at Target] was 70% about consumer behavior and 30% miscalculation related to inventory,” said Eric Schiffer, chief investment officer of Los Angeles-based private equity firm, The Patriarch Organization.\n\nThere is some hope for all retailers that they could benefit from the large, steady decline in gas prices over the last two months.\n\nThe national average price of gasoline has dropped $1.11, or 22% to $3.91 since hitting a record of $5.02 on June 14. It has fallen every day since. That should save households $100 a month on average. And wholesale gasoline futures point to even lower gas prices ahead in the coming weeks and months.\n\nTarget was always going to have more problems with a sudden shift in consumer spending than Walmart. Walmart has more than half of its sales from grocery while Target is closer to 20% said Owen Chen, retail analyst at Cowen. Walmart also had to offer sales on its nonessential general merchandise in the quarter.\n\nAnd Walmart has always competed more on low prices, an advantage at a time that even middle and higher income shoppers are concerned about higher prices. Walmart executives reported it saw more business from those upper income households in the most recent quarter, a statement that cheered its investors.\n\nBut Chen said the numbers indicate that they did not get those higher income shoppers from Target’s traditional customers.\n\n“I think that Target’s [store] traffic numbers show it did a good job holding onto their customers,” he said. The number of customers making purchases at Target was up 2.7% compared to a year ago in the just-completed quarter. And that’s more than a 20% increase since the same period of 2019, ahead of the pandemic.\n\nTarget shares have underperformed some of its rivals, falling 28% so far this year, compared to only a 5% decline at Walmart. Schiffer said he wouldn’t be surprised to see the slide in Target shares continue, as he believes they are overvalued by as much as 30%. But he doesn’t think that means Target is badly positioned for the future.\n\n“I would stay the course,” he said. “The pace of growth during the pandemic was never going to be sustainable. They’ll still grow, just not as fast.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/28/business/black-friday-sales-numbers/index.html", "title": "Online Black Friday sales set a new record | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nOnline Black Friday sales in the United States topped a record-breaking $9.12 billion this year, according to Adobe Analytics, kicking off a solid start to the holiday shopping season despite inflation and other economic concerns.\n\nAdobe, which tracks sales on retailer websites, said that this year’s Black Friday online sales were 2.3% higher compared to last year, with electronics, smart home equipment, toys and exercise equipment providing the biggest boost. Some of that growth reflects higher prices and not higher volume, since the firm’s figures aren’t adjusted for inflation. But Adobe said sales would have been higher even if inflation were factored in.\n\nAmericans are dipping into their savings accounts and racking up debt on credit cards to make purchases, according to Claire Tassin, Morning Consult’s retail and e-commerce analyst.\n\n“We’re seeing a lot of people leaning on savings and debt to afford a lot of these purchases,” Tassin told Christine Romans, CNN Business’ chief business correspondent. “Even more than credit cards, we’re seeing a lot of people leaning on ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ services, which is sort of a newer form of debt that American consumers are really embracing.”\n\nBNPL installment plans were about 80% higher compared to the previous week, Adobe said. Some lawmakers and economists have criticized BNPL programs for their lack of transparency and regulatory oversight.\n\nOnline shopping is expected to remain strong through Cyber Monday. Adobe predicts that American shoppers spent more than $9.55 billion across Saturday and Sunday, and that Monday will be the “biggest online shopping day again” — growing more than 5% from last year, to $11.2 billion.\n\nAdobe previously reported that US shoppers spent a record $5.29 billion on Thanksgiving Day, up 2.9% from a year ago.\n\nThe holiday shopping season looks very different now than it once did. Instead of doorbuster deals on Black Friday, many retailers began their holiday sales in early fall. Amazon (AMZN) held a second Prime Day event in October this year, and Walmart, Target (TGT) and others held competing savings events.\n\nBy spreading out their holiday deals online, retailers have reduced the draw of Black Friday.\n\nBut shoppers are returning to many of their pre-pandemic routines and retailers expect a more typical holiday season than the last two years in the pandemic. Shoppers are once again expected to buy around key holidays like Black Friday and also buy later in the season, hoping to land deals.\n\nThis year, inflation has squeezed many shoppers’ budgets. Retailers say customers are pulling back on discretionary spending like furniture and electronics and are being more selective about what they buy.\n\nThe number of people giving gift cards and money is “up significantly over last year,” Tassin said, likely because it’s an easy way for shoppers to “to stay on budget because you can control the amount.”\n\nIn total, holiday sales will increase by up to 8% this year, the National Retail Federation projects.\n\n–CNN’s Kevin France and Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Jordan Valinsky"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/bargainista/2018/06/12/time-shop-jensen-beach-toys-r-us-drops-prices/693324002/", "title": "Time to shop!

Amazing Deals!! Time to fill up a cart!!,\" the Facebook post reads.\n\nSigns announcing the deeper discounts also were posted at the store near the Treasure Coast Square mall Monday nearly three months after Toys R Us said it would liquidate all of its U.S. stores.\n\nThere still are some hot toys left, including a handful of Lego sets, many board games, Barbie dolls, Star Wars toys, Nerf guns and more, with prices on most items now beating competitors like Amazon, Walmart and Target and rivaling Black Friday doorbuster deals.\n\nInventory is expected to go faster with the latest cuts.\n\n“The prices are getting good,” said Rita Hasselbach, of Port St. Lucie. \"I’m looking for games that I can donate to charities and shelters.”\n\nHasselbach, who said her first job 33 years ago was as a Toys R Us cashier, plans to visit the Jensen Beach store and other south Florida stores, a few more times before closing day.\n\n“It’s just to have the experience before the whole company closes down,” she said.\n\nMore:Forgot to use that last Toys R Us gift card?

The 14 items came to $137.15, a savings of $126.46.\n\n“We’re pretty much done — at least for this week,” Alejandro Benichio said.\n\nThe two became pros when the Babies R Us in Tradition liquidated earlier this year as part of the first wave of closings.\n\n“We had three carts full for what we spent today,” Fabio Benichio said of shopping during the final days. “At the end, Babies R Us was worth it.”\n\nTips to scoring a closeout deal\n\nCompare prices: The easiest way to do this is to scan product bar codes with Amazon, Target and Walmart apps.\n\nCheck the product thoroughly: Signs at stores say you cannot open the box but ask an employee before checking out that you need to make sure all parts, accessories, instructions, warranty information and other items are included.\n\nAll sales are final: If you end up buying something you don’t want, try recouping your money by selling it. Also make sure prices ring up at advertised discounts before paying.\n\nLook for special merchandise: It's common for liquidators to bring in special merchandise, often leftovers from other closed retailers. Look for signs at store entrances that explain how to spot this merchandise, which includes women slippers, tote bags and special toys not previously carried at stores.\n\nUse a credit card: This is a safety net if you experience any problems and may offer a way to contest the charge. However, you are shopping at your own risk.\n\nWarranties: Check warranty details and find out where repairs can be made.\n\nGo often: During the final days, markdowns will increase.

Here's why it's everywhere | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\n“Unexpected item in the bagging area.”\n\n“Please place item in the bag.”\n\n“Please wait for assistance.”\n\nIf you’ve encountered these irritating alerts at the self-checkout machine, you’re not alone.\n\nAccording to a survey last year of 1,000 shoppers, 67% said they’d experienced a failure at the self-checkout lane. Errors at the kiosks are so common that they have even spawned dozens of memes and TikTok videos.\n\n“We’re in 2022. One would expect the self-checkout experience to be flawless. We’re not there at all,” said Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia who has researched self-checkout.\n\nCustomers aren’t the only ones frustrated with the self-checkout experience. Stores have challenges with it, too.\n\nSelf-checkout is everywhere, despite its issues. George Frey/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe machines are expensive to install, often break down and can lead to customers purchasing fewer items. Stores also incur higher losses and more shoplifting at self-checkouts than at traditional checkout lanes with human cashiers.\n\nDespite the headaches, self-checkout is growing.\n\nIn 2020, 29% of transactions at food retailers were processed through self-checkout, up from 23% the year prior, according to the latest data from food industry association FMI.\n\nThis raises the question: why is this often problematic, unloved technology taking over retail?\n\nMaking customers do the work\n\nThe introduction of self-checkout machines in 1986 was part of a long history of stores transferring work from paid employees to unpaid customers, a practice that dates all the way back to Piggly Wiggly — the first self-service supermarket — in the early 1900s.\n\nInstead of clerks behind a counter gathering products for customers, Piggly Wiggly allowed shoppers to roam the aisles, pick items off the shelves and pay at the register. In exchange for doing more work, the model promised lower prices.\n\nShoppers at Piggly Wiggly, the first self-service supermarket, in 1918. Library of Congress/Corbis Historical/Getty Images\n\nSelf-checkout, however, was designed primarily to lower stores’ labor expenses. The system reduced cashier costs by as much as 66%, according to a 1988 article in the Miami Herald.\n\nThe first modern self-checkout system, which was patented by Florida company CheckRobot and installed at several Kroger stores, would be almost unrecognizable to shoppers today.\n\nCustomers scanned their items and put them on a conveyor belt. An employee at the other end of the belt bagged the groceries. Customers then took them to a central cashier area to pay.\n\nThe technology was heralded as a “revolution in the supermarket.” Shoppers “turn into their own grocery clerks as automated checkout machines shorten those long lines of carts and reduce markets’ personnel costs,” the Los Angeles Times said in 1987 review.\n\nBut self-checkout did not revolutionize the grocery store. Many customers balked at having to do more work in exchange for benefits that weren’t entirely clear.\n\nIt took a decade for Walmart (WMT) to test self checkout. Only in the early 2000s did the trend pick up more widely at supermarkets, which were looking to cut costs during the 2001 recession and faced stiff competition from emergent superstores and warehouse clubs.\n\nWalmart first tested self-checkout in the late 1990s. Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“The rationale was economics based, and not focused on the customer,” Charlebois said. “From the get go, customers detested them.”\n\nA 2003 Nielsen survey found that 52% of shoppers considered self checkout lanes to be “okay,” while 16% said they were “frustrating.” Thirty-two percent of shoppers called them “great.”\n\nThe mixed response led some grocery chains, including Costco (COST), Albertsons and others, to pull out the self-checkout machines they had installed in the mid-2000s.\n\n“Self-checkout lines get clogged as the customers needed to wait for store staff to assist with problems with bar codes, coupons, payment problems and other issues that invariably arise with many transactions,” grocery chain Big Y said in 2011 when it removed its machines.\n\nWalkaways\n\nThe move to self-checkout has created unintended consequences for stores as well.\n\nRetailers found that self-checkout stations were not autonomous and required regular maintenance and supervision, said Christopher Andrews, a sociologist at Drew University and author of “The Overworked Consumer: Self-Checkouts, Supermarkets and the Do-It-Yourself Economy.”\n\nStores have challenges with self-checkout, including higher levels of theft. John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe/Getty Images\n\nAlthough self-checkout counters eliminated some of the tasks of traditional cashiers, they still needed to be staffed and created a need for higher wage IT jobs, he said.\n\nSelf-checkout, Andrews added, “delivers none of what it promises.”\n\nIn the biggest headache for store owners, self-checkout leads to more losses due to error or theft than traditional cashiers.\n\n“If you had a retail store where 50% of transactions were through self checkout, losses would be 77% higher” than average, according to Adrian Beck, an emeritus professor at the University of Leicester in the UK who studies retail losses.\n\nCustomers make honest errors as well as intentionally steal at self-checkout machines.\n\nSome products have multiple barcodes or barcodes that don’t scan properly. Produce, including fruit and meat, typically needs to be weighed and manually entered into the system using a code. Customers may type in the wrong code by accident. Other times shoppers won’t hear the “beep” confirming an item has been scanned properly.\n\n“Consumers are not very good at scanning reliably,” Beck said. “Why should they be? They’re not trained.”\n\nOther customers take advantage of the lax oversight at self checkout aisles and have developed techniques for stealing. Common tactics include not scanning an item, swapping a cheaper item (bananas) for a more expensive one (steak), scanning counterfeit barcodes attached to their wrists or properly scanning everything and then walking out without paying.\n\nStores have tried to limit losses by tightening self-checkout security features, such as adding weight sensors. But additional anti-theft measures also lead to more frustrating “unexpected item in the bagging area” errors, requiring store employees to intervene.\n\n“There’s a delicate balance between security and customer convenience,” Beck said.\n\nSelf-checkout is here to stay\n\nDespite self-checkout’s many shortcomings for customers and store owners, the trend is only growing.\n\nWalmart (WMT), Kroger (KR) and Dollar General (DG) are piloting exclusively self-checkout stores. Costco and Albertsons have brought self-checkout back after removing it years ago. Amazon (AMZN) has taken the concept a step further with cashier-less Amazon (AMZN) Go stores.\n\nIt may simply be too late for stores to turn their back on self-checkout.\n\nAmazon has developed cashier-less Go stores. Other retailers are trying to jump in on the trend. Chona Kasinger/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nStores today are catering to shoppers who perceive self-checkout to be faster than traditional cashiers, even though there’s little evidence to support that. But, because customers are doing the work, rather than waiting in line, the experience can feel like it’s moving more quickly.\n\nStore owners have also seen competitors installing self-checkout and determined they don’t want to miss out.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This AI technology lets you skip the checkout line 02:22 - Source: CNN Business\n\n“It’s an arms race. If everyone else is doing it, you look like an idiot if you don’t have it,” said David D’Arezzo, a former executive at Dollar General, Wegmans and other retailers. “Once you let it out of the bag, it’s pretty difficult not to offer it anymore.”\n\nCovid-19 has also hastened the spread of self-checkout.\n\nDuring the pandemic, many customers opted for self-service to avoid close interactions with cashiers and baggers.

Mattel and Hasbro are among the major toy companies paying Tic Tac Toy to feature their products.\n\nAnd last month, a small company named Blip Toys launched Tic Tac Toy products – including Maya and Addy figurines – in Walmart and Target stores nationwide, a deal potentially worth millions of dollars.\n\n“We never could have imagined that our home-made videos would be so popular with so many children,” Jason Maxwell said.\n\nFunny thing is, the girls – Addy is 9, Maya’s 6 – don’t really know they’re famous.\n\n“Every time we go out and there are kids around their age, people come up and ask for pictures and autographs,” Lucy Maxwell said.\n\n“They get excited about that. I don’t think they fully grasp how well known they are.”\n\nAnd that’s a good thing as far as their parents are concerned.\n\nLucy and Jason Maxwell – who moved to Middle Tennessee a year ago – try to keep things as normal as possible for their daughters. They go to public school, for now, anyway.\n\nAddy and Maya play with other kids in their neighborhood, and they have friends at school and church, like other children. (But the Maxwells have a few more toys than most.)\n\nThe parents work full time on Tic Tac Toy, writing scripts, making deals with toy companies, interfacing with YouTube, shooting the episodes themselves, setting up appearances. Their daughters only do video shoots one day a week.\n\nEven on production days, Addy and Maya Maxwell seem like most any other sassy sisters.\n\nWhile her dad adjusted lighting during a recent shoot, Addy Maxwell grabbed a toy – a finger on a stick – and started playing with it.\n\n“This is a nice back scratcher!” she sang out.\n\nHer little sister grabbed a toy plastic gardening shovel and rubbed it across her cheek.\n\n“This is a great face scratcher!” Maya Maxwell said, smiling and looking to her big sister for approval.\n\nMonthly checks went from $150 to $800 to $1,600\n\nThree years ago, at age 3, it was Maya Maxwell who really got into the toy unboxing videos.\n\nHer dad was selling toys through Amazon at the time, and he quickly convinced his wife to try to make their own videos.\n\n“We already had a gazillion toys in the garage, and we figured we had a cellphone and toys, so let’s shoot video,” Lucy Maxwell said.\n\nThey applied for a YouTube channel in December 2015. Lucy Maxwell did the toy unboxings herself in the family’s master bedroom closet.\n\nHer charm and kid-friendly voice drew more and more viewers. The Maxwells started seeing monthly checks, first $150, climbing to about $800 the second month, which Jason Maxwell considered a great supplement to the couple’s income.\n\nLucy Maxwell decided to concentrate on \"Finding Dory\" toys the next month because the movie was coming out. Smart move. The next check was for $1,600.\n\n“That’s when I realized this could be full time,” Jason Maxwell said.\n\nTheir girls, meanwhile, were dying to get into the videos, and when their parents agreed, that was the game changer. Views went from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, growing exponentially each month from there.\n\nRight now, Tic Tac Toy videos get between 60 million to 115 million views each month, monster numbers that make the Maxwell family one of the country’s biggest toy influencers.\n\nThat’s drawn attention from toy manufacturers, and several approached the Maxwells about making a Tic Tac Toy toys line. The winner: Blip Toys, a smaller Minnesota-based company that produced micro collectible Squinkies a few years back.\n\nBlip Toys executive Jenna Harlander said Tic Tac Toy stands out among toy influencers because they use skits and scripted content, going beyond video testimonials or videos of girls playing with toys.\n\nAlso, Harlander added, “they have a very dedicated audience. And they have very authentic videos.”\n\nIn the first few weeks, Tic Tac Toy toys have been “disappearing off shelves,” Harlander said.\n\nVisiting sick children\n\nThe Maxwells also are looking to the future. In a few years, their daughters will be too old to play with toys, which leaves the family with questions.\n\n“Our objective is get to a place where they can do whatever they want. If they tell us tomorrow we’re done, so be it,” he said.\n\nFor now, as success skyrockets, Jason and Lucy Maxwell become more and more concerned about their daughters’ privacy. They’ve taken several steps to try to keep the girls safe.\n\nAnd the parents want the family’s work to have a community service piece to it.\n\nThe Maxwells have visited St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, a non-profit treating sick children regardless of the family’s ability to pay.\n\nMost patients there immediately recognize Addy and Maya Maxwell, their parents said, and the girls connect with those patients.\n\n“Our 9-year-old looks them in the eye, asks how old they are and thanks them for watching,” Lucy Maxwell said.\n\nJason Maxwell said the family’s mission goes beyond making money.\n\n“We strive to use our channel’s popularity to bring positive, family friendly messages and entertainment into people's homes,” he said.\n\n“The success is nice, but our greatest joy will continue to be the smiles we put on our fans’ faces.”\n\nReach Brad Schmitt at brad@tennessean.com or 615-259-8384 or on Twitter @bradschmitt.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/shopping/2021/10/27/black-friday-2021-guide-all-you-need-know-shopping-deals/8426778002/", "title": "Black Friday 2021 guide: All you need to know about shopping deals", "text": "No, you're not just imagining an onslaught of Black Friday-worthy bargains before Halloween. Say \"hello\" to Christmas in October.\n\nWith the shadow of supply chain shortages looming, with everything from electronics to appliances, toys, clothing and random items like glass in short supply, consumers are starting their holiday shopping earlier than ever and retailers are pushing hard to grab those sales, especially online.\n\n\"Concerns about delays and scarcity, as well as retailers' eagerness to drum up a month of hype, has created a perfect storm for an early and long Black Friday season in 2021,\" said shopping expert Kristen McGrath.\n\nGone are the days of waiting in line at 5 a.m. for doorbuster deals. Even before the pandemic, consumers had begun shifting to the internet as a convenient alternative to shopping in person for Black Friday bargains.\n\nIn 2019, Cyber Monday became the biggest online shopping day in U.S. history, hitting record online sales of over $9.4 billion. The National Retail Federation found that consumers plan to spend $648 on gifts and an additional $231 on non-gift holiday items such as food, candy decorations and cards in 2021. They also plan to spend another $118 on themselves for a grand total of $998.\n\nAnd most of those sales will be made online well before Black Friday. Adobe Analytics' annual holiday retail report predicts nearly 60% of U.S. holiday sales in 2021 will be placed online.\n\nTotal sales are expected to hit a whopping $207 billion between Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, setting a new record. Those numbers represent a 10% increase from 2020 when the pandemic made e-commerce an essential service.\n\nThis year \"is probably one of the most unusual holiday seasons we’ve seen,\" said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe. \"Especially after a year where consumers had no choice but to go online.\"\n\nSo what does this mean for consumers? If you haven't already started your holiday shopping, be prepared to be a little frustrated this year thanks to higher prices, sold-out favorites and shipping delays. Keep in mind if you have your eye on something very specific, 2021 is not the year to hold out for a lower price. It might not be available for long.\n\nHere's what to know about navigating the early holiday shopping season.\n\nYou may like:'It's a mess.' How global supply chain issues are going to impact holiday shopping in Louisville\n\nWhere can I find early Black Friday deals?\n\nIf you feel motivated to check items off your holiday list earlier than ever, you are not alone. According to the National Retail Federation, about half (49%) of holiday shoppers in 2021 will start browsing and buying before November — the highest percentage in the annual survey's history.\n\nAmong those shopping in October, 47% say they want to avoid the stress of last-minute shopping and another 36% do not want to miss out on key holiday items.\n\nRetailers are responding to changed shopping habits with earlier sales and a fluid shopping environment, which has been supercharged by the popularity of e-commerce during the pandemic.\n\nMassive chain retailers such as Target announced a three-day shopping event in October to allow consumers “a head start checking off their holiday lists.”\n\nOther big-box retailers are also jumping in early. Walmart is bringing back its month-long savings event dubbed “Black Friday Deals for Days,\" which offers deep discounts on specific days throughout the month of November. Each savings event begins online on Walmart.com and continues in stores.\n\nWhen Amazon announced its \"Epic Deals\" sale event in early October, the Courier Journal went hunting for early online examples of holiday treasures.\n\nWe found an $80 savings on a super fancy Oral-B iO Series 7 Electric Toothbrush the week before Halloween. It’s normally more than $250 but on Oct. 20, it was selling for $175 on Amazon. We also spotted the uber-popular Apple Airpods Pro for $179 — a savings of $70.\n\nAt Best Buy's early Black Friday, another example of early holiday savings includes the Samsung - 55\" Class The Frame Series LED 4K UHD Smart Tizen TV selling for $999.99. That's $500 off the television's original price.\n\nAnd it's not just major retailers offering early discounts and encouraging consumers to move up their holiday shopping. In Louisville, Kelly Estep, co-owner of Louisville's Carmichael's Bookstores, 1295 Bardstown Road and 2720 Frankfort Ave., is offering shoppers a way to jump-start their holiday spending.\n\nCarmichael's annual holiday gift guide will be available about 30 days ahead of its usual Thanksgiving week mailing and Estep has also ordered the items featured in the guide in bulk.\n\nYou may like:Here are 7 tips for Louisville shoppers to make the 2021 holiday retail season go smoothly\n\n\"We've placed our largest orders ever to try to stay ahead of this supply chain back up,\" she said. \"We say if you see something that you want, buy it now. There are no guarantees it will be in stock again before Christmas.\"\n\nOther local retailers like Quest Outdoors, 4600 Shelbyville Road in St. Matthews, plan in-store and online deals and won't necessarily wait for Black Friday or Small Business Saturday to launch those. Keep an eye on the social media pages of your favorite Louisville shopping destinations — like the Logan Street Market, shops on Frankfort Avenue and in downtown Louisville and the Louisville Independent Business Alliance — for deals that may pop up at any time.\n\nShopping early is sound advice across the board. Adobe Analytics, which follows online sales in real-time at 80 of the top 100 retailers in the U.S., including stores like Walmart, Target and Home Depot, reports out-of-stock notifications have risen by 172% in 2021.\n\nHow will this holiday shopping season differ from past years?\n\nThe National Retail Federation said consumers plan to spend almost $1,000 a year on holiday gifts, decor and more, which is about the same amount consumers spent last year. Electronics, toys and clothing are the top items on most consumer lists.\n\nSo, what's different? As many continue to work from home, consumers say they are less inclined to purchase gifts for co-workers than in 2019 before the pandemic.\n\nThe \"door-busting\" deals you are used to getting during the holidays are also expected to shrink. While there will still be promotions, overall price reductions are expected to be in the 5% to 25% range, while the historical average is 10% to 30%. For apparel specifically, the deepest discounts are expected to be around 15%. (In 2020, they were 20%.)\n\nWhat day should I shop if I want a deal?\n\nWhile seasonal discounts started in October in the 5%-15% range, as retailers look to manage supply chain challenges, the biggest discounts, 5%-25%, are still expected to happen around Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, this year on Nov. 25 and 29, respectively.\n\nYou may like:For Louisville business owners, the broken supply chain delivers nothing but bad news\n\nCertain categories, like electronics, are expected to have the deepest discounts on Cyber Monday or before, according to Adobe's research. The best days to shop for other holiday favorites will be Thanksgiving for toys, Black Friday for furniture/bedding and tools/home improvement, Small Business Saturday for electronics and appliances, Sunday, Nov. 28. for apparel and sporting goods, Cyber Monday for televisions, and Wednesday, Dec. 1 for computers.\n\nWhat are the hottest toys for the 2021 holiday?\n\nBack in August and September, Target, Walmart and Amazon released their hot toy lists and those are the toys you will want to snag as soon as possible.\n\n\"This is not the year to wait in hopes of a better deal,\" said retail and shopping expert Sara Skirboll. \"The most popular toys will be sold out by then. If you see what you are looking for, buy it.\"\n\nSome of the hot toy trends for 2021 are LOL Surprise dolls, LEGO, Star Wars Snackin’ Grogu and Fidget toys.\n\nWhy you should shop online, pick up locally\n\nNo one likes to pay high shipping fees and this year there is a chance your orders won't be shipped in time to arrive by the holidays.\n\nYou can keep down the costs and avoid the stress of a timely arrival when you opt for the curbside pickup at your local retailer. This is especially true if it's a bulky or heavy item, such as a TV or exercise equipment.\n\n“Over the last few years, consumers have demonstrated the desire to begin their holiday shopping earlier and earlier,” said Phil Rist, executive vice president of Prosper Strategy. “This year in particular, as retailers promote holiday inventory, they are taking advantage of additional offerings such as free shipping, buy online, pick up in-store and even expedited shipping to ensure they receive their gifts on time.”\n\nYou may like:Cracker Barrel announces its 2021 Thanksgiving to-go menu. Here's what you can order\n\nSomething else to consider this year is potential delivery delays. With the supply chain disruption and potentially slower shipping times, when you shop online, curbside pickup helps to ensure timely delivery of your gifts.\n\n\"That's a really important option to keep in mind when you buy online,” said Skirboll. “Curbside is a safe way for shoppers to handle their holiday shopping, stay out of stores, save on shipping costs and make certain you have the gift in time for the holidays.\"\n\nReach Kirby Adams at kadams@courier-journal.com or Twitter @kirbylouisville.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2022/12/27/gift-card-scams-check-balance/10950245002/", "title": "Gift card scams: How to avoid them, get money back if balance is zero", "text": "Susan Tompor\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nWould you ever dream of buying a beautiful gift, maybe a cashmere sweater or a diamond necklace, and have it gift-wrapped at the store, only to watch your special someone open the box and discover it was empty?\n\nUnfortunately, that's what's happening too often during the holidays and other times of the year for those who hand over gift cards. It's another way that criminals who run elaborate fraud rings steal dollars from consumers.\n\nWho would imagine that a gift card that you just received suddenly had little or no value? How could a gift card have been redeemed when it was sitting inside a holiday card or little gift card tin covered with bouncy penguins?\n\nAbout 26% of people reported being surprised to learn that they gave away or received a gift card with a zero balance, zip, not a dollar left on it, according to an AARP survey. That's up from 21% from a similar survey last year.\n\nDon't wait on returns:Many stores will have a stricter return policy this holiday season\n\nChristmas travel mess:Holiday travelers scramble to get home ahead of a winter storm with blizzard conditions\n\nHow do scammers use gift cards?\n\nWhile most gift cards work fine, some consumers are astounded when they go out to dinner or try to buy a new pair of running shoes only to see their gift card declined because of a zero balance after crooks mysteriously drained money off the card.\n\nThis past summer, Dina Pfeiffer was overwhelmed by her brother's generosity when he handed her son Niall two Visa gift cards with $200 each on them for his graduation from Clawson High School.\n\nThe next day, she decided to go online to review any rules or restrictions. She couldn't believe it when she spotted the balance on one card. She woke up her son who was still sleeping to ask him if he had already spent the money on that Visa card. He had not.\n\n\"There was a dollar left on it – out of $200 that should have been on it,\" Pfeiffer said.\n\nThe online information for viewing transactions on the Vanilla brand Visa card showed that one purchase was made at an supply store. \"It had been done in the wee early hours of the morning.\" The store wasn't in Michigan, she recalled.\n\nOddly, the $200 on the second gift card was fine. And so were two other gift cards her brother bought for another family member.\n\nNow, she'd tell anyone who gets a gift card to check out the balance quickly. See what you need to do to register the card – and look for any problems so you complain as early as possible.\n\nGift cards are still a go-to item\n\nGift cards remain a popular and often quick-and-easy gift.\n\nTotal spending on gift cards is expected to reach $28.6 billion in 2022, compared with $28.1 billion in 2021, according to the National Retail Federation. Holiday shoppers plan to buy three to four gift cards and spend around $50 a card on average.\n\nFrom Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday, gift cards were among the top gifts purchased and were bought by 27% of those surveyed, according to the National Retail Federation.\n\nOther top gifts: Clothing and accessories (bought by 50%); toys (31%); books, video games and other media (24%); food and candy (23%), and electronics (23%).\n\nAbout 60% of gift shoppers plan to buy a gift card, according to data from Numerator, a market research company. Amazon is the most popular gift card, followed by Target, gift cards for a variety of restaurants, Walmart, and then credit-card-style gift cards, like those with Visa and Mastercard brand logos.\n\nDon't wait on returns:Many stores will have a stricter return policy this holiday season\n\nHow can I avoid gift card scams?\n\nThe key with gift cards appears to be to use them soon – and act quickly if you run into trouble.\n\n\"Once you realize there's no money on it, you can try to reach out to the card issuer or the retailer where you purchased it,\" said Kathy Stokes, AARP’s director of fraud prevention for the Fraud Watch Network.\n\nBut it's not guaranteed that you'd have luck getting your money back. Sometimes, Stokes said, you have a better chance if you react quickly and contact the issuer soon once fraud is discovered. Much could depend, she said, on whom you connect with at customer service.\n\nWhen Pfeiffer spotted the problem, she immediately called the customer service number listed on the card. She explained the situation. She had a receipt. She noted that she lives in Michigan and the purchase was made out of state.\n\n\"It took a couple of months but they reissued a $200 gift card to us,\" she said.\n\n\"I really thought we were just out that money.\"\n\nCan I get my money back from a gift card scam?\n\nMaybe.\n\nSome of the rules regarding fraud are hazy. A disclosure from a U.S. Bank Gift Card agreement for a Mastercard gift card states you'd have \"zero liability\" but leaves some wiggle room in its limitations. \"You are generally protected from all liability for unauthorized transactions. However, if you do not tell us within 60 days of the date of the first transaction you believe to be unauthorized you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time.\"\n\nMastercard’s gift cards come with \"zero liability protection\" which keeps the recipient safe from unauthorized purchases if their card is lost or stolen after registration, Matthew Alcuri, vice president of product management for Mastercard North America, said in an emailed statement.\n\nAn increasing shift from physical to digital gift cards will further reduce the risk of third-party gift fraud, Alcuri said.\n\nWhen there is fraud consumers should contact the customer service number, he said, usually on the back of the card. A customer service representative may initiate a claim and an investigation. In some cases, he said, money can be put back on the card if the cardholder previously registered it upon activation.\n\nSome programs, he said, will not be able to assist cardholders if they wait more than 60 days to file a claim.\n\nHow much is that boxer puppy online?Beware of puppy scams that can ruin your Christmas\n\nStreaming, classes or cash:Try these digital gift ideas for last-minute holiday shopping\n\nKroger, which has various promotions during the year for building fuel points when you buy gift cards, said customers should first contact the issuer of a third-party card if the value is lost. If you bought a Starbucks card at Kroger, you'd go contact Starbucks. The third-party issuer typically decides how you might be reimbursed.\n\nA Kroger spokeswoman said the retailer will try to help customers if the situation isn't resolved. In that case, the Kroger customer can call 866-544-8062 or email paymentsupport@kroger.com.\n\nMany of us never think of keeping a receipt or paperwork for a gift card. It's never the wrong size, right?\n\nBut paperwork is needed because scams can happen. If you're giving a gift card, it doesn't hurt to include a receipt for it along with the card.\n\nThe scams are complex. The crooks grab stacks of gift cards off a shelf, without anyone noticing, and then remove the security tape on the back of each gift card. They either take photos or write down the card's secret activation code. And they can buy similar security tape to replace what they took off the card to make the card seem OK.\n\nThe crooks know how to work the system – even when they don't even have the card in their hands – to gain access to the money and wipe the card clean.\n\nWhere you buy gift cards matters\n\nThe bad actors are able to use technology to monitor when compromised cards are activated. Soon after money is loaded onto the card, the scammers will use the activation code.\n\n\"Once the card is activated and you've to the PIN for it, it's pretty much as good as cash,\" said Daniel Ayoub, senior director and analyst for Gartner, a technology research and consulting firm.\n\nAyoub said the criminals can make money in a variety of ways: Maybe they're selling the gift cards online and trading them in for cash value; maybe they're buying expensive goods that can later be resold on the black market; maybe they're buying items for themselves; maybe they're buying goods that are shipped to clients who later sell the item; some might even trade in the gift cards for cryptocurrency.\n\n\"It's becoming an increasing problem to the point where card issuers now are taking notice of it,\" he said.\n\nAyoub visited a store in suburban Detroit where he lives and noticed some gift cards on the rack are being packaged more carefully. \"It's not like the card is hanging from a little piece of rubbery glue like it used to,\" he said.\n\nBig box stores are encasing the card in more packaging to hide the important numbers on the back, he said, which could be a sign that retailers are trying to find ways to stop the fraud before it happens.\n\nHe's not a fan of just grabbing a gift card off a huge rack at the store. He'd suggest buying them online from the retailer or restaurant that is issuing the card and emailing that e-card to the person. If you want a plastic or paper card, you can buy that online, too. Amazon even sells its own gift cards online in an attractive holiday box.\n\nEven cards bought online, though, might face issues related to fraud.\n\n\"But then you have documented proof that you purchased it, that you had it activated, that it came to you,\" Ayoub said.\n\nQuite honestly, Ayoub says he prefers to give the old-fashioned way and often puts cash in an envelope. \"Why limit them to one store? Just give them cash,\" he said.\n\nThose who have bills to pay ahead might welcome the extra money.\n\nAnother key tip: Do not go online just anywhere to try to find out the value of your card, Ayoub said. Con artists can create third-party sites to capture your information. If you are going online to check a gift card's balance, make sure you're at a retailer or banking site that’s listed on the gift card itself, not something you find online.\n\nConsumer watchdogs warn that crooks have been known to create phony websites that advertise gift cards at a steep discount – but the crooks steal your financial information and possibly your money. You don't receive the gift card.\n\nOther gift card tips\n\nGift cards are typically not easily exchanged if the person you give it to really cannot use it. \"Card not redeemable for cash and cannot be used at ATMs,\" states the back of one $25 Mastercard gift card, which has a $3.95 activation fee.\n\nGift cards given as part of a promotion might have different rules, so pay attention to any restrictions.\n\nConsider the possibility that a store or restaurant could go out of business or shutter doors in your town.\n\nDo not give your card credentials to just anyone who asks for them.\n\nWhen possible, keep receipts for what you bought when using the gift card.\n\nMany times, of course, a gift card can be declined when there wasn't a scam. Maybe the card wasn't activated properly when it was bought. Maybe someone who gave you the card made a mistake and gave away a card they've already used. It can happen.\n\nI once ran into a problem when we bought gift cards – which were not compromised – and a clerk at the store had some trouble running the card. She said the card wasn't activated when it was. A store manager resolved the issue.\n\nIn some cases, the card – which could still have money on it — might be declined at the register when the dollar value being charged against the card is greater than the amount that was put on the card.\n\nTell a store clerk that you plan to use a gift card in advance of the purchase and explain how much is on the card. Some clerks are familiar with how to use a Mastercard or Visa gift card to make a transaction go smoothly, if you have to use a gift card and then add money to cover the purchase.\n\nShelley Hunter, who is known as the Gift Card Girlfriend and has a blog at Giftcards.com, said fraud isn't always involved if there is trouble making a purchase with a gift card.\n\n\"Stores are increasingly implementing security delays on some gift card activations for fraud prevention,\" she said. \"So talking to customer service should help sort out whether or not a scam is involved.\"\n\nContact Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

The NHTSA website also allows you to search for recalls based on your vehicle identification number, or VIN.\n\nHere are the vehicle recalls published by the NHTSA from June 15 through June 23:\n\nHonda recalls 1.2 million Odyssey, Pilot, Passport vehicles\n\nHonda is recalling 1,198,280 vehicles due to a visibility issue with the vehicle's rearview camera, according to the NHTSA.\n\nIn documents posted by the U.S. safety regulator, Honda said the rearview camera image may not appear on the dashboard screen in certain models. If that happens, regulators said, it can decrease driver visibility and increase the risk of a crash.\n\nRecalled vehicles:\n\n◾ 2018-2023 Honda Odyssey\n\n◾ 2019-2023 Honda Passport\n\n◾ 2019-2022 Honda Pilot\n\nHonda recall:Nearly 1.2M vehicles recalled because of rear view camera issue\n\nVolkswagen recalls 2023 Golf hatchbacks for strut issue\n\nVolkswagen is recalling 59 of its 2023 Golf R A8 and Golf GTI vehicles because during strut assembly, an issue may have caused a deformation of the strut mount. If the strut mount is deformed, it can lead to improper torque on one of the bolted connections on the right or left suspension strut mounting, which can increase the risk of a crash without warning, the company said in an NHTSA safety report.\n\nBased on vehicle driving tests, customers may not notice the issue, Volkswagen said. Dealers will inspect and replace the right and/or left suspension strut mountings, as necessary, free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed on Aug. 18.

This can reduce the driver's rear visibility and increase the risk of a crash and injury to people outside the vehicle, the company said in a safety report filed with NHTSA.\n\nVolkswagen dealers will update the software, free of charge.

There are, however, two deaths linked to the inflator problem, both with Honda in the U.S. in 2009. Honda's latest action is its sixth recall related to the air bags.\n\nThe inflator problem now is connected to propellant degraded by improper storage and exposure to moisture at Takata plants in Monclova, Mexico, and Moses Lake, Wash. The problem began as early as April 13, 2000, and was fixed by Nov. 1, 2002, according to a Takata report to safety officials last year.\n\nTakata said this month that it is studying whether vehicles used in high humidity areas have additional risk.\n\nNHTSA opened an investigation into the issue this month and says that it knows of six incidents of ruptured bags and three injuries in high-humidity Florida and Puerto Rico.\n\nA major factor in the size and expansion of the recalls has been admitted bad recordkeeping by Takata, which has made it difficult to identify the vehicles that might have the suspect inflators.\n\nIn the latest actions:\n\n• Honda recalled 1.02 million vehicles in North America and 2.03 million worldwide. They were built from 2000 through 2005 and include some models of Civic, CR-V, Odyssey and Element. With this expansion, air bag recalls have affected nearly 4 million of the company's older vehicles in North America.\n\n• Nissan recalled 755,000 vehicles worldwide built from 2001 through 2003, with about a quarter-million Pathfinder, Cube and Infiniti FX35 models in North America.\n\n-- Mazda recalled nearly 160,000 vehicles made from 2002 through 2004, with about 15,000 in North America, including RX-8 and early Mazda6 sedans.\n\n• Regional recalls in the U.S. by Honda, Nissan, Mazda, Toyota, BMW, Ford and Chrysler of certain vehicles in humid climates. NHTSA estimates that 1.5 million vehicles could be affected — the totals and lists of vehicles still were being compiled.\n\nAll were recalling vehicles Florida, Puerto Rico, Hawaii and the Virgin Islands. Honda said it would do so in 10 states and territories, adding Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas.\n\nNHTSA said it was continuing to investigate the problem.\n\nJapan-based Takata is a big supplier of air bags, seat belts, steering wheels and other parts.

Falling trees damaged homes and power lines in many places. North Carolina and Virginia, where hundreds of people had to be pulled from flooded homes, had the most customers without electricity, according to poweroutages.us.\n\nWith water levels were rising fast after up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain in just three days, the Tennessee Valley Authority said it began making controlled releases from some of its 49 dams in Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama and North Carolina. That could lead to more flooding downstream, so people who live near the water should be wary, said James Everett, senior manager of the utility's river forecast center in Knoxville, Tennessee.\n\nCreek water was still raging Friday in Alabama's Buck's Pocket State Park, where a person was seen inside a car as it disappeared under the surface two days earlier. Rangers walked for miles above the swollen creek but found no trace of the vehicle, so authorities sent up a state helicopter crew on Friday.\n\n\"The weather is better, but the water is not. The water is several feet higher than normal. It's extremely high and fast.\" Alabama Trooper Chuck Daniel told The Associated Press. \"Until that water slows down, nobody's going to get in that water.”\n\nIt took nearly three weeks last year to recover the body of an 18-year-old who was in a Jeep that got swept into the water in the same area.\n\nThe National Weather Service was using radar data and making damage assessments to confirm many reports of tornadoes touching down, including spots in Virginia and Maryland, near the nation's capital, meteorologist Isha Renta told the AP. In the Tampa, Florida, area, tornadoes blew a tree onto a mobile home, trapping an elderly woman, and toppled a construction crane along interstate 275.\n\nThe dangerous winds formed the leading edge of a band of weather that stretched from Tennessee to Maine on Friday, blowing snow into northern states. As much as 4 inches (10 centimeters) fell overnight in Ohio, contributing to car accidents in the Akron area, and the Ohio Department of Transportation urged people to make room for nearly 1,300 state crews working to improve the icy conditions.\n\nUp to 8 inches (20 centimeters) of snow was predicted in West Virginia, and Gov.

The tornado warnings started in Wausau and then were essentially continuous until the storms finally moved out of Wisconsin after 2 a.m.\n\nThe extent of the damage across the state was emerging after daybreak on Thursday and resulted in Gov. Tony Evers declaring a state of emergency.\n\nThe potent line of thunderstorms arrived early Thursday in metro Milwaukee, generating numerous tornado warnings as well as high winds and near-constant lightning.\n\nThe tornado warnings were in effect at 1:35 a.m., including for Milwaukee County.\n\nThe storms arrived in Milwaukee after causing widespread damage across the state. More than 80,000 electricity customers were without power across the state just before 2 a.m.\n\nAs the storms approached Milwaukee, they prompted numerous tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings.\n\nAt 1:13 a.m., the National Weather Service issued tornado warnings for Waukesha and Jefferson counties.\n\n\"At 1:13 a.m., tornado producing storms were located along a line extending from near Lac La Belle to 6 miles east of Johnson Creek to near Jefferson, moving east at 50 mph,\" according to the weather service.\n\nResidents in the area were being advised to take shelter.\n\nAt 7:45 a.m., Milwaukee utility We Energies was reporting about 35,700 customers without power.\n\nMadison-based Alliant Energy was reporting 35,000 customers in Wisconsin were without power just before 2 a.m.\n\nElectricity utility Wisconsin Public Service was reporting more than 22,000 customers were without power as of 11:30 p.m. Wednesday across its service territory in central and northeast Wisconsin.\n\nNumerous reports of trees and power lines being blown down were received from areas of northern and central Wisconsin.\n\nAt 12:42 a.m., a tornado warning was issued for southeastern Columbia County, northeastern Dane County, northwestern Jefferson County and southwestern Dodge County until 1:15 a.m. At 12:42 a.m., severe thunderstorms capable of producing tornadoes and extensive straight-line wind damage were located near Columbus, moving southeast at 40 mph, according to the weather service.\n\nAt 12:26 a.m. on Thursday, the weather service issued a tornado warning for eastern Columbia County and western Dodge County until 1:15 a.m. At 12:25 a.m., severe thunderstorms capable of producing tornadoes and extensive straight-line wind damage were located along a line extending from near Cambria to near Rio, moving southeast at 40 mph, according to the weather service.\n\nAt 11:55 p.m., severe thunderstorm warnings were issued for Washington and Dodge counties.\n\nAt 11:41 p.m., a tornado warning was issued for Fond du Lac County after weather service radar detected a severe thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado 7 miles northeast of Ripon.\n\nWarm, humid air fueled storms\n\nCalling it \"a particularly dangerous situation,\" the National Weather Service placed nearly the entire state of Wisconsin, including the Milwaukee metro area, under a severe thunderstorm watch around 7:20 p.m. on Wednesday.

The threats detailed in those early forecasts intensified on Wednesday afternoon and evening, prompting meteorologists to declare the situation dangerous.\n\n\"Strong/severe thunderstorms are forecast to increase in coverage over the next 1 to 2 hours, evolving into a large, well-organized cluster/possible derecho while moving rapidly southeastward,\" according to a statement from the weather service Storm Prediction Center issued at 7:25 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nAs late afternoon stretched into evening on Wednesday, forecasters continued to voice their concern about the potential for a significant severe weather outbreak in Wisconsin.\n\n\"This is a particularly dangerous situation,\" the Storm Prediction Center said. It's a declaration that the organization uses rarely and only when there are significant threats to life and property posed by severe weather.\n\nThe atmospheric conditions across the state and Milwaukee metro were primed for severe storms, with warm humid air enveloping much of the state, Chris Stumpf, a weather service meteorologist in Sullivan, said Wednesday night.\n\n\"The forecast remains on track,\" Stumpf said around 8 p.m. on Wednesday. \"We're still really concerned.\"\n\n\"With the amount of instability that we have and the wind profile, it looks pretty hazardous,\" Stumpf added.\n\nCampers evacuated\n\nAnyone who was camping, whether at a state park, private campground or the EAA AirVenture in Oshkosh, was asked to have a plan to seek shelter or already be seeking shelter as the storms approached.\n\nAt the EAA, organizers evacuated as many of the campers as possible, first into the EAA museum and later into other shelters in Oshkosh.\n\nWhile Oshkosh was hit, the worst of the storm hit Ripon, just west of Oshkosh. Trees and power lines were reported down throughout Ripon. Ripon Police asked that residents all remain in their homes and not head outside. Power was out throughout the city.\n\nPolice in Hartford in Washington County, also evacuated campers in the area, according to emergency radio traffic provided by Broadcastify.\n\nUnusually high risk\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the Storm Prediction Center upgraded the risk for much of central and eastern Wisconsin, including metro Milwaukee, to a \"moderate\" risk, which is its second-highest category.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant risk for severe thunderstorms across the state...,\" Mark Gehring, a meteorologist with the weather service in Sullivan, said early Wednesday morning. \"The main threat is damaging winds. We could get some winds that are 75 to 80 mph. We think there's the real possibility of that as this tracks across the state.\"\n\nIn an update on Wednesday afternoon, meteorologists said the forecast remained on track for severe storms to develop in Wisconsin as evening approached.\n\n\"It's pretty rare that we get to that level of severe risk,\" said Tim Halbach, warning coordination meteorologist with the weather service in Sullivan. \"We don't go to this level very often.\"\n\nComputer forecast models were \"very consistent the past few days leading up to today and nothing has really backed us off,\" the forecast, Halbach said Wednesday afternoon. \"It's more of a matter of when and where this is going to end up happening.\"\n\nWhile significant winds were the main concern, there was a risk for tornadoes, too. Numerous tornado warnings ultimately were issued across the state.\n\nThe weather service called in extra staff for the day and evening.\n\n\"This is our top priority,\" Gehring said early Wednesday. \"Everything gets ramped up. We're trying to fine-tune everything.\"\n\n\"This is the highest risk in the country (Wednesday), this moderate risk in Wisconsin,\" Gehring added.\n\nThe weather service was urging everyone in the state to have a way to receive weather warnings.\n\n\"Review your severe weather safety procedures for the possibility of dangerous weather today,\" the Storm Prediction Center said in a statement.\n\nUtility was preparing for storms\n\nMilwaukee-based utility We Energies already had crews working around the clock to restore power that was knocked out by storms this week in its northern Wisconsin and the UP of Michigan service territories, Amy Jahns, a spokeswoman for the utility, said via email early Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, crews were preparing for the possibility of severe storms later Wednesday across the areas the utility serves including the Milwaukee metro area, Jahns said.\n\n\"We are ... closely monitoring the weather and chance for severe storms in southeastern Wisconsin and the Fox Valley. We are coordinating extra staffing and preparing equipment like poles, wires and transformers that we may need if strong storms hit.\"\n\nWe Energies has a number of power outage safety tips and is reminding everyone to stay at least 25 feet away from downed power lines.\n\nContact Joe Taschler at (414) 224-2554 or jtaschler@gannett.com.

Michael Guest toured the devastation from a helicopter Tuesday morning.\n\n“Many of us just flew over the damage, and I’ve seen a lot of tornadoes over the last 20 years, and what I will tell you is the magnitude of the damage here is catastrophic,” Reeves said. “It’s catastrophic because not only were the winds up in the 200 mile an hour range – it’s catastrophic because it stayed on the ground for what looks like 40 or 50 miles.\"\n\nThe aftermath:Storms and tornadoes killed 12 in Mississippi. Here's what we know about them.\n\n'We took a pretty hard punch':Reeves speaks in Soso after air tour of tornado damage\n\nThe storm damage\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, power had been restored to about 35,000 Mississippians, but more than 37,000 Mississippians were still without power, according to the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency.\n\nMore than 500 houses, mobile homes and apartments were damaged or destroyed, according to initial damage reports to MEMA, though that number could rise. At least 30 counties across the state have reported damage reports to MEMA.\n\nOfficials at the National Weather Service said Monday night that at least one of the tornadoes registered as an EF-4 tornado, with winds up to 170 mph. The path of that tornado went through Jefferson Davis County near Bassfield, where a pool hall was obliterated, leaving only the foundation and killing four people inside.\n\nCars were flipped. A mattress hanged from a tree. A roof was ripped off a home in Soso, but a cake sitting on the kitchen counter was reportedly left undisturbed. A tornado obliterated every part of home in Moss except the concrete safe room, sparing the family of four huddled inside.\n\nIn Prentiss, Rosie Hall stood among the devastation that used to be home she shared with her son, two grandchildren and a great grandchild. Dogs ran back and forth through the rubble, occasionally lowering their noses to the ground to smell the scattered laundry and rubble.\n\nHall said the family was trapped at one point but managed to make it out. She credits God for their survival.\n\n\"It's just gone, ain't nothing left,\" she said. \"I'm just glad I'm still alive though because we could have been gone. God is so good. He spared our lives.\"\n\nHer great grandson was \"screaming and hollering\" throughout the ordeal. He still cries out in his sleep.\n\nDown the road, Nawasa Buckley and her family were outside when they saw the funnel. Then it touched down.\n\n\"I told them to run,\" Buckley said.\n\nShe got everyone in the bathtub—seven total—and then ran into the closet and put a basket on her head before she heard glass shattering. She estimates the storm was around them \"for about two minutes.\"\n\nWhen it stopped, she emerged to \"devastation.\"\n\n\"We can put the material stuff back together but the lives, you know you only get one life so I'm just glad that everyone was safe and sound,\" she said. \"We can replace all the other stuff but it was something to see. I don't ever want to experience it again in my life.\"\n\nPreliminary reports from radar indicated there were 13 tornadoes in Mississippi. The National Weather Service is expected to release more reports about those tornadoes in the coming days.\n\nThe recovery effort\n\nHundreds of Mississippians have been displaced due to the storms. Normally, the Red Cross would house people in shelters, but the coronavirus pandemic has made traditional shelters a possible breeding ground for infection.\n\nJohn McFarland, executive director of the Southeast Mississippi chapter of the American Red Cross, said the organization is trying to place families in hotels and use shelters as a last resort.\n\nCounties initially reported more than 150 had been displaced, according to MEMA.\n\nEllen Ciurczak contributed to this report.

Price/USA Today Network\n\nThe damage stemmed from a line of storms that raced across eastern Oklahoma and western Arkansas and intensified throughout the day. By late afternoon, at least 38 million people were still at risk for life-threatening extreme weather, largely across the Southeast.\n\nSevere thunderstorms were expected later in the day and into the night over parts of the lower Mississippi Valley and the mid-South, into the central Gulf Coast states, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) said.\n\nThe rainfall could lead to flash flooding over parts of Louisiana and Mississippi, the Weather Prediction Center said.\n\nAs the storms rolled through the region, more than 140,000 customers were left without power Wednesday evening, with the majority in Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nThe greatest concern is for tornadoes\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, tornadoes were the greatest concern from the storms – with the possibility of twisters of at least an EF-2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale – as well as damaging wind gusts, the SPC said. EF-2 tornadoes can cause considerable damage, ripping roofs from houses and destroying mobile homes.\n\nThe SPC issued at least seven tornado watches Wednesday. Those that remained active included a tornado watch issued until 10 p.m. CDT for parts of Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri and Indiana, an area that includes the town of Mayfield, Kentucky that was devastated by a tornado in December.\n\nThere was also a tornado watch across central Tennessee and much of Alabama until 1 a.m. CDT Thursday and another watch for southeast Mississippi, and parts of southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle until 4 a.m. CDT.\n\nGet ahead of the storm, sign up for weekly updates from CNN meteorologists\n\nA moderate risk -- level 4 of 5 – for severe storms covered Mississippi and included portions of Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama and Tennessee, and Florida. In addition to Jackson, cities like Memphis in Tennessee, Baton Rouge in Louisiana, and Mobile and Montgomery in Alabama are all in this risk category.\n\nThe bulk of the most vigorous activity is expected to become severe as it quickly crosses the Mississippi River into Mississippi, western Tennessee and Kentucky, the SPC said.\n\n“We are expecting a long duration severe weather event today with damaging winds even before the storms arrive and destructive winds during the main event,” Logan Poole, a meteorologist with the NWS in Jackson, told CNN.\n\nThe extreme weather comes in a month that has seen near-record tornado activity in the US. One difference between this week’s storms and last week’s deadly tornado outbreak is how much more widespread the risk area is, how intense the winds will be and the longevity of damaging winds.\n\nHigh winds fuel brush fire in Tennessee\n\nAll across the South, winds are forecast to be strong ahead of the main line of storms which will have even stronger winds. Even before the storms approach, there could be damaging wind gusts of nearly 60 mph out of the south.\n\nResidents in Sevier County, Tennessee, were placed under mandatory evacuation due to a brush fire fueled by high winds in Wears Valley/Shagbark areas, the county Emergency Management Agency said.\n\nThe blaze had torched at least 250 acres and at least one person has been injured, the agency said Wednesday afternoon.\n\nHigh wind warnings are in effect ahead of the line of storms stretching from northwestern Tennessee to the Louisiana Gulf Coast.\n\n“This will certainly be widespread and likely to affect a larger portion of our population,” the NWS in Jackson wrote. “Winds up to 80 mph, in addition to the gradient wind ahead of the line, will pose risks of downed trees and powerlines and result in power outages.\n\nAs the line of storm approaches, “Supercells are likely, with strong tornadoes possible,” the SPC said, “as well as particularly damaging outflow surges.”\n\nThe storm threat will continue through the evening hours and overnight, with storms hitting places like New Orleans, which is at a severe risk level 3 of 5, just about sunset.\n\nAs the storms make their way east across Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, they will begin to lose some of their potency before reaching places like Atlanta in the early morning hours.\n\nA near-record March for tornadoes\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, the SPC had tallied at least 187 preliminary reports of tornadoes in March. This is more than 233% of normal and just four shy of the highest March tornado count in recorded history (191 in March 2021), according to CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri.\n\nOn average, March averages about 80 tornadoes across the country.\n\nThough the March record may be broken in a few hours with Wednesday’s storms, another tornado record has been standing far longer. The nation is currently in the midst of its longest stretch without an EF-5 tornado, says Javaheri. “You would have to go back nearly a decade to May 20, 2013, for the last EF-5 in the country.”\n\nSince that time, at least 11,322 tornadoes have touched down in the US, without a single one reaching the EF-5 threshold (200+ mph).\n\n“The streak nearly came to an end in December 2021, amid the historic month that saw over 200 tornado reports,” Javaheri adds. “The December 10 western Kentucky tornado was rated an EF-4, with peak winds estimated around 190 mph, just 10 mph shy of an EF-5 tornado.”\n\n“This is a streak we’ll hope to continue today.”", "authors": ["Judson Jones Gregory Lemos Caroll Alvarado Eric Levenson", "Judson Jones", "Gregory Lemos", "Caroll Alvarado", "Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2018/03/09/who-pays-utility-repairs-storm-damage-you-do-through-higher-ny-nyseg-rates/399191002/", "title": "Who pays for utility repairs from storms? You do, with higher rates", "text": "You may think those bottles of water and dry ice being distributed by New York State Electric & Gas Corp. at emergency relief centers during power interruptions are free.\n\nThe goods are free to those utility customers without power, but someone's got to eventually foot the bill for emergency repairs across New York State as well as pay for all those cases of bottled water — it's you.\n\nEvery one of the the NYSEG's approximate 886,000 electric customers will shell out future cash for repairs from the past week's two storms that left thousands in Putnam, Westchester and Sullivan County in the dark for extended periods, some up to a week.\n\nRatepayers eventually cover the costs for line crew overtime. Additionally, customers will assume to costs for transporting, accommodating, feeding and paying supplemental teams from Maine, Connecticut and Canada brought in to restore power after nearly 2,000 downed lines were reported from the March 2 storm and the subsequent dumping five days later on March 7. At the peak, NYSEG's parent, Avangrid, said it had 2,000 people responding to storm damage.\n\nWatch for the costs to be included in the utility's next rate case coming due in two years, but probably submitted for consideration to the Public Service Commission in mid-2019. Most, if not all, reasonable costs are recoverable, based on past practice by the New York PSC.\n\nThere's precedence for storm recovery costs. A five-year electric rate plan approved by the PSC in 2015 allowed NYSEG to recover $260 million in damage and recovery costs incurred from 2010 through 2015.\n\nAbout half of the cost was incurred during Tropical Storm Lee and Hurricane Irene in 2011, and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Recovery of repair costs for these super storms was spread out over 10 years, according to the rate plan.\n\nPast practice doesn't necessarily spell out future policy, Public Service Commission representatives said.\n\nFor instance, the amount that Rochester Electric & Gas Corp., also a unit of Avangrid, will be allowed to recover in repair costs from a 2017 wind storm is under dispute and subject to extensive proceedings. In the storm’s aftermath, more than 100,000 RG&E customers lost power, and three days after the storm more than 50,000 customers remained without power.\n\nMore:AT RISK: NY reviews electric, gas free-choice program; consumers ended up paying more\n\nMore:State regulator: We’re ready for Indian Point closure\n\nMore:'Smart meter' signals new era for utility customers\n\nState regulators define a major storm under which costs are recoverable as “a period of adverse weather during which service interruptions affect at least 10 percent of customers or more” and/or “results in customers being without electric service for more than 24 hours in an operating district,\" the public service commission said in past rulings.\n\nAt one point following the March 2 storm, NYSEG had a dozen distribution centers from Allegheny County to Westchester County — four alone in Sullivan County — to hand our dry ice and bottled water to the thousands of customers who, three days after the storm, were still in the dark.\n\nOn Tuesday, 32,000 customers in Westchester and Putnam counties were still awaiting for power to be restored. By Wednesday, that number had been reduced to slightly more than 7,000, only to swell again to 35,000 after Wednesday's dump.\n\nThe second storm dumped another 10 to16 inches of heavy, wet snow in the Hudson Valley causing additional damage to the electrical system. As of late morning Thursday, approximately 8,300 customers were without power from the storm the week before in addition to the 30,300 who were without power from this latest wintery blast, NYSEG representatives said.\n\nBy Friday the number of NYSEG customers without power in Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess counties had been trimmed to about 11,000. On Saturday, NYSEG announced power had been restored to virtually all home in Putnam, Westchester and Sullivan counties.\n\n“These back-to-back storms have resulted in more substantial damage, but we will not stop working for our customers who are depending on us to get their power back on,” said Carl A. Taylor, NYSEG president and chief executive officer. “The second storm is a setback, but it will not lessen our resolve to push forward to make sure our communities and customers are safe and power is restored as quickly as possible.”\n\nFrustrations mounted this week as thousands of downstate customers remained without service. An apparent delayed response is coming under criticism by some powerful politicians, and it hasn't escaped the notice of those in charge of setting rates and determining how much NYSEG will be able to recover in repair bills.\n\n\"This is a severe and prolonged outage, with many thousands of New Yorkers still out, hundreds of impassable roads, and failures of coordination and communications,\" said James Denn, PSC spokesman. \"Once restoration is complete, we will undertake a thorough and intense public review, because this response and restoration has clearly not met expectations of New Yorkers.\"\n\nDenn said that as part of the rate review process, utility response will be examined. The adequacy of emergency response plans will also be reviewed. If deemed sub-par by PSC staff, utilities could be penalized with some of the repair costs exempt from ratepayer reimbursement.\n\nWestchester County Executive George Latimer on Wednesday called for the resignations of the heads of Con Edison and NYSEG.\n\n\"Both Con Edison and NYSEG have fumbled the recovery effort and we, as county residents, can no longer stand by and accept this,\" Latimer said in a post on the county government's Facebook page.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo continued to criticize the response by various electricity providers, saying during a Wednesday morning conference call that \"I'm not satisfied... The PSC (state Public Service Commission) will do a full review of their response. If we find that their response was not satisfactory, I will make sure that the PSC levies as severe a sanction as the PSC can.\"\n\nCuomo said that as of Wednesday there were 5,000 utility workers the ground statewide — counting NYSEG , Orange and Rockland, ConEd and itinerant crews — doing power restoration.\n\nOn Wednesday, PSC Chair John Rhodes said during the conference call that 26,000 electricity customers statewide were still without power from Friday's storm. He said 90 percent of those customers live in Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess and Sullivan counties, which was hardest hit by this past Wednesday's weather.\n\nUSA Today Network New York reporter Matt Spillane contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/03/04/alabama-tornado-aftermath-workers-search-missing/3053369002/", "title": "Alabama tornado aftermath: Workers search for missing, assess ...", "text": "First responders in southeast Alabama hunted for survivors Monday after a devastating tornado killed at least 23 people, smashed homes and toppled power lines and a massive steel cell tower.\n\nMississippi Gov.

The second thread looks at a series of recent disruptions of LGBTQ+ events across the nation by domestic extremists.\n\nThe FBI and the NC State Bureau are assisting in the investigation.\n\ninvestigators have no evidence connecting the North Carolina attacks to a drag event at the theater in the same county, but the timing of two events are being considered in context with the growing tensions and armed confrontations around similar LBGTQ+ events across the country, the sources told CNN.\n\nIn the past two years, anti-government groups began using online forums to urge followers to attack critical infrastructure, including the power grid. They have posted documents and even instructions outlining vulnerabilities and suggesting the use of high-powered rifles.\n\nOne 14-page guide obtained by CNN cited as an example the 2013 sniper attack on a high voltage substation at the edge of Silicon Valley that destroyed 17 transformers and cost Pacific Gas and Electric $15 million in repairs.\n\nIn that case, the shooter fired more than 100 bullets in about 20 minutes, disappearing a minute before police arrived. The case remains unsolved.\n\nWhile investigators haven’t found a rifle in the North Carolina shootings, the casings still could offer critical evidence. A law enforcement source told CNN that the caliber of the bullets in the California incident is different from those used in North Carolina.\n\nInvestigators are taking into consideration that the timing of Moore County shootings – 7 p.m. on a Saturday night – coincided with the time a drag performance sponsored by the local LBGTQ+ community began, according to the sources. Audience members used their phone flashlights to light the stage for one last song, but after that the performance couldn’t continue due to the power outage, according to Sandhills PRIDE.\n\nOfficials have said the gunfire, which left much of the county without electricity for days, were a “malicious” and “intentional” attack. The two substations are about 10 miles apart.\n\nNo suspects in the outages have been announced.\n\nSheriff Ronnie Fields has said whoever fired at the substations “knew exactly what they were doing.” No group “has stepped up to acknowledge or accept they’re the ones who (did) it,” the sheriff said Sunday.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning there were 35,000 customers without power, but that number had decreased to 1,200 by the time a 4 p.m. news conference began, according to Duke Energy spokesperson Jeff Brooks. A few hours later the company’s website showed zero outages in the area.\n\nGiven the information, county officials said a nightly curfew will end for good at 5 a.m. Thursday.\n\nShell casings and bullets offer clues\n\nBullets recovered from the sites, and the brass shell casings found a short distance away, are the few pieces of physical evidence that investigators have.\n\nBecause of the heat generated in a high-powered rifle’s chamber during rapid fire, fingerprints are burned away – and nearly impossible to recover from spent casings. Still, the brass may offer valuable clues.\n\nInvestigators can enter the casings into the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network, a database from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The database records three-dimensional images of shell casings and can match them to any other shell casings that may have been fired by the same gun at another crime scene or to the gun if the weapon is recovered.\n\nThe spot where the casings were found can give investigators a way to pinpoint the firing positions. Knowing where the shooter fired from could lead to discoveries such as shoe prints and tire tracks.\n\nResidents head to shelter for hot food and showers\n\nFor now, schools are closed through Thursday, many stores and restaurants are shut, homes are without heating or running refrigerators, drivers are traversing intersections with no traffic lights.\n\nNakasha Jackson, who came to the shelter to pick up some hot food, said the outage has been difficult with her 1-year-old child. CNN\n\nA Red Cross-run emergency shelter was set up at the Moore County Sports Complex to help provide shelter, food, showers and other services to people impacted. It will remain as a shelter through noon on Thursday, officials said.\n\nNakasha Jackson, who came to the shelter to pick up some hot food, said the outage has been difficult for her 1-year-old child.\n\n“No lights, no power, can’t really do nothing. The kid is scared of the dark,” she told CNN.\n\nJackson said sometimes she has to travel up to an hour one way to buy food. “It’s ridiculous. It should never have been done,” Jackson said.\n\nResidents who rely on electricity-powered medical equipment have also seen their lives upended. One woman told CNN she came to the shelter because she had no power for her CPAP machine at night.\n\nAfter two days of sleeping without it, she said she began to feel ill and came into the shelter for help.\n\nOthers have sought shelter fearing for their safety as they struggled to keep their homes warm.\n\n“It’s different. It’s kind of hard to sleep, you know. But at the end of the day, I’d rather be somewhere where it’s warm, where we have food, where we’re taken care of than to be somewhere it’s freezing cold,” said Amber Sampson.\n\nOn top of having to stay at the shelter, Sampson hasn’t been able to work since Sunday after her employer also lost power – an issue that could end up costing her hundreds of dollars.\n\nAuthorities have expressed anger over the attack, with Carol Haney, mayor of Southern Pines – a town of about 15,900 residents that completely lost power – calling it a cruel and selfish act.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper voiced concern over businesses and residents in nursing homes.\n\n“When we look at all the money that’s being lost by businesses here at Christmastime, when we look at threats to people in nursing homes having lost power, hospitals having to run off generators and not being able to do certain kinds of operations at this point – all of those are deep concerns here, and we can’t let this happen,” the Democrat told CNN on Tuesday.\n\n“This was a malicious, criminal attack on the entire community.”", "authors": ["John Miller Steve Almasy Whitney Wild", "John Miller", "Steve Almasy", "Whitney Wild"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}]}

And even though Biden is deeply unpopular in many of those states two years later, Democratic incumbents and challengers amassed massive sums of money that allowed them to run on their own brands throughout the summer while their Republican opponents limped out of contentious primaries. This is where the nitty-gritty of campaign spending makes a difference: Candidates get more favorable advertising rates than the super PACs and outside groups that have had to come in and make up the difference for some Donald Trump-backed GOP nominees with lackluster fundraising.\n\nMore on key Senate races ‘We can walk and chew gum at the same time’: Cheri Beasley vows to fight inflation and for abortion rights 7 takeaways from the Colorado Senate debate GOP New Hampshire Senate nominee repeats hoax that kids are using litter boxes in schools Schumer: Georgia Senate race ‘going downhill’ but Pennsylvania debate ‘didn’t hurt us too much’ See Senate race ratings by Inside Elections\n\nDemocrats’ challenge in the final days of the midterm elections is getting their base to turn out and persuading those remaining undecided voters – especially those who voted for Biden two years ago but are dissatisfied with him today – to stick with the president’s party. That’ll be easier said than done. Just 41% of US adults approved of Biden’s performance, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released Wednesday. And Republican voters expressed greater engagement with this year’s midterms than Democrats across multiple questions gauging voters’ likelihood to vote.\n\nThat president’s party often loses seats in Congress during the first midterms of a new administration, and lower Democratic enthusiasm would suggest we’re on track for history to repeat itself. The enthusiasm gap (favoring Republicans by 14 points) is similar to the partisan gap in CNN’s polling from 2010, when Republicans gained seats in the first midterm of Barack Obama’s presidency.\n\nThis year’s key issues for voters would also seem to advantage Republicans. More than half of likely voters in CNN’s new poll identified the economy and inflation – a central component of GOP attack ads – as the most important factor in their vote for Congress. The Supreme Court’s late June ruling overturning Roe v. Wade injected uncertainty into the political landscape, with a majority of Americans disapproving of that decision. But only 15% of likely voters in CNN’s poll said abortion was the most important issue determining their vote. More broadly, nearly three-quarters of Americans think things in the country are going badly.\n\nAnd yet, what’s keeping this cycle interesting is the unpredictability and relative messiness of the Senate map – with races sometimes moving in different directions. Despite Republicans picking up momentum across the country, for example, the seat most likely to flip is a GOP-held seat, not a Democratic-held one. Pennsylvania – where GOP Sen. Pat Toomey is retiring – tops the list, as it has since CNN first started compiling these rankings at the start of the cycle in early 2021. Rankings are based on CNN’s reporting, fundraising and advertising data, and polling, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. And two other GOP-held open seats – North Carolina and Ohio – have proved to be surprisingly competitive for Democrats this year, even if they’re much less likely to flip.\n\nBut the race that could matter more than any other is a seat Democrats flipped last year. If neither candidate receives a majority of the vote in Georgia on November 8, the race will advance to a December 6 runoff. And if Senate control hinges on the Peach State – as it did in 2020 – we’ll have to wait another month to learn which party holds the majority.\n\n1. Pennsylvania\n\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\n\nSarah Silbiger/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe Keystone State rounds out the cycle where it began – as the Senate seat most likely to flip. The race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey represents Democrats’ best pickup opportunity. Biden narrowly won the commonwealth in 2020, after Trump had carried it in 2016, making it a pivotal battleground for the midterms and the next presidential contest.\n\nThe Senate race has tightened as Republican Mehmet Oz consolidates support from Republicans after making it through a nasty primary with Trump’s endorsement. Democrat John Fetterman, the current lieutenant governor, held a slim lead over the celebrity surgeon in a recent New York Times/Siena poll. But that was notably conducted in large part before their late October debate, when the visible effects of Fetterman’s May stroke raised some concern, even among his supporters, that he might not be able to win over undecided voters. Still, only 3% of voters in a new Monmouth University poll said the debate had caused them to reconsider their choice in the race. And 39% of registered voters in a Fox News survey taken after the debate said they were concerned Fetterman wasn’t healthy enough to do the job effectively – a 5-point increase since that question was asked in September – compared with 58% who weren’t concerned.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have seized on Oz’s comments during the debate that the discussion over abortion should be left to “women, doctors, local political leaders,” with Senate Majority PAC using it to link him to GOP gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano, who’s trailing in his race. Fetterman stood at 50% to Oz’s 46% among likely voters in a CNN Poll of Polls, which averages four most recent surveys that meet CNN’s standards, including the Times/Siena poll and others conducted mostly before the debate.\n\nThe good news for Fetterman, even as his own negatives have gone up, is that Oz’s negatives remain relatively high – 17% of Republicans and more than half of independents had an unfavorable view of the celebrity surgeon in the Times survey – and the Democrat continues to outpace Oz on the question of which candidate understands the concerns of everyday Pennsylvanians, according to the Monmouth survey. Biden and former President Barack Obama are rallying with Fetterman in Philadelphia on the final weekend before Election Day – the rare competitive Senate battleground that’s playing host to the president.\n\n2. Nevada\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\n\nCNN\n\nThe supremacy of voters’ economic concerns is bad news for Democrats in Nevada. The state has been hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and average gas prices remain near $5 a gallon. Furthermore, Nevada’s transient population makes it tough for first-term incumbents to establish a strong brand. That’s complicating Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s key task – winning over voters dissatisfied with Biden and the direction of the country. Her favorability rating stood at 39% among likely voters in the New York Times/Siena poll (the same as GOP challenger Adam Laxalt’s), which was about on par with the percentage of likely voters who approved of Biden’s job performance. However, her share of the vote in recent polling is above Biden’s approval rating, giving Democrats confidence that she has a path to overperform the president. Cortez Masto and Laxalt were tied at 47% in the Times poll – a similar finding to a recent CBS poll and CNN polling from early October, which showed no clear leader.\n\nRepublicans are blaming Cortez Masto, the first Latina senator, for a litany of concerns – from higher inflation to “chaos at the border” – all with the message that she’s a “rubber stamp” for Biden. Cortez Masto and Democrats have attacked Laxalt over abortion – although he says he does not support a national ban and has pointed out that the right to an abortion is settled law in Nevada. They’ve also tried tying Laxalt – a former state attorney general and the grandson of the former governor and senator with the same last name – to Trump and highlighted his efforts, as Trump’s Nevada campaign co-chair, in the filing of lawsuits related to the 2020 election. But perhaps in a recognition that economic concerns outweigh abortion or democracy as issues that are important to voters, Democrats – including Obama, who rallied the party faithful in Nevada on Tuesday – have tried to flip the script on higher gas prices, blaming them on corporations and tying Laxalt to “big oil.”\n\n3. Georgia\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\n\nMegan Varner/Getty Images\n\nNo race has seen more drama in the last month than Georgia, where Trump’s hand-picked candidate, Herschel Walker, is facing allegations from two women that he urged them to get abortions, which he has denied. But the accusations, which have played into the Democratic narrative about the retired football star being a hypocrite, don’t seem to have done much damage to his standing in the race against Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who’s seeking a full six-year term. After at first steering clear of the allegations, Warnock used them in a recent ad against his opponent. But the New York Times/Siena poll showed no clear leader, which was a tightening from a Quinnipiac University survey conducted after news of the first allegation that had given Warnock a 7-point lead.\n\nWarnock continues to enjoy stronger favorability ratings than his GOP challenger, whose image is underwater. The Democrat’s favorability ratings are also higher than Biden’s approval – a potentially significant separation in a state the president flipped by less than half a point in 2020. But the gubernatorial race in Georgia could help carry Walker across the finish line with GOP Gov. Brian Kemp appearing to have the advantage over Democrat Stacey Abrams in a rematch of their 2018 contest. Where that finish line is, though, remains to be seen – if neither Senate nominee surpasses 50% of the vote on November 8, the top two finishers will advance to a December 6 runoff.\n\n4. Wisconsin\n\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\n\nLeigh VogelPool/Getty Images\n\nAs the only Republican senator running for reelection in a state Biden won in 2020, Sen. Ron Johnson is the chamber’s most vulnerable GOP incumbent. A Marquette University Law School poll released Wednesday showed no clear leader in the race between Johnson and Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes – similar to a CNN survey from mid October – which is comparable to the close governor’s race.\n\nThe race seems to have moved in the GOP’s favor since the summer when Barnes emerged from the August primary relatively unscathed after his opponents had dropped out beforehand. Republicans sought to define Barnes after Labor Day with a blitz of advertising, particularly hitting him over crime and his past support for redirecting funding from police. (Barnes has called it a “lie” that he supports defunding the police.) Democrats have tried to turn the crime argument back on Johnson by pointing to some of the statements he has made downplaying the January 6 insurrection and trying to use Johnson’s past remarks on Social Security against him.\n\nBiden only carried Wisconsin by less than half a point in 2020, so it’s still a tough state, with an even tougher national political environment for Barnes. Independents, for example, were breaking for Johnson in the Marquette survey (53% to 46% among likely voters), and 68% of registered voters said they were “very concerned” about an inflation – an issue that favors Republicans. Barnes was polling at 48% in the Marquette poll, slightly lower than Biden’s percentage of the Wisconsin vote in 2020. That’s one reason why Obama, who received a higher 53% in the state in 2012 while winning a second term, rallied with Barnes in the final weeks of the campaign.\n\n5. Arizona\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\n\nCourtney Pedroza/Getty Images\n\nThe race between Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly and Republican Blake Masters has also narrowed – a Fox News poll released Tuesday shows no clear leader with Masters picking up support from Republicans. But Kelly, who won a 2020 special election and is running for a full six-year term, has proved a much more resilient Democrat to tarnish than some of the GOP’s other targets. That has kept this race – in a purple state Biden won by less than half a point – more competitive for Democrats than it probably should be given the national environment. (A CNN poll and the Times/Siena poll both gave him a 6-point lead over Masters.) A retired astronaut with impressive fundraising totals, Kelly has tried to distance himself from his party on immigration – as he did during their debate last month – and largely had the airwaves to himself to sell that message.\n\nMasters is getting some late help from other Republican spenders – including Trump’s super PAC and the political arm of the Club for Growth – after the Senate Leadership Fund had to cut its spending here to divert resources to other states. A venture capitalist who has the backing of both Trump and Peter Thiel, Masters tried to dial back some of his more extreme rhetoric on abortion and election denialism after winning the GOP primary. But the former president recently urged him to go “stronger” on his unfounded election fraud claims.\n\nMasters may have gotten an assist Tuesday, when the libertarian nominee, who was pulling at 1% in the Times survey, dropped out. But with voters already voting, it’s unclear how much of a difference the move will actually make. This is another state where the governor’s race could affect the Senate contest since Republican gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake is considered a much stronger candidate than Masters. Given their struggles in this race so far, though, Republicans will interpret Masters doing well here on election night as a sign that the environment is even better for them than they had expected.\n\n6. North Carolina\n\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\n\nDemetrius Freeman/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Richard Burr looks closer than many observers had expected at the beginning of the cycle. Democrat Cheri Beasley and Republican Rep. Ted Budd were tied among registered voters in a late October Marist poll. (Budd, a third-term congressman, had a small edge among definite voters.) North Carolina is accustomed to close elections – Trump only won it by about 1 point in 2020. But Democrats haven’t won a Senate race here since 2008, the last time the state went blue at the presidential level.\n\nBudd, Trump’s first nonincumbent Senate endorsee of the cycle, has been outraised by Beasley. And even though he’s benefited from outside spending that attacks Beasley on crime, the Democrat’s campaign has been able to take advantage of the more favorable advertising rates that candidates get. A former state Supreme Court chief justice, who would be the state’s first Black senator, Beasley has been trying to run as the outsider. “Washington politicians like Ted Budd aren’t listening,” she says in a recent spot about high prices and stagnant wages. Her ads don’t mention that she’s a Democrat – or that her party holds power in Washington. Besides hitting Budd on abortion, Democrats are also trying to make an economic counterargumen. Budd “voted against lowering drug prices for people like us,” one senior says in a Beasley ad, referring to a provision in Democrats’ health care, climate and tax package that allows Medicare to negotiate certain prescription drug prices.\n\nDemocrats have long hoped that Beasley could help energize parts of their base that don’t usually turn out in midterms – like rural Black voters and young voters. But national Democrats haven’t been able to pour as much money into this race given the number of incumbents they’re defending. Still, the Senate Majority PAC did up its spending in the state this fall, suggesting Democrats think Beasley has a shot.\n\n7. New Hampshire\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\n\nErin Scott/Getty Images\n\nThis race’s position on the rankings continues to be one of the biggest surprises of the 2022 cycle. Democrats and Republicans alike expected this contest to jump near the top of the list if and when GOP Gov. Chris Sununu got into the race. But he decided late last year not to run. Instead, retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, who had raised virtually no money, is taking on first-term Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan after making it through the September primary. That doesn’t mean this isn’t still a competitive race – especially given the national environment. But Bolduc cuts a very different profile than Sununu, a Trump critic who supports abortion rights, in a state that Biden carried by 7 points and that’s been trending blue in federal elections.\n\nAnd yet, Sununu, who previously called Bolduc a “conspiracy theory type candidate,” is now supporting the GOP nominee, who’s repeatedly pushed election falsehoods. (Asked about that choice, the governor told CNN this week that no one should be a “one-issue voter.”) Bolduc also recently picked up an endorsement from Trump. Despite some Republicans coming to his side, both the Senate Leadership Fund and the National Republican Senatorial Committee have cut funding here as they’ve diverted resources to higher-priority races. That’s accentuated the resource disparity between Bolduc, who had raised about $1 million at of the end of the Federal Election Commission’s pre-general reporting period on October 19, compared with Hassan’s $39 million.\n\nStill, Hassan’s closing ad, in which she talks about “standing up to the president – whatever it takes,” speaks to her vulnerability this year given the national environment, which even her massive fundraising advantage may not be able to erase.\n\n8. Ohio\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\n\nTING SHEN/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nThe race for retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman’s seat wasn’t supposed to be competitive – Trump won the state by 8 points and, with the exception of Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown’s success, it’s been trending red over the past decade. Given those fundamentals and the national mood, Republicans still very much have the edge here, which is why it’s in the second half of this list.\n\nBut there’s no denying that Trump’s hand-picked Republican candidate, J.D. Vance, struggled to raise money and consolidate GOP support after a divisive primary. The diversion of Republican super PAC spending from more reliable battlegrounds to shore him up in Ohio speaks to his weaknesses as a candidate. After Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan had the airwaves mostly to himself over the summer, the Senate Leadership Fund has been trying to poke holes in his moderate image by tying him to Biden. Still, Ryan’s vast fundraising advantage has allowed him to run plenty of ads in which he says he has sided with Trump on trade and takes on his own party.\n\nThe candidates were essentially tied in a late October Marist survey, which likely speaks to this particular matchup given that the same survey showed the gubernatorial contest not even close. But Republicans are confident, given the makeup of the state, that the remaining undecided voters in the Senate race, who made up 8% of registered voters in that Marist survey, will break late for Vance. It’s probably no accident that Trump is holding a rally in Ohio the day before Election Day.\n\n9. Florida\n\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\n\nDREW ANGERER/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nFlorida voted for Trump by a smaller margin than Ohio, but for the second month in a row, the Sunshine State has ranked lower on the list of seats most likely to flip. That’s because Republican Sen. Marco Rubio – although he’s been outraised by a strong challenger in Democratic Rep. Val Demings – is a two-term incumbent who seems to be doing everything he needs to do to win in this environment.\n\nDemings, a former Orlando police chief, has leaned heavily into her law enforcement experience. “The Senate could use a cop on the beat,” she says in one spot in which she explains her opposition to defunding the police. But that hasn’t been enough to blunt Republican attacks that she’s prioritized Washington over the police by siding with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\n10. Colorado\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Michael Bennet\n\nDEMETRIUS FREEMAN/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Sen. Michael Bennet is used to close races – he won his last reelection in 2016 by just 6 points against a GOP challenger whom the national party had abandoned. He’s facing a much more formidable opponent this time in businessman Joe O’Dea, who has expressed support for abortion in the early stages of pregnancy and has criticized Trump. He told CNN’s Dana Bash last month that he would “actively” campaign against the former president, which inspired Trump to lash out at the GOP nominee.\n\nThat might actually help O’Dea in a state Biden carried by more than 13 points in 2020. And in a sign of the GOP’s brewing divisions ahead of 2024, the race has become a point of divergence between Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has backed O’Dea. The Senate Leadership Fund gave $1.25 million to a pro-O’Dea super PAC – the same amount it gave to a group supporting Republican challenger Tiffany Smiley in Washington state. But Biden’s smaller margin in Colorado (he won Washington by 19 points) makes it more likely to flip if the national environment gives Republicans a chance to pick up a seat in a state seen as safely blue.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2023/03/10/iowa-poll-presidential-candidates-2024-donald-trump-favorability-approval-rating-amid-caucus-season/69982668007/", "title": "How Republicans view Trump, 2024 presidential candidates: Iowa Poll", "text": "© Copyright 2023, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.\n\nMany Iowa Republicans remain committed to Donald Trump, but the former president is seeing his support erode as campaigning begins to heat up ahead of Iowa’s 2024 presidential caucuses, a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows.\n\nTrump, who launched a third White House bid late last year, has seen his favorability numbers in the first-in-the-nation caucus state steadily decline among Republicans since they peaked in September 2021.\n\nAnd the percentage of Iowa Republicans who say they would “definitely” vote for him if he were the nominee in 2024 has plummeted by more than 20 percentage points since June 2021.\n\n“Iowa is where the competition starts,” said pollster J. Ann Selzer, who conducted the Iowa Poll. “And someone who has already held the office and who won the state twice would be presumed to be the front-runner, and I don't know that we can say that at this point.\n\n“There's nothing locked in about Iowa for Donald Trump.”\n\nTrump’s favorability numbers put him about on par with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who made his first trip to Iowa Friday as he weighs a likely presidential run. And they’re substantially higher than those for declared challenger Nikki Haley and likely candidate Mike Pence.\n\nThe data represent an early test of Iowans’ feelings toward the growing crop of candidates as they begin the task of vetting and winnowing the field during a busy caucus year.\n\nThe poll of 805 Iowans, including 257 self-identified Republicans, was conducted March 5 through 8 by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nQuestions asked only of Republicans have a margin of error of plus or minus 6.1 percentage points.\n\nPoll respondent Steven Goodenough, a 72-year-old Republican from Guthrie Center, said he voted for Trump in 2020 and would consider voting for him again in 2024, but he’s interested in hearing from the other candidates already making their way to Iowa.\n\nHe said Trump may be his current top choice “by default,” but he’s interested in seeing how he conducts himself on the campaign trail.\n\n“I’m not a dyed-in-the-wool Trump fan,” Goodenough said. “I am probably more middle of the road with him. So, I'm looking for other options. But you know, I probably would vote for him again if he is the candidate.”\n\nMore:Iowa or bust: Why the 2024 Iowa caucuses will be key to deciding GOP nominee\n\nGoodenough said he likes that Trump brought “balance” to the judiciary, both in the Supreme Court and in other federal appointments, and he thought Trump’s policies helped stimulate the economy.\n\nBut he expressed disappointment that Trump is already bringing a combative personality to the campaign trail, as evidenced by his attacks on candidates such as Haley and DeSantis.\n\n\"I think that was evident during the presidency that he might have gotten further if he was not so combative,\" Goodenough said.\n\nFewer say they would 'definitely' vote for Donald Trump in 2024 general election\n\nIf Trump were to become the GOP nominee for president, 74% of Iowa Republicans say they would likely vote for him in the 2024 general election.\n\nThat includes 47% who say they would definitely vote for him and 27% who say they would probably vote for him.\n\nJust 9% said they would be unlikely to vote for him, with 5% saying they would probably not vote for him and 4% saying they definitely would not vote for him.\n\nAnother 12% say they “might or might not” vote for him, 3% say they wouldn’t vote at all and 2% were unsure.\n\nMore:Ron DeSantis makes his Iowa caucuses debut with stops March 10 in Des Moines, Davenport\n\nThat’s a substantial shift from June 2021 when the Iowa Poll last tested the question.\n\nThen, 69% of Iowa Republicans said they would definitely vote for Trump in the 2024 general election — 22 percentage points more than say the same today — and another 15% said they would probably do so.\n\nIn 2021, just 4% said they would be unlikely to vote for Trump, with 2% saying they probably would not and 2% saying they definitely would not.\n\nAnother 10% said they “might or might not” for him, 1% wouldn’t vote at all and 1% were unsure.\n\nThe question is relevant in a caucus cycle where Republicans are already beginning to discuss “electability” and who would be best positioned to take on Democratic President Joe Biden, who is expected to seek a second term.\n\nDan Leinen, a 64-year-old poll respondent from Woodburn, said he is a Republican, but his views on Trump changed drastically following the Jan. 6th U.S. Capitol riot.\n\nLeinen said he didn’t like how Trump dealt with his election defeat and wouldn’t consider voting for him again — even if he were the Republican nominee for president.\n\n“I don’t think we need anybody like that in the White House,” he said.\n\nKendall Kirschbaum, a 21-year-old poll respondent and Republican from Lake Mills, said she thinks Trump was a strong president who successfully tackled key issues while in office, including promoting a strong economy, keeping down inflation, achieving low unemployment rates and strengthening security on the border, while also being good to farmers and small businesses.\n\nShe said she recognizes his social media presence may have been offensive to some, but she said it didn’t really bother her.\n\n“Growing up, I really just heard of him as not necessarily a political figure but more as a celebrity,” she said.\n\nBut after hearing Trump speak on policy, she said she realized “I really liked this guy.

We answer your top questions.\n\nDonald Trump’s favorability falls; Ron DeSantis starts out strong\n\nA September 2021 Iowa Poll showed Trump was viewed favorably by 91% of Iowa Republicans. That fell to 83% in October 2022, and now it is at 80%.\n\nAt the same time, Trump’s unfavorable numbers have climbed, with the percentage of Iowa Republicans viewing him unfavorably more than doubling — from 7% in 2021 to 18% now.\n\nAmong independent Iowans, 35% view Trump favorably — down from 40% in October 2022 — and 63% view him unfavorably.\n\nTrump is set to return to the state March 13 for a rally in Davenport, just days after DeSantis makes his Iowa debut in the same city. Trump is expected to address education policy in his first Iowa campaign stop of the 2024 election cycle.\n\nThe numbers follow a tumultuous couple of years for the former president, who is facing multiple investigations related to his involvement in efforts to subvert the results of the 2020 presidential election, his handling of classified documents and his past business practices.\n\nThose investigations continue as other declared and potential presidential contenders begin making their appeals to Iowans.\n\nMore:Donald Trump to make first Iowa trip of 2024 presidential campaign\n\nDeSantis, who is attending public events with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds in Davenport and Des Moines Friday, is viewed favorably by 74% of Iowa Republicans — just behind Trump’s 80%. He is viewed unfavorably by 6% of Iowa Republicans, with 20% saying they aren’t sure.\n\nIndependent Iowans are nearly evenly split on DeSantis, with 35% viewing him favorably, 33% viewing him unfavorably and 32% saying they’re not sure.\n\nDeSantis has emerged in national polling as the early favorite to challenge Trump.\n\nA Real Clear Politics rolling average of polling shows 45% of respondents say Trump should be the Republican nominee for president, while 29% say it should be DeSantis. No other potential candidate is currently polling in double digits.\n\nPoll respondent Alex Barry, a 31-year-old Cedar Rapids Republican, said he views Trump “very favorably” and would vote for him in a general election, but he worries that Trump, 76, would fail to gain necessary support.\n\nBarry said he thinks DeSantis would have a better chance of beating Biden.\n\nBarry called DeSantis, 44, a “younger, fresh face” and praised his “strong stance on parental rights.”\n\n“I liked what he did with COVID — he stayed open and didn’t restrict everybody,” he said. “… He just seems like the right guy to me.”\n\nGrowing share have unfavorable view of Mike Pence; Nikki Haley relatively unknown\n\nPence, who served as Trump’s vice president and was previously the governor of Indiana, is viewed favorably by 66% of Iowa Republicans.\n\nPence has the highest unfavorable rating of the four politicians tested among Iowa Republicans at 26%. Another 7% are not sure.\n\nThose numbers have changed substantially since June 2020, when the Register last tested Republican Iowans’ attitudes of Pence. Then, 86% viewed him favorably, while just 7% viewed him unfavorably and 7% were not sure.\n\nSince then, many of Trump’s most loyal followers have turned on the former vice president after he refused to help Trump overturn the results of the 2020 election on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThat day, some who rioted at the U.S. Capitol erected makeshift gallows and chanted “hang Mike Pence” as others flooded the halls of Congress in search of the vice president.\n\nJust 58% of Iowa evangelicals — the group consistently showing the most support for Republicans and seemingly one of Pence’s most natural constituencies — say they have favorable feelings toward him.\n\nGoodenough, the poll respondent from Guthrie Center, is a pastor and said he was disappointed with Pence’s handling of the 2020 election and wished the vice president had done more to investigate allegations of fraud.\n\n“I think he's a good man,” Goodenough said. “But I'm not sure he's really qualified for the job of the president.”\n\nPence has traveled to Iowa multiple times since losing the 2020 election with Trump, and he’s been well-received at events around the state. He’s scheduled to return March 18 for a foreign policy forum alongside U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan.\n\nMore:Mike Pence rails in Iowa against 'radical gender ideology' as caucuses start to simmer\n\nHaley, the former governor of South Carolina and Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, was also in Iowa this week, holding events in Council Bluffs, Nevada and Des Moines.\n\nShe announced her campaign in February and immediately traveled to Iowa where she has been advocating for a “new generation” of leaders, urging Iowans to look forward, rather than back at Trump.\n\nAccording to the poll, she is viewed favorably by 53% of Iowa Republicans and unfavorably by 8%. However, she is much less known than the others, with 40% saying they don’t know enough about her to form an opinion.\n\nKirschbaum, the Lake Mills Republican and Trump supporter, a 21-year-old poll respondent and Republican from Lake Mills, said she needs to learn more about Haley before coming to a strong opinion about her, but she likes that Haley is in the field of candidates.\n\n“I really like how she provides that kind of strong, independent female portrayal,” Kirschbaum said. “I feel like that’s a really good example, especially for the Republican party.”\n\nMore:Nikki Haley is carving a lane in the Iowa caucuses as Donald Trump looms. Here's how:\n\nStill, Kirschbaum said she currently prefers Trump for the GOP nomination, followed by DeSantis.\n\nAlthough favorability numbers don’t necessarily indicate how candidates will perform in a head-to-head race, Selzer said they are a helpful indication of name identification and visibility and help set the stage for the campaigning that will come.\n\nThey also show the “intensity” of Iowa Republicans’ feelings about the candidates, she said.\n\nFor DeSantis, a plurality of 42% rate their feelings as “very favorable.” Trump also has a plurality of Iowa Republicans saying they feel “very favorably” about him, at 44%.\n\nBut for Pence and Haley, the plurality say they feel slightly less intense, rating their feelings as “mostly favorable.” For Pence, it is 49% and for Haley it is 37%.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register.

Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted households with randomly selected landline and cell phone numbers supplied by Dynata. Interviews were administered in English. Responses were adjusted by age, sex and congressional district to reflect the general population based on recent American Community Survey estimates.\n\nQuestions based on the sample of 805 Iowa adults have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents — such as by gender or age — have a larger margin of error.\n\nRepublishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit to The Des Moines Register and Mediacom is prohibited.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/02/politics/cnn-poll-georgia-senate-runoff-election/index.html", "title": "CNN Poll: Warnock holds a narrow edge over Walker in final ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn the final undecided Senate contest of 2022, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia holds a narrow lead over Republican challenger Herschel Walker among those likely to vote in a runoff election Tuesday, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS.\n\nThe survey shows that Walker faces widespread questions about his honesty and suffers from a negative favorability rating, while nearly half of those who back him say their vote is more about opposition to Warnock than support for Walker. Voters’ modestly more positive views of Warnock and a firmly committed base of supporters appear to boost the incumbent in the new poll.\n\nOverall, 52% of likely voters say they plan to support Warnock in Tuesday’s runoff and 48% pick Walker. Partisans on both sides are deeply entrenched, with nearly all Democrats (99%) behind Warnock and 95% of Republicans backing Walker. Independents break in Warnock’s favor, 61% to 36%, but make up a relatively small slice of likely voters, 17%, compared with 24% in a CNN exit poll of voters in the first round of this contest last month. (Warnock finished narrowly ahead of Walker in November but without the majority of the vote needed to avoid a runoff.)\n\nWhite voters remain broadly behind Walker ahead of Tuesday’s election: 69% support him, with 30% backing Warnock, in the new poll, while Black voters likely to cast a ballot next week are near unanimous in their support for the Democrat (96% Warnock to 3% Walker). Those divides are similar to the racial split in the 2021 runoff during which Warnock initially won his seat, when 93% of Black voters backed him while 71% of White voters favored his Republican opponent, then-Sen. Kelly Loeffler, according to CNN’s exit poll.\n\nThere is also a wide age gap in the upcoming contest, with voters under 35 sharply behind Warnock (74% to 25%), while those 65 or older break in Walker’s favor by 26 points (63% to 37%). Younger White voters are far more closely divided than older White voters (52% Walker to 48% Warnock among White voters younger than 45, while 75% of White voters age 45 or older say they back Walker). Support for Warnock is about the same among younger and older Black voters.\n\nWhite voters without college degrees are heavily behind Walker – 83% support him – while White voters with four-year degrees are closely divided, 51% Walker to 47% Warnock. White women with degrees tilt toward Warnock (53% Warnock to 44% for Walker) while White men with degrees break in Walker’s favor (58% Walker to 42% Warnock).\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Obama mocks Herschel Walker's vampire remark 01:42 - Source: CNN\n\nWarnock’s supporters broadly say they are casting ballots to support their candidate (83%) rather than to oppose Walker (17%), but it’s a more mixed bag among those who favor Walker (52% say their vote is more to support him, 47% to oppose Warnock).\n\nThat difference, the poll suggests, could be a factor in driving turnout. The runoff between Warnock and Walker is the only race on the ballot in most of the state, and voters who say they are voting more to support their Senate candidate than to oppose the other candidate express deeper motivation to vote – 79% of likely voters who say their vote is to support their chosen candidate are extremely motivated to vote, compared with 69% among those who say their vote is more one of opposition.\n\nThere are several indications in the poll that negative views of Walker are also a potential drag on his chances.\n\nBeyond the gap in affirmative support behind each man’s candidacy, there’s a big difference in views of Warnock and Walker personally. Views of Warnock tilt narrowly positive, with 50% of likely voters holding a favorable opinion, 45% unfavorable, while far more likely Georgia voters have a negative view of Walker (52%) than a positive one (39%).\n\nA broad majority say that Walker is not honest and trustworthy – 59% feel that way, including 18% of those who say they plan to vote for the Republican. A narrow majority, 52%, say they believe Warnock is honest and trustworthy, and views of his honesty are closely connected to vote choice (93% of Warnock’s own voters say he is honest, 91% of Walker’s voters say Warnock is not honest). Walker holds a wide lead among those likely voters who say that neither Walker nor Warnock are honest and trustworthy (they break 71% Walker to 27% Warnock).\n\nLikely voters are more apt to see Warnock than Walker as well qualified to serve as senator (52% say that describes Warnock better, 27% Walker, and 21% say neither is well qualified); as someone who would represent Georgia effectively in Congress (50% Warnock, 41% Walker, 8% neither); as someone who has good judgment (50% Warnock, 33% Walker, 17% neither); and as someone who has the right priorities (49% Warnock, 43% Walker, 7% neither). Among the roughly 1 in 5 likely voters who say neither candidate is well-qualified, about 9 in 10 back Walker (92%), and he wins roughly 8 in 10 of those who say neither candidate has good judgment (82% say they’ll vote for Walker).\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why Georgia's GOP lieutenant governor left runoff polling station without voting for either candidate 01:33 - Source: CNN\n\nStill, when asked directly whether their votes are more about the candidates’ positions on the issues or their character and integrity, 57% of likely voters say issues are the more important factor and 42% choose character and integrity. Among those saying that the issues are their main concern, 64% are voting for Walker; on the character side, 74% favor Warnock.\n\nNearly half of likely voters say the economy is their top issue in this runoff contest (46%), while 17% say voting rights and election integrity is their top concern and 16% choose abortion as their top issue. Walker holds 68% support among economy-focused voters, while broad majorities of both those who called elections and voting their top issue (79%) and those most concerned with abortion (78%) back Warnock.\n\nAbout half of likely voters (48%) say that abortion should be legal under most circumstances (37% say it should be legal under any circumstances, 11% in most circumstances), while 52% say it ought to be either legal in only a few circumstances (39%) or illegal in all circumstances (13%). The issue sharply divides the electorate: Those voters who feel it should be legal in most or all cases break heavily in Warnock’s favor, 88% for him vs. 11% for Walker, while those who say it should be legal in only a few cases or illegal in all circumstances are broadly behind Walker – 82% back him to 18% who favor Warnock.\n\nAfter an extended legal battle over when early voting would be allowed in the run-up to the runoff election, likely Georgia voters largely feel that the rules around voting in the runoff were about right. About 1 in 5 say they thought the rules made it too hard to vote (21%), a smaller share say it was too easy (14%) and around two-thirds say the rules were about right (66%). Liberals (47%), voters who considered voting rights and election integrity a top issue (39%) and Democrats (38%) were among the most likely to say the rules made it too hard to vote.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s approval rating in the new poll stands at 42% approve to 57% disapprove, about the same as in the November CNN exit poll among Georgia voters who cast ballots in the first round of this Senate race (41% approved, 58% disapproved). But both Biden and his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, are viewed negatively in Georgia. In the new poll, 41% hold a favorable view of Biden and 52% an unfavorable one, while views of Trump split 39% favorable to 54% unfavorable.\n\nThe CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from November 25-29 in Georgia, using a combination of online and telephone interviews. The survey samples were originally drawn from two sources – a probability-based online panel and a registration-based sample – and combined. Respondents were initially contacted by mail, phone or email. Results among the full sample of 1,886 registered voters has an error margin of plus or minus 3 points. Likely voters were identified through a series of questions about their intention to, interest in and past history of voting. Results among 1,184 likely voters have an error margin of plus or minus 3.8 points.", "authors": ["Jennifer Agiesta Ariel Edwards-Levy", "Jennifer Agiesta", "Ariel Edwards-Levy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/politics/senate-race-rankings-october-elections/index.html", "title": "The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe race for the Senate is in the eye of the beholder less than six weeks from Election Day, with ads about abortion, crime and inflation dominating the airwaves in key states as campaigns test the theory of the 2022 election.\n\nThe cycle started out as a referendum on President Joe Biden – an easy target for Republicans, who need a net gain of just one seat to flip the evenly divided chamber. Then the US Supreme Court’s late June decision overturning Roe v. Wade gave Democrats the opportunity to paint a contrast as Republicans struggled to explain their support for an abortion ruling that the majority of the country opposes. Former President Donald Trump’s omnipresence in the headlines gave Democrats another foil.\n\nBut the optimism some Democrats felt toward the end of the summer, on the heels of Biden’s legislative wins and the galvanizing high court decision, has been tempered slightly by the much anticipated tightening of some key races as political advertising ramps up on TV and voters tune in after Labor Day.\n\nMore on key Senate races ‘We can walk and chew gum at the same time’: Cheri Beasley vows to fight inflation and for abortion rights 7 takeaways from the Colorado Senate debate GOP New Hampshire Senate nominee repeats hoax that kids are using litter boxes in schools Schumer: Georgia Senate race ‘going downhill’ but Pennsylvania debate ‘didn’t hurt us too much’ See Senate race ratings by Inside Elections\n\nRepublicans, who have midterm history on their side as the party out of the White House, have hammered Biden and Democrats for supporting policies they argue exacerbate inflation. Biden’s approval rating stands at 41% with 54% disapproving in the latest CNN Poll of Polls, which tracks the average of recent surveys. And with some prices inching back up after a brief hiatus, the economy and inflation – which Americans across the country identify as their top concern in multiple polls – are likely to play a crucial role in deciding voters’ preferences.\n\nBut there’s been a steady increase in ads about crime too as the GOP returns to a familiar criticism, depicting Democrats as weak on public safety. Cops have been ubiquitous in TV ads this cycle – candidates from both sides of the aisle have found law enforcement officers to testify on camera to their pro-police credentials. Democratic ads also feature women talking about the threat of a national abortion ban should the Senate fall into GOP hands, while Republicans have spent comparatively less trying to portray Democrats as the extremists on the topic.\n\nWhile the issue sets have fluctuated, the Senate map hasn’t changed. Republicans’ top pickup opportunities have always been Nevada, Georgia, Arizona and New Hampshire – all states that Biden carried in 2020. In two of those states, however, the GOP has significant problems, although the states themselves keep the races competitive. Arizona nominee Blake Masters is now without the support of the party’s major super PAC, which thinks its money can be better spent elsewhere, including in New Hampshire, where retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc is far from the nominee the national GOP had wanted. But this is the time of year when poor fundraising can really become evident since TV ad rates favor candidates and a super PAC gets much less bang for its buck.\n\nThe race for Senate control may come down to three states: Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania, all of which are rated as “Toss-up” races by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. As Republicans look to flip the Senate, which Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has called a “50-50 proposition,” they’re trying to pick up the first two and hold on to the latter.\n\nSenate Democrats’ path to holding their majority lies with defending their incumbents. Picking off a GOP-held seat like Pennsylvania – still the most likely to flip in CNN’s ranking – would help mitigate any losses. Wisconsin, where GOP Sen. Ron Johnson is vying for a third term, looks like Democrats’ next best pickup opportunity, but that race drops in the rankings this month as Republican attacks take a toll on the Democratic nominee in the polls.\n\nThese rankings are based on CNN’s reporting, fundraising and advertising data, and polling, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. It will be updated one more time before Election Day.\n\n1. Pennsylvania\n\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\n\nSarah Silbiger/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe most consistent thing about CNN’s rankings, dating back to 2021, has been Pennsylvania’s spot in first place. But the race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey has tightened since the primaries in May, when Republican Mehmet Oz emerged badly bruised from a nasty intraparty contest. In a CNN Poll of Polls average of recent surveys in the state, Democrat John Fetterman, the state lieutenant governor, had the support of 50% of likely voters to Oz’s 45%. (The Poll of Polls is an average of the four most recent nonpartisan surveys of likely voters that meet CNN’s standards.) Fetterman is still overperforming Biden, who narrowly carried Pennsylvania in 2020. Fetterman’s favorability ratings are also consistently higher than Oz’s.\n\nOne potential trouble spot for the Democrat: More voters in a late September Franklin and Marshall College Poll viewed Oz has having policies that would improve voters’ economic circumstances, with the economy and inflation remaining the top concern for voters across a range of surveys. But nearly five months after the primary, the celebrity surgeon still seems to have residual issues with his base. A higher percentage of Democrats were backing Fetterman than Republicans were backing Oz in a recent Fox News survey, for example, with much of that attributable to lower support from GOP women than men. Fetterman supporters were also much more enthusiastic about their candidate than Oz supporters.\n\nRepublicans have been hammering Fetterman on crime, specifically his tenure on the state Board of Pardons: An ad from the Senate Leadership Fund features a Bucks County sheriff saying, “Protect your family. Don’t vote Fetterman.” But the lieutenant governor is also using sheriffs on camera to defend his record. And with suburban voters being a crucial demographic, Democratic advertising is also leaning into abortion, like this Senate Majority PAC ad that features a female doctor as narrator and plays Oz’s comments from during the primary about abortion being “murder.” Oz’s campaign has said that he supports exceptions for “the life of the mother, rape and incest” and that “he’d want to make sure that the federal government is not involved in interfering with the state’s decisions on the topic.”\n\n2. Nevada\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\n\nCNN\n\nRepublicans have four main pickup opportunities – and right now, Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s seat looks like one of their best shots. Biden carried Nevada by a slightly larger margin than two of those other GOP-targeted states, but the Silver State’s large transient population adds a degree of uncertainty to this contest.\n\nRepublicans have tried to tie the first-term senator to Washington spending and inflation, which may be particularly resonant in a place where average gas prices are now back up to over $5 a gallon. Democrats are zeroing in on abortion rights and raising the threat that a GOP-controlled Senate could pass a national abortion ban. Former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt – the rare GOP nominee to have united McConnell and Trump early on – called the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling a “joke” before the Supreme Court overturned the decision in June. Democrats have been all too happy to use that comment against him, but Laxalt has tried to get around those attacks by saying he does not support a national ban and pointing out that the right to an abortion is settled law in Nevada.\n\n3. Georgia\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\n\nMegan Varner/Getty Images\n\nThe closer we get to Election Day, the more we need to talk about the Georgia Senate race going over the wire. If neither candidate receives a majority of the vote in November, the contest will go to a December runoff. There was no clear leader in a recent Marist poll that had Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who’s running for a full six-year term, and Republican challenger Herschel Walker both under 50% among those who say they definitely plan to vote.\n\nWarnock’s edge from earlier this cycle has narrowed, which bumps this seat up one spot on the rankings. The good news for Warnock is that he’s still overperforming Biden’s approval numbers in a state that the President flipped in 2020 by less than 12,000 votes. And so far, he seems to be keeping the Senate race closer than the gubernatorial contest, for which several polls have shown GOP Gov. Brian Kemp ahead. Warnock’s trying to project a bipartisan image that he thinks will help him hold on in what had until recently been a reliably red state. Standing waist-deep in peanuts in one recent ad, he touts his work with Alabama GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville to “eliminate the regulations,” never mentioning his own party. But Republicans have continued to try to tie the senator to his party – specifically for voting for measures in Washington that they claim have exacerbated inflation.\n\nDemocrats are hoping that enough Georgians won’t see voting for Walker as an option – even if they do back Kemp. Democrats have amped up their attacks on domestic violence allegations against the former football star and unflattering headlines about his business record. And all eyes will be on the mid-October debate to see how Walker, who has a history of making controversial and illogical comments, handles himself onstage against the more polished incumbent.\n\n4. Wisconsin\n\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\n\nLeigh VogelPool/Getty Images\n\nSen. Ron Johnson is the only Republican running for reelection in a state Biden won in 2020 – in fact, he broke his own term limits pledge to run a third time, saying he believed America was “in peril.” And although Johnson has had low approval numbers for much of the cycle, Democrats have underestimated him before. This contest moves down one spot on the ranking as Johnson’s race against Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes has tightened, putting the senator in a better position.\n\nBarnes skated through the August primary after his biggest opponents dropped out of the race, but as the nominee, he’s faced an onslaught of attacks, especially on crime, using against him his past words about ending cash bail and redirecting some funding from police budgets to social services. Barnes has attempted to answer those attacks in his ads, like this one featuring a retired police sergeant who says he knows “Mandela doesn’t want to defund the police.”\n\nA Marquette University Law School poll from early September showed no clear leader, with Johnson at 49% and Barnes at 48% among likely voters, which is a tightening from the 7-point edge Barnes enjoyed in the same poll’s August survey. Notably, independents were breaking slightly for Johnson after significantly favoring Barnes in the August survey. The effect of the GOP’s anti-Barnes advertising can likely be seen in the increasing percentage of registered voters in a late September Fox News survey who view the Democrat as “too extreme,” putting him on parity with Johnson on that question. Johnson supporters are also much more enthusiastic about their candidate.\n\n5. Arizona\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\n\nCourtney Pedroza/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Kelly, who’s running for a full six-year term after winning a 2020 special election, is still one of the most vulnerable Senate incumbents in a state that has only recently grown competitive on the federal level. But Republican nominee Blake Masters is nowhere close to rivaling Kelly in fundraising, and major GOP outside firepower is now gone. After canceling its September TV reservations in Arizona to redirect money to Ohio, the Senate Leadership Fund has cut its October spending too.\n\nOther conservative groups are spending for Masters but still have work to do to hurt Kelly, a well-funded incumbent with a strong personal brand. Kelly led Masters 51% to 41% among registered voters in a September Marist poll, although that gap narrowed among those who said they definitely plan to vote. A Fox survey from a little later in the month similarly showed Kelly with a 5-point edge among those certain to vote, just within the margin of error.\n\nMasters has attempted to moderate his abortion position since winning his August primary, buoyed by a Trump endorsement, but Kelly has continued to attack him on the issue. And a recent court decision allowing the enforcement of a 1901 state ban on nearly all abortions has given Democrats extra fodder to paint Republicans as a threat to women’s reproductive rights.\n\n6. North Carolina\n\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\n\nDemetrius Freeman/Pool/Getty Images\n\nNorth Carolina slides up one spot on the rankings, trading places with New Hampshire. The open-seat race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Richard Burr hasn’t generated as much national buzz as other states given that Democrats haven’t won a Senate seat in the state since 2008.\n\nBut it has remained a tight contest with Democrat Cheri Beasley, who is bidding to become the state’s first Black senator, facing off against GOP Rep. Ted Budd, for whom Trump recently campaigned. Beasley lost reelection as state Supreme Court chief justice by only about 400 votes in 2020 when Trump narrowly carried the Tar Heel state. But Democrats hope that she’ll be able to boost turnout among rural Black voters who might not otherwise vote during a midterm election and that more moderate Republicans and independents will see Budd as too extreme. One of Beasley’s recent spots features a series of mostly White, gray-haired retired judges in suits endorsing her as “someone different” while attacking Budd as being a typical politician out for himself.\n\nBudd is leaning into current inflation woes, specifically going after Biden in some ads that feature half-empty shopping carts, without even mentioning Beasley. Senate Leadership Fund is doing the work of trying to tie the Democrat to Washington – one recent spot almost makes her look like the incumbent in the race, superimposing her photo over an image of the US Capitol and displaying her face next to Biden’s. Both SLF and Budd are also targeting Beasley over her support for Democrats’ recently enacted health care, tax and climate bill. “Liberal politician Cheri Beasley is coming for you – and your wallet,” the narrator from one SLF ad intones, before later adding, “Beasley’s gonna knock on your door with an army of new IRS agents.” (The new law increases funding for the IRS, including for audits. But Democrats and the Trump-appointed IRS commissioner have said the intention is to go after wealthy tax cheats, not the middle class.)\n\n7. New Hampshire\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\n\nErin Scott/Getty Images\n\nA lot has been made of GOP candidate quality this cycle. But there are few states where the difference between the nominee Republicans have and the one they’d hoped to have has altered these rankings quite as much as New Hampshire.\n\nRetired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, who lost a 2020 GOP bid for the state’s other Senate seat, won last month’s Republican primary to take on first-term Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan. The problem for him, though, is that he doesn’t have much money to wage that fight. Bolduc had raised a total of $579,000 through August 24 compared with Hassan’s $31.4 million. Senate Leadership Fund is on air in New Hampshire to boost the GOP nominee – attacking Hassan for voting with Biden and her support of her party’s health care, tax and climate package. But because super PACs get much less favorable TV advertising rates than candidates, those millions won’t go anywhere near as far as Hassan’s dollars will.\n\nA year ago, Republicans were still optimistic that Gov. Chris Sununu would run for Senate, giving them a popular abortion rights-supporting nominee in a state that’s trended blue in recent federal elections. Bolduc told WMUR after his primary win that he’d vote against a national abortion ban. But ads from Hassan and Senate Majority PAC have seized on his suggestion in the same interview that the senator should “get over” the abortion issue. Republicans recognize that abortion is a salient factor in a state Biden carried by 7 points, but they also argue that the election – as Bolduc said to WMUR – will be about the economy and that Hassan is an unpopular and out-of-touch incumbent.\n\nHassan led Bolduc 49% to 41% among likely voters in a Granite State Poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. The incumbent has consolidated Democratic support, but only 83% of Republicans said they were with Bolduc, the survey found. Still, some of those Republicans, like those who said they were undecided, could come home to the GOP nominee as the general election gets closer, which means Bolduc has room to grow. He’ll need more than just Republicans to break his way, however, which is one reason he quickly pivoted on the key issue of whether the 2020 election was stolen days after he won the primary.\n\n8. Ohio\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\n\nTING SHEN/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nOhio – a state that twice voted for Trump by 8 points – isn’t supposed to be on this list at No. 8, above Florida, which backed the former President by much narrower margins. But it’s at No. 8 for the second month in a row. Republican nominee J.D. Vance’s poor fundraising has forced Senate Leadership Fund to redirect millions from other races to Ohio to shore him up and attack Rep. Tim Ryan, the Democratic nominee who had the airwaves to himself all summer. The 10-term congressman has been working to distance himself from his party in most of his ads, frequently mentioning that he “voted with Trump on trade” and criticizing the “defund the police” movement. Vance is finally on the air, trying to poke some holes in Ryan’s image.\n\nBut polling still shows a tight race with no clear leader. Ryan had an edge with independents in a recent Siena College/Spectrum News poll, which also showed that Vance – Trump’s pick for the nomination – has more work to do to consolidate GOP support after an ugly May primary. Assuming he makes up that support and late undecided voters break his way, Vance will likely hold the advantage in the end given the Buckeye State’s solidifying red lean.\n\n9. Florida\n\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\n\nDREW ANGERER/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nDemocrats face an uphill battle against GOP Sen. Marco Rubio in an increasingly red-trending state, which Trump carried by about 3 points in 2020 – nearly tripling his margin from four years earlier.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Val Demings, who easily won the party’s nomination in August, is a strong candidate who has even outraised the GOP incumbent, but not by enough to seriously jeopardize his advantage. She’s leaning into her background as the former Orlando police chief – it features prominently in her advertising, in which she repeatedly rejects the idea of defunding the police. Still, Rubio has tried to tie her to the “radical left” in Washington to undercut her own law enforcement background.\n\n10. Colorado\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Michael Bennet\n\nDEMETRIUS FREEMAN/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Sen. Michael Bennet is no stranger to tough races. In 2016, he only won reelection by 6 points against an underfunded GOP challenger whom the national party had abandoned. Given GOP fundraising challenges in some of their top races, the party hasn’t had the resources to seriously invest in the Centennial State this year.\n\nBut in his bid for a third full term, Bennet is up against a stronger challenger in businessman Joe O’Dea, who told CNN he disagreed with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. His wife and daughter star in his ads as he tries to cut a more moderate profile and vows not to vote the party line in Washington.\n\nBennet, however, is attacking O’Dea for voting for a failed 2020 state ballot measure to ban abortion after 22 weeks of pregnancy and arguing that whatever O’Dea says about supporting abortion rights, he’d give McConnell “the majority he needs” to pass a national abortion ban.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/politics/2022-midterm-election-day-takeaways/index.html", "title": "Takeaways from the 2022 midterm elections: Battle for control of the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe battle for control of Congress is still up in the air, with the Senate coming down to three key races while Democrats and Republicans are still hanging onto hopes of winning a narrow majority in the House.\n\nRepublicans began Tuesday night with a rout in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis won heavily Latino, historically Democratic regions on his way to a blowout victory that could serve as a launch pad for a 2024 presidential run.\n\nBut in the hours that have followed, Democrats reclaimed ground. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the battle for the House majority – one that favored Republicans, who expected to benefit from high inflation, historical trends and friendly new district lines after 2021’s redistricting – remains unsettled.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN analyst: Here's what DeSantis' projected victory could mean for the GOP 02:18 - Source: CNN\n\nHere are takeaways as votes are still being counted in key races:\n\nQuestions over control remain\n\nElection Day is over but the fundamental questions of this election cycle remain unanswered.\n\nTo start, control of the Senate remains up for grabs. Fetterman’s victory in Pennsylvania, flipping a GOP seat, gave Democrats some breathing room as they await results from Arizona, Nevada and Georgia. Republicans now need to win two of those three to claim a majority, but the Georgia Senate race will go to a runoff in December after no candidate won more than 50% of the vote.\n\nThe shape of the House, too, remains uncertain. Republicans appear poised to take control but there are scant signs of the big night they were hoping for. As the votes continue to be counted, the coming days will likely reveal the strength of a new GOP House majority – and whether a potentially underwhelming performance undermines Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s standing within a rancorous GOP conference. The GOP is now in a race-by-race fight that will ultimately determine McCarthy’s ability to govern.\n\nKey states are still counting ballots\n\nVotes are still being counted in several key states – including Arizona and Nevada, where a sweep of the Senate races by either party would result in control of the chamber.\n\nArizona and Nevada also have competitive races for governor, secretary of state and more to be decided in the coming days.\n\nIn Arizona, as of late Wednesday night, about 600,000 votes remained to be counted – the bulk of them in Maricopa County, the home of Phoenix and the state’s most populous. Those votes could decide the Senate race between Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly and Republican nominee Blake Masters, as well as the gubernatorial contest between Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and Republican former television journalist Kari Lake, an election denier.\n\nIn Nevada, CNN estimates that as of Wednesday night, about 160,000 known ballots remain to be counted. Mail-in ballots can be accepted through Saturday so more could be en route to elections offices. The state is the home of a crucial Senate contest between Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican challenger Adam Laxalt.\n\nThe final House landscape also depends on races that have not yet been decided as a handful of states, including California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona, continue to count ballots.\n\nIn Alaska, a Republican will win the Senate race – but it’s not clear whether Sen. Lisa Murkowski or her Donald Trump-backed challenger Kelly Tshibaka will cross the 50% threshold to avoid the race being decided by ranked choice voting. Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola leads the House race there, but it’s also not clear whether that race’s outcome will be decided by ranked choice voting.\n\nDemocrats go a long way to protecting their Senate majority\n\nRepublicans were not shy about the importance of Pennsylvania’s Senate race: “This is a must-win race. We believe if we win Pennsylvania, we win the majority,” said Steven Law, president of the preeminent Republican Senate super PAC.\n\nEarly on Wednesday morning, CNN projected that Fetterman would be the next senator from Pennsylvania, defeating Oz in the most expensive and high stakes Senate campaign in the country.\n\nFetterman’s win was a thunderclap for Democrats. While the race long represented the best chance for the party to pick up a Senate seat in 2022, Fetterman’s near fatal stroke in May – and the lengthy recovery he endured in public – injected uncertainty into the race. But on Wednesday morning, the Pennsylvania lieutenant governor gave Democrats the pick-up they needed to have a better chance to hold the United States Senate next year.\n\n“Fetterman’s win makes it next to impossible for the GOP to get a majority. Pennsylvania was the fire wall,” said Mike Mikus, a Democratic operative based in Western Pennsylvania.\n\nAlthough a number of key Senate races remain uncalled – including contests in Nevada and Arizona and in Georgia which will go to a runoff – earlier on Tuesday, CNN projected one Democratic incumbent: Sen. Maggie Hassan, a first-term Democrat who faced Republican retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, won her race.\n\nA Hassan loss would have effectively ended Democrats’ hopes of retaining their majority. And CNN projected Wednesday that Republican Ron Johnson will keep his Senate seat in Wisconsin. The Democrats are still defending seats in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada – so it will take time to settle Senate control.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN political director breaks down top issue for most voters 03:40 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump’s no good, very bad night\n\nFew Republicans were more involved in these midterms than Trump and the former president had a particularly bad night.\n\nIt appears that Trump knows it, too: He is “livid” and “screaming at everyone,” a Trump adviser who has been in contact with Trump’s inner circle told CNN on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe most striking loss for Trump came in Pennsylvania, where his chosen candidate, Oz, fell to Fetterman in what was the most expensive Senate race in the country. Trump endorsed Oz during the contentious Republican primary, effectively pulling through a brutal primary and narrowly into the general election. But where the former president’s backing was decisive in the primary, it was an albatross in the general election for a Republican Senate candidate who was attempting to make inroads in the suburbs by touting his own moderation.\n\nWhile Trump did score some Senate wins – Trump-backed Republican JD Vance defeated a stronger-than-expected challenge from Democrat Tim Ryan in the Ohio Senate race, while Republican Ted Budd defeated Democrat Cheri Beasley in North Carolina – those wins have so far been limited to Republican states.\n\nIn the House, too, some Trump acolytes lost in what were seen as competitive contests that Republicans needed to win if they were going to build a significant majority in the legislative body.\n\nIn New Hampshire, former Trump aide Karoline Leavitt lost to Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in what was seen as a highly competitive contest. In North Carolina, Trump-backed Republican Bo Hines lost to Democrat Wiley Nickel in a race that was widely seen as a test of the former president’s influence. And in Ohio, Democratic state Rep. Emilia Sykes defeated Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert who bullishly touted her ties to Trump.\n\nTrump’s evening was particularly bad when viewed through the lens of DeSantis’ romp of a night.\n\nDeSantis, Trump’s clearest rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, overwhelmingly won reelection on Tuesday, crushing Democrat Charlie Crist by nearly 20 percentage points, continuing to consolidate Latino support in Florida and even by winning populous counties like Miami-Dade.\n\nThe headline in Trump’s one-time hometown paper, the New York Post, said it all: “DeFUTURE,” the headline blared, showing the Florida Republican on stage with his family.\n\nDemocrats hold their own in the suburbs\n\nIn 2018, the suburbs delivered Democrats the House majority. In 2020, they vaulted Joe Biden to the presidency.\n\nAnd in 2022, suburbs across the country went a long way to helping Democrats avoid a significant red wave.\n\nRepublicans may still win the House, but if the 2022 election was going to be a red wave, it was likely to come through suburban victories that have not materialized yet.\n\nIn a district made up of the Kansas City suburbs, CNN projected Democrat Sharice Davids would win reelection. In Ohio, CNN projected two suburban wins: Democrat Greg Landsman defeated Republican Rep. Steve Chabot in a district that included Cincinnati and some of the surrounding suburbs and Democratic state Rep. Emilia Sykes defeated Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert in a district that includes areas around Cleveland and all of Akron. In Illinois, CNN projected that Democratic incumbent Lauren Underwood would win reelection against Republican Scott Gryder in the Chicago suburbs. And in Virginia, CNN projected Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger would win reelection, largely because of the votes she picked up from the suburbs of Washington, DC.\n\nRepublicans did score some suburban victories – CNN projected Brandon Ogles the winner in a district around Nashville, Tom Kean Jr. winning in a suburban New Jersey district and Rich McCormick the victor in a district that included Atlanta’s northern suburbs – but it was their defeats that spoke volumes about the size of the GOP wave.\n\nAnother January 6 committee member loses\n\nDemocratic Rep. Elaine Luria, a member of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, lost her Virginia Beach-based House seat, CNN projected.\n\nLuria’s loss to Kiggans, Republican Navy veteran, was the latest demonstration that the lasting focus on the insurrection – even as it sheds light on a dark chapter in the nation’s capitol – is a political anchor for those involved.\n\nLuria had defeated former GOP Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018 and 2020. But the district had become slightly more favorable ground for Republicans in redistricting: Biden carried the previous version by 5 points, and would have lost the new district by 2 points.\n\nAnd Luria provided the latest evidence that voters are not rewarding those involved in the committee probing the insurrection. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was routed in a primary by Trump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman, while Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a Florida Democrat, both retired rather than seeking reelection.\n\nDeSantis’ big win could be a 2024 launchpad\n\nDeSantis led a dominant Republican ticket in Florida – delivering historic margins in Democratic territory in his victory Crist on a night that provides him a powerful argument if he seeks the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination.\n\nThe easy wins by DeSantis, who led by nearly 20 percentage points with 92% of the estimated vote counted, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who was 17 points up, were enough to cast doubt on Florida’s status as a national bellwether.\n\nThe most eye-popping outcome – and one that demonstrates the breadth of DeSantis’ appeal in the eyes of Sunshine State voters – came in Miami-Dade County, which is heavily Hispanic and historically a huge source of Democratic votes.\n\nRepublicans had made gains there in recent years: Hillary Clinton defeated former President Trump there by 29 percentage points in 2016. DeSantis did slightly better in the 2018 governor’s race, losing the county by 21 points. Trump made inroads there in 2020, losing by just 8 points. But a GOP candidate for governor hadn’t actually won Miami-Dade County since Jeb Bush in 2002.\n\nThe political reality is straightforward: Democrats have no realistic path to victory in statewide races in Florida without big wins in Miami-Dade County. That reality makes county’s outcome into an exclamation point on a dominant GOP performance.\n\nDeSantis’ win comes as a battle over the future of the Republican Party takes shape, with Trump signaling a potential 2024 announcement next week. Exit polls in Florida showed that 45% of the state’s voters would like to see DeSantis run for president, compared to 33% who want Trump to run in 2024.\n\nIn a victory speech Tuesday night, DeSantis offered a glimpse at how he might describe his governorship to a national audience. Touting his refusal to impose lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, he said that Florida “was a refuge of sanity when the world went mad.” He also described the state as “where woke goes to die” and “a ray of hope that better days still lie ahead.”\n\nGOP makes gains with Latinos in Florida\n\nRepublicans hoped to build on Trump’s inroads among Latino voters in 2020, a trend that could reshape the political landscapes in several swing states if it continues.\n\nThe strongest early signal that the GOP had continued to make gains came in Miami-Dade County, home to a large Cuban population.\n\nBut Latinos are not a monolith, and there were more important signs in Florida, too: Another traditional Democratic stronghold won by DeSantis was Osceola County, a majority Latino county south of Orlando with a heavily Puerto Rican population.\n\nHowever, it’s not clear if those GOP gains are materializing outside Florida.\n\nOne key gauge was the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, where three House races in heavily Latino districts were up for grabs. Democrats have won two of those races, CNN projected. Rep. Henry Cuellar, the only House Democrat who votes against abortion rights, won reelection in his Laredo-based 28th District, while Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez defeated Republican Rep. Mayra Flores – the two were drawn into the same district – in the McAllen-based 34th District. The 15th District race, which was widely seen as the GOP’s best chance, is still too early to call.\n\n“The RED WAVE did not happen. Republicans and Independents stayed home,” Flores tweeted just after midnight.\n\nArizona and Nevada, both competitive states with significant Latino populations, are also important to watch. So are a spate of House races in California, where it could take days or weeks for winners to become clear.\n\nDemocrats had a good night in governor’s races\n\nCNN projected Wes Moore the winner in Maryland and Maura Healey the victor in Massachusetts, two seats that are currently in Republican control. Democratic governors in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Mexico and others are projected to hold their seats, while Democrat Josh Shapiro defeated Republican Doug Mastriano in a seat where Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf was term limited.\n\nBut as Tuesday turned into Wednesday, Democrats have a shot at strengthening their grip of governor’s offices across the country.\n\nCNN projected Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly the winner in her bid for reelection on Wednesday morning, while Democrats are competitive in Oregon and Nevada, two states that would represent Democratic holds, and Arizona, a state that would represent a Democratic flip.\n\nThe night is far from an unmitigated victory for Democrats – and how the three outstanding key races tip could shift the way Democrats see their gubernatorial successes. And some of the most famous Democratic gubernatorial candidates did lose: CNN projected Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams failed to unseat Republican incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp in a rematch of their 2018 race, and Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke was unable to defeat Republican incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nBut few Democratic operatives would have said weeks ago that they would be in line to have this kind of night in governors races.\n\nAbortion rights, and its defenders, triumph\n\nIn referendums and races where the Supreme Court’s June decision to reverse Roe v. Wade was a central issue, voters sided overwhelmingly with Democrats and in favor of abortion rights.\n\nIn Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – who staked her reelection campaign on her successful efforts to block the enforcement of the state’s 1931 law banning abortion in almost all instances – defeated Republican challenger Tudor Dixon, who had waged a campaign focused on cultural battles.\n\nMichigan voters also approved a Whitmer-backed amendment to the state’s constitution that will scrap that 1931 law and guarantee abortion rights.\n\nVoters in California and Vermont also green-lit constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers had made abortion a central focus of his campaign. Republicans there have rejected Evers’ efforts to amend the state’s 1849 abortion ban to include exceptions for rape and incest. He highlighted that split by calling the GOP-led legislature into a special session in October and urging them to act on the issue – and then used lawmakers’ decision to adjourn in less than 30 seconds without taking action as a campaign cudgel.\n\nIt’ll take time to sort out which issues were decisive, particularly in suburban House battles. But according to CNN exit polls, 27% of voters in House races said abortion was the most important issue – second only to inflation at 31%. Among those who cited abortion as the most important issue, 76% voted Democratic.\n\nA night of firsts\n\nUp and down the ballot, in red states and blue, candidates from both parties are celebrating pathbreaking victories.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Healey is poised to become the state’s first elected female governor and the nation’s first out lesbian state executive. Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Trump White House press secretary, has been elected the first female governor of Arkansas. And Moore will be the Maryland’s first Black governor.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Massachusetts elected its first female governor.

With all House districts in the commonwealth projected by CNN, the results hint at a night where Democrats could lose the House – but would not face a 2014-style wave.\n\nDemocrats held seats in two Virginia districts Biden won in 2020.\n\nCNN projected that Democratic Jennifer Wexton won her reelection bid in Virginia’s 10th District. Republicans were hoping Wexton could fall on Tuesday if the night was particularly bad for Democrats.\n\nIn an even more competitive race, CNN projected Spanberger also won reelection in Virginia’s 7th District. Spanberger was widely seen as a vulnerable incumbent, especially after Republican Glenn Youngkin carried the district in his successful gubernatorial campaign in 2021.\n\nBut Democrats lost in southeastern Virginia, with CNN projecting that Republican state Sen.

And my latest 2024 Democratic presidential rankings are here.) A word of caution: it’s still very early so this list can and will change.\n\n10. Rick Scott: The Florida senator is in the midst of a cold war with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell over the best way to execute the fall campaign. But Scott, the chair of the Senate GOP’s campaign arm, doesn’t seem particularly interested in trying to take McConnell’s job (and he wouldn’t be able to anyway). Scott’s eye is on a bigger prize – as evidenced by his recent trip to Iowa to campaign with a House candidate. (Previous ranking: 9)\n\n9. Greg Abbott: Abbott has a comfortable, if not massive, edge over Democrat Beto O’Rourke in his bid for a second term as Texas governor. And he’s drawn a lot of national attention for busing migrants to New York and Washington, DC. Abbott has demonstrated an ability to raise the sort of money he would need to run for president, too. (Previous ranking: 7)\n\n8. Mike Pompeo: No one on this list has been more overt about their interest in running for president than Pompeo. The former secretary of state recently visited New Hampshire, simply the latest in a series of trips to states expected to kick off the primary season. If Trump doesn’t run, expect Pompeo to position himself as an inheritor of the muscular foreign policy that the former President sought to make his legacy. (Previous ranking: Not ranked)\n\n7. Nikki Haley: During a trip to Iowa this summer, the former UN ambassador and South Carolina governor leaned as far into a possible candidacy as she ever has. “If it looks like there’s a place for me next year, I’ve never lost a race,” she said. Haley had previously suggested she wouldn’t run if Trump did, but political promises are made to be broken. Haley is charismatic and experienced on the campaign trail. It remains to be seen how she would differentiate herself in a race against Trump, though. (Previous ranking: 6)\n\n6. Ted Cruz: The Texas senator is set to go on a massive campaign trip for the midterm elections that will take him through three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada – that will play a critical role in picking the next Republican presidential nominee. Cruz, who finished second to Trump in the 2016 primary, is smart enough to know that the race is effectively frozen until Trump makes up his mind, but is putting in the work now so that if Trump bows out (unlikely, but possible) he would be in a position to take advantage. (Previous ranking: 5)\n\n5. Mike Pence: Look, I get that he is the former vice president of the United States. And that as a result, Pence has name recognition and a donor network that is the envy of almost everyone on this list. At the same time, he is persona non grata with the unquestioned leader of the Republican Party. Even if Trump doesn’t run in 2024, can you imagine a scenario where he leaves Pence alone during a GOP primary campaign? I sure can’t. (Previous ranking: 3)\n\n4. Glenn Youngkin: There’s a tendency to be skeptical of Youngkin because he is only now in his first year as the governor of Virginia. But as Barack Obama should have taught all of us, inexperience in national politics isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Youngkin is a very hot commodity in Republican politics these days; he’ll campaign for gubernatorial candidates in across the country in the coming weeks. Politics is all about timing and momentum – and right now, Youngkin has both on his side. (Previous ranking: 5)\n\n3. Tim Scott: On the one hand, the South Carolina senator publicly downplays his presidential aspirations. On the other, he spent a day in late August stumping for a House candidate in Iowa. (Scott has been to the state at least five times in the last three years.) So … The reality is that if Trump doesn’t run, it’s hard to see how Scott stays out of the 2024 race. And he would immediately be one of the contest’s front-runners – he is the only Black Republican in the Senate and has demonstrated an ability to raise money. (Previous ranking: 4)\n\n2. Ron DeSantis: There’s no question that the FBI’s search of Mar-a-Lago took some wind from the sails of DeSantis’ presidential ambitions. But there’s also no question that the Florida governor is the only contender on this list who poses a direct threat to Trump in a presidential primary. DeSantis continues to show his knack for attracting national headlines – his stunt of flying migrants to Martha’s Vineyard being the latest example – and, in so doing, rallying Trumpian conservatives to his cause. If Trump, as expected, enters the race, DeSantis will have a very tough choice to make. (Previous ranking: 2)\n\n1. Donald Trump: Yes, the former President is, without question, the favorite to win the Republican nomination for a third time. But it’s worth noting that he’s not as big a favorite as, say, Hillary Clinton was at this point for the Democratic nomination in the 2016 election cycle. (Clinton won the nomination, but the race against Bernie Sanders was far closer than early polling indicated.) Which is to say that the GOP nomination is Trump’s for the taking, but it is not a foregone conclusion that he wins it. Polling of late has picked up a sizable chunk of Republicans who are ready to look elsewhere for the next leader of their party.

Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign. Brad Parscale will not be involved in the 2024 operation.

And more than 7 in 10 of them opted for Republicans.\n\nInflation also dominated in most of the exit polls conducted in 11 key states. At least two-thirds of those concerned about high prices in several crucial states cast ballots for Republican Senate candidates.\n\nConsumers have been contending with soaring prices for food, gas and other essentials for more than a year as inflation has hovered around 40-year highs.\n\nAround three-quarters of voters nationally said the economy is “poor” or “not good,” and the same share said that inflation has caused them severe or moderate hardship. About two-thirds said that gas prices have been causing them hardship.\n\nVoters have a dour view about the way things are going in the country generally, with more than 7 in 10 saying they are “dissatisfied” or “angry.”\n\nThe exit poll results are in line with pre-election polling, as well as consumer confidence surveys, all of which show that Americans are worried about the state of the economy.\n\nThough President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats have tried to tout the measures they’ve taken to lower costs, many voters aren’t giving them credit. Just under half of voters for House candidates said Biden’s policies are hurting the country, while only around one-third said they are helping, exit polls found.\n\nEven Biden’s plan to forgive some student loan debt has not rustled up widespread support. Roughly half of voters approve of the effort, while nearly the same share disapprove.\n\nDespite voters’ angst about the economy, the Republicans’ red wave does not seem to have fully materialized. Abortion was also a significant factor in the election, with more than a quarter of voters listing it as a top issue. About 61% said they were unhappy with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, and about 7 in 10 of those voters backed a Democratic House candidate.\n\nHere are more takeaways from CNN’s preliminary 2022 national and state exit polls.\n\nVoters who valued ‘honesty and integrity’ favored Fetterman\n\nPennsylvania voters who most valued “honesty and integrity” in their Senate candidate favored Democrat John Fetterman over Republican Mehmet Oz, according to the early results of the Pennsylvania exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nFetterman also won among voters who said they wanted a candidate who cared about people like them, while Oz won among the smaller bloc of voters who prioritized a candidate sharing their values.\n\nCNN projects that Fetterman will defeat Oz to win the open Pennsylvania Senate race, flipping a Republican-held seat.\n\nA majority of female voters, White college-educated voters, voters of color and political independents in the state supported Fetterman, the exit poll finds, while most male voters and White voters without college degrees supported Oz.\n\nMost voters, about 53%, said they disapproved of President Joe Biden’s job performance. But roughly 14% of those who disapproved of Biden cast their ballots for Fetterman, as did nearly all of those who approved of the president. A slim majority of voters in the state said that Biden was not a factor in their vote, with most also saying former President Donald Trump did not play a role.\n\nVoters were close to evenly split on whether or not Oz’s views were too extreme, while about 53% said Fetterman’s views were not.\n\nVoters in Pennsylvania were closely split over whether Fetterman’s health was good enough to represent the state effectively. Fetterman, Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor, suffered a near fatal stroke days before the May Democratic primary.\n\nBut a majority of voters said that Oz has not lived in the commonwealth long enough to represent it effectively. Oz has said he moved to Pennsylvania in late 2020 after living in New Jersey for decades.\n\n2:05 a.m. ET Wednesday / Ariel Edwards-Levy and Tami Luhby\n\nMost voters don’t want Biden to run in 2024\n\nMore than two-thirds of voters for House candidates don’t want President Joe Biden to run for reelection in 2024, according to the early results of the national exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nMore than 7 in 10 independent voters and roughly 9 in 10 Republican voters said they don’t want Biden to be in the 2024 presidential campaign. Fewer than 6 in 10 Democratic voters thought he should run.\n\nJust under 6 in 10 independent voters have an unfavorable view of Biden, and about the same share disapprove of the job he’s doing as president.\n\nOnly 1 in 10 Democratic voters have an unfavorable view of the president and slightly more disapprove of his job performance.\n\nMore than 9 in 10 GOP voters have an unfavorable view of Biden and disapprove of the job he’s doing.\n\nWhen it comes to former President Donald Trump, two-thirds of independent voters and more than 9 in 10 Democratic voters have an unfavorable view of him. Just over three-quarters of GOP voters have a favorable view.\n\nIndependent voters comprise about a quarter of the electorate, while Democratic voters are roughly one-third and Republican voters are just over one-third of the electorate.\n\n12:59 a.m. ET Wednesday / Tami Luhby\n\nVance draws support from suburban and rural voters, as well as from men, White voters and older voters\n\nNearly 6 in 10 suburban voters and nearly the same share of rural voters favored GOP Senate candidate J.D. Vance over his Democratic rival, US Rep. Tim Ryan, which helped the Republican clinch the open seat, according to preliminary results of the Ohio exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nAlso, nearly 6 in 10 men who cast ballots voted for Vance, about the same share as White voters who picked the GOP candidate. More than half of Buckeye State voters age 45 and older and voters without college degrees opted for Vance, as well.\n\nRyan was the preferred candidate of just over half of women who voted, college-educated voters and younger voters. Roughly half of independent voters cast ballots for the Democrat. Just under 6 in 10 voters who live in Ohio cities went for Ryan, as did more than three-quarters of voters of color in the state.\n\nNearly 6 in 10 voters from union households voted for Ryan, according to the exit poll later on Wednesday morning. Initially, the exit poll had shown that about the same share supported Vance.\n\nVoters who said they were most concerned about crime, inflation and immigration broke for Vance, while those who thought abortion and gun policy were top issues selected Ryan.\n\nVance was the choice of voters who wanted a candidate who shared their values, but Ryan was supported by those looking for a candidate who cares about people like them and a candidate who has honesty and integrity.\n\n1:15 p.m. ET Wednesday / Tami Luhby\n\nAbout half of New Hampshire voters saw Don Bolduc’s views as ‘too extreme’\n\nAbout half of New Hampshire voters called Republican Senate candidate Don Bolduc’s views “too extreme,” according to the early results of the New Hampshire exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. Only about 43% said the same of his Democratic rival, incumbent Sen. Maggie Hassan.\n\nCNN projects that Hassan will win a second Senate term in New Hampshire, defeating the Trump-backed Bolduc.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s job approval rating in the state is negative, per the exit poll, with only about 42% of voters approving. But roughly 1 in 5 Biden disapprovers, nevertheless, cast their vote for Hassan.\n\nRoughly three-quarters of voters in the state – including similar shares of both candidates’ supporters – said that party control of the Senate was very important to their vote.\n\n12:59 a.m. ET Wednesday / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nMost voters express at least some confidence in fairness of elections in their states\n\nNationally, more than 9 in 10 Democrats who voted in this year’s midterms said they were at least somewhat confident that elections in their state were being conducted fairly and accurately, according to early national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. That’s a level of confidence shared by about 8 in 10 independents, and a smaller two-thirds of Republicans.\n\nWhile Democrats’ confidence was robust across most key battleground states, Republicans’ views of the election system varied much more significantly by state.\n\nRoughly 8 in 10 Republicans in Florida, New Hampshire, Texas and Ohio said they were confident that their state’s elections were accurate and fair, as did more than 7 in 10 in Georgia, North Carolina and Wisconsin.\n\nBut only about 6 in 10 Republicans in Michigan, Nevada and Arizona said they were confident in their state’s elections. And in Pennsylvania, only about half expressed such confidence.\n\nVoters were also deeply concerned about the state of the country’s democracy. About 3 in 10 said that they viewed democracy in the US today as at least somewhat secure, with about two-thirds feeling that democracy in the country is somewhat or very threatened.\n\nSlightly over 6 in 10 voters accepted that Biden legitimately won the presidency in 2020, while slightly over one-third denied the results of that election.\n\nUpdated 11:39 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nVoters who disliked both parties broke for Republicans\n\nMost voters in this year’s election view one party positively, and the other negatively – nationally, about 4 in 10 have a favorable view of only the Democratic Party, and a similar share have a favorable view of only the Republican Party, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. Unsurprisingly, these voters almost unanimously supported their favored party in their district’s congressional election.\n\nBut there’s also a smaller bloc of voters – about 11% of the electorate, nationwide – who dislike both parties. This group broke in favor of the Republicans, with nearly 6 in 10 favoring a GOP House candidate this year. That’s a shift from 2018, when voters who disliked both parties were about evenly split in their vote.\n\nVoters who were most upset with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade differed from those who felt less profoundly unhappy with the decision, the exit polls show. Those who were angry about the overturning of Roe (about 39% of the electorate) overwhelmingly voted Democratic for the House (about 85% picked the Democratic candidate). Those who were dissatisfied but not angry (about 21% of the electorate) narrowly favored the GOP.\n\nThere was also a difference between voters who were most pessimistic about the economy, and those who felt less strongly negative. While nearly 9 in 10 voters who said the economy was poor voted for a GOP House candidate, about 6 in 10 who described the economy as “not so good” backed a Democratic candidate.\n\nTo some extent, these divides reflect the partisan differences already baked into views on abortion and the economy. Voters who considered themselves Democrats were roughly 59 points more than voters who considered themselves Republican to say they were angry about Roe v. Wade being overturned. Republicans, meanwhile, were about 28 points likelier than Democrats to call the economy poor.\n\n9:55 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nFlorida voters weigh in on Trump and DeSantis\n\nWhat do Florida voters think about the possibility two Florida men could run for president in 2024? Exit polls from the Sunshine State offer some clues.\n\nWith Donald Trump signaling a potential announcement next week, 33% of Florida voters said they want to see the former president run in 2024, according to the preliminary results of the Florida exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nThere appears to be more of an appetite for a bid by Ron DeSantis, with 45% of Florida voters saying they want the state’s governor – who CNN projects will win reelection – to seek the presidency in 2024.\n\nDeSantis’ strength is reflected in the Florida exit polls, which show the governor winning Latinos in the state by 13 points. In 2020, Trump trailed Biden among Latino voters in Florida by 7 points. DeSantis also held a slight edge among independents, whom Biden carried in the state by 11 points. Those could be selling points if DeSantis and Trump collide in a 2024 GOP primary.\n\n9:55 p.m. ET / Terence Burlij\n\nPennsylvania voters are split over Fetterman’s health\n\nVoters in Pennsylvania are split over whether Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman’s health is good enough to represent the state effectively, according to the preliminary results of the Pennsylvania exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nFetterman, Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor, suffered a near-fatal stroke days before he won the May Democratic primary.\n\nBut a majority of voters said that Mehmet Oz, the Republican candidate for Senate, has not lived in the commonwealth long enough to represent it effectively. More than 4 in 10 said he had.\n\nOz has said he moved to Pennsylvania in late 2020 after living in New Jersey for decades.\n\nVoters also split over which candidate’s views are too extreme with more than 4 in 10 picking Fetterman and the same share selecting Oz.\n\nMore than one-third of Pennsylvania voters said that they care most about whether a candidate shares their values and whether a candidate has honesty and integrity. About 2 in 10 said the most important quality is that a candidate cares about people like them. Fewer than one in 10 said having the right experience matters most.\n\nMen and women who cast ballots split their support, with more than half of men voting for Oz and more than half of women voting for Fetterman. Among independent voters, who made up about a quarter of the electorate, more than half voted for Fetterman.\n\nFor voters who thought that abortion was the most important issue, more than three quarters supported Fetterman. They made up just over one-third of the electorate.\n\nBut among those who said inflation was the most pressing issue, more than three-quarters cast ballots for Oz. They made up more than a quarter of the electorate.\n\n8:44 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nVast majority of North Carolina voters think the economy is not in good shape\n\nRoughly 8 in 10 North Carolina voters said the economy is “poor” or “not good,” according to the preliminary results of the North Carolina Exit Poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nMore than three-quarters of voters in the state said inflation has caused them and their family severe or moderate hardship.\n\nAbout half of those who cast ballots said that President Joe Biden’s policies are hurting the country, while only 35% think they are helping.\n\nAbout 4 in 10 North Carolina voters approve of Biden, while more than half disapprove.\n\n8:19 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nOhio voters think the economy is weak\n\nMore than three-quarters of Ohio voters said the nation’s economy was “poor” or “not so good,” according to the preliminary results of the Ohio Exit Poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nAnd nearly three-quarters of Buckeye State voters said inflation has caused their family severe or moderate hardship, with nearly 2 in 10 saying their difficulties were severe.\n\nMore than half of those who cast ballots said that President Joe Biden’s policies are hurting, while about one-third said they are helping.\n\nThe president is not that popular among Ohio voters – more than half disapprove of him, with more than 4 in 10 approving.\n\n7:47 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nWarnock loses some support among Black and Hispanic Georgians\n\nDemocratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia who is locked in tight reelection race with Republican Herschel Walker, lost some support among Black and Hispanic voters in Tuesday’s closely watched election, compared with the special runoff election the Democrat won in 2021, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nThe votes in Georgia continue to be counted, but the race is widely expected to be close.\n\nRoughly 9 in 10 Black voters and nearly 6 in 10 Hispanic voters in Georgia supported Warnock, but he lost several percentage points among each group, the preliminary exit polls found.\n\nWarnock also shed a few percentage points of support among men who cast ballots and among voters age 64 and younger. However, the senator gained a small amount of support among White voters, who make up nearly two-thirds of the electorate, and among senior citizens.\n\nStill, Walker was the candidate of choice among more than two-thirds of White voters, as well as among a majority of men who cast ballots.\n\nA majority of women who voted and around 8 in 10 non-White voters opted for Warnock.\n\nMore than half of voters age 45 and older cast ballots for Walker, while nearly 6 in 10 younger voters selected Warnock.\n\n7:47 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nWarnock holds edge among Georgia voters when it comes to showing ‘good judgment’\n\nGeorgia voters were more likely to say that Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock has good judgment than they were to say the same of his Republican challenger, Herschel Walker, according to the preliminary results of the Georgia exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. But more said Warnock holds views that are too extreme than said the same about Walker.\n\nJust shy of half, about 46%, said only Warnock shows good judgment, with about 28% saying only Walker does, and nearly a fifth that neither candidate does.\n\nVoters in Georgia were close to evenly split on whether or not Warnock’s views were too extreme. Slightly more than 4 in 10 said Walker’s views were too extreme, with just over half saying they were not.\n\nAsked which candidate quality mattered most to their Senate vote, 36% of Georgia voters said they wanted a candidate who shared their values, 32% a candidate who had honesty and integrity, 19% a candidate who cared about people like them, and 8% someone who had the right experience.\n\n7:08 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nPennsylvania voters are not enamored with either Biden or Trump\n\nMore than 4 in 10 of Pennsylvania voters approve of the way Joe Biden is handling his job, but a majority disapprove of the president, who was born and raised in Scranton, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nVoters in the commonwealth did not have a high opinion of former President Donald Trump either. Just 4 in 10 had a favorable opinion, while nearly 6 in 10 had an unfavorable opinion.\n\nMeanwhile, just over half of Pennsylvania voters said Biden was not a factor in their vote. For those who said the president was a factor, more than 1 in 10 said they support him, while nearly a third said they oppose him.\n\nMore than half of Pennsylvania voters also said that Trump was not a factor in their vote. For those who said the former president was a factor, close to 1 in 5 said they support him, while about a quarter oppose him.\n\n6:52 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nVoters trust Republicans more on inflation and crime but lean toward Democrats on abortion\n\nMore voters trust Republicans than Democrats to handle inflation and crime, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nRoughly half of voters said they trusted GOP candidates on those two issues, while more than 4 in 10 voters said they trusted Democratic candidates.\n\nWhen it comes to the issue of abortion, however, roughly half of voters said they trusted Democratic candidates, compared with more than 4 in 10 voters who said they trusted Republican candidates.\n\n6:30 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nVoter views on Trump are even more negative than on Biden\n\nWhile voters in this year’s midterm election hold negative views of President Joe Biden, their views of his predecessor are even more negative, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nOnly about 37% of voters in this year’s midterms expressed a favorable view of former President Donald Trump, with around 6 in 10 viewing him unfavorably. About 16% of voters said their House vote this year was intended to express support for Trump, with just under 3 in 10 saying it’s intended to express opposition and the rest saying that Trump was not a factor.\n\nVoters’ opinions of the GOP were slightly more positive than their views of Trump, with about 43% viewing the Republican Party favorably and just over half viewing it unfavorably. More than half, about 54%, say the GOP is too extreme.\n\n6:00 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nRepublican and Democratic voters differ in their top issues\n\nThere’s a significant partisan divide in voters’ priorities and attitudes this year, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nNearly half of voters who supported a GOP House candidate called inflation their top issue, with fewer than 15% picking any other issue as their priority. Among voters who backed a Democratic candidate, about 44% called abortion their top issue, with 15% or fewer picking any other issue.\n\nMeanwhile, midterm voters were mostly opposed to the US Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, according to the preliminary national exit polls.\n\nSlightly fewer than 4 in 10 said they felt enthusiastic or satisfied about the decision, while about 21% said they felt dissatisfied, and roughly 4 in 10 that they were angry.\n\nAbout 60% of all voters said that abortion should be legal in most or all cases, up from 51% among voters who turned out for the 2020 general election.\n\n5:52 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\n2022 voters may skew older compared with 2018\n\nEarly indications suggest that this year’s midterm electorate may look older than the voters in the 2018 midterms, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nOnly about a tenth of voters in this election were under age 30, while roughly one-third were age 65 or older. In 2018, about 13% were under 30, and about 26% were 65 or older.\n\nThe electorate this year was split roughly between those who generally identify as Democrats (about 34%) and those who generally identify as Republicans (about 35%), with the remainder consisting of political independents and members of other parties. In 2018, Democrats made up a slightly larger voting bloc, about 37%.\n\nAbout 76% of voters were White, and about 24% were voters of color. White voters with college degrees look to be a slightly larger share of the electorate this year – about 40% per the preliminary data, compared with 31% four years ago. By contrast, voters of color without a college degree look to have made up a slightly smaller share of the electorate this year.\n\n5:29 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nInflation is top issue for voters, followed by abortion\n\nInflation tops voters’ list of concerns in this year’s midterm elections, with abortion a close second, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nApproximately one-third called inflation the most important issue to their vote, with about 27% citing abortion. The remainder were roughly divided between picking crime, gun policy and immigration as their chief concerns.\n\nThe electorate’s views of the economy are largely gloomy. Only about one-quarter of voters felt positively about the current condition of the economy, with roughly three-quarters viewing it negatively – and about 4 in 10 saying it’s downright poor.\n\nThat’s more pessimistic than in the 2018 midterms, when 68% of voters said the state of the economy was excellent or good, and the 2020 presidential election, when 49% said the same.\n\nAbout 46% of voters in this election say that their family’s financial situation had worsened over the past two years, while only about 1 in 5 said it had improved.\n\nMore than three-quarters of voters in this year’s election say that inflation has caused hardship for them and their family over the past year, with about 20% saying it’s been a severe hardship. And about 6 in 10 say that gas prices, specifically, have recently been a hardship.\n\n5:23 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nVoters unhappy with the state of the nation and largely negative on Biden\n\nVoters in this year’s midterm elections are broadly unhappy with the state of the nation and hold largely negative views of President Joe Biden, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nMore than 7 in 10 said they were less than satisfied with the way things are going in the country, with about one-third saying they were not just dissatisfied but angry with the state of the nation.\n\nBiden’s approval rating stands at about 45% among voters in this year’s election – nearly identical to then-Donald Trump’s 45% approval rating four years ago among 2018 midterm voters. And voters in this election were more than twice as likely to strongly disapprove of Biden as they were to strongly approve of him.\n\nJust shy of half of voters this year said that Biden’s policies are mostly hurting the country, with about 36% saying his policies are mostly helping, and the rest that they’re making no difference.\n\nMany voters didn’t see their congressional vote as a referendum on the president – close to half said that Biden was not a factor in their vote, while about 18% said their vote was to express support for Biden, and about one-third that it was to express opposition to him.\n\nUpdated 5:13 p.m. ET / Ariel Edwards-Levy\n\nMethodology\n\nThe 2022 national exit polls include interviews with thousands of voters, both those who cast a ballot on Election Day and those who voted early or absentee. That scope makes them a powerful tool for understanding the demographic profile and political views of voters in this year’s election. And their findings will eventually be weighted against the ultimate benchmark: the results of the elections themselves. Even so, exit polls are still polls, with margins for error – which means they’re most useful when treated as estimates, rather than precise measurements. That’s particularly true for the earliest exit poll numbers, which haven’t yet been adjusted to match final election results.\n\nCNN Exit Polls are a combination of in-person interviews with Election Day voters and in-person interviews, telephone and online polls measuring the views of early and absentee by-mail voters. They were conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. In-person interviews on Election Day were conducted at a random sample of 250 polling locations.

Ron DeSantis — with about five months to Caucus Day, a new Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows.\n\nThe poll of Iowa’s likely Republican caucusgoers comes as the former president grapples with the fallout of a fourth criminal indictment and a pack of other top contenders prepares to gather for a high-stakes GOP presidential debate in Milwaukee on Wednesday.\n\nAmong those likely caucusgoers, 42% say they plan to support Trump — a lead of 23 percentage points over DeSantis, who is at 19%. U.S. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina follows in third place with 9%.\n\nFormer United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence tie at 6%, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is at 5% and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy follows with 4%.\n\nThe poll finds many indicators of Trump’s strength, but the race is not settled and may be “closer than it may first seem,” said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., the firm that conducted the poll.\n\nMore:See where presidential candidates are campaigning in Iowa\n\nSixty-three percent of likely GOP caucusgoers say they support Trump as their first or second choice in the caucuses or are actively considering him. That footprint is on par with the 61% who say the same for DeSantis.\n\nPlenty could shift by Caucus Day on Jan. 15.\n\nA majority, or 52%, of likely GOP caucusgoers have a first choice for president and say they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate, while 40% say their minds are made up. Seven percent do not have a first-choice candidate.\n\nIn addition, just 7% of poll respondents say they are considering only one candidate for president. Seventeen percent say they are considering two candidates; 19% say three; and 55%, four or more.\n\nThe poll of 406 likely Republican caucusgoers was conducted Aug. 13-17 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\n\nIt is the Iowa’s Poll’s first test of the field of 14 Republican candidates vying for their party’s chance to take on Democratic President Joe Biden in 2024.\n\nIn addition to the top contenders, seven other candidates are polling at 2% or lower.\n\nThey include North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who is at 2%, and former U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, who has 1%.\n\nBusinessman Ryan Binkley, conservative radio host Larry Elder, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, businessman Perry Johnson and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez all register below 1%.\n\nAs they think about which candidate to support, 65% of poll respondents say it’s most important to find a candidate who comes closest to their own views on issues, while 29% say it’s most important to pick a candidate who has the best chance of defeating Biden.\n\nDonald Trump’s legal challenges may be helping him in Iowa\n\nEven as Trump faces mounting legal troubles, his support appears only to grow.\n\nA grand jury in Georgia indicted Trump Aug. 15 for allegedly attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election there.\n\nThe Iowa Poll, which was conducted Aug. 13-17, showed greater support for Trump in the days after the indictment was unveiled.\n\nIn the days before the indictment, Trump led DeSantis 38% to 20%. In the days after, his lead grew to 43% over DeSantis’ 18%.\n\nTrump’s Iowa footprint, combining his first-choice support, second choice and those actively considering him, also increased 12 percentage points after the Georgia indictment was announced — from 55% to 67%.\n\nDonald Trump leads, but Ron DeSantis and Tim Scott have room to grow\n\nAlthough Trump leads overall, the poll measures candidates’ full footprint of support in Iowa, where caucusgoers are known for considering many candidates before slowly zeroing in on one person by Caucus Day.\n\nThe footprint adds together those who say the candidate is their first choice for president, those who say the candidate is their second choice and those who are actively considering supporting the candidate.By that measure, about as many likely GOP caucusgoers are considering DeSantis as are considering Trump.\n\nTrump’s Iowa footprint includes the 42% who say he is their first choice for president, 10% who say he is their second choice and 12% who say they are actively considering him. That’s 63%, or nearly two-thirds of likely Republican caucusgoers, who are considering caucusing for Trump.\n\nDeSantis’ support includes the 19% who name him as their first choice, 20% who say he is their second choice and 22% who say they are actively considering him — totaling 61%.\n\nScott is the only other candidate whose Iowa footprint tops 50%.\n\nIn addition to the 9% who say Scott is their first choice for president, 15% say he is their second choice and 29% say they are actively considering him. That gives him an Iowa footprint of 53%.\n\nHaley’s Iowa footprint totals 40%, Ramaswamy’s is 34% and Pence’s is 31%.\n\nSelzer said other candidates have the opportunity to gain on Trump and turn people who are actively considering them into firm supporters, but “there’s a lot of work to be done.”\n\nTrump’s support is more firmly locked in than DeSantis’; 66% of those who name Trump as their first choice say their minds are made up, while 34% say they could be persuaded to support someone else.\n\nFor DeSantis, it’s nearly the inverse, with 31% who say their minds are made up and 69% who could be persuaded.\n\nMore:Donald Trump, at Iowa fair, woos crowds, rebuffs 'wise guy' question on taking plea deal\n\nTrump also leads DeSantis among self-identified Republicans, the core of caucusgoers, 51% to 20%.\n\nAmong those who say they will be attending their first caucus in January, Trump leads the Florida governor 47% to 18%.\n\nAnd among evangelicals, an influential group in Iowa that’s often key to a caucus win, Trump leads with 47% who say he is their first choice for president. He’s followed by DeSantis, who gets 20% of evangelicals and Scott who gets 7%.\n\nPhil Marchand, a 42-year-old Sergeant Bluffs resident and poll respondent, said he caucused for Trump ahead of the 2016 election and has been “on the Trump train” ever since.\n\nMarchand is steadfast in his support for Trump in the current election cycle. He said he considered other Republican candidates, including DeSantis and Scott, but ultimately decided to caucus again for the former president come January.\n\n“The more time I spend listening to DeSantis and the more I listen to the things Trump is saying, the more I think that it has to be (Trump). It can’t be anyone else,” he said.\n\nMore:Trump is wrestling with 5 big legal cases. Here's how they may collide with the campaign calendar.\n\nMarchand said he appreciates Trump’s “America first” approach to foreign policy and his efforts to grow the economy and jobs.\n\nIf Trump does not receive the Republican nomination, Marchand said he would likely register as an independent and vote for a third-party candidate.\n\nIndependent caucusgoers could be ‘the way in’ for Trump challengers\n\nAmong independents, Trump and DeSantis are nearly evenly split, with 21% supporting Trump as their first choice and 19% supporting DeSantis.\n\nAnother 13% of independents support Scott, 12% support Christie, 10% support Haley and 6% each support Pence and Ramaswamy. No other candidate tops 5% with independents.\n\nSelf-identified independents who say they will likely caucus with Republicans make up 25% of the poll’s respondents.\n\n“To me, that's a little bit of something to be paying attention to,” Selzer said. “Because we've seen this happen in the past. A non-Trump candidate could say, 'I've got to get people to come to the caucus who are outside of the GOP base.’ So, if a candidate can grow the people who are coming to the caucuses, that is the way in, because Trump is strong with that base.”\n\nBrian Alstrom, a 48-year-old independent voter and poll respondent, said he would consider caucusing in January — if it looks like some of the candidates opposing Trump have a chance.\n\n“I did vote for him both times because it was the lesser of two evils,” Alstrom said of Trump’s 2016 and 2020 campaigns. “But it was hard to even listen to him speak. I’m just done with him. Hopefully I don’t have to vote for him again, because I’m not going to vote for Joe Biden.”\n\nAlstrom, who is a Dorchester resident, said he’s soured on Trump’s personal approach to managing conflicts and his combative attitude. He said DeSantis is his top choice for president, followed by Scott.\n\nIn DeSantis, Alstrom sees an appealing candidate with a “common sense approach” to issues that are important to him, such as the economy and national security.\n\n“Florida speaks for itself in how successful they’ve been,” he said. “... I’d love to see that transfer to the rest of our country.”\n\nDonald Trump has never been viewed favorably by more Iowa Republican caucusgoers\n\nSince his presidency ended and as he has mounted a third campaign for the White House, Trump has been criminally indicted four times, has attacked Kim Reynolds, Iowa’s popular Republican governor, and has held relatively few campaign events in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.\n\nAnd yet, Trump has never been viewed favorably by more of Iowa’s likely Republican caucusgoers than he is now, the Iowa Poll shows.\n\nIn August 2015, Trump was viewed favorably by 61% and unfavorably by 35% — his best showing among likely GOP caucusgoers during the 2016 caucus cycle. Trump went on to finish second in Iowa’s Republican caucuses behind U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nMore:Candidates try to clear GOP debate fundraising hurdles. Is it changing their Iowa strategy?\n\nNow, Trump is viewed favorably by 65%. That includes 42% who view him “very favorably” — the best showing of any of the 2024 candidates. Another 33% view him unfavorably, and 2% are not sure.\n\nTrump’s best showing is among self-identified Republicans, with 77% viewing him favorably and 21% viewing him unfavorably.\n\nHe also does well with those who make less than $70,000 a year (74% favorable, 25% unfavorable) and among evangelicals (74% favorable, 25% unfavorable).\n\nDeSantis’ overall favorability numbers are about on par with Trump’s.\n\nThe Florida governor is viewed favorably by 66% of likely GOP caucusgoers and unfavorably by 29%. Another 5% are not sure.\n\nAmong self-identified Republicans, DeSantis is viewed favorably by 74% and unfavorably by 21% — numbers that are about equal to Trump’s.\n\nMore:Republican presidential candidates woo Iowa's pivotal evangelicals to pry them away from Trump\n\nPoll respondent Rick Williams, a 72-year-old Holstein resident and self-identified Republican, said he considers himself a Trump supporter and believes the former president is being unfairly targeted in the series of criminal indictments that have been unveiled this year.\n\nStill, he plans to support someone else in the caucuses. Right now, he prefers DeSantis.\n\n“Trump supporters are going to support him no matter what if he's the nominee,” Williams said. “But we need the independents. We can't win with just us. We've got to get the independents, and I don't know if he can swing them.”\n\nThe Florida governor has higher favorability ratings with independents than Trump: 52% view him favorably, and 43% view him unfavorably.\n\nMore:Mike Pence is asking Iowans to choose him for president. Some say Jan. 6 is 'holding him back'\n\nFor Trump, it’s the inverse: 44% of independents view him favorably, while a majority, 53%, view him unfavorably.\n\nWilliams, a semi-retired paramedic, said Scott is currently his second-choice candidate.\n\nScott is viewed favorably by 59% and unfavorably by 17%. But a higher percentage — 24% — are unsure, indicating they don’t know enough about him to say one way or the other.\n\nGenevieve Hefel, a 63-year-old Dubuque resident and poll respondent, said she voted for Trump in the 2020 election but has felt her support for the former president wane.\n\nBecause of the recent indictments, Hefel, a retired Army sergeant, said she believes there’s “too much noise” around Trump for him to be able to defeat a Democratic opponent in the general election.\n\nHefel said she’s still considering other Republican contenders in the race, but she’s drawn to Scott’s “positive message and Christian beliefs” and plans to caucus for him.\n\n“He's able to carry on a conversation to get his point across without having to be ignorant or raise his voice,” Hefel said, reflecting on an interview she saw Scott give recently. “He handled it very professionally and calmly, and I thought he made very good points.”\n\nScott does best with those age 55 and older, with 70% viewing him favorably and 16% viewing him unfavorably.\n\nHaley is viewed favorably by 53% and unfavorably by 26%. Another 21% are not sure.\n\nMike Pence, Chris Christie among those with highest unfavorable ratings\n\nSeven candidates are underwater, meaning more likely Republican caucusgoers view them unfavorably than favorably.\n\nThey include Binkley (12% favorable, 21% unfavorable), Hurd (13%-22%), Hutchinson (20%-32%), Johnson (18%-22%) and Suarez (12%-23%).\n\nPence is viewed favorably by 42% and unfavorably by 53%, with 5% who aren’t sure. Even though he’s underwater, a plurality — 33% — say they have a “mostly” favorable view of the former vice president.\n\nBut he holds no advantage with evangelicals, despite his efforts to highlight his own faith and connect with Iowa’s religious conservatives: 43% view him favorably and 51% view him unfavorably — numbers that mirror his overall favorability numbers.\n\nAmong all the candidates, Christie is viewed unfavorably by the greatest share of poll respondents, with 60% saying they view him unfavorably, including 31% who view him “very” unfavorably. Another 28% say they view him favorably and 12% say they’re not sure.\n\nNo 2024 presidential candidate performs better than Iowa’s own Republican elected officials.\n\nReynolds commands the highest numbers, with 81% viewing her favorably (including 50% who view her very favorably), 18% who view her unfavorably and 1% who are not sure.\n\nU.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley is viewed favorably by 73%, unfavorably by 22%, and 5% are not sure.\n\nU.S. Sen. Joni Ernst is viewed favorably by 72%, unfavorably by 24%, and 4% are not sure.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register. Reach her at bpfann@dmreg.com or 515-284-8244.

The sample was supplemented with additional phone number lookups. Interviews were administered in English. Responses for all contacts were adjusted by age, sex and congressional district to reflect their proportions among voters in the list.\n\nQuestions based on the sample of 406 voters likely to attend the 2024 Iowa Republican caucuses have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents — such as by gender or age — have a larger margin of error.\n\nRepublishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit to The Des Moines Register, NBC News and Mediacom is prohibited.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/11/03/andy-beshear-daniel-cameron-tied-kentucky-governors-race-emerson-poll/71436569007/", "title": "With Kentucky governor election days away, new poll has Andy ...", "text": "With early voting open and Election Day coming soon, the Kentucky governor's race has tightened, according to one poll released Friday.\n\nThe new poll from Emerson College Polling has found incumbent Gov.

The two candidates each have 47% support, the poll found, with 4% of voters undecided and 2% supporting someone else.\n\nThe new poll stands in stark contrast to Emerson's last poll, which was released on Oct. 6 and found Beshear, a Democrat, leading by 16 points.\n\nAt the time, Emerson College Polling executive director Spencer Kimball attributed Beshear's lead in part to the candidate's ability to separate himself from President Joe Biden, a fellow Democrat who lost Kentucky by about 26 points to Donald Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nNow, Kimball said, Cameron \"appears to have gained ground by consolidating Republican voters who supported former President Donald Trump in the 2020 election,\" with a 25-point increase in support from Trump voters in a month's time.\n\nUndecided voters who took part in the new poll gave a slight edge to Cameron, who had 49% support compared to Beshear's 48%.\n\nBeshear's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The stadium has a capacity of nearly 50,000 and was a venue for the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics.\n\nThe NFL also announced a doubling of the potential international games from four to eight in 2025, not counting an additional game that Jacksonville has the option of including each year.\n\nThere were five international games this year, three year in London and the first two in Frankfurt, Germany. There will be five more next season — another three in London along with a return to Germany and the addition of Brazil.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nSpain got strong consideration for the bid that went to Brazil, and the NFL made it clear a regular-season game was coming to the European country at some point. A return to Mexico also is expected.\n\n“I think our focus is on looking at where are those next markets based on where the fan passion exists, where the opportunity is to have the greatest impact,” said Peter O'Reilly, the NFL’s executive vice president for club business, and international and league events. “It’s not mapped today, and that’s the flexibility we have working with the clubs.”\n\nAt the December owners meetings two years ago, the league designated home marketing rights for teams in various countries as part of a strategy to build fan growth internationally. Miami is the only team with such rights in Brazil.\n\n“Bringing the NFL to new continents, countries and cities around the world is a critical element of our plan to continue to grow the game globally,” Commissioner Roger Goodell said. “Brazil has established itself as a key market for the NFL.”\n\nPollster IBOPE Repucom published a study in February in which it said the NFL has more than 35 million fans in Brazil. In 2013, only 3 million Brazilians paid attention to the sport, the pollster said.\n\nLocal estimates say 2.5 million Brazilians watched this year’s Super Bowl, almost 20% more in comparison with the previous edition. Brazil has the second-largest international fan base behind Mexico.\n\nSao Paulo Mayor Ricardo Nunes led the Brazilian contingent that made a presentation to owners in Texas, and smiled widely as he held a football during a news conference.\n\n“The right choice was made,” Nunes said through a translator. “With the game in Sao Paulo, Brazil will surpass Mexico as only behind the U.S. in terms of total number of fans.”\n\nThe stadium in Sao Paulo belongs to Corinthians, one of Brazil's most popular soccer teams, and is part of the country's bid to host the 2027 Women’s World Cup.\n\n“We are immensely happy and proud with this partnership,” outgoing Corinthians president Duilio Monteiro Alves said. “There were many months of studies and negotiations, including two visits to Europe and many meetings at the stadium so we could get here.”\n\nIn other news Wednesday:\n\n— Los Angeles will host the Super Bowl to wrap up the 2026 season. That means LA will get a Super Bowl, World Cup soccer and the Summer Olympics in a little more than a two-year span. The 2028 Games will be in Southern California.\n\n— NFL executive vice president of football operations Troy Vincent said the league will seriously consider banning the so-called hip-drop tackle. Goodell echoed Vincent's comments.\n\nThe tackle results in players being dragged down from behind and has led to serious lower-body injuries for Dallas running back Tony Pollard and Baltimore tight end Mark Andrews, among others.\n\n— Vincent dismissed as false a report suggesting the league or Goodell wanted to get rid of the “tush push” quarterback sneak perfected by Philadelphia. Goodell said he wants to hear both sides of the discussion after the season.\n\n“Philly does it better than everyone else. That's a fact,” Vincent said. “You won’t want to punish anyone for doing something well.”\n\n— Vincent said kickoffs have become a “dead ceremonial play” with the infrequency of returns. The league wants to hear ideas from coaches on improving the return rate of less than 20% this season without reversing the progress on injuries.\n\n“We'd like to see that higher, but we also want to make sure the injury rate is addressed,” Goodell said. “We're going to have to do what we've done before, which is make the game more exciting and make it safer at the same time. We've proven we can do that, and we're going to do it.”\n\nThe league is using a one-year rule that allows fair catches anywhere on the field. They are the same as touchbacks, with the ball placed on the 25-yard line.\n\n— Vincent said the league will review the rule that gives the defense the ball at the 20-yard line on a fumble into the end zone and out of bounds. Some argue the offensive team should keep the ball where the fumble happened.\n\n“Many believe it may be too punitive with that penalty,” Vincent said.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Mauricio Savarese contributed from Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/12/13/nfl-to-play-2024-regular-season-game-in-brazil/71908076007/", "title": "NFL set for 2024 regular-season game in Brazil", "text": "Barry Werner\n\nStaff Writer\n\nThe NFL is expanding its international series of games.

They have won two of the past four Super Bowls, they have dynamic stars in reigning MVP Mahomes and All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce, and the NFL has prioritized international growth. Taylor Swift just adds to their good timing.\n\n“We feel like this is our era,” Chiefs president Mark Donovan said. “Based on the timing, the success and the stars, it’s a responsibility to take advantage of this. If we don’t aggressively take advantage of this, that’s a failure.\"\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nThe Chiefs have commercial rights in Germany under the league’s global markets program, meaning they can sign corporate sponsorship deals, hold events to attract fans and sell merchandise as they do in their home markets. That country list includes Austria and Switzerland, as well as Mexico.\n\nThe NFL added a 17th game to the schedule to facilitate playing more games abroad, and it is reviewing Spain and Brazil as future hosts, one of them possibly for the 2024 season.\n\n“It can be looked at as maybe arrogant. I like to look at it as ambitious, but we want to be the world’s team,\" Donovan said. \"We think the opportunity exists today for us to set a foothold that we are the world’s team, that people look at the Chiefs as an international representation of the NFL.”\n\nThey say they have some numbers to back it up, too. The NFL told the Chiefs that they are No. 2 in “revenue generated from the international markets,” Donovan said. He declined to say which team is first, and the NFL didn't comment.\n\nThe Chiefs have played two other regular-season international games, winning in Mexico City in 2019 and in London four years earlier.\n\nThis one is different, though. The global markets program only took effect in January 2022, the Chiefs have another Lombardi Trophy, and Mahomes is increasingly the face of the league following the retirement of Tom Brady.\n\n“From our standpoint, we’re going to be aggressive in looking at additional markets, and we’re going to be aggressive in looking at additional games,” Donovan said. “We think games are the best way to have that foothold activation.”\n\nWith the league studying Spain and Brazil, those two countries are atop Kansas City's list of potential next markets, Donovan said.\n\nThe Chiefs are “talking to the league” about ways to play more international games. As is, they are a big draw around the U.S., so other teams don't want to give up the revenue that comes with a visit from Chiefs Kingdom. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, for example, rejected the Chiefs as the “away” team for their game in Munich last season, Donovan said.\n\nKansas City is the designated “home” team in Frankfurt, as will be the New England Patriots next week against the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nThe Chiefs have spent about $1 million in preparation and fan events for Frankfurt — that includes docking a Chiefs-themed yacht in the Main River. Over the past nearly three years, the team has spent about $3 million on its international efforts, with the majority invested in Germany, Donovan said.\n\n“It’s going to pay off over time,” he said.\n\nThe late Lamar Hunt was an early proponent of going international. The Chiefs have played preseason games in Japan, Mexico and Germany.\n\nA memorable preseason game took place in August 1990 when the Chiefs played the Los Angeles Rams at Olympic Stadium in West Berlin after the Berlin Wall fell and just before reunification. Media reports said there were 55,000 fans.\n\nGrowing an international fan base these days “is much easier to do now because of social media, because of the digital delivery of games,\" Chiefs Chairman and CEO Clark Hunt said this week.\n\nAs for becoming the world's team, Donovan acknowledges it won't be easy.\n\n“It’s a big, audacious goal,” he said.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/12/14/chargers-raiders-tnf-best-bets-anytime-td-scorer-props/71913954007/", "title": "Thursday Night Football: Top anytime touchdown bets for Chargers ...", "text": "Week 15 of the NFL season kicks off with a Thursday night showdown between two AFC West rivals, the Los Angeles Chargers and Las Vegas Raiders. Each team has struggled as of late and comes into tonight's matchup with questions at the quarterback position.\n\nFor Vegas, the question lies in Aidan O'Connell's talent. After signing Jimmy Garoppolo in the offseason, the Raiders have since turned to the fourth-round rookie from Purdue. Through seven games in 2023, O'Connell has just one more touchdowns than interceptions. That ineffectiveness has many wondering whether the Raiders should turn to veteran Brian Hoyer. The Raiders have announced that O'Connell will get the nod, but this could be his last chance to prove himself worthy of the starting role.\n\nThe Chargers' quarterback situation is much more unfortunate. After a tremendous thirteen games from Justin Herbert, the former sixth overall pick fractured his index finger on his throwing hand, forcing him to miss the rest of the season. The Chargers will now rely on Easton Stick, who has never started a game in his nearly four years in the NFL.\n\nWith the Raiders coming off a shutout loss to the Minnesota Vikings and the Chargers opting to ride with Stick, there may not be much hope that either team will find the endzone. Regardless, here are the best anytime touchdown bets for Thursday Night Football.\n\nBest anytime TD bets Thursday Night Football, Week 15: Chargers vs. Raiders\n\n*Odds according to DraftKings\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers TE Gerald Everett (+380)\n\nInexperienced quarterbacks tend to lean on their big men down the middle of the field. In last week's game, Stick targeted Everett four times. That may not seem like a lot, but it was third to Austin Ekeler (5) and Keenan Allen (10), and the latter is out. The Raiders boast a solid secondary, meaning this matchup should create more looks for guys like Everett and Ekeler short. So, why not bet Ekeler then? You could, but Everett's +360 odds would pay out much better than Ekeler's +135 odds.\n\nLos Angeles Raiders WR Davante Adams (+170)\n\nI get it. I don't trust Aidan O'Connell to get this man the ball either, but with running back Josh Jacobs potentially out for this game, the Raiders will need their rookie quarterback to perform if they want any chance of winning.\n\nThe Chargers have allowed five receiving touchdowns to wide receivers over their last five games too. Sure, Jakobi Meyers is always a threat to steal goal-line targets, but Meyers has scored just once through the air in the team's last six games.\n\nAdams is still the team's No. 1 option. He's received double-digit targets in three of his last four games. The Chargers secondary is not good. There's plenty of reason to feel good about Adams' touchdown chances.\n\nNo Touchdown Scorer (+2800)\n\nWe all saw what happened last week with the Raiders against Minnesota. With only three days to prepare for this game, we might see another low-scoring affair in this one. Yes, the Chargers' defense is not as stout as the Vikings, but the Raiders had just three plays in the Vikings' red zone and not one came closer than the ten-yard line.\n\nThe Chargers defense is bad, but not so bad that they're guaranteed to give up a touchdown. After all, they did shut out the Patriots a few weeks ago, and the Raiders aren't too far off from their friends in Foxborough. As is the case with any NFL game nowadays, there is usually at least one touchdown in every game. But each of these teams has had at least one game without one in the last month.

As he has done since stepping onto the world stage, Neymar will carry the expectations of a nation but will have Real Madrid’s Vinicuis Jr. and Barcelona’s Raphinha to support him.\n\nThere is quality all over the pitch, not least in defense, where Chelsea’s experienced Thiago Silva and Paris Saint-Germain’s Marquinhos will likely form a shield for Liverpool’s goalkeeper Allison.\n\nBrazil also has an impressive record to boast, winning or drawing 28 of its past 29 matches, the only loss coming against Argentina in the Copa America final in 2021 and will feel confident of reaching the knockout rounds. It faces a relatively easy group stage, against Switzerland, Cameroon and Serbia.\n\nBrazil has named a strong squad going into Qatar 2022. Justin Setterfield/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nAlongside Brazil, you can’t ignore France.\n\nThe reigning world champion breezed through qualifying without losing a game and has Kylian Mbappe maturing into a global superstar.\n\nHowever, a number of injuries in key positions could harm its chances. Star striker Karim Benzema has been ruled out on the eve of the tournament, while the midfield duo of Paul Pogba and N’Golo Kante – so pivotal to its success in 2018 – miss out. However, central defender Raphael Varane has been included in the squad after recovering from injury.\n\nNielsen’s Gracenote predicts Brazil has a 20% chance of winning the competition, with Argentina, boasting the great Lionel Messi in its squad, the next most likely to lift the trophy with an 18% chance.\n\nSimon Gleave, head of analysis for Gracenote Sports, said: “No other teams have been anywhere near as consistent over the last four years as the two South American giants and this consistency means that there is a good chance of one of them prevailing.”\n\nUnderdogs\n\nIt’s rare that an underdog wins the World Cup but it’s not impossible.\n\nDenmark has its new golden generation. After being knocked out by England in the Euro 2020 semifinals, the team waltzed through World Cup qualification, winning nine of its 10 matches and conceding only three goals.\n\nManchester United playmaker Christian Eriksen is arguably its most important player and his return to the team is nothing short of a miracle.\n\nEriksen collapsed during Denmark’s game against Finland at Euro 2020 and received life-saving treatment on the pitch before being fitted with a Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) device.\n\nSuch trauma seemed to unite the team and the Danes will be a tough proposition for anyone in Qatar.\n\nElsewhere, Senegal is arguably the best African team at the tournament – even without Bayern Munich’s Sadio Mane, who misses out through injury.\n\n‘The Lions of Teranga’ won the African Cup of Nations for the first time earlier this year and have a host of star names playing in Europe’s top leagues.\n\nAlthough Mane will be a massive loss, the team is no longer just reliant on its captain.\n\nChelsea’s Edouard Mendy is a top class goalkeeper and Kalidou Koulibaly is used to dealing with the very best attackers in Europe. It also has the frightening pace of rising star Ismaila Sarr to lean on.\n\nNo African team has ever made it to the semifinals of a World Cup but this Senegal side has a chance, albeit very slim, should the draw be kind.\n\nSenegal celebrated winning the Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year. KENZO TRIBOUILLARD/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPlayers to watch\n\nSome of the best players in the world will be on show in Qatar and, for many, it’s possibly the last chance they have to get their hands on the famous trophy.\n\nMessi and Cristiano Ronaldo are two of the greatest players to have played the game, but neither have had success on the biggest international stage.\n\nMessi has already confirmed this will be his last World Cup and, given he’ll be over 40 when the next tournament comes around, it’s safe to say Ronaldo is unlikely to play another.\n\nBoth are already their nation’s top goalscorers and both have a reasonable chance of going far in the tournament.\n\nAway from the established superstars, though, this could also be a tournament that unearths some lesser-known talents.\n\nIn addition to making its World Cup debut, Qatar is a relatively unknown quantity with most of its players spending their careers in the nation’s top league. The exception is attacker Akram Afif.\n\nThe wideman spent brief spells in Belgium and Spain before returning to Qatar and signing for Al Sadd in 2020. The 25-year-old has since developed into an exciting playmaker and backs up his trickery with efficiency.\n\nAfif made 11 assists during the team’s Asian Cup win in 2019 and currently has eight assists in just seven appearances in Qatar’s top division. He’s one to watch in the opening game.\n\nAnother rising star is Japan’s Takefusa Kubo.\n\nThe playmaker, 21, has learnt his trade at some of soccer’s most prestigious schools, spending time in Barcelona’s youth academy before joining Real Madrid in 2019.\n\nHe’s since left the Spanish capital but has excelled at Real Sociedad this season. He will be an important player in Japan’s World Cup campaign and has already been dubbed the ‘Japanese Lionel Messi’ back home. No pressure, then.\n\nQatar's Akram Afif could be exciting to watch for the hosts. Ralph Freso/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nAmerican star Gio Reyna could also become a global star.\n\nThe 19-year-old, whose mother and father both played international soccer for the US, joined German club Borussia Dortmund in 2019 from New York City’s youth academy and has made big strides, getting plenty of game time in recent weeks after missing a number of games last season with injury.\n\nSpeaking to CNN in 2020, Ghana’s manager and former Dortmund youth coach Otto Addo said Reyna’s ability was clear from an early age.\n\n“It’s his technique under pressure,” he said. “To make no mistakes under pressure, to change direction under pressure and to accelerate in the midfield.\n\n“He also has game intelligence, to position himself always between the lines, to read the game and he knows what’s next. He brings a lot, way more than other players from his age group.”\n\nGio Reyna could make an impact with the US if he manages to stay fit.

Last week, the hospital said his health had worsened as his cancer progressed. He died on Thursday from multiple organ failure due to the progression of colon cancer, according to a statement from Albert Einstein Hospital.\n\nFor more than 60 years, the name Pelé has been synonymous with soccer. He played in four World Cups and is the only player in history to win three, but his legacy stretched far beyond his trophy haul and remarkable goal-scoring record.\n\n“I was born to play football, just like Beethoven was born to write music and Michelangelo was born to paint,” Pelé famously said.\n\nTributes have been pouring in for the soccer legend. Pelé’s first club, Santos FC, responded to the news on Twitter with the words “eternal” shared next to an image of a crown.\n\nBrazilian footballer Neymar said Pelé “changed everything.” In a post on Instagram, he wrote: “He turned football into art, into entertainment. He gave a voice to the poor, to black people and especially: He gave visibility to Brazil.

For me Pele remains the greatest of all time and I was proud to be on the the pitch with him. RIP Pele and thank you.”\n\nBrazil’s incoming President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took to Twitter to pay his respects to Pelé, saying “few Brazilians took the name of our country as far as he did.”\n\n“As different from Portuguese as the language was, foreigners from the four corners of the planet soon found a way to pronounce the magic word: ‘Pelé,’” Lula added.\n\nA public wake will be held for Pelé on Monday at the Urbano Caldeira stadium, popularly known as Vila Belmiro and home to Santos football club, in Brazil’s São Paulo state, according to a Thursday statement from Santos FC.\n\nAt dawn Monday, Pele’s body will be moved from the Albert Einstein Hospital to the stadium. The soccer legend’s coffin will be placed in the center of the pitch.\n\nThe wake at Vila Belmiro will continue until Tuesday 10 a.m. local time (8 a.m. ET), after which a funeral procession will carry Pelé’s coffin through the streets of the city of Santos, including the street where Pelé’s 100-year-old mother, Celeste Arantes, lives.\n\nThe cortege will continue to Pelé’s final resting place, the Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica cemetery in Santos, where a private funeral, reserved for family members, will be held.\n\nDazzling ability\n\nPelé was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento in Três Corações – an inland city roughly 155 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro – in 1940, before his family moved to the city of Bauru in São Paulo.\n\nThe genesis of the nickname Pelé are unclear, even to the footballer. He once wrote in the British newspaper The Guardian that it likely started with school classmates teasing him for mangling the nickname of another player, Bilé. Whatever the origin, the moniker stuck.\n\nExactly how many goals Pelé scored during his career is unclear, and his Guinness World Records tally has come under scrutiny with many scored in unofficial matches. Domicio Pinheiro/Agência Estado/AP\n\nAs a child, his first taste of soccer involved playing barefoot with socks and rags rolled up into a ball – a humble beginning that would grow into a long and fruitful career.\n\nBut when he first took up the game, his ambitions were modest.\n\n“My dad was a good football player, he scored a lot of goals,” Pelé told CNN in 2015. “His name was Dondinho; I wanted to be like him.\n\n“He was famous in Brazil, in Minas Gerais. He was my role model. I always wanted to be like him, but what happened, to this day, only God can explain.”\n\nAs a teenager, Pelé left home and began training with Santos, scoring his first goal for the club side before his 16th birthday. He would go on to score 619 times over 638 appearances for the club, but it is his feats in the iconic yellow jersey of Brazil for which he is best remembered.\n\nThe world first got a glimpse of Pelé’s dazzling ability in 1958, when he made his World Cup debut aged 17. He scored Brazil’s only goal in the country’s quarterfinal victory against Wales, then netted a hat-trick in the semifinal against France and two in the final against host Sweden.\n\nBrazil players hold a banner showing support for former Brazil player Pele after the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Round of 16 match between Brazil and South Korea on December 5. Michael Steele/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\n“When Pelé scored the fifth goal in that final, I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding,” said Sweden’s Sigvard Parling.\n\nFor Pelé, the standout memory from the tournament was putting his country on the sporting map.\n\n“When we won the World Cup, everybody knew about Brazil,” he told CNN’s Don Riddell in 2016. “I think this was the most important thing I gave to my country because we were well known after that World Cup.”\n\nAnother World Cup victory came in 1962, although an injury sidelined Pelé for the tournament’s later stages. Further injuries hampered his next campaign in 1966 as Brazil exited the competition after the group stage, but redemption came in 1970.\n\n“Pelé was saying that we were going to win, and if Pelé was saying that, then we were going to win the World Cup,” Brazil’s co-captain Carlos Alberto said about the tournament.\n\nThat team – featuring the likes of Jairzinho, Gerson, Tostão, Rivellino, and, of course, Pelé – is regarded as one of the greatest ever assembled.\n\nIn the final – a 4-1 victory against Italy – Brazil scored arguably the most famous World Cup goal of all time, a sweeping, length-of-the-pitch move involving nine of the team’s 10 outfield players.\n\nIt ended with Pelé teeing up Alberto, who drilled the ball into the bottom corner of the net. Brazil’s mantra of jogo bonito (the beautiful game) has never been better encapsulated.\n\nPelé, who had considered retiring before the 1970 World Cup, scored a goal of his own in the final and a total of four over the course of the tournament.\n\n“Before the match, I told myself that Pelé was just flesh and bones like the rest of us,” Italian defender Tarcisio Burgnich said after his side’s defeat in the final. “Later, I realized I’d been wrong.”\n\nThe tournament capped Pelé’s World Cup career but not his time in the spotlight. In 1975, he signed a $1.67-million-a-year contract in the United States with the New York Cosmos.\n\nOne of the greatest players\n\nWith his larger-than-life personality and extraordinary dribbling skills – a trademark of his game – Pele’s helped the Cosmos win the North American Soccer League championship in 1977 before officially retiring from football.\n\nThe league, which attracted further big names like Giorgio Chinaglia and Franz Beckenbauer, wouldn’t last, ultimately folding in 1984. But around the world, Pelé’s influence endured.\n\nHe remained in the public eye through endorsement deals and as an outspoken political voice who championed the poor in Brazil. He served as a Goodwill UNICEF ambassador for many years, promoting peace and support for vulnerable children.\n\nHealth problems persisted for much of Pelé’s later life. He got around with the support of a walker – an item he was filmed shoving around with disdain in a documentary released last year – and in September 2021, he underwent surgery to remove a tumor from his right colon.\n\nParis Saint-Germain and France national football team forward Kylian Mbappe (R) and Brazilian football legend Pele take part in a meeting at the Hotel Lutetia in Paris on April 2, 2019. Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPelé’s cancer treatment continued over the past year. He was hospitalized in Sao Paulo in November as the 2022 World Cup was being played in Qatar, prompting an outpouring of support from the global soccer community and beyond.\n\nDebate will inevitably rage about whether Pelé is the greatest player of all time – whether it is possible to compare Pelé’s achievements to those of Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi, who have rewritten soccer’s record books over the past 15 years, or to Diego Maradona, the late Argentinian star who captivated the footballing world in the 1980s and 90s.\n\nIn 2000, FIFA jointly named Maradona and Pelé as Player of the Century, but to some, the outright winner of the award should have been obvious.\n\n“This debate about the player of the century is absurd,” said Zico, who represented Brazil in the decade after Pelé’s retirement. “There’s only one possible answer: Pelé. He’s the greatest player of all time, and by some distance, I might add.”\n\nBefore Christmas, Pele's daughter posted a moving photo with father in hospital. Kely Nascimento/Instagram\n\nExactly how many goals Pelé scored during his career is unclear, and his Guinness World Records tally has come under scrutiny with many scored in unofficial matches.\n\nIn March 2021, he congratulated Portugal’s Ronaldo for passing his “record of goals in official matches” – 767.\n\nThere is little doubt, however, that Pelé was, and always will be, football’s first global superstar.\n\n“If I pass away one day, I am happy because I tried to do my best,” he told The Talks online magazine. “My sport allowed me to do so much because it’s the biggest sport in the world.”", "authors": ["Camilo Rocha George Ramsay Tara John Flora Charner Rodrigo Pedroso", "Camilo Rocha", "George Ramsay", "Tara John", "Flora Charner", "Rodrigo Pedroso"], "publish_date": "2022/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/11/05/nfl-chiefs-dolphins-germany-updates-score-highlights/71442894007/", "title": "Chiefs-Dolphins score: Highlights, top plays, more from Germany ...", "text": "The Kansas City Chiefs hung on to beat the Miami Dolphins to kick off the NFL's Sunday schedule for Week 9.\n\nWith a minute left and the game on the line, Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was unable to corral an errant snap and the Chiefs recovered the football on the fourth-down play.\n\nThis clash of potential AFC championship game contenders started with a lopsided first half.

Both teams have a bye in Week 10. — Safid Deen\n\nWhat NFL games are showing today?\n\nHere are the kickoff times and TV info for all of Sunday’s NFL action.\n\nBye week: Denver Broncos, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, San Francisco 49ers\n\nWinners and losers from Chiefs' win over Dolphins\n\nWINNERS\n\nKansas City Chiefs: The first AFC team to reach seven wins in the 2023 season, the reigning Super Bowl champions cemented their hold on the conference’s projected No. 1 playoff seed and home-field advantage – which is pretty important given the last five AFC championship games have been staged at Arrowhead Stadium. K.C. now rolls into its Week 10 bye week, which is followed by a massive Monday nighter at Arrowhead, a Super Bowl 57 rematch with the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nK.C. D: The Chiefs offense has not been as explosive in 2023, and Sunday’s 21 points fell short of the team’s 23.4-point average entering Week 9. Luckily, the defense has stepped up in a massive way – never more so than limited the Miami Dolphins’ top-ranked offense to a season-low 14 points and just 292 total yards (the Fins’ second-lowest total in 2023). Not only did Kansas City stonewall Miami as it drove for a potential game-tying score on its final possession, Chiefs S Bryan Cook’s 59-yard fumble return for a touchdown at the end of the first half proved to be the difference in the game.\n\nGermany: The league’s second regular-season game in Deutschland appeared to be another massive success, more than 50,000 attending in Frankfurt’s Deutsche Bank Park, a venue designed for Bundesliga soccer matches. Next week, the venue will host the Indianapolis Colts and New England Patriots in this season’s final international game … and we’d expect one more rendition of the late John Denver’s, \"Take Me Home, Country Roads.\"\n\nLOSERS\n\nTua Tagovailoa and Tyreek Hill: To the degree either of Miami’s offensive stars should be under MVP consideration, Sunday was a blow to such candidacy. Tagovailoa passed for 193 yards and one TD in his least-productive game of the season. Worse, his inability to handle Miami’s final snap from scrimmage cost the Dolphins any shot at tying or winning the game deep in K.C. territory. Hill finished with a pedestrian eight catches for 62 yards but also committed the pivotal fumble in a game he’d had circled against his former team.\n\nTravis Kelce: The Chiefs improved to 3-2 in games this season not attended by Taylor Swift. However Swift's beau, TE Travis Kelce, was again quiet with her presumably halfway across the world. Kelce’s three catches and 14 yards were both season lows. However, it must be noted those 14 yards were sufficient to make Kelce the Chiefs' all-time leader in receiving yards (10,941) as he supplanted Hall of Famer Tony Gonzalez by 1 yard Sunday.\n\nDolphins: Though still 6-3 and in strong position to ultimately secure a playoff spot, Miami continues to feed the narrative it beats up on the NFL’s weak links but can’t hang with the big boys. The Dolphins are averaging 39 points in their victories – all against sub-.500 opponents – but just 17 in defeat, each of those occurring against teams also projected to be in the playoffs. Fortunately for Miami, the only team it will face – twice – with a winning record before Christmas Eve is the AFC East rival New York Jets, who are 4-3 and have plenty of problems of their own. — Nate Davis\n\nTwo-minute warning: Dolphins driving\n\nWe're set up for a heck of a finish in Frankfurt.\n\nThe Dolphins have the ball back after holding the Chiefs to a three-and-out. On their first play after receiving the punt, Miami got a 25-yard run by Raheem Mostert to the Kansas City 31 yard line.\n\nWe've reached the two-minute warning.\n\nHuge defensive stop by Chiefs\n\nThe Dolphins had a great chance to tie the game, but their offensive drive ended with two debilitating sacks and a punt.\n\nMiami quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was sacked twice for 11-yard losses on consecutive plays, killing Miami’s drive after it passed midfield.\n\nThe Dolphins offense was somewhat rolling with a chance to capitalize on the Chiefs' misfortune in the second half. But the Chiefs defense got the job down to keep Kansas City’s lead intact.\n\nThe Chiefs took over at their own 10-yard line, after Mecole Hardman returned the punt instead of letting it reach the end zone for a touchback.\n\nThere’s 4:10 left in this game. — Safid Deen\n\nNFL referee speaks German to make penalty call\n\nIf you were wondering if referee Clay Martin spoke a different language after the game's first penalty, you'd be correct.\n\nAfter a false start from Dolphins wide receiver Chase Claypool, Martin said the first part of the penalty call in German.\n\n\"Fehlstart,\" the sixth-year NFL referee said before continuing in English. \"Offense, number 83. Five-yard penalty. Third down.\" — Jack McKessy\n\nFrankfurt crowd sings 'Take Me Home, Country Roads'\n\nIf \"traditions\" can take root after two games, then we have one in Germany.\n\nAs the third quarter of Sunday’s Chiefs-Dolphins game in Frankfurt expired, the crowd at Deutsche Bank Park erupted into a singalong rendition of the late John Denver’s \"Take Me Home, Country Roads.\" Because, naturally.\n\nThe same thing happened at Allianz Arena in Munich last year, when the Buccaneers defeated the Seahawks in Germany’s first NFL regular-season game. — Nate Davis\n\nChiefs' Chris Jones called for crucial penalty\n\nAn unnecessary roughness penalty by Chiefs defensive lineman Chris Jones on third down helped the Dolphins close to within one touchdown.\n\nJones pushed a Dolphins offensive lineman after the third-down play, and the Dolphins made the Chiefs pay one play later. — Safid Deen\n\nRaheem Mostert touchdown: Chiefs 21, Dolphins 14\n\nThe stage is set for a meaningful final quarter.\n\nDolphins running back Raheem Mostert scored on a 13-yard run with 22 seconds left in the third quarter, and the Chiefs are hanging onto a 21-14 lead.\n\nThe Dolphins have scored 14 unanswered in the third quarter, and a crucial Chiefs penalty after a Chiefs turnover have gotten Miami back in this game.\n\nChiefs defensive lineman Chris Jones was called for unnecessary roughness on a pivotal third down, pushing a Dolphins offensive lineman after the play. And the Dolphins made the Chiefs pay one play later.\n\nThe Dolphins regained possession after Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes fumbled after he was sacked by edge rusher Bradley Chubb, and defensive tackle Zach Sieler recovered the ball.\n\nIf the first three quarters were any indication, we could be in for an exciting finish in Germany. — Safid Deen\n\nCedrick Wilson Jr. touchdown: Chiefs 21, Dolphins 7\n\nThe Dolphins have finally found some mojo offensively.\n\nDolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa found receiver Cedrick Wilson Jr. for a 31-yard touchdown, and the Chiefs’ lead has been trimmed to 21-7 with 4:47 left in the third quarter.\n\nThe Dolphins notched their first conversion on third down in the game during the drive, which lasted eight plays, 80 yards and more than five minutes of game time.\n\nTagovailoa was 6 for 6 on the drive to lead Miami. — Safid Deen\n\nThe Taylor Swift effect?\n\nIt definitely seems real as it pertains to the Chiefs and TE Travis Kelce, who’s been – hanging out? – with the mega pop star in recent weeks, though he declined Friday to say whether or not he’s in love.\n\nRegardless, no doubt that Kelce and the reigning Super Bowl champs have played at a higher level whenever Swift is on the premises – which she apparently isn’t today in Germany with her \"Eras Tour\" resuming in South America in recent days. Kansas City is 4-0 this season when Swift is in attendance and 2-2 when she’s got other things to do.\n\nKelce, specifically, has averaged 6.7 catches for 50.3 yards and 0.7 TDs in three games with Swift absent (he missed Week 1 with a knee injury). But when she’s cheering him on from a suite? In those four contests, Kelce has averaged 8.5 receptions for 108 yards and 0.5 TDs.\n\nGoing into halftime, Kelce had two grabs for 7 yards. — Nate Davis\n\nDolphins punter hits scoreboard with kick\n\nNFL punters lofting kicks into a scoreboard became an issue when Jerry Jones hung his massive replay system above the field at the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium. And it's definitely not unusual to see punters try to drill the scoreboard at Arlington, Texas, in pregame warmups, yet it's also happened during games – such plays requiring a stoppage in play and subsequent re-kick.\n\nA similar occurrence took place Sunday at Frankfurt's Deutsche Bank Park, with Dolphins P Jake Bailey drilling the underside of the German scoreboard suspended above the field right before halftime. (He sailed a 48-yarder with his mulligan.)\n\nOf more concern, Bailey has punted five times today – already a season high – while the Dolphins' 41-game streak, including playoffs, of not being shut out before halftime came to an end. — Nate Davis\n\nHalftime score: Chiefs 21, Dolphins 0\n\nThe first half could not have gone better for the Chiefs, while it could not have ended more horribly for the Dolphins.\n\nThe Dolphins were driving down the field in the final minutes of the first half until star receiver Tyreek Hill was stuffed and fumbled in the backfield, leading to a 59-yard fumble recovery touchdown by Chiefs safety Bryan Cook with 33 seconds remaining.\n\nPatrick Mahomes added touchdown throws to receiver Rashee Rice and running back Jerick McKinnon, and the Chiefs own a 21-0 lead on the Dolphins at halftime.\n\nMahomes is 14 of 19 for 147 yards, connecting with eight different receivers in this game, while tight end Travis Kelce has just two catches for 7 yards. Running back Isiah Pacheco has 10 carries for 41 yards.\n\nTua Tagovailoa is 11 of 18 for 89 yards, while Hill has five catches for 39 yards and Jaylen Waddle has two catches for 29 yards and a 12-yard run. But the Dolphins have not had a drive last longer than six plays in this game, going 0 for 5 on third down in the first half.\n\nThe battle between the Chiefs and Dolphins, the top two seeds in the AFC, has been one-sided so far. — Safid Deen\n\nKansas City defensive touchdown: Chiefs 21, Dolphins 0\n\nChiefs cornerback Trent McDuffie stripped Dolphins star receiver Tyreek Hill after a catch, the ball was picked up by Mike Edwards, who lateralled it and safety Bryan Cook returned it 59 yards for a touchdown in the final minute of the first half to give Kansas City a 21-0 lead just before halftime.\n\nThe Dolphins went to their four-minute offense and were charging down the field until Hill was stopped in the backfield and fumbled to his former team. — Safid Deen\n\nJerick McKinnon touchdown: Chiefs 14, Dolphins 0\n\nPatrick Mahomes and the Chiefs are now up two scores on the Dolphins in Germany.\n\nMahomes found trusty running back Jerick McKinnon underneath for a 17-yard catch-and-run touchdown to help the Chiefs take a 14-0 lead with 2:31 left in the first half.\n\nChiefs tight end Travis Kelce was a decoy on the play, freeing up space for McKinnon to roam freely into the end zone.\n\nA penalty by Dolphins edge rusher Bradley Chubb early on extended the Chiefs’ drive to 13 plays and 95 yards. The Dolphins offense has yet to answer in this game. — Safid Deen\n\nHow legit are the Dolphins?\n\nMiami and its top-ranked offense came into Sunday's game with a 6-2 record, good for first place in the AFC East and second overall in the conference. But how good are the Fins? Really?\n\nThat's been the major question this year, all six of the Dolphins' wins coming against sub-.500 teams, their average margin of victory 18.2 points per game. However they're 0-2 against bona fide playoff contenders like K.C., blown out by the Bills and Eagles by an average of 21 points. Consequently, Miami has only cracked the top five in USA TODAY Sports' NFL power rankings once this season, following Week 3's memorable 70-point outburst against Denver. But, currently, the Dolphins sit in the ninth spot, behind clubs like the Chiefs, Jaguars, Bills and Ravens.\n\nToday is another important litmus test for Miami's legitimacy going into January … though it's worth noting, following a Week 10 bye, the only opponent with a winning record on the Dolphins lineup before Christmas Eve is the AFC East rival New York Jets (4-3), twice. — Nate Davis\n\nEnd of first quarter: Chiefs 7, Dolphins 0\n\nPatrick Mahomes led the Chiefs down the field on the first drive of the game. And that was all the offense we’ve seen in the first quarter.\n\nThe Dolphins defense settled into the game on the Chiefs’ next two drives, resulting in punts. But the Dolphins offense has gotten off to a slow start. A penalty and missed block by left tackle Terron Armstead on third-and-15 ending Miami’s second drive. The Dolphins have punted twice.\n\nChiefs receiver Rashee Rice caught Mahomes’ first touchdown pass of the game, while star tight end Travis Kelce has two catches for 7 yards. Star Dolphins receiver Tyreek Hill has two catches for 17 yards to start the game. — Safid Deen\n\nDolphins' Jaylen Waddle returns\n\nAfter leaving the first drive, Dolphins WR Jaylen Waddle was back on the field for Miami's second possession. He took an end around 12 yards and later caught a 17-yard pass that was nullified by a penalty. — Nate Davis\n\nDolphins' Jaylen Waddle injured\n\nDolphins receiver Jaylen Waddle was injured on the second play of Miami’s first drive.\n\nWaddle appeared to be caught under a tackle when running back Raheem Mostert ran toward the right side for no gain on the play.\n\nWaddle was announced to have a knee injury and is questionable to return. He started the drive with a 15-yard completion from Tua Tagovailoa. He has been dealing with a back injury in recent weeks. — Safid Deen\n\nRashee Rice touchdown: Chiefs 7, Dolphins 0\n\nWell, the Chiefs don’t appear jetlagged.\n\nPatrick Mahomes and the Chiefs offense blazed down the field, and are on the board first in this one.\n\nMahomes found receiver Rashee Rice for an 11-yard touchdown on a wide receiver screen one play after a touchdown was taken off the board. Mahomes nearly has an 11-yard touchdown to Justin Watson, but the ball hit the field as Watson finished his catch.\n\nThe Chiefs needed just seven plays and 75 yards to reach the end zone on the opening drive of the game. — Safid Deen\n\nNo European vacation\n\nThe Chiefs and Dolphins have taken drastically different travel approaches to this game, and that's always a fascinating (and highly parsed) component of International Series games played across the Atlantic.\n\nThe Chiefs are 2-0 in international matchups, both occurring during HC Andy Reid's tenure. They beat the Lions in London in 2015 and defeated the Chargers in Mexico in 2019. Coming off a Week 8 loss in Denver's mile-high altitude, Reid opted to let his AFC West leaders recuperate in Kansas City before arriving in Germany on Friday.\n\nConversely, the Dolphins – they're 2-4 internationally, losing the first-ever regular-season game in London to the New York Giants in 2007 – landed in Germany on Tuesday. Coach Mike McDaniel wanted his first international game with Miami to double as a bonding experience for his players while also giving them sufficient time to adapt their bodies to the local time zone.\n\nWho did it better? Verdict in about three hours. — Nate Davis\n\nChiefs get opening kickoff\n\nPatrick Mahomes and the Chiefs offense will be on the field first.\n\nNFL picks Week 9\n\nThe NFL is back, its 104th season set to kick off, and USA TODAY Sports’ panel of resident NFL experts have made their Week 9 picks. Check them out here.\n\nChiefs-Dolphins inactives\n\nThese players will not be in uniform today, no huge surprises.\n\nNFL's international outreach expanding to Brazil and Spain?\n\nGermany has joined England, Canada and Mexico among international countries where the NFL has staged regular-season games since 2007. Sunday morning, during an interview with NFL Network, Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league plans to expand to a new nation in 2024 – Brazil and Spain vying for the honor. — Nate Davis\n\nToday's matchup between Kansas City and Miami – both divisional leaders with 6-2 records which currently own the AFC's top two projected playoff seeds, respectively – marks the NFL's second regular-season game in Germany. Last year, Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Seattle Seahawks 21-16 in front of approximately 70,000 very spirited fans in Munich.\n\nThe Chiefs and Dolphins will meet in Frankfurt, not an hour from where I graduated from high school on a U.S. Army base. Back in the day, Germans very much backed the Frankfurt Galaxy in the old World League of American Football (aka NFL Europe). As I wrote two years ago when the NFL revealed its intention to expand to the German market, \"I was witness to a passionate base of Frankfurt Galaxy fans … even if their enthusiasm for American football often outstripped their education – extra points and punts often drawing far more cheers than first downs or touchdowns. I still can't unhear those ardent chants of 'Goooo, Galaxy' tinged with the local accent. And European fashion being what it was at the time, not unusual to see a local wearing green and purple knockoff Los Angeles Raiders gear, the NFL Properties police opting not to cross the Atlantic to crack down on such unofficial merchandise.\" — Nate Davis\n\nNFL Week 9 odds\n\nOur guide to the NFL betting odds, picks and spreads has you covered with Thursday Night Football odds, Sunday Night Football odds and/or Monday Night Football odds.\n\nIf you’re new to sports betting, don’t worry.

He is the first player in the Super Bowl era (since 1966) to be on the receiving end of 1,000 yards in a season's first eight games. And with nine more contests on the docket, he's on pace to finish with 2,155 – that would shatter Hall of Famer Calvin Johnson's single-season standard (1,964 yards in 2012) – and achieve Hill's avowed goal of becoming the league's first 2,000-yard receiver.

A.J. Brown had 8 catches for 130 yards, Jalen Hurts threw for 319 yards and 4 touchdowns.\n\nAJ Brown gets NFL record as Eagles take 1st lead in 4Q\n\nAJ Brown with a 16-yard fourth-quarter catch on 2nd-and-14 became the first player in NFL history to have six straight games with at least 125 yards receiving. That catch gave him 129 yards on the day.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nThe Eagles then tied the game at 24-24 on DeVonta Smith's 38-yard TD catch with 8:47 left.\n\nThen Reed Blankenship intercepted Howell and returned the ball to the Washington 15. A penalty for unnecessary roughness put the ball at Washington's 7 yard line. One play later, Jalen Hurts threw to Julio Jones in the end zone, and the Eagles had the lead, 31-24.\n\nAs for Brown, Detroit's Calvin Johnson was the only other player with five such games, doing it in 2012.\n\nThe Eagles needed Brown's production. They were on the verge of getting blown out in the first half before A.J. Brown's incredible catch in the corner of the end zone from 16 yards out pulled them to within 14-10.\n\nThe Eagles had a first down at Washington's 16 when Jalen Hurts threw to Brown in the corner of the end zone. Brown reached up with one hand, hauled it in as he was falling down with Benjamin St. Juste all over him, yet still managed to get both knees in bounds.\n\nThe touchdown with 34 seconds left pulled the Eagles to within 14-10. But Washington's Joey Slye responded with a 61-yard field goal with 1 second left in the half, putting the Eagles behind 17-10 at the break.\n\nStill, Brown has 6 catches for 88 yards in the first half. He needs 37 more yards to become the first player in NFL history with 6 straight games with at least 125 yards receiving.\n\nAJ Brown has 2nd TD catch, Eagles tie game for 1st time\n\nBrown, of course, wasn't done. He caught a 25-yard touchdown catch with 4:17 left in the third quarter to pull the Eagles into a 17-17 tie.\n\nThe Eagles kept the drive alive by going for a first down on 4th-and-4 from Washington's 45 yard line. Hurts completed a low pass to DeVonta Smith at the 28, enough for the first down. But Smith had to go down to the ground to catch the ball.\n\nIt seemed questionable. But the Eagles rushed to the line and got a play off before Washington could throw a challenge flag. Two plays later, Hurts connected once again with Brown in the end zone.\n\nThat put him 12 yards short of the record.\n\nTurnover (x2): Jalen Hurts fumbles on tush push at Washington goal line\n\nFor the second time, the Eagles were inside the Washington 5 yard line. And for the second time, the Eagles turned the ball over.\n\nThis time, the Eagles were at Washington's 1 when they lined up for a \"tush push.\" But Hurts never really had control of the ball as he barreled towards the end zone, and Washington recovered.\n\nEarlier in the game, Kenny Gainwell fumbled when the Eagles reached the Commanders' 3.\n\nKevin Byard starts at safety, but Washington shreds Eagles defense\n\nKevin Byard's arrival and Reed Blankenship's return couldn't save the Eagles secondary.\n\nThat's because Washington quarterback Sam Howell completed 19 of his first 20 passes for 185 yards in the first half, and finished the half 24-for-26 for 226 yards and 2 TDs.\n\nThe Eagles also hurt themselves when Kenny Gainwell fumbled after the Eagles had a first down at the Commanders' 3 yard line, poised to cut into Washington's 14-3 lead midway through the second quarter.\n\nThe Eagles have been short-handed at safety for most of the season. And while Byard is still learning a new system, it won't take as long for him to get acclimated as it would for wide receiver Julio Jones, whom the Eagles signed as a free agent last week.\n\nStill, he couldn't make much of a difference early.\n\nLOCAL ICONS:How Phillies Bryce Harper, Eagles Jalen Hurts became heroes from the most painful of losses\n\nSTAFF PICKS:Eagles vs. Commanders predictions: Our expert picks on if Sam Howell can pull the upset\n\nByard, who spent the season with Tennessee, has played in every game this season, so his conditioning is not an issue.\n\nAnd while Eagles coach Nick Sirianni wouldn't reveal how much Byard is expected to play, well, he also made it pretty clear by what he didn't say.\n\n\"We feel like he's had a great week of practice,\" Sirianni said. \"Everything is considered. He's been playing so it's different than Julio as far as the pitch count, as far as health-wise goes. But man, (Byard) is a pro, and he's worked really hard this week, so we're confident in him. We'll see how much he plays in this football game.\"\n\nEagles fall behind 14-3 to Commanders, then Gainwell fumbles ball away\n\nIt hasn't been a good start for the Eagles defense. Washington quarterback Sam Howell has thrown 2 touchdown passes, from 26 and 21 yards out, taking a 14-3 lead over the Eagles with 12:40 left in the second quarter.\n\nIt's the Eagles' biggest deficit of the season.\n\nThe Eagles were on the verge of cutting into the lead, however. Jalen Hurts' 20-yard pass to A.J. Brown gave the Eagles a first down at Washington's 3. On the next play, Kenny Gainwell fumbled the ball away and the Commanders' Phidarian Mathis recovered at the 5.\n\nJalen Carter among 3 Eagles defensive tackles injured early\n\nIt's not a good start for Eagles defensive tackles. Jordan Davis, who was listed as questionable heading into Sunday's game, walked off the field on the Commanders' first drive. Soon after, rookie Jalen Carter did, too.\n\nCarter spent some time in the medical tent, but neither he nor Davis were on the field when the Commanders scored a TD on a drive that lasted three plays. That came on Terry McLaurin's 26-yard touchdown catch.\n\nMilton Williams also left and went to the locker room with a shoulder injury. He returned in the second quarter. Carter and Davis' injuries weren't announced, but Davis had a hamstring injury during the week.\n\nThe Eagles responded with a field goal, and Davis and Carter returned for the next series. Carter, in fact, had 2 QB pressures.\n\nByard teaming with Reed Blankenship at safety\n\nByard isn't the only new expected starter at safety this week. Reed Blankenship is returning after missing last week's game with a ribs injury. Blankenship also missed the Sept. 14 game against the Vikings with a ribs injury. But Blankenship told reporters that he injured a different rib against the Jets on Oct. 15.\n\nBlankenship is the Eagles' full-time starter at safety. So he and Byard will give the Eagles a solid duo at safety.\n\nLast week, the Eagles started Terrell Edmunds, who was sent to Tennessee in the Byard deal, and rookie Sydney Brown, in his first game back after missing three with a hamstring injury. Mekhi Garner, a cornerback signed last spring as an undrafted free agent, was the third safety.\n\nSo by trading for Byard and getting Blankenship back, the Eagles have a lot more depth at safety.\n\nEagles inactives: Jordan Davis playing, but CB Bradley Roby isn't\n\nThe Eagles are relatively healthy for the game. The only injured player on the list of game-day inactives is CB Bradley Roby, who's missing his second straight game with a shoulder injury.\n\nDefensive tackle Jordan Davis was listed as questionable on Friday with a hamstring injury suffered in practice Thursday. But Davis was cleared to play. In addition to Roby, the Eagles inactives are QB Tanner McKiee, RB Rashaad Penny, LB Patrick Johnson, DT Moro Ojomo and TE Albert Okwuegbunam.\n\nJulio Jones is Eagles' only practice squad elevation\n\nJones is the practice-squad elevation for the second time. After three elevations, the Eagles have to either add him to the 53-man roster or keep him on the practice squad.\n\nThe Eagles could have elevated a second player, but decided not to do so. That means Garner, who has already had two elevations, is on the practice squad for this game, so he's not eligible to play.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

Brown has more than revenge on his mind vs. Titans", "text": "PHILADELPHIA − A.J. Brown's twitter handle is \"1Kalwaysopen,\" but Brown said the \"1K\" does not stand for 1,000, as in receiving yards.\n\nBrown would not divulge what it stands for, but the Eagles' wide receiver did make it clear how he feels about that milestone.\n\n\"If I don’t get 1,000, that’s not a good year,\" Brown said. \"That’s not the goal for me. My goal is beyond 1,000.\"\n\nDOUBTING DELAWARE?Eagles' Dallas Goedert doesn't give Delaware a chance vs. SDSU, his alma mater – and why he's upset on IR\n\nDREAM PLAYOFF SCENARIOS:How Eagles' playoff scenarios include clinching Sunday, No. 1 draft pick, trolling Giants\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nThere are a few things about that, though.\n\nThe first is that Brown is at 831 yards this season, needing 169 yards with six games remaining. He just so happens to be playing against his former team this Sunday in the Tennessee Titans, with whom he had an acrimonious breakup last spring.\n\nBoth the Eagles (10-1) and the Titans (7-4) are leading their divisions − the NFC East and the AFC South, respectively. Brown downplayed having extra motivation against the Titans, but he'd certainly like to have a good game against them. Brown has already set a career high with 156 yards receiving against the Steelers on Oct. 30, and he had 155 in the season opener, his first game as an Eagle, against the Detroit Lions.\n\nSo 169 yards in a game is not far-fetched for him.\n\n\"Of course, it means a lot,\" Brown said about facing the Titans. \"But I gotta be a professional about it, keep my emotions down, and just play.\"\n\nThe other thing is that for an Eagles wide receiver, getting 1,000 yards is a pretty big deal. That hasn't happened since Jeremy Maclin had 1,318 yards receiving in 2014.\n\nJordan Matthews had 997 yards in 2015. After that, no other Eagles wide receiver came within 157 yards of 1,000 until DeVonta Smith had 916 yards receiving last season, setting an Eagles rookie record. In 2019 and 2020, no Eagles wide receiver had more than 539 yards.\n\nBrown is on pace for 1,298 yards receiving, which would rank fifth in team history. It would also be Brown's personal best. He surpassed 1,000 yards in each of his first two seasons with Tennessee, then dropped to 869 yards last season while missing four games with an injury.\n\nBut Brown wanted a contract extension in the range of some of the top receivers in the NFL, averaging somewhere around $22 million to $25 million per season.\n\nThe Titans wouldn't do it, and Brown took to social media over the winter to express his displeasure. He even threatened to play baseball in the San Diego Padres organization, the team that drafted him in the 19th round in 2016. Brown had already decided that he was going to college to play football.\n\nThen the Eagles worked out a draft-night trade, sending the Titans a first- and third-round pick, and signed Brown to a four-year deal worth as much as $100 million, with $57 million guaranteed.\n\n\"Of course, I had come to peace about it,\" Brown said about leaving Tennessee. \"The Eagles are 10-1. We’re doing a really good job here. Of course, early on, I had mixed emotions, but (the contract) changed my family’s life forever. That was the goal. So I’m thankful for Tennessee, but I’m here in Philly now.\n\n\"Early on, I wanted to try to finish my career a Titan. I stated that. I learned that it’s a business and that you gotta do what’s best (for yourself) because they’re going to do what’s best for them. You grow up, and that’s what I did.\"\n\nThe Eagles are just as happy to have him. That's especially true for Brown's best friend, quarterback Jalen Hurts.\n\n\"It's been cool to just be able to experience all of these things with him and be along front and center for his journey,\" Hurts said. \"He's doing great things, and he's done a lot of great things this year, and I’m happy for the things he's doing.\n\n\"I know he wants more, and I see that competitiveness in him personally.\"\n\nBut Brown has struggled somewhat since that career-best game against the Steelers. Brown has had 170 yards receiving in the four games since. Brown has also fumbled twice, played through an ankle injury, and a stomach bug last Sunday that left his eye with a red spot from vomiting so much.\n\n\"He's tough as hell,\" Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. \"He’s just got so much toughness and he just fits great into this team with a bunch of guys. ... He was able to fight through a tough week and get himself ready to play.\"\n\nThe Titans, meanwhile, have struggled without Brown.\n\nThey used the first-round pick on wide receiver Treylon Burks, who after a slow start, has played well lately. But veteran Robert Woods, with 351 yards, is the Titans' leading receiver. Tennessee's offense goes through running back Derrick Henry, who is second in the NFL in rushing with 1,048 yards and is first in carries − by a wide margin − with 247.\n\nThe Titans rank 29th in passing, averaging just 176 yards per game through the air. They're also 26th in scoring, averaging 19 points per game.\n\nWhen asked how the Titans' wide receivers have done without Brown, Titans coach Mike Vrabel told a reporter: \"I’m not into midseason report cards. I’ll let you do that. I don’t give a report card.\"\n\nLet's just say Brown would get a better grade with the Eagles. And he knows it.\n\n\"Regardless of how the trade and everything went down, I feel like me personally, I feel like I won,\" he said. \"I say that because, like I said, that changed my family life forever. That’s the goal, especially growing up where I’m from. Of course, I want to do great and help us have a great game, but that’s the reason why we play the game.\"\n\nWill Jordan Davis come off IR?\n\nRookie defensive tackle Jordan Davis said he hopes to play Sunday, the first day he's eligible after missing the required four games on injured reserve, but doesn't know if that will be the case yet.\n\n\"We’ll make a decision at some point,\" Davis said after his first full practice Thursday since suffering an ankle injury on Oct. 30 against the Steelers. \"We’re pushing it. We’re cranking this thing full tilt as far as I can go. I would love to (play), but we have to make a decision that’s smart for everybody.\"\n\nSirianni said before practice Friday that he's \"hopeful\" that Davis will be able to play.\n\nIf Davis is ready to be activated off IR, they could create a roster spot by placing safety Chauncey Gardner-Johnson on IR. Gardner-Johnson suffered a lacerated kidney against the Packers on Sunday night, and Sirianni said he could miss a few weeks. If it's beyond that, an IR decision could be made by Saturday.\n\nDavis had been the Eagles' best run-stopper up until his injury. Since he's been out, the Eagles have signed veterans Linval Joseph and Ndamukong Suh.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

They're also the three most tenured Eagles, going back to 2010 for Graham, 2011 for Kelce and 2012 for Cox.\n\nBut there are other tough decisions at every position. On the one hand, the Eagles have $15 million in cap space for 2023. That figure should increase once the salary cap is set for next season. But that isn't nearly enough to re-sign everybody, especially if the Eagles give quarterback Jalen Hurts an extension after this season.\n\nThat could raise his salary cap hit significantly from $1.9 million in the final year of his rookie contract, thus almost negating the increase in the overall cap.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nHere, then, is a look at the decision the Eagles will have to make at key positions with their pending free agents.\n\nDefensive line\n\nJavon Hargrave, Fletcher Cox and Brandon Graham\n\nThe Eagles already released Cox once, last March, before re-signing him at a reduced rate a few days later. Cox turns 32 next month, and Graham is 34.\n\nBoth are still playing well, but they're also playing less. So it would hard to justify a combined salary cap hit of at least $20 million for the two of them.\n\nAt defensive tackle, the Eagles would be more inclined to choose Hargrave over Cox. Hargrave is younger and has 5 sacks in the last two games. But Hargrave won't come cheaply either. He signed a three-year deal worth $39 million in 2020, and he won't want a pay cut.\n\nKeep in mind, the Eagles drafted Jordan Davis in the first round last spring, so Davis can slide into the role vacated by the player the Eagles don't bring back.\n\nIt's possible that the Eagles let both Cox and Hargrave go and spend big for someone like Washington's Daron Payne, who's five years younger than Hargrave. That's because the other defensive tackles coming back in Davis, Milton Williams and Marlon Tuipulotu are all on their rookie contracts.\n\nAs for Graham, the Eagles don't have an heir apparent to replace him, but they do have the Saints' first-round pick. According to Tankathon.com, that pick is currently No. 6 overall. If it remains in the top 10, the Eagles can get a defensive end who can step right in and play − and for much less money.\n\nOffensive line\n\nJason Kelce, Andre Dillard and Isaac Seumalo\n\nIt's likely that Seumalo, at right guard, is the only one of the three who returns. There's no way the Eagles are skimping on the offensive line, so it's easy to see Seumalo getting a new contract worth more than $10 million per season. After all, everyone from Kelce to Lane Johnson to offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland, has raved about Seumalo’s skill and smarts.\n\nAs for Kelce, it's his choice whether he returns or not. He turned 35 years old last Saturday and he's still at the top of his game. But there's a good chance Kelce will feel comfortable turning the center position over to Cam Jurgens, whom Kelce gave his seal of approval to during the draft.\n\nThe Eagles, no doubt, would love to keep Dillard as Mailata's backup at left tackle. But some team will give the 2019 first-round pick a chance to start next season and pay him accordingly. The Eagles won't. So they can either sign a free agent backup or have Jack Driscoll, who replaced Mailata earlier in the season, serve as the swing tackle.\n\nDefensive back\n\nChauncey Gardner-Johnson, Marcus Epps and James Bradberry\n\nIt's likely going to take more than $10 million a year to re-sign Bradberry and Gardner-Johnson, and likely in the $5 million annual range for Epps. Gardner-Johnson is 25 years old and leads the NFL in interceptions. So he would be a better risk than Bradberry, who's 29.\n\nThe Eagles might also have to pay Epps because K'Von Wallace, the third safety, doesn't seem like he's ready to become a reliable starter.\n\nIf Bradberry doesn't return, the Eagles could be using one of their first-round picks on a starting-caliber cornerback. If it's Gardner-Johnson who's not returning, then safety will be a draft priority.\n\nRunning back\n\nMiles Sanders and Boston Scott\n\nThis isn't an either/or proposition with Sanders and Scott. Rather, it's a decision about whether the Eagles want to go against their organizational philosophy and pay for a running back like Sanders, who's on pace to top 1,000 yards for the first time in four seasons.\n\nIf Sanders leaves, Scott won't become the primary back, and neither will Kenny Gainwell, the Eagles' fifth-round pick in 2021. The Eagles definitely won't pay to keep Scott regardless of what happens with Sanders.\n\nEven if the Eagles do pay to keep Sanders, it's quite possible they'll try to add depth in the draft with someone who could possibly succeed him a year or two down the road.\n\nLinebacker\n\nKyzir White and T.J. Edwards\n\nThis one seems pretty easy. The Eagles drafted Nakobe Dean in the third round last spring, and he can barely get on the field this season. That won't be the case next year. White signed a one-year deal worth $5 million last spring. While he's playing well, the Eagles won't get into a bidding war to bring him back, especially for a significant raise.\n\nThey won't have to pay nearly as much for Edwards, whom they developed as an undrafted free agent in 2019. Edwards is having just as good, if not better, season than White. So he'll stay.\n\nThe rest\n\nGardner Minshew and Zach Pascal\n\nThe Eagles would love to have Minshew return as the backup, but it's more likely that he'll want to go someplace where he'll have the chance to start, and thus earn either top backup money or starter money. The Eagles won't overspend to keep him.\n\nThe only other QB on the roster is Ian Book, who has thrown 20 career passes. The Eagles won't go into next season with Book as the backup. You can book that.\n\nAs for Pascal, he could end up coming back for one more season as a low-cost slot receiver. If not, the Eagles will hope to find someone like Pascal.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

Got it back, saw a lane and just went to the basket.\n\n“I know I’m stronger than most of my opponents, so I battled through the contact. I’m just thanking God for the layup going in. It was a tough shot, but it went in.”\n\nRawls also made the free throw for the go-ahead point, and the fourth-ranked Hawks (10-4) made one more stop to foil the Blue Raiders (10-2). A jump ball was called with 1.1 seconds remaining, giving Woodbridge an inbounds play under the basket. Kejon Mosley cut into the lane and got an off-balance shot off, but it bounced off the back of the rim.\n\n“It was a playoff atmosphere,” said St. Georges coach Rod Griffin, who guided the Hawks into the DIAA championship game before losing to Sanford last year. “They brought a lot of fans from down south. You need these kinds of games as you move toward the playoffs, and I think our guys showed a lot of character.”\n\nSt. Georges was flying high early, scoring the first seven points. Sophomore guard Nah’Shon Hyland reeled off 11 points – including two 3-pointers – in the first quarter as the Hawks built a 20-12 lead.\n\n“We got out in transition,” Griffin said. “We played really good help defense, and in that regard, once we started changing our defenses it threw them off.”\n\nBut the Blue Raiders held the Hawks scoreless for the first four minutes of the second quarter, pulling within 20-17 on a 3-pointer by Mosley and long jumper by Brandon Palmer. Woodbridge continued to gain momentum, taking a 27-26 lead into halftime after Mosley’s steal and layup.\n\n“We came out a little flat,” Blue Raiders coach Julius Cannon said. “Usually we’re the ones who come out aggressive, but we didn’t. We just had to gather ourselves. This is probably the toughest game we’ve played all season… Once we settled down, I think we did fine.”\n\nThe Blue Raiders scored the first seven points of the third quarter, stretching their lead to 34-26 on Cornell Corbin’s fast-break layup. The Hawks battled back, and Rawls’ free throws tied it at 39 heading into the fourth quarter.\n\n“We let our intensity go down, and they were very relentless when it came to going after the boards and hustle plays,” Griffin said of the Blue Raiders. \"… Once they got confidence, you saw a change in the game.”\n\nWoodbridge surged ahead again, as Corbin’s fallaway jumper capped an 11-5 run for a 50-44 lead with 4:26 to play. St. Georges answered with six straight, and tied it at 50 on Hyland’s free throws at the 1:02 mark. Hassan Corbin’s layup with 28 seconds left gave Woodbridge a 52-50 advantage and set up Rawls’ heroics.\n\n“Oh my goodness, what a play,” Griffin said. “… I had two timeouts. I’m trying to decide do I call a timeout, or do I go with what we taught them? Fortunately, I trusted my intuition and I let him go.”\n\nRawls and Hyland each scored 21 points for St. Georges. Hassan Corbin led Woodbridge with 21, and Cornell Corbin added 12.\n\nContact Brad Myers at bmyers@delawareonline.com.

He has caused quite a stir in his first season at the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision level.\n\nHis talent as both a runner and passer puts him No. 3 nationally in FCS in total offense, averaging 355.9 yards per game.\n\nHis 282.3 yards passing per game lead the Colonial Athletic Association and are No. 12 nationally. He also happens to be No. 4 among CAA rushers averaging 73.6 yards per game.\n\n“He only cares about one stat, and that’s us winning,” said Towson coach Rob Ambrose, whose team has done plenty of that with Flacco leading the way.\n\nFlacco will be quite a handful for the Blue Hens – if they can get their hands on him – in Saturday’s 3:30 p.m. showdown between No. 21-ranked Delaware (5-2 overall, 3-1 CAA) and No. 10 Towson (6-1, 4-0).\n\n“I’m happy to be on the field and my whole family is happy for me and excited to see me playing again,” Flacco said.\n\n“These coaches have trusted me to put me on the field. With the success we’ve had, that’s what our whole team envisioned all summer. It’s been fun and we know we’re not done yet and we know we’ve got a tough game this week.”\n\nThe 6-1, 208-pound Flacco, from Voorhees, New Jersey, was recruited by Delaware and offered a scholarship by former coach Dave Brock.\n\nAt Eastern Regional High, his 7,387 passing yards were No. 3 all-time in South Jersey. He also starred in basketball and baseball, in which he was a 32nd-round draft pick by the Phillies.\n\nBut Flacco signed with Western Michigan, where the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach was Kirk Ciarrocca, who held those titles at Delaware when brother Joe was a Blue Hen.

Fleck left Western Michigan for Minnesota after the 2016 season, when the team went 13-1 and played in the Cotton Bowl, Flacco transferred to Rutgers.\n\nHe had to sit out 2017 because of transfer rules and after 2018 spring practice, with several quarterbacks ahead on the depth chart and his degree in hand, Flacco decided to head for Towson.\n\nThe Tigers haven’t been in the FCS playoffs since losing in the 2013 title game to North Dakota State but are on a postseason path now.\n\n“I wouldn’t have changed how I got here at all,” said Flacco, now pursuing a master’s degree in applied information technology. “It’s been crazy but it’s been a good experience. This has been fun being at Towson. This is where I’m happy to be.”\n\nJoe Flacco, who is 6-6 and a drop-back passer, took a similar route to college football success.\n\nHe red-shirted as a Pitt freshman in 2003 before backing up Tyler Palko, who was one year ahead of him, and saw mop-up duty in 2004. Feeling he wasn’t going to get a true competitive shot, Flacco transferred to Delaware, where he should have been eligible immediately but couldn’t play in 2005 because Pitt wouldn’t give him a release.\n\nFlacco then completed a UD record 595 passes in just two seasons for 7,046 yards, second all-time at Delaware, and sparked the Blue Hens trip to the 2007 NCAA title game.\n\nHe was the 18th choice in the first round of the 2008 NFL draft by the Baltimore Ravens, with whom he was MVP of the 2013 Super Bowl and is in his 11th season as a starter.\n\nThe Ravens are in Carolina this weekend so there’s no way Joe could have seen Tom play. He has only been able to attend one game so far, Towson’s season-opening 36-10 win at Morgan State before the NFL season began.\n\nAsked this week whom he’d be rooting for Saturday, Joe gave the expected answer.\n\n“My brother,” said Flacco, who frequently expresses his affection for the Blue Hens and recently made a large financial gift for the Delaware Stadium renovation and Whitney Athletic Center construction to begin in 2019.\n\nIronically, Joe attended the Towson-Delaware game at Delaware Stadium two years ago when he was inducted to the UD Athletics Hall of Fame.\n\n“If you’re playing college football, why not?” Tom Flacco, who has junior eligibility at Towson, said about his own NFL ambitions. “I’ve done well academically but if you’re playing you always have that goal and I feel like I’m gonna have the opportunity.”\n\nFlacco’s success at Towson has allowed him to shed the “running quarterback” label he had, despite his prolific high school passing stats. When he threw for 345 yards in Towson’s second game, a 51-20 loss at Wake Forest, it was evident he could throw.\n\nLater, in Towson’s win against The Citadel, Flacco did run for 185 yards. A week after that, he threw for 319 yards and four touchdowns against Stony Brook, showing his versatility.\n\n“It bothered me because I felt like it was used as a derogatory [term],” he said of that label. “I’ve known that I could throw the ball and do what a quarterback does. To say I’m happy to prove people wrong, I wouldn’t say that. I have a chip on my shoulder but I’ve always had that chip.\n\n“I’m just happy our offense is able to keep it going. Our offense is very adaptable to what the defense is doing. But I know that Delaware’s defense, watching film, they’re good so it’s gonna be a fun matchup.”\n\nDelaware’s defense is among the best in the CAA, having allowed 327.7 yards per game, which ranks fourth. Towson’s 482.9 yards per game of total offense ranks first.\n\nTowson’s offense also features running back Shane Simpson, 10th among CAA rushers and No. 1 in all-purpose yards because of his return skills, and wideout Shane Leatherbury, second in the CAA with 92.1 receiving yards per game.\n\nFlacco has been CAA offensive player of the week three times and is on the watch list for the Payton Award, which goes to the top offensive player in FCS.\n\n“I’ve been very impressed with Tom and his accuracy,” Delaware coach Danny Rocco said. “I’ll use the word 'acumen,' his football IQ. He makes good decisions, kind of like a coach on the field, and his athleticism is probably the bonus to the whole thing. This is definitely a quarterback that can run and not a runner playing quarterback.”\n\nAmbrose had said as much after Towson’s recent win over William & Mary.\n\n“His brain is what starts this,” Ambrose said. “His understanding of defensive schemes and our offense and how it fits against a defensive scheme really comes into play here. He understands what they’re trying to take away and how difficult they’re trying to make it on him and where the benefits come from based on that. You can’t defend everything all the time.\"\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

Biggers", "text": "Martin Frank\n\nThe News Journal\n\nThe Eagles signed a wide receiver and a safety, two positions of need, but they aren't replacements for the glaring holes at those positions.\n\nBoth Seyi Ajirotutu, a wide receiver, and E.J. Biggers, a defensive back, signed one-year contracts Tuesday. It's likely that neither will start for the Eagles, and they likely won't affect the Eagles' needs to address both positions in the draft.\n\nAjirotutu (6-foot-3, 215 pounds) spent four of his five seasons with the San Diego Chargers after signing with them as an undrafted free agent out of Fresno State in 2010. He spent the 2011 season with the Carolina Panthers. Biggers (6-0, 180 pounds) spent the last two seasons with Washington after he was a 2009 seventh-round pick of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers out of Western Michigan. Biggers has played both cornerback and safety in the NFL, although the Eagles will likely look at him as a safety.\n\nAjirotutu, especially, is known for his special teams prowess, which is a need the Eagles had after letting wide receiver Brad Smith leave as a free agent. Ajirotutu was named the Chargers' special teams player of the year in 2014, and led them in special teams tackles in each of the last two seasons.\n\nHe is not considered a replacement for Jeremy Maclin, who signed with the Kansas City Chiefs after having a career-high 85 catches for 1,318 yards for the Eagles in 2014. Ajirotutu has 24 receptions for 420 yards and 3 TDs in five seasons. He has started just two games in his career. Maclin's ultimate replacement could come in the draft, which is considered strong for wide receivers.\n\nAjirotutu is a close friend of new Eagles running back Ryan Mathews. The two went to Fresno State together and were teammates with the Chargers. Mathews signed with the Eagles last month.\n\nIt's the same with Biggers at safety. He'll compete with returnees Earl Wolff, Jaylen Watkins, Jerome Couplin and Ed Reynolds, as well as a likely early-round draft choice to start opposite Malcolm Jenkins. The Eagles allowed Nate Allen to leave as a free agent, creating the opening.\n\nIn five seasons, Biggers has appeared in 76 games with 31 starts. He has 235 tackles, four interceptions, 38 passes defensed and one sack. His best season came in 2012 when he started 12 of 13 games for the Bucs. With Washington the last two seasons, Biggers started 7 of 31 games with one interception.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

Here, then, are the rankings for the 9 players most critical to the Eagles' success this season. They're not necessarily the best players, but those in position to be the most impactful.\n\nNo. 9, Marcus Epps, safety\n\nFor non-Eagles NFL fans, the mention of Epps might elicit a shoulder shrug, or a collective, \"Who?\"\n\nBut Epps is expected to start at safety this season, even after the Eagles signed veteran Jaquiski Tartt last month to go along with veteran returnee Anthony Harris. At the very least, it'll be a three-way rotation with Epps playing a significant role. Both Tartt and Harris are 30 years old, and both are signed to low-cost, one-year contracts.\n\nAs last season went along, Epps, 26, worked in more and more with Harris and Rodney McLeod. Epps, however, has started only eight games in three seasons, and he set a career high last season by playing 48% of the snaps. Typically, starting defensive backs play at least 90% of the snaps.\n\n\"He's played at a high level the times that he's played for us, and you have to be able to do that over the long-haul, snap after snap,\" defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon said during the spring.\n\nNo. 8, Haason Reddick, rush linebacker\n\nReddick will go a long way towards determining if Gannon's strategy to play multiple defensive fronts, essentially adjusting to the strengths and weaknesses of the Eagles' opponent, will pay off.\n\nReddick has had 23.5 sacks the past two seasons with Carolina (11 last season) and Arizona (12.5 in 2020), but from the linebacking position. The Eagles, who finished 31st in sacks last season with 29, no doubt can use that production. That explains why the Eagles made Reddick, who's 6-foot-1, 240 pounds, their first free agent signing, giving him a three-year deal worth as much as $45 million.\n\nReddick will enable the Eagles to use a five-man defensive line in passing situations, something the Eagles were unable to do effectively last season with Genard Avery at that rush linebacker spot. He had 1 sack in 12 starts.\n\nReddick is a major upgrade.\n\nNo. 7, Lane Johnson, right tackle\n\nOne might expect the left tackle position to be the Eagles' most important on the offensive line. And yes, Jordan Mailata's role is critical towards protecting quarterback Jalen Hurts' blindside.\n\nBut there are several reasons as to why Johnson is more vital than Mailata to the Eagles' success this season.\n\nFor one, the Eagles win with Johnson in the lineup. As Johnson enters his 10th season, the Eagles are 66-46-1 when he plays, 12-20 when he doesn't. Johnson missed three games last season to deal with a mental health illness. The Eagles went 1-2 without him.\n\nSecondly, the Eagles have a proven backup at left tackle in Andre Dillard, their first-round pick in 2020. There's a much steeper dropoff if Johnson were to miss games. Finally, Johnson will have a new starter at right guard next to him after Brandon Brooks retired. It'll either be Isaac Seumalo, who's moving from left guard, Jack Driscoll, or second-round pick Cam Jurgens.\n\nJohnson has long established himself as one of the top right tackles in the NFL. He'll have to be again this season.\n\nNo. 6, Jordan Davis, defensive tackle\n\nWhy are the Eagles counting so much on a rookie who's playing behind two veteran Pro Bowl players at defensive tackle?\n\nFletcher Cox was selected to six straight Pro Bowls from 2015-20, and Javon Hargrave was named to his first Pro Bowl last season.\n\nBut look beyond Davis' massive potential as the Eagles' first-round pick, not to mention his size (6-foot-6, 336 pounds) and speed (4.78 in the 40-yard dash).\n\nCox is 31 years old, and both he and Hargrave are in the final year of their contracts. Cox has had just 3.5 sacks in two of the last three seasons. Hargrave, 29, could price himself out of returning.\n\nSo it's practically guaranteed that Davis will be a full-time starter next season. That could actually happen sooner. Ideally, the Eagles would want Davis to play a significant amount in the rotation this season order to maximize Cox's effectiveness. If Davis can't adapt, then it's possible Cox could wear down as the season goes along.\n\nNo. 5, DeVonta Smith, wide receiver\n\nThe Eagles haven't had a wide receiver surpass 1,000 yards receiving since 2014 when Jeremy Maclin did it. In 2020, the year before Smith was drafted in the first round, Travis Fulgham led Eagles wide receivers with 538 yards.\n\nBut it's not about statistics, even though Smith set an Eagles rookie record with 916 yards receiving in 2021. And that was with tight end Dallas Goedert as the only other real receiving threat. Needless to say, Smith often faced the opponent's top cornerback last season.\n\nThat won't necessarily be the case this season after the Eagles traded for A.J. Brown on draft night. That makes it imperative for Smith to take advantage.\n\nThe Eagles had to switch to a run-based attack last season, but that only goes so far, especially in the playoffs.\n\nSomething to watch: The Eagles' record for receiving yards in a season is 1,409, set by Mike Quick in 1983.\n\nNo. 4, Jason Kelce, center\n\nIt's hard to imagine Kelce, who's 34, getting better with age, but that's exactly what happened last season. Kelce had arguably his best season in 2021, and that was with the Eagles starting three different left guards and four different right guards on either side of him.\n\nLast season, Kelce was selected to his fifth Pro Bowl and fourth All-Pro first team.\n\nKelce is a master at calling out defenses, not to mention famous for rushing downfield to block a lineman.\n\nNo wonder Eagles coach Nick Sirianni sent Kelce a keg of beer last winter to coax him into returning for a 12th season. Kelce accepted, of course.\n\nKelce is also durable. He has started 122 straight games, the fifth longest consecutive games streak in Eagles history. It's the longest streak by an NFL center since Chris Myers had 123 straight starts from 2007-14.\n\nThe Eagles drafted Kelce's replacement in second rounder Cam Jurgens − with Kelce's blessing. But don't rule out Kelce putting off retirement for yet another year. Until that happens, Jurgens has a Hall of Fame mentor to learn from.\n\nNo. 3, A.J. Brown, wide receiver\n\nThe Eagles don't just give away first-round picks or hand out nine-figure contracts. That they did both with Brown shows how important he is to the Eagles' offense.\n\nThe Eagles got Brown by trading their first-round pick, 18th overall, to the Tennessee Titans the night of the draft, then signed him to a four-year extension worth as much as $100 million. Only two other Eagles players have gotten contracts worth potentially more − Carson Wentz ($128 million) and Fletcher Cox ($103 million).\n\nThe Eagles haven't had a wide receiver with 1,000 yards or more since Jeremy Maclin in 2014. In three seasons, Brown has surpassed 1,000 yards receiving twice.\n\nBut it's not just the yards that Brown will get.\n\nHe'll also help open up the field for DeVonta Smith. And his effectiveness in the middle of the field, where at 6-foot-1, 226 pounds, he can outmuscle defenders for the ball. He can also serve as a safety valve for quarterback Jalen Hurts, who happens to be his best friend.\n\nNo. 2, Darius Slay, cornerback\n\nSlay has never been afraid to talk a little trash, admit to some lofty goals, or crack a joke. It's what endears him to his Eagles teammates, especially wide receiver DeVonta Smith, with whom Slay has a running competition during practices.\n\nSlay's play is typically good enough to back up his talk.\n\nSo Slay was not about to rest on his accomplishments when he was asked about his goals for 2022 after the Eagles signed former Pro Bowl cornerback James Bradberry to play opposite of him. Last season, Slay led the NFL with 3 defensive touchdowns (2 interceptions, 1 fumble recovery), and he led the Eagles with 5 takeaways. He was named to the Pro Bowl for the fourth time in his career.\n\n\"I just hope, and I ain’t going to lie, I hope (Bradberry) gets 20 picks and I get 20 picks,\" Slay said. \"I hope the whole defense gets 30 picks. We’re ready for whatever. I ain’t scared of no competition. He ain’t scared of competition.\"\n\nThe Eagles' success on defense depends on Slay. Last season, the Eagles' defense ranked 11th against the pass, despite having the second fewest sacks in the NFL.\n\nSlay might not get those 20 interceptions this season, but he'll certainly influence the Eagles' success.\n\nNo. 1, Jalen Hurts, quarterback\n\nAs if it could be anyone else.\n\nHurts is the Eagles' most important player not only because of what he means to their success this season after they spent lavishly on wide receiver A.J. Brown.\n\nThe Eagles also expect improvement from DeVonta Smith, Dallas Goedert and Miles Sanders.0\n\nBut Hurts is also the Eagles’ most important player because of how his success, or lack thereof, will affect the Eagles in the future.\n\nThat's a lot to ask for a quarterback who won't turn 24 until Aug. 7, who completed just 61.3% of his passes last season, yet who led all NFL quarterbacks − and the Eagles − in rushing yards last season.\n\nBut that's where the Eagles are as they hope to improve on their 9-8 season in 2021.\n\nIf Hurts can improve as a passer enough to take advantage of his offensive weapons, then the Eagles can contend for a Super Bowl, and Hurts can thus become the quarterback of the future with the contract to go with that.\n\nIf he can't, the Eagles won't have a good season in the present, and they'll likely have to upgrade at QB for the future.\n\nIf they do it via trade, that will add significantly to their salary cap, and thus prevent the Eagles from addressing other areas of need. If they're drafting a QB, it could mean starting over with a rookie quarterback on a team that's built to win in the next few years.\n\nEither way, the Eagles plans to be a championship contender will be delayed for at least a few years, especially taking into consideration older veterans who likely won't be around, such as Jason Kelce, Lane Johnson, Fletcher Cox, Brandon Graham and Darius Slay.\n\nNo pressure.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

The first of its three buildings won't be done until 2019, and the district's new middle school and high school won't be done until 2020.\n\n\"In this growth time, you have to take into consideration the environment for kids, and we have to make sure we have an environment they can learn in,\" Burrows said.\n\nCape Henlopen School District is in a similar position — residents passed a $130 million referendum, and the district has said rebuilding and remodeling its elementary schools will help it get rid of modular classrooms. The district recently eclipsed 5,200 students and has added nearly 1,000 since 2002.\n\nCape Henlopen's construction will not conclude for several years, between 2018 and 2021, which means the modular classrooms could stay in use for several years.\n\nSTORY: Autism Delaware offering college scholarships\n\nSTORY: Colonial School District gears up for referendum\n\nWithout modular classrooms, class sizes would grow, Burrows said.\n\nThe two schools getting trailers at Appoquinimink already have several classes with 30 or more students, according to the Department of Education.\n\nStudents interviewed by the district ahead of its referendum said large class sizes make it hard for teachers to focus on individuals. The modular classrooms, which have narrow hallways and doors, create backups and cause students to be late for class, the students said in a video.\n\nNevertheless, four temporary classrooms will be placed at Cedar Lane Elementary, which already has trailers but has been growing at a rate of 80 to 100 children a year. Eight will be added at Appoquinimink High School, which is overcapacity. The school is growing at a rate of about 60 students a year and had a fall enrollment of 1,638, according to the Department of Education. It's designed to hold about 1,600.\n\nThere are also modular classrooms at Alfred G. Waters Middle School and Louis L. Redding Middle School.\n\n\"I know those teachers are feeling somewhat disconnected from the building,\" Waters Principal Tom Poehlmann said.\n\nThe modular classrooms house three world-language teachers and a STEM teacher.\n\nSTORY: Middletown race will decide control of state Senate\n\nSTORY: Suspicious package at UD was a battery\n\nThe rooms are on the small side, which makes hands-on learning slightly difficult, though Poehlmann said, for the most part, the modular classrooms are a good short-term solution.\n\n\"We occasionally this year have had problems with the heat not working out there, and there not being heat or air conditioning in the connector,\" he said. \"Not often, but sometimes ... like this morning.\"\n\nFunding for the trailers is not sustainable, Burrows said. The temporary solution has cost nearly $1 million to date, and leasing costs are ongoing. There is no matching state support, which means the trailers must be funded by local revenue, typically raised through taxes.\n\n\"Definitely it's a cost you don't want to have because that cost is 100 percent local,\" Burrows said. \"It comes 100 percent out of your local cost. You'd much rather build something the community can use and will be there for 50 years.\"\n\nBy comparison, the state contributes about 75 percent of costs toward capital building projects.\n\nBurrows said while he hopes the new modular classrooms hold the district over until the new buildings are done, there is a chance it may have to add more, perhaps at Cedar Lane.\n\nThough costly, they are by no means inferior learning spaces, he said. They aren't \"trailers\" per se and are attached to the school by a closed hallway. They are wired for the internet and have all the technology regular school classrooms have.\n\n\"You can't really tell the difference unless you're outside the building,\" Burrows said.\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

We took a look at the backgrounds of candidates across the ballot. Keep exploring this voter guide from Delaware Online/The News Journal to learn more.\n\nHow do I vote in Delaware school board elections?

It has since been changed, as the organization remains nonpartisan.\n\nAt-Large seat\n\nTashiba A. Graham, 40, Townsend\n\nBackground: Tashiba Graham is vice president of operations and innovation for a healthcare system in Pennsylvania. The mother of two has a youngest son in the Appoquinimink School District.\n\nIssues: According to Graham, the focus of her campaign is advocating for students with special needs, school safety and teacher retention. She shared her intention to introduce regular assemblies to combat bullying and violence in schools and address general mental wellness among students.\n\nGraham has stated her support for paying teachers and staff members a more competitive salary and improving incentives for new candidates while also evaluating what factors are working to keep staff members in the district. Engaging family members on resources available for students is another priority of hers.\n\nIn response to ACLU-DE voters guide questionnaire regarding national movements restricting certain curriculum material, Graham remains adamant that policies must be put in place to keep the district’s curriculum factual and comprehensive and protect the rights and inclusion of LGBTQ+ students. Graham has been supported by Appoquinimink Educational Support Professionals, First State Action Fund and more.\n\nEducation roundup:Delaware is 1 of 5 states to get $1 million for tutoring in schools\n\nTimothy W. Johns, 57, Middletown\n\nNote: This candidate did not return any requests for contribution from Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\nBackground: Timothy Johns is an entrepreneur and co-founder of Heaven’s Gate Ministries, which he runs with his wife, Monique, in Newark. As co-founder, Johns oversees nonprofit charity work and established a leadership institute, where he has worked as an educator for 12 years. The U.S Army veteran is a father of four adult children.\n\nIssues: Johns says he's mainly concerned with bridging the achievement gap between students of different backgrounds and accessibilities, while setting students up for success in the global marketplace with leadership skills.\n\nJohns has stated during a public Q&A session that he believes conversations related to sexual orientation and gender identity are “family matters\" and should be left out of the classroom. He proposes setting up a public forum where debates about curriculum censorship can take place and be evaluated fairly.\n\nRestorative justice is another hallmark of Johns’ campaign, he told ACLU-DE in its voter guide, which includes training staff members and SROs about de-escalation techniques. He also proposes enhancing parent participation within the district by holding parent education classes focused on child development and communication.\n\nRaymond J. Petkevis, 45, Middletown\n\nBackground: Raymond Petkevis is a real estate broker for Keller Williams Realty around the Middletown area and recently started a position as Delaware’s principal broker for REAL, a virtual-based real estate company. His two children are students in Appoquinimink.\n\nIssues: Petkevis has mainly expressed concerns about violence in schools, citing outreach from community members worried about student safety. To combat this, reevaluating measures of rule enforcement and the district’s code of conduct have been suggested by the candidate.\n\nThe district’s teacher shortage and dwindling test scores are intertwined with issues related to violence in the district, according to Petkevis. In response to Citizens For Delaware Schools', he also recommended potentially soliciting funding from local developers to go toward the district’s resources and implementing financial responsibility into the curriculum for high school students.\n\nPolls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nAlfred G.

The alumna of Red Clay Public Schools holds a bachelor's degree in dance, as well as another bachelor's degree in English and a master's in education from the University of Delaware. Gilbert is a certified teacher, with experience from K-12 special education to high school English Language Arts, though currently a stay-at-home mother to her four children. Her two daughters and two sons attended private schools in Delaware.\n\nIssues: “Let me be clear,\" wrote this candidate on her Facebook page, operating as a landing pad for other campaign materials. \"The school’s role is to educate, NOT indoctrinate. Reading, writing, mathematics (not Common Core), true history (not Critical Race Theory or whatever name they’ve morphed it to).”\n\nGilbert said plummeting test scores in the district motivate her to run, alongside hopes to boost graduation rates and college readiness. She lists safety, effectiveness, curriculum and transparency as her priorities on her website. Among top-of-mind issues, she also noted parents and guardians \"will have their voices heard.\"\n\nLearning loss concerns:What’s the cost of failing math? Well, for Delaware kids it could be $66 billion\n\nDouglas Danger Manley, 38, Newark\n\nBackground: Manley works at a cybersecurity startup as a software engineer, an industry and occupation he’s found himself in for about 17 years. The Newark resident is also a volunteer firefighter with Mill Creek Fire Company, where he’s been for the past decade. He’s now its president, after having served on the board for three years.\n\nManaging a $3-4 million budget with Mill Creek, Manley told The News Journal/Delaware Online he’s used to dealing with a fixed amount of funding from state and local governments — which leave a “need to squeeze every bit of value out of that funding as we can to provide our services.”\n\nIssues: Manley has no children, and he sees that as an asset. He says this will allow him to maintain a public-service perspective. The candidate shared his focus on supporting resources for Christina School District, sharpening communication and community engagement. He also said protecting students will be a priority, especially gay or transgender children — but he hopes the district “focuses on its mission of education and doesn't get lost in the mire” of various culture wars.\n\nDistrict E\n\nY.F. Lou, 36, Newark\n\nBackground: The single father of two children, enrolled in Christina, works with the state’s health department, where he said his work focuses on improving healthcare for the most vulnerable in long-term care facilities. He also serves as a volunteer firefighter for Aetna Hose, Hook and Ladder Company. Lou's family moved to Delaware from China when he was young, an experience the candidate believes will allow him to advocate for Christina's diverse student body, as he said in a late-March candidate forum. He attended public school in Lewes, graduated from the University of Delaware, and has been a full-time Newark resident since 2012. Lou also attended both University of Southern California and Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health for graduate degrees.\n\nIssues: With an 8-year-old at West Park Elementary — and a 5-year-old headed there in the fall — Lou finds himself motivated by three key issues: safety, community engagement and a goal to \"broaden our students’ horizons.\"\n\nFor Lou, safety includes keeping guns out of schools, \"fostering a safe and welcoming environment for all of our students especially those most vulnerable,\" as well as monitoring environmental health and safety, such as lead. Community and stakeholder engagement, as he put it, focuses on how the pandemic created opportunities to capitalize on for information sharing and family engagement. In terms of broadening horizons, the candidate hopes to see more support of art programs to keep students \"curious and innovative.\"\n\nYong Peng, 53, Newark\n\nBackground: Peng works for the federal government as a software engineer, having previously worked for companies like Delmarva Power and Bank of America. Peng, in one candidate forum, called himself a “happy immigrant” focused on giving back to Delaware. Peng was born in China and came to the U.S. to study. The 15-year resident of Newark has a doctorate in physics, having worked in research and teaching at a few universities before his current line of work. Peng said he has also worked as a math tutor in Wilmington.\n\nIssues: Peng said he sees a “crisis in public education.” Two issues are top-of-mind for the father of two. One, he perceives too much focus on topics that are “ignoring the core curriculum,” which are reading, writing and math. He didn't elaborate. Two, he believes school policies are failing at “enhancing the parent's right to oversee their children’s education.” Peng said his daughter used to study in Christina School District, though no longer, and now he is running for the future of the community.\n\nPolling places, open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nPulaski Elementary School , 1300 Cedar St., Wilmington\n\n, 1300 Cedar St., Wilmington The Bancroft School , 700 N.

Before that, English-Wynn worked in the Department of Labor as a deputy principal. This career, the candidate said, meets more than 10 years of experience in mentorship and advocacy connected to K-12 education and the community. A \"proud alumna\" of Red Clay schools herself, English-Wynn also has a young child entering the district this fall. She said the Wilmington district prepared her for later degrees from Wilmington University and Delaware State.\n\nIssues: The alumna said the impact of both \"a supportive community and quality education\" are keys to students succeeding. She noted three issues motivating her campaign: equity and access, parent engagement and support for educators.\n\nWilmington:They struggled during Ida. Now one Wilmington community is finding a better way to respond\n\nJohn Shulli, 50, Wilmington\n\nBackground: Born and raised in Wilmington, Shulli returned to his home state after 26 years in the U.S. Army and Department of Defense — 22 of which were spent overseas. He works in a civilian job on A.I. policy for the Pentagon, as well as teaches part time as a colonel in the Army Reserve. He graduated from John Dickinson High School before attending Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona.\n\nIssues: Shulli said he's motivated to run by the \"severe\" learning loss faced since the pandemic and highlighted in state and district's statistics. The district must, as he sees it, \"restore our children’s academic standings so they can compete in a local, regional, national and global jobs market.\"\n\nDistrict D\n\nCarlucci Coelho, 53, Wilmington\n\nBackground: Coelho said he came to the U.S. hoping to work as an artist. He has worked in real estate since 2017, as well as the nonprofit sector. He earned a two-year degree in fashion business, according to his website, alongside a parallel degree in costume and set design while studying in Portugal. Though he doesn't have kids enrolled in the district, Coelho said he's been close to the community for over 30 years. Coelho also ran for state representative as a Republican last year, but did not secure a win in District 13.\n\nIssues: Coelho stressed that he is against any kind of bullying, citing that protecting safety in schools is paramount in his platform. Another motivating issue is budgeting, making sure money is distributed \"to those schools and programs who need the most.\" He also said he supports strong academics alongside more vocational training in every school.\n\nIn other background, in response to a question for the ACLU-DE voter's guide about the teaching of U.S. history and whether students have the right to learn free of viewpoint-based censorship, Coelho said parents should have \"the choice of accepting or denying what their own kids have the right or not to read. These children have parents who have different views about life and we must respect all parents views.\" Also when running for state representative, the candidate expressed support for a failed 2022 bill aimed at barring transgender athletes to compete in school sports, saying: \"Woman sports is woman sports.\"\n\nJose Matthews, 27, Elsmere\n\nBackground: Matthews has represented District D on the Red Clay School Board since 2018. Working in the healthcare field in different capacities over the last six years, his day job is working a community liaison for Rockford Center, a community mental health organization. The incumbent lives in Elsmere with his husband, who is a teacher.\n\nIssues: Matthews said he wants to keep up his work. In his first term, he said, the board tackled many issues related to equity around the pandemic, one being transparency. He said he \"was one of the biggest supporters on the board to make sure we continue to provide a Zoom option both to watch the meetings and to participate in public comment.\" If elected, he hopes to continue to offer that access.\n\nRed Clay has fallen behind other northern New Castle County districts, Matthews said, in terms of keep up with building maintenance and competitive salaries. He plans to make that competitiveness a priority, even if it means the district's first referendum in nearly a decade. He also aims to maintain a focus on family and parent engagement.\n\nPolling places, open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nActivity Center at Hockessin PAL , 7259 Lancaster Pike, Hockessin\n\n, 7259 Lancaster Pike, Hockessin AI DuPont High School , 50 Hillside Road, Wilmington\n\n, 50 Hillside Road, Wilmington Baltz Elementary School ,1500 Spruce Ave., Wilmington\n\n,1500 Spruce Ave., Wilmington Cab Calloway School of Arts , 100 N.

For four years, she's handled zoning variance requests on the town of Smyrna's Board of Adjustment. She’s a member of the Alpha Beta Gamma sorority at Delaware Technical Community College, the Holly’s Club and the Boys and Girls Club board.\n\nIssues: Fontaine St. Pierre decided to run for the board because she wants to serve as “a liaison between parents, teachers and the community, providing the best resources for our children's education, and allowing parents to have the most influence in their children's life.” She wants to recognize and prioritize instructors' interests and concerns.\n\nShe said the most important issues in the district are continuing to push for high-quality, intellectually-rigorous education to prepare students for the competitive labor market, providing safe schools, confronting bullying and cyberbullying and expanding self-esteem initiatives for students.\n\nAs for controversial issues such as critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, she said, “An inclusive educational system offers various advantages, including enhanced educational quality for all students and assisting students in becoming more responsive to an inclusive attitude. This could also help with behavioral issues, self-esteem, social skills, and community involvement. All students have the right to a challenging core education and outstanding instruction from well-trained educators. Students should be allowed to have an open and honest discussion about America's past, and they deserve to see themselves and the issues that impact them reflected in their classrooms and books.”\n\nShe encourages parents to attend board meetings to address issues and share comments and insights.\n\nBobbi Jo Webber, 44, Kenton\n\nBackground: A farmer for over 25 years along with her husband on their family’s farm, she has two children, a son who is a freshman at Smyrna High School and a daughter in sixth grade at Clayton Intermediate School. She’s volunteered for 10 years at Sunnyside Elementary and at Clayton Intermediate School, running fundraisers, helping teachers in classrooms and hosting free field trips at her family’s farm.\n\nIssues: Webber wanted to run for school board to improve safety, success of students, transparency and teacher compensation. She believes teachers and staff should hold students accountable for misconduct and follow through with consequences, but also favors hiring constables “who will help pull some of that responsibility off of the teachers so that they can focus on education.” She wants the administration to notify parents “about important issues that occur in the schools – the good and the bad.” She favors competitive pay: “We cannot lose these amazing educators we have to neighboring districts because of financial reasons.”\n\nIn regard to issues like critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, she said, “All races and groups should be represented in our classes. Our students should be exposed to a well-rounded curriculum. Bias and unfounded opinion do not belong in the classroom.”\n\nOn transgender policies, Webber said, “I believe that students can express themselves in a way that they feel is appropriate, although personal expression cannot become a distraction for other students. I do not approve of transgender students using the locker room or restroom of their choice of gender. I feel it could develop into an unsafe and distracting situation for other students.\"\n\nIn curriculum decisions, she said parents and community members should have their opinions represented, but they also need to trust educators to make decisions that will benefit students’ education.\n\nPolling places, open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/05/23/k-12-mental-health-providers-honored-while-new-bills-focus-on-schools/70235193007/", "title": "K-12 mental health providers honored, while new bills focus on ...", "text": "Honors are coming to Delaware professionals helping students navigate mental health challenges, while lawmakers continue a focus on school safety and mental wellness in the General Assembly.\n\nIn this roundup we'll look to catch you up on some Delaware education news you may have missed.\n\nDid we miss another good story?

Comparing notes, swapping stories, drafting demands in hushed tones, their words steeped in an already restless campus atmosphere.\n\nThey had heard of a coalition forming to address concerns of safety and the handling of sexual assault cases. They heard students might get to lead it. Quickly, they agreed on their worst fear.\n\n“I don't want it to fizzle out,” Jayda Tate said to the group, heads nodding around her. “We don't have the luxury of time at Delaware State.”\n\nHundreds already filed out of class, finding megaphones to speak out about feeling unsafe or not taken seriously when reporting assaults. Protesters made noise in Dover that would lead to community meetings, news coverage and discussion during a state budget hearing for the public, land-grant university.\n\nNow, students feel that very catalyst has been muzzled.\n\nDelaware State University made any student who wished to join the Safe Space Coalition, through the core membership or nine steering committees, sign a confidentiality agreement. It would strip over 100 members serving across these committees of free speech on these issues, if they hoped to serve on the new workgroup formed to assess campus safety and existing protocol.\n\nBroad strokes in the agreement bar its signer from sharing “any and all information related to my participation as a committee member,” according to a copy obtained by Delaware Online/The News Journal, for fear that “such willful and unauthorized disclosure violates university policy (and) will be grounds for adverse action.”\n\nStudents stopped answering text messages. Some told this reporter they fear their school could sue them. Others fear pulled scholarships. Most didn’t have time to question the validity in their alarm.\n\nWhat's the 'Safe Space Project?'What a $300K grant for Delaware State University aims to address after student protests\n\nBackground from Dover:Delaware State students are fighting for campus safety. So what's next?\n\nA university spokesperson confirmed these agreements were sent across all members of the new coalition. The chief reason given was the possible handling of sensitive information.\n\n\"We need everybody to be on the same page and respect the privacy and confidentiality of what we're doing,\" said Carlos Holmes, director of news services. \"Once the committees come to decisions with respect to actions that will be taken, or measures that will be implemented, then that will be shared with the campus community.\"\n\nAttorney Alex Morey said she’s never heard anything quite like it.\n\n“It's another level of troubling that they would have students purport to sign away their rights — their expressive rights under the First Amendment — to talk about these issues that are going on, that are clearly of major public concern,” said the director of Campus Rights Advocacy for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE.\n\nStudents have strong rights to speech at public universities, Morey explained, particularly on issues of political and public concern.\n\n“What Delaware State is doing here is really putting these students in an incredibly difficult position,” she said. “Because they're saying we'll let you help us work to use government resources to fix this incredibly important problem — but you can't talk about it.”\n\nThe lid has been on tight in Dover. Delaware State escorted media out of the large town-hall meeting following Jan. 18 protest, while follow-up meetings were also made closed to the public. This marked the second time reporters have been removed from campus recently while trying to cover issues at the institution, including a shooting in September 2022. Several students also said these confidentiality agreements are common for student leaders, such as heads of Student Government Association, but Holmes did not offer confirmation.\n\nClosed to public:Delaware State responds to protest cries with closed-door town hall meeting\n\nMorey cautioned that a “well-meaning” administrator may have tied this privacy notion to discussion of sexual assault, but the public institution “is an arm of the state, using government resources\" and the best practice is transparency.\n\nConfidentiality or anonymity could have been specifically attributed perhaps to any sensitive student information, she said, if any student committee was going to be granted such access.\n\nAnyone participating had to sign. More than 100 students, parents, community members and employees form this coalition, according to a university announcement. The “core” of appointed leaders marries nine separate steering committees that students were free to join:\n\nCampus Health\n\nCounseling and Prevention\n\nCommunications and Customer Service\n\nEmployee Awareness and Safety, Facility and Management\n\nJudicial Affairs and Title IX\n\nProject Resources and Funding\n\nPublic Safety and Student Awareness\n\nEngagement, and Safety\n\nOne student said she wasn't surprised.\n\n“If we can’t be open and honest about what we’re doing, what’s the point?” posed Dynah Mosley, a junior who didn’t join any committees, having expected a document like this one. She stood for hours in protest. She spoke in multiple town halls. She shared her own story as a survivor.\n\nBut the junior said she’s tired of a culture that keeps quiet.\n\n“One of the big topics that I really tried to push for during the town hall was being open and honest,” she said. “If you want this to be a ‘family,’ then you have to be honest with your family. If you want us to trust, you have to build that trust with your family.”\n\nIt’s been nearly two months since the protest.\n\nQuiet, 'early days’ in Delaware State response\n\nAnother student asked to remain anonymous.\n\nConnecting on the phone over spring break, the Dover scholar’s caution remained that simply sharing whether they joined certain committees breaches the signed agreement. Even while personally more comfortable behind the scenes, they can sense its impact.\n\n“It dilutes the very catalysts of creating that change,” the member said of student NDAs. “So it’s interesting.”\n\nTheir committees have had just one introductory meeting so far, this student said, though they hope it’s \"still early days.” It is frustrating, however, having fellow Delaware State classmates unable to see much from the outside, save noticing electricians working on blue-light systems.\n\nIt’s almost dulling the pain, they said.\n\n“It kind of dulls the very reason people became angry — about administration, faculty not handling these cases in the timely order they should be handled,” the student said of sexual assaults. “If you’re asking what the school culture or environment is right now amongst peers. ... It’s kind of been complacent.”\n\nBut this student wants to see more. And ACLU-DE would agree.\n\n'Something's happening to my child':One survivor's family says it knows public safety culture at Delaware State, firsthand\n\nExecutive Director Mike Brickner said the organization has been trying to keep a pulse on campus unrest since the start of the year. He found news of the NDAs striking.\n\n\"Not every single student at Delaware State University is going to be able to participate. Not every single person who lives in the area of DSU is going to be able to participate. Not all of the parents or family members of people who go to DSU are going to be able to participate,\" Brickner said. \"So this is a vent that has essentially cut off that pipeline of public information.\"\n\nThe director since 2020 said if this measure were intended to protect the possible disclosure of sensitive information, it's \"using a sledgehammer to swat a fly.\"\n\nAs his organization continues to watch the university's response, he added, \"It absolutely concerns us.\"\n\nHolding hope for a Safe Space\n\nPresident Tony Allen began pitching the scaffolding of his university response by Jan. 20. Even in what the top administrator called \"initial steps,\" it became clear the coalition would mark central supports. The new workgroup began to form before month’s end, under a prescribed mission to assess protocol and make recommendations to his office.\n\nAllen said the coalition is now tasked with “regular reporting” to the broader university community at least monthly.\n\nOne of the largest announcements yet came last week, to the tune of $300,000.\n\nThe historically Black university’s coalition was awarded a two-year grant to assist in developing its sexual assault response and prevention program. The \"Safe Space Project” will be housed on DSU Downtown, Delaware State announced March 6. The university also committed to continuing its funding after these two years.\n\nLike several measures Allen announced, it joins promises to upgrade campus lighting and cameras, update the blue lights system, garner body cameras for university police and assess existing escort services and counseling hours. Allen did not give an exact timeline for the efforts.\n\nLetter from the president:'It isn't what we say or think that defines us, but what we do' (Opinion)\n\n“I want to emphasize that these are initial steps aimed at immediately improving our current practices,” Allen wrote in a February column. “We will work closely with the coalition and committees as we build out our long-term plan.”\n\nSexual violence isn't unique to Delaware State, but the school saw 10 rapes reported in 2022, four other reports in January alone, and another from a parent Feb. 7. One family recently spoke out about feeling no support when her daughter reported an assault, echoing student protest concerns.\n\nCrime statistics at neighboring University of Delaware show five assaults in 2021, with Temple University recording seven that year. These schools are nearly four times and six times larger than Delaware State in total student population, respectively.\n\nStudent organizers have repeatedly called on their school to “fortify the integrity” of its Title IX process — increasing trust and transparency, while treating cases as time-sensitive — as well as boost security, escort service, counselors for students and facility improvements to building security and water.\n\nThe Dover institution insists it's on a road to change, while experts question certain methods to get there.\n\nFor students, it’s just hard to ignore the clock.\n\n“Delaware State University stalls these types of issues, suffocates them like a flame almost,” said the anonymous student, noting many seniors form the core coalition. “And once you graduate, that’s basically your exit ticket from the university’s issues.”\n\nKelly Powers covers race, culture and equity for the USA TODAY Network's Northeast Region and Delaware Online, with a focus on education.

John Carney's proposed spending plan for the coming fiscal year.\n\nThe governor also hopes to invest in building new schools, libraries and highway improvements, all while restoring some of last year's cuts to nonprofits and the state's prescription drug assistance program.\n\nDelaware residents, meanwhile, would not see any new tax hikes under the $4.25 billion budget proposal Carney unveiled to state lawmakers on Thursday.\n\nHis spending plan instead would use about 60 percent of the $170 million in extra revenue the state is expecting to have next year on one-time spending items.\n\n\"That's a very big number,\" he told legislators. \"But we have to keep an eye on the fact that it's only one time.\"\n\nRELATED:Carney calls for bipartisan approach in State of the State address\n\nRELATED:Delaware House expected to vote on sexual harassment rules this week\n\nThe remaining $70 million of new revenue – a combination of unspent funds from this year and more income next year than was previously projected – would be used to fund new expenses, such as raises and the expansion of existing programs.\n\nMuch of that added revenue depends on how the $1.5 trillion federal tax cuts approved in the December's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will impact state coffers – a large unknown even to Delaware's Finance Department. Carney's budget plan sets aside $10 million to deal with those impacts.\n\nYet Carney told reporters Wednesday that the real challenge will be convincing the General Assembly not to spend more than the 3.5-percent \"sustainable\" budget growth he is proposing – well beyond the 0.3 percent the governor pitched last year.\n\n\"When the Legislature sees surplus revenue in a given year, they think about its availability in that given year,\" he said. \"There is very little focus on the next year and the year after that. My job is to help them focus on that and not to plow unsustainable revenue ... into the operating budget.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Greg Lavelle, R-Sharpley, called Carney's spending plan \"an election year budget.\"\n\n\"It's hard to be against a lot in it,\" he said. \"My biggest concern is where is this money coming from. We have a slow economy by any number of measures and yet we're looking at 3-5 percent budget growth.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf, D-Rehoboth Beach, said the governor's budget proposal is simply a starting point. Lawmakers typically use the governor's proposal as a blueprint for crafting their final spending plan, but it is the General Assembly that ultimately writes the state budget each year.\n\n\"There's a couple of things I like and a couple of things I'm not choked up about,\" he said, citing a desire to restore more of the nonprofit grant funding cut last year than Carney proposed.\n\nSchwartkopf said a possible tax hike also is not off the table.\n\n\"We still need to find a structural fix for our revenue issue,\" he said, noting that state expenses are growing by roughly 3.5 percent per year, while revenues are growing by 2 percent.\n\nTo help address that issue, Carney called for cuts across state government combined with a number of tax hikes to close a $386 million budget gap.\n\nDebate in the General Assembly about those measures led to lawmakers missing a June 30 deadline but ended with a final spending plan that cut spending while raising taxes on real estate transfers, tobacco, and alcohol. A proposed property tax hike was not adopted.\n\nThis year, Carney is proposing to use some of the revenue from those tax hikes to put more money in the pockets of 32,000 state workers, about 40 percent of whom will be eligible to retire in the next five years.\n\nThat includes providing an estimated 12,340 Delaware public school educators with a 2-percent raise at a total cost of $12.6 million. That would be in addition to the $10.2 million that would be used to fully fund pay increases already promised based on years of experience and another $20.9 million needed to cover the cost of hiring about 200 teachers statewide to account for increased student enrollment.\n\n\"We are pleased to see a proposal that invests money in salaries and benefits, particularly through pay raises, and family leave,\" said Mike Matthews, president of the Delaware State Educators Association. \"While it is only the beginning of the process, we look forward to working with Joint Finance Committee and the administration to produce a budget that makes his proposals a reality.\"\n\nThe state's roughly 1,280 correctional officers would receive the raises promised in the labor deal their union struck with the state last summer, at a total cost of $11.1 million. Another $3.6 million would be dedicated to paying for raises associated with officer promotions.\n\nThe added funding will help, but what the state's correctional officers really need is for the roughly 230 vacant positions to be filled, said Geoff Klopp, president of the Correctional Officers Association of Delaware. Understaffing was cited as a contributing factor to last year's 18-hour prison siege at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center that ultimately led to the death of Lt. Steven Floyd.\n\n\"We're satisfied with the direction the budget is going,\" he said. \"But until we get more staff in the facilities, we still have our main struggle and that's what we continue to push for.\"\n\nAbout 12,320 other state employees would get a flat $1,000 increase in pay at a total cost of $12.1. Carney also has set aside $1.2 million in his spending plan to cover the cost of a bill pending in the General Assembly that would provide 12 weeks of paid parental leave to hundreds of new parents employed by the state.\n\nThe Division of Family Services would add 30 new caseworkers to bolster investigations into child abuse and neglect, while 29 new positions would be added to the state's six juvenile detention facilities, under Carney's spending plan. Combined those new hires would cost about $4.6 million.\n\n\"Getting a flat raise really helps the people at the bottom of the pay scale most,\" said Mike Begatto, executive director of the of the Delaware chapter of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees.\n\n\"The caseworkers, for instance, are so dramatically overloaded and make such little money,\" he said. \"Hopefully, these raises will help bring up that bottom salary and make those jobs attractive.\"\n\nThe governor, meanwhile, is asking the General Assembly to dedicate the largest chunk of new spending to a combination of projects and initiatives aimed at improving the state's infrastructure, economy, and communities that he is calling Delaware Reinvest.\n\nThe list of investments using one-time operating revenue and bond funding totals $677.5 million, nearly 15 percent more than last year's capital budget.\n\nThat would include $391 million in federal and state dollars for road improvements and nearly $136 million to cover the state's share of building new schools in the Appoquinimink, Brandywine, Caesar Rodney and Cape Henlopen school districts.\n\nA flat $20 million would be allocated to the state's open space and farmland preservation programs, nearly as much for construction projects at University of Delaware, Delaware State University, and Delaware Technical Community College, and close to $7 million would be earmarked for money to build new libraries in Middletown and Smyrna.\n\nCarney also is suggesting the General Assembly restore about half of the 20-percent cuts in state grants to nonprofits that were enacted last year.\n\nThe governor's budget plan does include some spending cuts, totaling roughly $15 million, through a combination of Medicaid savings, a reduction in contractual employees, a new contract for energy procurement and fewer positions in the Department of Education.\n\nBut those cuts are minuscule compared to the slew of targeted, one-time spending proposals in Carney's budget proposal, such as:\n\nEducation\n\n$16.5 million to help improve education in the five struggling Christina School District school located in Wilmington;\n\n$6 million for the Opportunity Grants program that assists schools serving high poverty and non-English speaking students – a three-fold increase over the current allocation. The program would shift from a competitive grant-program to automatic funding;\n\n$3.8 million for the Delaware Stars for Early Sucess, which offers training for early child care providers;\n\n$1.1 million for the SEED and INSPIRE scholarship programs that help Delaware high school students attend local colleges;\n\nState programs\n\n$7.8 million for renovations at the Carvel State Office Building in Wilmington and to address a backlog of maintenance needs at other state facilities;\n\n$4 million to implement improvements in the Department of Correction, including funds to cover staff training, add behavioral therapy for offenders, install security equipment and cameras, and purchase ballistic vests;\n\nHealth\n\nAn additional $1.4 million to provide more resources for substance abuse treatment, bringing the total federal and state funding to $23.7 million;\n\n$2 million for prescription assistance for Delaware seniors;\n\n$285,000 to fund resources for infants born with drug addictions.\n\n\"The objective here was to make modest, sustainable investments in areas like public education, in our communities and in the economy to create a stronger state going into the future,\" Carney said. \"The emphasis is on the word sustainable.\"\n\nContact reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/18/churchs-reckoning-orphaned-bear-cub-saving-hemlocks-news-around-states/118445044/", "title": "Church's reckoning, orphaned bear cub: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: City leaders have extended a ban on construction of large student housing developments in the hometown of the University of Alabama, where the mayor expressed concern about overtaxing municipal infrastructure and services. The Tuscaloosa City Council unanimously extended a moratorium that began in January 2019 during a meeting last week. The prohibition on permits for large-scale student housing projects will last at least until May 2022. The votes came at the urging of Mayor Walt Maddox, who said more work was needed to create rules and regulations to prevent such developments from becoming a drain on the city of about 101,000. “We’re also exploring some ideas on how do you fairly assess what these developments are costing in terms of city expenses, but we would appreciate a little bit more time to work through this,” he said. Bryan Winter, an attorney who has represented developers, said restrictions adopted last year to slow the spread of student housing already have made it difficult to move ahead with projects that will bring jobs and additional tax revenue. “They’ve already effectively tried to kill any outside investment in Tuscaloosa,” Winter said. “These rules and the moratorium are designed to discourage significant outside investment and revitalization in Tuscaloosa.”\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A comprehensive fiscal policy for the state “must be negotiated and agreed to as whole” and not taken up piecemeal, according to a report from a legislative working group that was charged with making recommendations for the special session that opened Monday. Pieces to which the report said the group agreed as necessary parts of a comprehensive approach include restructuring Alaska’s oil-wealth fund, limiting what is drawn from it and providing constitutional certainty for a dividend for residents. Other elements include a new dividend formula, new revenues, budget cuts and a “healthy” state infrastructure budget, as well as spending cap revisions and possible changes in how the constitutional budget reserve fund works. Lawmakers faced with deficits in recent years have relied heavily on the budget reserve fund, which requires three-fourths support in each the House and Senate to access. The report said that working group members “do not support addressing only one or two issues to the exclusion of others.” It said members recommended considering two approaches to the perennial debate over dividends: placing in the state constitution a dividend formula or constitutionalizing the promise of a dividend that would be based on a formula in law.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A metro-area school district can keep its mask requirement for now, despite a new state law barring such mandates, a judge ruled Monday. Judge Randall Warner declined to immediately put the brakes on the Phoenix Union High School’s mask mandate, but he’s allowing teacher Douglas Hester to proceed with his lawsuit against it. Warner said the new law surrounding school mask mandates doesn’t take effect until Sept. 29, rejecting Hester’s claim that the statute has been in force since the Legislature approved it in late June. The law didn’t get the two-thirds approval needed to take effect immediately. While the ruling rejected Hester’s bid to stop to the district’s policy, Warner made an observation that could prove helpful to the teacher. The judge said Arizona law gives school boards the authority to protect students. But he also said the district failed to cite a legal authority showing the Legislature overstepped its bounds with the new law. Warner noted the law’s effective date is weeks away, saying that “many things could change in that time.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reached another new record for COVID-19 hospitalizations Monday as thousands of students headed back to school. The state reported 46 new coronavirus patients in hospitals, bringing the total to 1,459. That surpasses the record high the state reached last week. The state’s COVID-19 deaths increased by 31. Arkansas’ virus cases and hospitalizations have been skyrocketing in recent weeks because of the ultra-contagious delta variant and the state’s low vaccination rate. Arkansas ranks fourth in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. The hospitalizations spiked as the school year began for thousands of students, most of whom will be required to wear a mask following moves by dozens of districts after a judge blocked the state’s mask mandate. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge announced Friday that she’s appealing the ruling against the mandate ban. “As many children across Arkansas head back to school today, I am praying for a safe and productive year,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who has said he regrets signing the ban into law, tweeted Monday. The governor has said he agreed with the judge’s decision. There are only 22 intensive care unit beds available in the entire state, the Department of Health said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nQuincy: Firefighters are keeping an eye on a lone, emaciated bear cub that may have lost its mother to the country’s largest wildfire. The pointy-eared cub has been seen rambling solo along a mountain road burned by the Dixie Fire near Taylorsville, peering through brush and leaping through plants covered in fire-retardant chemicals. “Generally when you see them with a sow or a mother bear, they’ll stay with the mother bear and run off,” said firefighter Johnnie Macy, who was deployed from Golden, Colorado, to battle the fire. “This bear hasn’t done that, so because of that we think that the bear’s orphaned as a result of the fire.” Macy said Sunday that the team has been monitoring the cub for several days to determine if it is an orphan. A wildlife rescue team was waiting to extract the emaciated cub from the burn-scarred area. Macy called the situation “heartbreaking” but said it is “Mother Nature taking its course.” Earlier this month, a bear cub with burns to its paws and nose was rescued from a fire in eastern Siskiyou County in California. Also this month, an injured cub tunneled out of a Lake Tahoe wildlife care center where he was being treated for burns sustained in a wildfire. The bear has since been spotted in the wild.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Visitors lining Rocky Mountain National Park’s Moraine Park Road and Horseshoe Park shoulder to shoulder while taking in the elk bugling this fall might be asked to mask up. The National Park Service announced Monday that it is immediately requiring visitors, employees and contractors to wear a mask inside all park service buildings and in crowded outdoor spaces regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status or community transmission levels. The park service said the new requirement follows the latest science and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Visitors to national parks are coming from locations across the country, if not across the world,” park service Deputy Director Shawn Benge said in the news release. The requirement will be in effect until further notice and applies to all NPS buildings and public transportation systems. It also applies to outdoor spaces where physical distancing cannot be maintained, such as narrow or busy trails and overlooks. Moraine Park Road and Horseshoe Park attract large crowds of visitors to see elk in September and October, necessitating the park to stage rangers and volunteers in those areas to keep visitors a safe distance from the elk. The park’s shuttle service stations often are crowded, as are some of the more popular overlooks along Trail Ridge Road.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A new use-of-force training program that will be required for all police officers in the state will emphasize “moral courage,” empathy and deescalation in an effort to reduce fatal shootings and other violent acts by officers. Officials believe it is one of the first use-of-force training programs in the country to be mandated across an entire state. Most police departments provide their own such training to officers based on state laws, which can result in patchworks of different standards and interpretations, said Keith Mello, police chief in Milford, Connecticut, and chairman of the state Police Officer Standards and Training Council. “We wanted to do something different and unique, and that is to create one single standard, one policy, one sheet of music by which police officers will be guided in making use-of-force decisions, and one training program,” Mello said at a council meeting during which the training program was unanimously approved. All of the more than 8,000 law enforcement officers in the state must take the four-hour training program by Dec. 31, 2022. They can apply for an extension of the deadline to April 1, 2023, at the latest. The council includes law enforcement officials, policy experts and people who have been negatively affected by the criminal justice system.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A school board postponed its monthly meeting Monday after members of the audience refused to wear face coverings. About 40 minutes after the Brandywine School District Board meeting was set to begin, Board President John Skrobot told the room of about 75 people that the meeting would have to be rescheduled because so many people in the crowd weren’t wearing face coverings. Superintendent Lincoln Hohler cited Gov. John Carney’s universal mask mandate as the reason the meeting could not proceed unless everyone put on face masks. Several school boards, including Appoquinimink and Milford, have faced lengthy public comment periods in recent weeks with parents and community members voicing concerns about students being required to wear face coverings in classrooms. Officials apologized to those in attendance and watching on Zoom seeking information about returning to school, saying they would get that information out in the coming days.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: All health care workers in the city are required to get fully vaccinated under an order from Mayor Muriel Bowser, WUSA-TV reports. Health care workers must have at least their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by Sept. 30, officials said. Employees who qualify for a health or religious exemption can opt out of the shots. The new policy applies to licensed, certified and registered health professionals; EMS providers such as paramedics and emergency medical technicians; and unlicensed health care workers, such as patient care technicians, personal care aides and environmental service staff. Bowser has also announced that D.C. government employees, including teachers at public schools, will be required to take COVID-19 vaccines or submit to weekly coronavirus testing. Government workers have until Sept. 19 to get fully inoculated, Bowser said. Unvaccinated employees who qualify for a health or religious exemption or who choose not to be vaccinated will be required to take a weekly coronavirus test. If they do not comply with the new policy, they will be subject to job penalities.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: A judge refused Tuesday to close pretrial hearings to the media and public in the case of the man accused of killing 17 people in a 2018 high school mass shooting. Broward County Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer rejected a motion by defendant Nikolas Cruz’s lawyers claiming that intense media coverage jeopardizes his right to a fair trial. Scherer did not elaborate on her reasons for denial, saying she would detail them in a written order later. But Dana McElroy, attorney for the Associated Press, said it was the correct decision. “It allows access to all of the hearings and filings in this case of great public concern, which is both contemplated and required by the Constitution,” McElroy said after the hearing. Several media outlets, including the AP, ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox News and CNN, had challenged the closure motion. Cruz’s lawyers contended that open hearings might publicly reveal inadmissible evidence that will never be heard at trial and that news coverage could otherwise create bias among jurors. The Florida Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that pretrial hearings are presumed to be open in most circumstances and can be closed only when there are no alternatives available except moving the trial elsewhere in the state. Prosecutors insist the trial must take place in Broward County.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Test scores fell for students across the state last year, amid questions about what the scores mean with few students taking the standardized tests in some districts. State officials said they believe the scores would have been worse if the missing students had also taken the tests, but they also deemphasized the weight they’re putting on the scores considering class disruptions stemming from COVID-19. The Georgia Department of Education released the annual Milestones test results Monday. Students in third through eighth grades as well as high schoolers take the tests. Federal law requires most of the tests, and the U.S. Department of Education insisted that students take them, despite two requests by Georgia State Superintendent Richard Woods to cancel tests for the second year in a row. “These are traditional tests that are designed to measure student performance in a traditional classroom environment,” Department of Education Chief of Staff Matt Jones said. “And we all know that this past year was anything but traditional. Students and teachers had to deal with an ever-changing environment.” Normally, test results would be used to create report cards for schools and districts with letter grades. That won’t happen this year because Georgia and other states got waivers from the federal accountability requirement.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Lt. Gov. Josh Green, who works as an emergency room doctor on the Big Island, says a minority of unvaccinated people are pushing the state toward another lockdown. “I say we are two to four weeks at this rate from seeing major adjustments in what we’re able to do,” Green said. “It’s a small minority that is otherwise condemning society to a lockdown and potentially large-scale death. No one wants to close down businesses, no one wants to put in curfews, no one wants to curtail regular life or schools, but we have to keep people alive.” Green said all intensive care beds at the Hilo hospital are full – more than half with COVID-19 patients – and as of Sunday 58 of the 68 ICU units at Honolulu’s Queen’s Hospital were occupied, Hawaii News Now reports. In total, Green said 300 people were hospitalized with COVID-19, and of those, at least 270 were unvaccinated. Protesters showed up outside Green’s condo over the weekend. “I’m probably going to be taking care of them in the hospital with my colleagues because they’re going to catch COVID,” Green said. “Those very individuals are condemning everyone in society to a much larger lockdown.”\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: A federal judge says a discrimination lawsuit filed against the University of Idaho by a UI College of Law professor can move forward. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill rejected a request from the University of Idaho to throw out the lawsuit last week, The Lewiston Tribune reports. Professor Shaakirrah Sanders was hired to teach at the College of Law in 2011 and and in 2018 became the first African American to achieve the rank of full professor at the school. She filed the lawsuit several years ago, alleging that she was unfairly denied an associate dean position in 2017, that she faced a variety of unfair conditions and terms of employment, and that school officials retaliated against her when she complained about the treatment. The University of Idaho asked the court to throw out the lawsuit before it went to trial, contending in part that Sanders failed to file the complaint on time and that she failed to show there was a valid dispute about the facts of the case. In his ruling first reported by the American Bar Association’s ABA Journal, Winmill rejected the university’s argument, noting that UI’s Office of Civil Rights and Investigations received at least 35 reports of sexual or racial discrimination at the College of Law during a nine-year period starting in 2011. Those complaints triggered a formal review.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Federal pandemic relief money will be funneled into a $10 million grants program to aid the rebound of tourism in the Prairie State. The Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity said last week that the grants will be handed out to organizations that are starting or enhancing tourism attractions or festivals planned for this year or next. The money comes from the American Rescue Plan Act, doled out to states to help them recover from the economic damage wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis until funds are depleted. Projects most closely aligned with Commerce and Economic Opportunity guidelines will be funded. Grants will range from $10,000 to $1 million. They will require a local matching amount. The Tourism Attraction and Festivals Grant program will develop new attractions or improve existing ones across the state. It is available to a variety of sources including museums, businesses, events, performances and festivals.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor gave his support Monday to the growing number of school districts across the state issuing mask mandates for students and staff as they try to head off more COVID-19 outbreaks. Several of the state’s largest school districts in the Indianapolis area began requiring masks for indoor areas this week after starting the school year without such requirements, reacting to a growing number of coronavirus infections among students as the more transmissible delta variant continues surging. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb said he would continue his policy of allowing local officials to impose mask rules and other steps to stem the coronavirus spread even as several school boards have faced vocal – and sometimes misleading – opposition to such actions. “I think the schools that are putting mask mandates into place are making a wise decision when the facts warrant it,” Holcomb said. “I’m not surprised by the pushback, having lived through the last year and a half.” Holcomb’s stance differs from that of Republican governors in Florida, Texas and other states that have issued statewide orders prohibiting mask-wearing mandates in schools.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A new schools superintendent is apologizing for plagiarizing parts of a welcome letter she sent to district families, acknowledging she copied several phrases word-for-word from a similar letter a New York superintendent authored in 2017. Dr. Christine Trujillo, who started last month as superintendent of public schools in Gilbert, Iowa, admitted that her Aug. 10 back-to-school letter copied from a 2017 letter by Superintendent Gerard Poole of the Shoreham-Wading River Central School District in New York. “I made a mistake and an error, and I apologize for that,” she told the Associated Press in an interview Monday evening. Trujillo said she was in a hurry to get the letter out while preparing for the school year. Her letter to parents misstated the district for which she worked and the time of year, copying these sentences from Poole: “It is an exciting time for the Shoreham-Wading River Central School District, and I’m looking forward to the year ahead. Please accept my best wishes for a happy and healthy summer.” Hours later, she sent a revised letter that deleted those lines without explanation but still kept several other phrases copied from Poole. A district parent notified the AP of the similarities.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Top Republican legislators are accusing Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration of illegally spending at least $86 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds by not getting their approval first. Kelly’s office on Tuesday did not immediately respond to a letter from Senate President Ty Masterson, House Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr., and the chairs of the House and Senate budget committees. In the letter sent Monday, the lawmakers threatened to “explore all necessary legal actions” if she does not seek approval from leaders of the GOP-controlled Legislature before state agencies spend relief dollars. Their dispute centers on relief funds that agencies received before the state’s current 2022 budget year began July 1. The four Republicans contend that a budget measure approved by lawmakers and signed by Kelly in May required an advisory committee’s review and legislative leaders’ consent for any spending starting July 1. “Respect for the rule of law compels you to cease your attempt to circumvent the will of the people as expressed by the Legislature and approved by your own hand,” the Republican lawmakers wrote. Kelly’s office contends the spending in question falls under a plan legislative leaders approved in June 2020, allocating $1.8 billion in federal relief funds.\n\nKentucky\n\nSouthgate: Building on the former Beverly Hills Supper Club site is about to start, but the area where the Cabaret Room stood before fire destroyed the popular dinner club will become a memorial fountain honoring the 165 people who died. Nothing besides memorials has been put at the supper club site in Southgate since the May 28, 1977, fire that left 165 people dead. Survivors and witnesses have said the night still haunts them. Construction will start before the end of the month on an assisted living center, apartments and homes at the former Beverly Hills Supper Club site, according to a release from the builder Monday. In November 2020, attorneys for the developer, Ashley Builders Group, and a group of descendants of fire victims resolved a lawsuit with an agreement to allow building on part of the property. The agreement included a deed restriction to not build on the former Cabaret Room, where most people died in the fire. Plans for a permanent memorial fountain for the Cabaret Room were agreed upon. The Edgewood-based building company and Vision Realty Group have finalized the sale of the property. The planned $65 million Memorial Pointe residential community on the 80-acre site will include a memorial that will be donated to the city of Southgate once it is completed.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A man sentenced to life without parole for stealing a wallet is free after serving 12 years. New Orleans prosecutors agreed to dismiss a habitual offender sentencing enhancement against 65-year-old Henry Phillips, and he was released Monday, The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate reports. Phillips was convicted in 2009 of purse-snatching after prosecutors said he swiped a man’s wallet from a McDonald’s counter and then pretended to have a gun when he was confronted. He stole $20 before he was arrested half a block away. Prosecutors under former District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro invoked his two prior robbery convictions to give him a sentence of mandatory life without parole, according to the newspaper. Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams’ office revisited the case as part of a larger project to review old sentences. “This case could have been a petty theft charge, but it was sentenced like a murder,” Phillips’ attorney, Colin Reingold, of the Promise of Justice Initiative, said in a statement. “In order to restore any sense of trust in our criminal legal system these cases have to be rooted out and purged.” In a letter to the court, the victims of the wallet-snatching said the incident did not damage their lives or emotional well-being, and they backed Phillips’ release.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Despite the pandemic limiting access to lawmakers, corporate and political interests working to influence the State House spent $4 million on lobbyists in 2021. Pharmaceutical companies, cable companies, electric utilities, hospitals and casinos were the handful of companies spending the most on lobbyists. Advocates against youth smoking and the chemical industry were also included, the Portland Press Herald reports. According to disclosure reports filed with the Maine Ethics Commission, Jim Mitchell, an attorney with a longtime presence at the State House, made over $312,000 for his work before the Legislature in the first six months of the year, making him the highest-paid individual lobbyist in Maine. Mitchell’s clients include Comcast Cable Communications, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, Central Maine Power Co. and New England Clean Energy Connect LLC, the newspaper said. The lobbying report also further underscores the revolving-door relationship between state government for both elected and appointed officials and the lobbying industry in Maine. Former state lawmakers were paid thousands for working to influence their former colleagues and incumbents on a range of issues, the newspaper said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: At least 180 Afghan nationals are expected to arrive in the state amid a U.S. effort to evacuate allies from Afghanistan as the Taliban takes over the country. Maryland is prepared to receive even more refugees from Afghanistan as chaos embroils the country during the U.S. troop withdrawal, Gov. Larry Hogan said Monday. “Many of these Afghan citizens – our allies – bravely risked their lives to provide invaluable support for many years to our efforts as interpreters and support staff, and we have a moral obligation to help them,” Hogan said in a statement. The effort is part of “Operation Allies Refuge,” a program that provides Special Immigrant Visas to Afghans and Iraqis who assisted in U.S. efforts during military actions there. Democratic President Joe Biden set an Aug. 31 deadline to withdraw all U.S. forces from Afghanistan and end the conflict that began after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. “The chaotic and heartbreaking scenes out of Afghanistan over the last several days – with innocent civilians running for their lives in fear of the Taliban – is the result of a rushed and irresponsible withdrawal,” the Republican governor said in Monday’s statement. Hogan’s office said Maryland is “ready and willing to receive more” Special Immigrant Visa recipients.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Old North Church, a site pivotal to the freedom of the nation, is the same place where slave owners and traders once worshipped. Now, with a $75,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities announced Tuesday, the foundation responsible for the preservation of the church campus and the visitor experience plans to overhaul its educational programming to better reconcile and integrate those ties to slavery. “We’ll be able to address what I call the paradox of the Old North Church,” said Nikki Stewart, executive director of the Old North Foundation, which is distinct from the active Episcopal congregation that still uses the site for religious services. “People see us as a symbol of liberty and independence, but the reality is that the church benefited from the enslavement of Africans.” For example, the famous steeple was financed in part by the sale of logwood, the harvesting of which was dependent on slave labor, she said. The church, built in 1723, is known to generations of schoolchildren as the place where in 1775 two lanterns in the steeple signaled that the British were heading to Concord and Lexington “by sea” and set Paul Revere on the ride that ignited the American Revolution.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Detroit Jazz Festival announced Tuesday that it will shift to an all-virtual format for this year’s event, which runs Sept. 3-6. No audiences will be present for the performances, which will be streamed and broadcast live and free from closed, indoor sound stages at the Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center. Shows will air on Detroit public radio and television and stream on the festival’s social media channels and website, as well as the DetroitJazzFest LIVE! app. “We’ve followed the COVID-19 numbers on a daily basis,” said Detroit Festival Foundation president and artistic director Chris Collins. The event – the world’s largest jazz festival that is free to attend – is typically held outdoors in downtown Detroit each Labor Day weekend. “Last year, we had great success with the virtual element of our festival,” Collins said. “We built custom soundstages in the Marriott complex, in major ballrooms with 20-foot ceilings and 26,000 square feet of space – huge, well-ventilated rooms. We limited it to performers and essential workers, the sound engineers and photographers and such … about 10 people. So there’s a great amount of control and security that puts the health and safety in proper perspective. A million viewers tuned in from 32 countries to watch the outcome.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A former U.S. Navy diver who helped efforts to search for bodies in the treacherous waters of the Mississippi River after the I-35W bridge collapse in 2007 has returned his awards to protest the Line 3 oil pipeline. John Miller, 39, a native of Monticello who now lives in Hawaii, asked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to stop construction on the pipeline replacement project until lawsuits challenging its approval play out in court, the Star Tribune reports. He spoke at an event Monday evening near the site of the bridge disaster, which killed 13 people and injured 145 others. Earlier Monday, Miller returned a commendation ribbon and pendant he received for his service, as well as a certificate of commendation from then-Gov. Tim Pawlenty. He said he grew up fishing and hunting and wants the pristine lands in northern Minnesota left alone for generations to enjoy. “The last time I came back to the Mississippi in distress was to help clean up after a disaster, and this time I come to do everything I can do to help prevent a disaster,” he said. Opponents say the new Line 3 will risk oil spills in waters where Native Americans harvest wild rice, and it will exacerbate climate change. Enbridge says the new pipeline, which replaces its aging current Line 3, is a safety enhancement that will restore its original capacity.\n\nMississippi\n\nStarkville: Most of the state’s soybean crop is looking good, and so are prices, but some areas are still replanting acres that were flooded in June, Mississippi State University Extension Service experts say. Soybean specialist Trent Irby said 82% of the crop appears in good or excellent shape. Most of the state’s soybean crop was planted at normal times ranging from as early as late March through June after wheat harvest, he said. But he said soybeans were still being planted in mid-July and even late that month, leaving total acreage a big question. “Several areas around the state received big rain events during June that resulted in substantial flooding,” Irby said. “There were also areas impacted days later as rivers and creeks got out and flooded fields.” Agricultural economist Will Maples said prices are good, largely driven by a strong export market. “New crop November soybean futures averaged $13.72 per bushel for the week ending July 23, which is 35% higher than this time last year,” Maples said. “In early June, the November contract reached as high as $14.60 per bushel.” Maples said international demand for U.S. soybeans is expected to remain strong. “At this time of year, the soybean market is trading on the weather. Any weather disruptions on yield could have a price effect,” he said.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The summer surge of COVID-19 is causing a spike in deaths in the state, including 124 reported Tuesday. The state health department said 86 of those deaths were discovered in the agency’s weekly examination of death certificates from across the state, with one tracing to June, 52 to July and 33 to earlier this month. But 38 of the deaths were new, an unusually high one-day total. According to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published Tuesday, Missouri ranked fourth in per capita deaths over seven days – and that doesn’t include the 124 additional deaths. The delta variant of the coronavirus began ravaging the state in June, causing a big rise in cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Experts lay much of the blame on Missouri’s low vaccination rate. The CDC says just 50.2% of Missourians have initiated vaccination, compared to 59.8% of all Americans. Concerns about the spread of the virus have prompted the cancellation of Ozarks Pridefest for the second straight year. Organizers announced the decision Monday, citing the “overwhelming number of hospitalizations caused by COVID-19.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The Blackfeet Reservation east of Glacier National Park implemented a mask mandate Monday after 18 cases of COVID-19 were identified in recent days. The mandate comes even as about 90% of reservation residents are fully vaccinated. In addition to a mask requirement, the tribe announced that its offices would be closed to the public, and it suspended nonessential travel for tribal programs. The travel restriction does not apply to tourists. The Blackfeet Reservation has allowed tourists to return this summer after last summer it closed to visitors to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The tribe’s announcement comes as Montana is experiencing increased spread of COVID-19, with several hot spots including Flathead Valley on the western side of Glacier National Park. The state announced 473 new cases Monday, bringing the number of active cases in Montana to more than 2,700. The state had 191 COVID-19-related hospitalizations on Monday – a number last recorded in January. Of the state’s eligible population, 49% of residents are fully vaccinated against the disease caused by the coronavirus, state health officials reported.\n\nNebraska\n\nSt. Paul: A state trooper shot and killed an 80-year-old man who pointed a rifle at officers after a dispute with a neighbor in the eastern Nebraska town of St. Paul, authorities said. The shooting happened shortly after 12:30 p.m. Saturday while officers were investigating an incident in which one man fired a gun during a dispute with a neighbor. Officers from the Nebraska State Patrol, Howard County Sheriff’s Office and St. Paul Police Department all responded in the town about 23 miles north of Grand Island. The Nebraska State Patrol said the officers found a man holding a rifle near a garage about 10 minutes after they arrived in the neighborhood. The man, identified as John Vogel of St. Paul, didn’t comply with commands to drop his gun and instead raised his rifle. The Nebraska State Patrol said a state trooper then fired his weapon twice, wounding Vogel. Officers gave him first aid until paramedics took him to a local hospital, where he died. The Nebraska State Patrol is investigating the shooting.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Vaccine verification at major venues emerged Tuesday as a coronavirus fighting front, with Las Vegas’ biggest trade conference following the NFL’s Las Vegas Raiders in announcing they’ll require attendees to prove they’re inoculated. The Consumer Technology Association, sponsor of the CES gadget show, said it will require attendees in January to be vaccinated to enter venues including the expanded Las Vegas Convention Center, Mandalay Bay and Sands Expo center. “We understand vaccines offer us the best hope for stopping the spread of COVID-19,” Gary Shapiro, association president and CEO, said in a statement. “We are taking on our responsibility by requiring proof of vaccination to attend CES 2022 in Las Vegas.” The announcement came a day after Gov. Steve Sisolak said indoor venues with 4,000 or more attendees will be allowed to opt out of the state’s mask requirements if they opt in to a program ensuring that attendees have inoculations. The state vaccination rate topped 60% for the first time Tuesday for people ages 12 and older who have received at least one dose. State health officials said 49.5% of residents have been fully vaccinated. In the Las Vegas area, the figures ticked up a notch to 60.7% and 48.6%.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Repeat drunken drivers who seriously injure or kill others will face longer prison sentences thanks in large part to a mother’s advocacy after the death of her son. Gov. Chris Sununu on Monday signed the Tyler Shaw Law, named for a 20-year-old Concord man who died in April 2018. It allows judges to hand down longer prison sentences to those convicted of negligent homicide who have previous drunken driving convictions. At the bill signing, he thanked Shaw’s mother for telling her story, the Concord Monitor reports. Beth Shaw said her experience with the criminal justice system showed her how broken it is. “I could not walk away without trying to make a change to honor Tyler and all the families who have lost loved ones to drunk driving,” she said. The driver who killed Tyler Shaw was sentenced to six to 12 years in prison. The crash marked his third arrest for driving while intoxicated. Former state Sen. Dan Feltes, D-Concord, sponsored an earlier version of the bill, which was set aside during the coronavirus pandemic. Rep. Daryl Abbas, R-Salem, refiled the bill this year.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A woman who killed her abusive ex-fiance can proceed with a lawsuit that claims her rights as a domestic violence victim were violated when a county prosecutor publicly identified her, an appeals court ruled Tuesday. The suit alleges the woman’s civil rights were violated in 2016 when former Warren County Prosecutor Richard Burke identified her after a grand jury declined to indict her. A lower court had dismissed the suit, saying the prosecutor was informing the public about the completion of a criminal investigation. According to court documents, the woman’s ex-fiance drove from Florida to New Jersey to confront her, armed with a handgun, knives, zip ties and duct tape. After sexually assaulting her, tying her up and threatening to kill her, he allegedly told her to kill him with his own gun, or else he would shoot her. She shot him in the shoulder, and he died at the scene. The lawsuit alleged that after the grand jury declined to indict her, Burke disclosed the results of the investigation, as well as her identity, “for the purpose of political and/or personal gain.” The suit named Burke, the prosecutor’s office, the county and former state attorneys general Christopher Porrino and Gurbir Grewal.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state will begin routinely collecting demographic data about sexual orientation and gender identity during government surveys under an executive order signed by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. The order Monday responds to growing concerns that basic demographic information about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations is being left out of an array of studies that shape public policy and governmental planning decisions. Officials at the National Institutes of Health are developing guidelines for collecting data on sexual orientation and gender identity to better serve unmapped LGBTQ populations. Lujan Grisham said survey responses will be voluntary as all state agencies begin collecting self-identification information. The order prohibits the public release of any personal identifying information. The governor called the order, lauded by several advocates for the LGBTQ community, a step toward identifying and addressing inequities in access to public resources. “If you really look at us as a community, we’ve never been asked who we are, ever,” said Democratic state Sen. Leo Jaramillo of Espanola, who is gay. “Now we’re included in a conversation and data-collecting that will then help in ways that we may not even see or think of.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: There’s a disconnect in the effort to make New York state less reliant on fossil fuels. Solar farms, wind turbines and hydro dams are producing more renewable power for the state, but it can be difficult to deliver that power south to the massive New York City market. So state officials are considering proposals to effectively plug the city into more green power through high-voltage transmission lines that would run underground or underwater for more than 100 miles. Different proposed lines would go beneath the Hudson River or be buried along the state thruway. One long-planned line would run down the entire state to deliver hydropower from Canada. The proposals are designed to bring New York state a big step closer to its goal of relying on renewable sources for 70% of its power by 2030. The Cuomo administration this year offered incentives to build the lines after analysts concluded it would be difficult to hit the statewide goal without targeting New York City, which relies heavily on fossil fuel. That reliance is expected to increase in the short term because of the recent closure of Indian Point nuclear facility just north of the city.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A program created by legislators to prevent overcrowding in state prisons has paid county jail operators millions of dollars to house certain offenders even as those facilities exceed capacity, according to a report released Monday. Disability Rights North Carolina, the report’s author, said 50 counties received $4.2 million combined to house and transport people sentenced for misdemeanors during months between 2018 and 2020 when their jails were above 100% capacity. Fourteen people died in 2018 and 2019 in overcrowded jails that were participating in what’s known as the Statewide Misdemeanant Confinement Program, the report said. “The conditions we found are extremely dangerous for all people in these overcrowded jails, staff and those housed in them, and we are especially concerned for the safety and well-being of people with disabilities in these jails,” group attorney Luke Woollard said in a news release. Jails have long have held people convicted of misdemeanors serving 90 days or fewer. State lawmakers passed a 2011 law that allowed jails, which are run by local sheriffs, to hold people sentenced to between 91 and 180 days for misdemeanors, The News & Observer of Raleigh reports. Jails received $40 per inmate per day. Sheriffs can opt out of the program.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Bakken Energy and Mitsubishi Power Americas on Monday announced they are acquiring a financially troubled synthetic natural gas plant in western North Dakota and plan to redevelop it to produce renewable energy. The companies said the deal to purchase the Great Plains Synfuels Plant from Dakota Gasification Co. is expected to be finalized by next April. Dakota Gasification is a subsidiary of Bismarck-based Basin Electric Power Cooperative. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The plant near Beulah is part of a proposed hub announced in June to produce clean hydrogen, which has a variety of uses including powering vehicles and energy generation. Republican Gov. Doug Burgum has hailed the project a key part of the state’s plan to become carbon-neutral by 2030. Officials said the hub consist of facilities that produce, store, transport and consume the carbon-free fuel. The hub will focus on the production of blue hydrogen, which is derived from natural gas with the carbon dioxide emissions captured and sequestered underground or used for enhanced oil recovery. Officials said they hope to connect the hub by a pipeline to other hubs throughout North America.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s Vax-a-Million giveaway contributed to more people getting COVID-19 shots, several independent analyses recently found. Vax-a-Million, announced by Gov. Mike DeWine on May 12, gave $1 million to five vaccinated adults and a college scholarship to five vaccinated youth over five weeks. The state spent about $5.6 million on the effort. Each analysis of the lottery varied in the number of people estimated to have received an initial shot following the announcement – as many as 200,000. But they shared several conclusions, including that the promotion was less costly than other incentives being offered. The studies contrast with an earlier study that received widespread media attention for its conclusion that the lottery didn’t increase vaccinations. Professors at Xavier University’s Health Economic and Clinical Outcomes Research gave the most generous estimate yet for the five-week lottery’s impact. They estimated 213,388 additional Ohioans were vaccinated due to the lottery, according to an analysis provided to the USA TODAY Network – Ohio. Assuming all inoculated children ages 12 to 15 would have been vaccinated without the lottery, that leaves more than 108,000 others who started the inoculation process as a result of the lottery.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: After a deadly hostage situation March 27, officials at the Oklahoma County jail blamed staffing problems and promised to do better. “We’d like to get our staffing up to about 400,” the jail administrator, Greg Williams, said at a news conference days after an inmate took a guard hostage. Four months later, at the start of August, there were fewer full-time employees, not more. “Corrections facilities all over the country are experiencing staff shortages. We are no exception,” Williams said last week. “Frankly, lots of businesses are struggling to hire people right now.” And “COVID is certainly a factor.” At the news conference March 31, the jail administrator disclosed the facility only had 330 full-time employees. On Aug. 2, the number of full-time employees had fallen to 327, a jail spokesman said. On Monday, the workforce was up to 334, the administrator told the trust that took over operation of the jail last year. Seventeen employees, though, were out because of positive coronavirus tests.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Gov. Kate Brown announced Monday that she is extending the statewide residential mortgage foreclosure moratorium, aimed at those experiencing financial hardship during the pandemic, until Dec. 31. The moratorium, which allows homeowners to put their mortgages in forbearance, was set to expire Sept. 30. Based on the measure’s language, this is the last extension that Brown is authorized to issue. “As we continue to see record-high numbers of COVID-19 hospitalizations driven by the delta surge, I am committed to ensuring that Oregonians have a warm, dry, safe place to live during this pandemic,” Brown said. “Extending the temporary residential foreclosure moratorium another three months will prevent removal of Oregonians from their homes by foreclosure, which would result in serious health, safety, welfare, and financial consequences, and which would undermine key efforts to prevent spread of COVID-19.” During the pandemic, the state’s ongoing housing crisis has only been exacerbated. In late July, more than 49,000 Oregon homeowners said they were not caught up on their mortgage payments, based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s most recent Household Pulse Survey.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nYork: Saving the state tree could be key to protecting trout in one of the top fishing grounds in the nation and perhaps the world. The iconic hemlock is dying off, under siege from the invasive woolly adelgid bug that slowly sucks the life out of the giant trees. There is a direct correlation between hemlock and native trout, a species highly sensitive to water pollutants, stream erosion and warming temperatures. The situation is particularly crucial in Pennsylvania, which has more miles of stream than any state in the lower 48. The state is renowned for its fly fishing and trout, and hemlocks are one of the great protectors of their waters. The towering trees that often live for hundreds of years create their own ecosystems. Certain kinds of animal life, like warblers and salamanders, as well as insects and plants, depend upon them. Deer and others bed down under them for warmth in winter and to stay cool in summer. Hemlocks often reside along streams, their vast root systems helping to stabilize water levels and prevent erosion. Their branches provide unparalleled, cooling shade. Native trout, for example, require waters that don’t rise above the low-60s to spawn and thrive. They also eat the insects that eat fallen hemlock needles. When hemlocks die, there’s nothing substantial to take their place in short order.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Attorney General Peter Neronha has filed objections to rate increases sought by health insurers that do business in the state. The rate proposals currently under consideration by the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner “raised concerns about affordability” for people who buy policies on the individual market, Neronha said. “Given the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic over the past year, and in light of our analysis of the current financial strength of the involved health insurers, higher rates are not warranted, nor affordable for over 42,000 Rhode Islanders who purchase insurance on the individual market, and nearly 140,000 subscribers of small and large employer group plans,” he said. Blue Cross Blue Shield’s request is for a 3.1% increase in the individual market. Neighborhood Health Plan is seeking an 8.5% increase. Neighborhood said it offers the lowest-cost health plans on the state’s health insurance marketplace, and even with the proposed rate increase, “Neighborhood will still be the most cost effective option.” Blue Cross Blue Shield said in an email that it “recognizes the ongoing economic challenges facing its members due to COVID-19 and took steps to limit proposed rate increases.” The commissioner’s ruling is expected later this month.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: With hundreds of students already quarantined for COVID-19 at the start of the fall semester, the state’s second-largest public school district will require masks in schools despite a state budget proviso that bans districts from doing so without risking funding. Charleston County School District’s board voted 8-1 Monday evening to approve an emergency ordinance to require masks for anyone who enters school buildings through mid-October. Board Chair Eric Mack said the ordinance was proposed for the safety of students and staff given the rapid spread of the delta variant. The district serving nearly 50,000 students is the first school board to openly flout the state budget proviso that went into effect July 1 and prohibits South Carolina educational institutions from using appropriated funds to mandate masks. A similar vote was cast by Richland County Council earlier Monday; that ordinance will require masks for students and educators who serve children ages 2 through 14 in public and private schools and day cares. The Charleston City Council was scheduled to vote on its own school mask rule Tuesday. Columbia leaders earlier this month made masks mandatory for schoolchildren in the capital city who are too young to receive COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A witness to an incident last week involving MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell says he saw no reason for Lindell to claim he was attacked. Lindell, who was in Sioux Falls hosting an election fraud symposium, said Tuesday that his encounter with a man seeking a photo late Wednesday at a hotel left him doubled over in pain. Lindell said he has filed a report of an assault with the Sioux Falls Police Department and is conducting his own investigation into how the photo-seeker could have shoved an object between his ribs, leaving him unable to move his right arm. But “there was no attack,” said Jeff Buongiorno, the conference attendee who was taking the photo. Buongiorno, a Republican congressional candidate in Florida, said he and two others were “shooting the breeze” at the hotel bar late Wednesday when they spotted Lindell in the lobby and asked to take a photo with the businessman who has become an ally of former President Donald Trump. Then another man Buongiorno did not know approached and sought his own photo, which Buongiorno offered to snap with the man’s phone. Buongiorno said nothing he saw could be described as an attack that would leave Lindell in pain. Buongiorno, who said he supported “law and order,” was concerned Lindell’s claim would take up police time and resources.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee signed an executive order Monday letting parents opt their children out of coronavirus-related mask mandates in K-12 schools, after a few school districts issued mask requirements for students and others. With the move, Lee also said he will not call the broad special legislative session requested by Republican House lawmakers to limit the authority of local officials to make rules aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19, which has seen a resurgence in Tennessee via the delta variant. All 73 Republicans in the state House signaled support for a special session last week, and a handful of school board meetings have become contentious as some parents fight mask mandates for their children. But the Senate’s Republican leader, Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, had said he trusts locally elected school boards to set COVID-19 health rules for schools. McNally on Monday called Lee’s order an “appropriate compromise that strikes a proper balance between freedom and public health.” Lee has resisted implementing a statewide mask mandate for schools and had left the decision to local school officials. The Republican governor’s order lets parents opt out if either a school board or a health department enacts a mask requirement over a school district.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: An Eanes school district parent assaulted a teacher and ripped off her face mask, according to an email that Superintendent Tom Leonard sent to the community Tuesday. The incident occurred after several weeks of tension and debate in the district over mask rules and mandates. “A parent physically assaulted a teacher by ripping a mask off her face, others yelling at a teacher to take off her mask because they could not understand what the teacher was saying while her face was covered,” Leonard’s email said. “This type of behavior will not be tolerated in Eanes ISD. Our staff are on the front lines of this pandemic; let’s give them some space and grace. Please, I am asking everyone to be kind. ... Do not fight mask wars in our schools.” Eanes, like other school districts in Travis County, has been caught in a legal tug of war between local and state officials over masks in schools. The district originally said it would not require masks but would encourage them, a position that was in line with Gov. Greg Abbott’s order banning mask requirements in schools. Travis County issued a contradictory order Aug. 11 that requires masks to be worn in schools. After a local judge upheld the county order, Eanes announced Saturday that it would reverse course and require masks in line with the county order.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Cuts to Colorado River apportionments announced Monday by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation triggered a new flood of protests against the city’s Lake Powell Pipeline project, the largest proposed diversion of additional water from this river that serves the needs of 40 million people throughout the West. “St. George is not going to get their pipeline,” said Robin Silver, a founder of the Center for Biological Diversity and a former Phoenix emergency room physician, in a press conference hosted by environmental groups Monday afternoon following the one held by the Bureau of Reclamation. “Whether they’re listening or not, they’re going to have no choice. But it’d be nice if they were listening so we could all figure out how to get out of this fix.” The Lake Powell Pipeline is the Washington County Water Conservancy District’s solution to the current rate of population growth outpacing its estimation of the local water supply. The project, which has been pursued by the state since the 1990s, would transport up to 28 billion gallons of water per year – enough to support about 150,000 households – from the Colorado River at Lake Powell 140 miles through the desert in a buried pipeline to Sand Hollow Reservoir for use by future St. George residents.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Lower College Street will be closed to vehicles for a month starting Friday as railroad track improvements are made near the waterfront for the long-awaited extension of the Amtrak train service from Rutland to Burlington. The west side of the street will be closed to vehicles until Sept. 17, but pedestrians and cyclists will be able to travel to Waterfront Park during the closure, the Vermont Agency of Transportation said. The Burlington bike path between Main and Colleges will remain closed for several more months. Amtrak passenger service is expected to return to Burlington next year. The Ethan Allen Express train, which travels from New York City to Rutland, is being extended north to Burlington, with stops in Middlebury and Vergennes.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A Republican state senator is among a group of people suing the Virginia Redistricting Commission over plans to count prisoners at their last known address instead of the prison where they’re incarcerated. The lawsuit says the change will politically weaken rural and conservative areas after the state draws new congressional and legislative districts. “Virginia prisons are typically located in rural districts with greater Republican voting strength, particularly in the southside and southwest regions of the commonwealth,” the suit said. The legal challenge was filed Friday in the Virginia Supreme Court. Petitioners include state Sen. Travis Hackworth, who represents a reliably Republican district that stretches from the Virginia-Kentucky border to Radford. Hackworth’s district includes five state correctional facilities, according to the lawsuit. Others who are suing include county representatives in western counties such as Buchanan and Tazewell. The lawsuit stems from the recent creation of the Virginia Redistricting Commission, which put redistricting in the hands of a bipartisan body. Voters approved the commission in a November referendum that amended the state constitution. But the lawsuit says other redistricting laws were passed by lawmakers outside the referendum and thus violated the state constitution.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee is planning to grant as many as 1,200 commutations for people on community supervision whose drug convictions have been deemed unconstitutional by the Washington Supreme Court. This spring, Inslee issued commutations to the handful of incarcerated people serving prison terms solely due to the overturned statute. Known as the Blake decision, the court overturned Washington’s felony drug-possession statute and rendered invalid decades of convictions. The ruling has made thousands of people eligible to get their records cleared and get paid back for legal financial obligations they paid while incarcerated or on supervision, but it has added to a backlog in the courts. The Seattle Times reports Inslee’s office said that as of Monday afternoon, the Democratic governor had signed 129 commutations for this latest round, and a spokesman said in an email that “new orders are being issued daily at this point, between 15 and 30 a day.” “I am committed to doing what I can to try to remedy the situation and assist the courts who are doing what they can to get through this backlog of cases,” Inslee said in a statement.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The number of people hospitalized for the coronavirus in the state hit a six-month high Monday as a top health official warned that West Virginia is at a “defining moment” in its response to the pandemic. After two months of declines, virus-related hospitalizations in the state have increased sevenfold in the past six weeks, going from 52 on July 4 to 369 Monday. The majority are unvaccinated people, said Dr. Clay Marsh, the state’s coronavirus expert. Hospitalizations peaked at 818 in early January and haven’t been this high since there were 394 on Feb. 8. The number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units has jumped from 17 on July 4 to 127 on Monday, according to state health data. Marsh said residents must take more precautions, including getting fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and wearing masks, because the more contagious delta variant of the virus is now present in 43 of the state’s 55 counties. Such confirmed cases have more than tripled this month to least 322. “This is really the defining moment for us in many ways as we see COVID-19 growing in West Virginia,” Marsh said at a news conference. “We see our hospital numbers going up. We see our ICU numbers going up. We see the number of people on ventilators going up.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican state Sen. Andre Jacques, one of the Legislature’s most conservative lawmakers and a vocal opponent of mask and vaccine mandates, tested positive for the coronavirus last week and was at the hospital Monday with pneumonia. The positive test and hospital care came after Jacque testified Wednesday in a packed Capitol hearing room without wearing a mask. The lawmaker from De Pere did not immediately return a text message Tuesday seeking comment on his condition. His spokesman, Matt Tompach, provided a statement from Jacque dated Monday night and said Tuesday afternoon that he had no update on his condition. “Sen. Jacque appreciates respect for his family, and the tremendous expressions of support he’s received from others,” Tompach said. “He’s tired but in good spirits.” Jacque said in the Monday night email that some of his family members also tested positive for the virus. Jacque, 40, has six children, including an infant. Jacque said in the email that he was at the hospital with pneumonia but did not say if he had been admitted. Jacque said he has had pneumonia before but did not immediately say whether it was diagnosed as COVID-19 pneumonia. His office did not immediately respond to questions about whether Jacque was vaccinated.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state will not return to a mask order or require COVID-19 vaccines despite a resurgence of the coronavirus, Gov. Mark Gordon said Monday. “The issue is not masks; the issue is COVID,” Gordon, a Republican, said in a news conference. “Here’s the thing: We already know what to do. We’ve been through this before.” Gordon imposed a statewide mask mandate in December and lifted it in March. Even so, mandates can cause some people to resist wearing masks, he said. “We know that there’s value to masks, and we recommend those masks. We also know people have very strong concerns about masks,” Gordon said. He said he also didn’t expect any shutdowns like the public health orders that forced many Wyoming businesses and public places to close or limit occupancy through much of 2020 and into 2021. Gordon made the remarks as coronavirus infections, because of the delta variant circulating worldwide, were back to levels unseen in Wyoming since January, though still roughly four times less than at the pandemic’s worst last November. Laramie County on Monday had the state’s highest infection rate, 698 per 100,000 people, followed by Natrona (469) and Campbell (324) counties, according to the Wyoming Department of Health.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/18"}]}

John Carney and civil rights groups settled a lawsuit that accused Delaware education officials of sending more money to schools with affluent children than it does to schools with high concentrations of children living in poverty.\n\nThe settlement kicks the issue to the General Assembly, which for two decades has not implemented state commissions’ suggestions to formally allocate more funding for low-income students, English language learners and students with disabilities.\n\nThe plaintiffs wrote in their complaint that schools with high concentrations of those students struggle to afford enough staff to meet the children's needs.\n\nThe potentially landmark case in Delaware Chancery Court sought to have the state’s school funding system ruled unconstitutional, with civil rights groups arguing state officials knowingly fail to give all children an adequate education.\n\nINITIAL FILING: Civil rights groups sue Delaware over education funding for low-income, disadvantaged students\n\nThey cited figures showing disadvantaged students are scoring far below state standards on state assessments\n\nThe settlement\n\nIn the settlement, reached close to three years after the lawsuit was first filed by Delawareans for Educational Opportunity and the Delaware NAACP, Carney agreed to make a number of budgetary proposals to the General Assembly — mainly, changing Delaware law to make weighted school funding permanent.\n\nThe case had been scheduled to go to trial next month.\n\n“While we were not able to get everything we wanted in this settlement, it does provide support for children that is desperately needed in Delaware’s education system,” said Jea Street of Delawareans for Educational Opportunity, who is also a New Castle County councilman, in a news release.\n\nWeighted funding takes into account additional needs and disadvantages of low-income and other students. Under the state’s current “unit count” system, school districts receive state funds based on enrollment numbers. Schools with high concentrations of low-income students tend to need more supports like reading specialists and counseling staff, but they do not receive the additional funding to cover those supports.\n\nAt the time the lawsuit was filed, Delaware was one of just four states that did not give additional funds for English language learners and one of 15 that did not provide additional funds for educating low-income children, plaintiffs said.\n\nLAWSUIT: Delaware schools are leaving children in poverty behind\n\nCarney first proposed Opportunity Grants in 2018, as a means of offering schools additional funding for high-poverty and English learners. The most recent round of Opportunity Funding, announced as the lawsuit was winding its way toward trial, would be doled out to schools over the course of three years, but was not formally written into law.\n\nEXTRA FUNDING:Gov. John Carney proposes expanding Opportunity Funding to $75 million\n\nUnder the settlement, Carney must propose that the General Assembly make Opportunity Funding permanent by 2023. By 2025, the state should grow the pot of money from $35 million to $60 million. Schools must report how that money is being spent annually.\n\nThe General Assembly will also be asked to enact legislation starting in 2023 to expand funding for special education students in kindergarten through third grade. Currently, state funding covers only students fourth grade and up.\n\nIn a news release, Carney called the settlement \"an opportunity to make real progress for Delaware’s children.\"\n\nA political challenge\n\nSuccess of the settlement depends on the state Legislature. Some advocates for low-income students have accused that body of lacking the political will to funnel more money to students in need — and formalize it into law.\n\nFor decades, state-formed commissions have issued report after report outlining the changes needed to improve Delaware schools. Most recently in 2016, the Wilmington Education Improvement Commission made the case for redistricting in New Castle County, where city of Wilmington students are split across five school districts. The commission suggested establishing weighted funding and property tax reassessment.\n\nThe General Assembly failed to implement the commission’s key recommendations. The push to restructure Wilmington schools is again being discussed in the Redding Consortium, a similar state-formed working group.\n\nWith state revenues having plummeted during the coronavirus pandemic, it may be even harder to pass additional spending.\n\nBut Carney’s agreement to back the proposals — and a Statehouse likely to be made up increasingly of more left-wing Democrats — gives advocates some hope.\n\nCarney, in a news release, stated he believes \"legislators of both parties will see the merit in this proposal.\"\n\nThe weight of a court settlement and the costly threat of further litigation may also help push the proposals through.\n\nIn Washington, one of numerous states targeted in a similar school funding lawsuit, the state Supreme Court fined the state $100,000 each day it failed to enact a funding system that would satisfy justices’ ruling that the government fully fund its schools in line with the state constitution.\n\nDelaware officials initially responded to the lawsuit by arguing school funding was a political issue up to lawmakers and said they had fulfilled the state constitution’s requirement of providing only a “general and efficient” system of public schools.\n\nCHANCERY JUDGE: Politics won't keep me from lawsuit on education funding\n\nVice Chancellor J. Travis Laster, in setting the state for a trial, rejected those arguments two years ago, ruling that the constitution does require schools to provide an adequate education.\n\nHe also separated the second half of the lawsuit, filed against the state’s three counties over their lack of a comprehensive revaluing of all the properties in their jurisdictions since three to four decades ago.\n\nFULL STORY: Delaware's unequal property tax system on trial\n\nThe plaintiffs argued the lack of a reassessment forced school districts to use old property values to raise local taxes for their portion of school funding, locking them into a cycle of regularly and often unsuccessfully asking residents for tax increases to keep up with costs.\n\nThat portion went to trial last year, and in May, Laster ruled the counties had violated the state constitution. A debate over how the counties should fix it remains pending before the judge.\n\nNOW WHAT:Delaware's property tax system ruled unconstitutional.\n\nThe settlement also requires:\n\nThe creation of an educational ombudsperson. Each county will have a program to assist students and families. The family advocates will focus on resolving disputes concerning discipline disparities, inequities in school access and unfair treatment of students.\n\nForming an Early Childhood Assistance Program. By fiscal year 2024, the governor’s budget will include at least $12.2 million to make early childhood education more accessible.\n\nAllocations for teachers in high needs schools. The governor’s 2023 budget must include at least $4 million to support teacher recruitment and retention in high-needs schools. Currently, high-needs schools tend to be staffed by teachers with less than five years of experience.\n\nAn independent funding assessment. By January 2024, the state should assess total funding levels and how education revenue is raised and distributed. The assessment should also make recommendations for improvements to equity and efficiency. However, the assessment will not obligate any action from the state.\n\nChanging how the Department of Education funds school construction. School districts seeking funding for construction must offer an “equity statement,” outlining the demographic information of the students who will attend the new facility. The statement should include how a construction project would affect the equitable distribution of new buildings throughout a district.\n\nContact Jeanne Kuang at jkuang@delawareonline.com.

Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna that resulted in the death of Lt. Steven Floyd. The document then provides sometimes lengthy – and other times, brief – descriptions of where those recommendations stand now.\n\nIt also shows how the DOC is planning to implement all 41 recommendations made by the independent review team in a year's time, said Claire DeMatteis, Delaware Gov. John Carney's temporary special assistant.\n\n\"What you are seeing is the Department of Correction moving forward,\" said DeMatteis, adding that by making her report public, it will hopefully give Delaware a view of what is actually been done.\n\n\"That's exactly why Gov. Carney wanted these reports to be public,\" she said. \"He wants the department to be held accountable, and he wants the public to see all the actions that are being taken.\"\n\nEven with officer vacancies and inevitable setbacks due to the inherent difficulties of implementing reforms related to the incarceration of convicted offenders, DeMatteis said, the DOC is working to meet the 41 recommendations.\n\nHer report also details how long the DOC has given itself to implement the recommendations, with a year to be the longest period for seven of the directives.\n\n\"We have more work ahead of us,\" Carney said in a statement. \"Making lasting change won't happen in a few short months. But as this report indicates, we are making progress.\"\n\nMore:Dead officer's request could have prevented Vaughn prison siege\n\nMore:Delaware to hire experts to study prison health care after riot\n\nMore:$7.5 million prison settlement could keep key details from public\n\nOne recommendation, which drew attention following the siege, was to purchase new equipment – and specifically to install cameras inside Vaughn's buildings. There were no working cameras inside Building C when the siege took place, which meant what happened inside the prison wasn't captured on surveillance footage.\n\nThe new report indicates that camera installation began in November “and will continue on an accelerated schedule.” Each building takes about a month to outfit with cameras, according to the report, and it's up to the discretion of senior prison staff to determine where inmates are moved during the installation project.\n\n“By July 2018, nine buildings at JTVCC are expected to have cameras operational,” the report stated. The entire installation project is scheduled to be finished by March 2019.\n\nThe location of these cameras – and what buildings still are without them – was not disclosed in the report.\n\nThe update also said that an analysis of evidence-based programs and job opportunities at Vaughn has been completed and that efforts are underway to expand these offerings.\n\nSpecifically, Connections – the medical treatment provider for Delaware prisons – trained more than 15 additional counselors on cognitive behavioral therapy curriculum, according to the report.\n\nEfforts to find funding to support Delaware Correctional Industries, which oversees training in trades like construction and furniture making and repair, are underway, according to the report.\n\nMany of these programs had been stopped in recent years, according to inmates and prison advocates, but the update indicates that DOC may be reinstating these programs should funding be found.\n\nAnd after nearly a year of complaints and allegations of misconduct from DOC staff and administration, Thursday’s update slips in an important detail: the creation of an Inmate Advisory Council, which will consist of prisoners in the minimum and medium housing units, according to the Oct. 1 memorandum creating the group.\n\n\"The goal is to foster discussion and problem-solving between inmates and officers,\" according to the report. \"Ten inmates on the council meet monthly, then meet with JTVCC senior leadership to discuss their recommendations and requests.\"\n\nIn order to be on the council, inmates may not have been in restricted housing for the past 12 months and cannot be validated gang members, the memorandum said. And the memorandum is subject to review and changes at the discretion of the Vaughn warden or higher authority, according to the report.\n\nThe report also said that some restrictions put in place after the February siege, like access to the commissary, recreation privileges and access to library services, have since been reinstated.\n\nFollowing last year's siege, inmates and their family members complained of masked corrections officers forcefully conducting searches, known as shakedowns, of prison cells. That practice was ended in October, according to the report and an appendix included in the document.\n\n\"Balaclava face masks are no longer authorized for CERT operations during a shakedown in a facility. Please make the necessary adjustments to any operation orders moving forward,\" read an Oct. 17 letter issued by Maj. Michael Merson, the DOC's special operations security superintendent.\n\nThe report also references the use of outside programs, consultants and input as a way to improve the quality of Delaware prisons. On Wednesday, DOC officials said they are hiring independent experts to review inmate access to health care and the prisoner grievance system – something cited in DeMatteis' report.\n\nHer report also said that each recommendation has been assigned to at least one DOC senior leader, who tracks its implementation progress, and is shared weekly. The report also claims Carney is updated weekly on the progress.\n\nWhile the independent review focused on Vaughn, DeMatteis' report said the reforms are being implemented in all of the DOC's Level V prisons, which include Sussex Correctional Institution, Young Correction Institution and Baylor Women's Correctional Institution.\n\n\"Since receiving the independent review, we have moved quickly to take action and implement the review team's recommendations,\" DOC Commissioner Perry Phelps said in a statement. \"Addressing the challenges we face will require our focus and attention over the long-term. But all the people of the Department of Correction are committed to this work.\"\n\nThis is the first of two public reports documenting the implementation of the 41 recommendations.

Vaughn Correctional Center.\n\nThe settlement will be divided by family members of slain correctional officer Lt. Steven Floyd and six prison workers held hostage during the incident.\n\nBut the settlement will most likely keep key details from the public – possibly, what provoked the siege and how and when decisions were made to end it – because it calls for no admission of wrongdoing nor policy change requirements.\n\nSuch a settlement can make it difficult to correct systemic problems within institutions like the Delaware Department of Correction, which despite previous lawsuits, the appointment of a federal monitor to oversee prison health, and promises of change from different administrations, continues to face many of the same issues.\n\nThe authors of an independent review looking into February's deadly incident pointed out that several recommendations made in a 2005 report following the rape of a prison counselor were not initiated.\n\nThis included fixing blind spots not covered by prison cameras, analyzing alternative shift scenarios, creating a communication channel so the governor and state legislators would be aware of staffing shortages and studying the radio communication network.\n\n\"The taxpayer should be concerned, I know I am,\" said The Rev. Christopher Bullock, a founder of the Delaware Coalition of Prison Reform and Justice.\n\nThe settlement's secrecy should give anyone who has been working for prison reform pause, Bullock said, adding that Gov. John Carney seems to be making some changes.\n\nSince February, Carney has moved to improve safety and security across Delaware’s correctional system, a governor's spokesman said.\n\nThis includes negotiating an agreement with the Correctional Officers Association of Delaware union to raise officer salaries in order to improve recruitment and retention. He also invested in new training and equipment, including cameras for James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.\n\nAnd to ensure the recommendations made in the independent review are implemented, Carney appointed Claire DeMatteis, a former senior counsel to then-U.S. Sen. Joe Biden, as his temporary special assistant to spearhead reform at the beleaguered DOC.\n\nShe has been charged with producing public reports after six months and a year.\n\n\"Gov. Carney believes that we should remain accountable publicly throughout this process, and that we should be judged on the results,\" Carney spokesman Jonathan Starkey said in a statement.\n\nCarney's improvements encourage Bullock – although he laments that they came as the result of Floyd's violent death.\n\nBullock also wants to see improved education, substance abuse counseling and job training for prisoners or they will not be rehabilitated and the conditions that led to February's deadly incident will not be fixed.\n\n\"I don't know. It's been going on for 40 years,\" he said referring to the inequities in the DOC. \"We just have to keep praying and working and encouraging the governor and lawmakers to fix this thing.\"\n\nMore:Officials: More must be done for Delaware prisons\n\nOngoing coverage: Prison Hostage Crisis\n\nThe state’s settlement sent a clear message to Dover defense attorney Stephen Hampton.\n\n\"It tells me that they don't really want to get into what happened,\" said the lawyer who has taken on the DOC repeatedly in lawsuits involving healthcare and discrimination.\n\nMost prominently, in 2005 he represented the family of Anthony Pierce, an inmate whose cancerous tumor grew to the size of a second head before he received treatment in the Sussex Correctional Institution in Georgetown. Pierce, known as the \"brother with two heads,\" died days after he was released from prison, and his family eventually settled their wrongful death lawsuit for an undisclosed amount of money.\n\nHampton said he is preparing a class action lawsuit on behalf of inmates inside Building C where the February uprising took place. He's working to compile and organize the \"huge amounts of material\" he continues to receive. He still receives daily phone calls about the lack of healthcare services and denials for medical requests, he said.\n\nLawrence A. Hamermesh, the Ruby R. Vale Professor of Corporate and Business Law at Widener University Delaware Law School, said there are many reasons that settlements occur.\n\nHe said settlements can make sense because a trial can be a burden on the public. Costs to pay lawyers, paralegals and experts – which are passed on to taxpayers – can quickly add up.\n\nAnother reason, though, is to avoid public disclosures, usually by the defendants, but sometimes by the plaintiffs.\n\n\"That's one thing that often motivates private parties and public parties to settle litigation,\" he said. \"A trial is an open affair and there's a lot of stuff that comes out. Sometimes people would have that not occur.\"\n\nThat is what many suspect was the reason in this case.\n\nThe state announced it had agreed to settle the federal lawsuit filed by Floyd's family and the six prison workers. The announcement was released on a Friday, after the close of business.\n\nAccording to the settlement agreement and release consent obtained by The News Journal, no attorney would speak publicly about the case following the settlement, and the only statements to the media would be provided in attachments to the written document released by former federal judge Joseph J. Farnan Jr.\n\nThe written specifications follow heated comments from Wilmington Attorney Thomas S. Neuberger, who made multiple assertions – both written and verbal – about who was to blame for the Feb. 1 uprising and what occurred inside Vaughn. Neuberger, along with attorneys from the Jacobs & Crumplar law firm, represented the prison employees and Floyd's family.\n\nThe only way any attorneys could speak about the settlement was if \"express (but not implied) public attacks\" were made toward the attorney and then published in the media, according to the settlement.\n\nThe plaintiffs, defendants nor officials were not restricted to speak about what occurred or any future issues, so long as it was not a \"formal, public announcement,\" according to the settlement.\n\nThere also was an entire section of the settlement dedicated to the state's \"no admission of liability\" which explicitly explained that state had no culpability in the death of Floyd or the prison uprising. Instead, it points out that the settlement is \"merely to avoid the burden and expense of litigation,\" according to the document.\n\nLori Alberts, chair of Link of Love, a support group for loved ones of inmates, said the silence is frustrating.\n\n\"As a taxpayer I’m angry,\" Alberts said. \"They're admitting no wrongdoing, but let's pay them [family and prison workers] off to shut them up so it doesn't cost us a lot of money.\"\n\nThe state is still moving forward with a criminal trial, prosecuting 18 inmates – 16 of whom are charged with Floyd's murder. Some of the DOC's issues may come out there if those cases go to trial.\n\n\"There's really not a whole lot we can do about it because DOC is an island onto themselves and they do what they do and they're not responsible to the citizens,\" she said, adding that the money used to settle the lawsuit could have been used to correct issues in the prison system.\n\n\"You pay out $7.5 million, which comes from a different fund,\" she said. \"But it's still taxpayer money that could have been sidelined for these things.\"\n\nContact Brittany Horn at (302) 324-2771 or bhorn@delawareonline.com.

There were no working cameras inside Building C when the siege took place, which meant what happened inside the prison wasn't captured on surveillance footage.\n\nWhile Tuesday's report said the DOC was stronger than it was 18 months ago, it claims officers continue to express concerns regarding understanding and mandatory overtime, referred to as \"shift freezes.\"\n\n\"I personally know the toll that it takes on those officers and their families when they are forced to work overtime,\" Phelps said at Tuesday's press conference.\n\nVaughn prison riot survivor says officials responsible: 'There's blood everywhere'\n\nAn analysis released last month by the DOC admits that in Vaughn alone, the state's largest maximum security prison, 235 additional corrections officers are needed to safely staff all operations. The analysis did not say how many additional corrections officers were needed for the entire state prison system.\n\nVaughn prison riot survivor says officials responsible: 'There's blood everywhere'\n\nAfter asking Muslim swimmers to leave pool, manager claims 'no discrimination'\n\nAnd though the DOC has trained and hired more than 150 new officers since the riot, according to Phelps, not all applicants make it to graduation or stay on after the hiring period. Retirements also adds to the fluctuation in staffing numbers, Phelps said.\n\nForced overtime was often used prior to the Feb. 1, 2017, takeover of Vaughn's Building C. But following the riot, massive resignations by corrections officers have forced the DOC to increase use of the practice, which the department admits takes a mental and physical toll on officers.\n\nThe shift freezes also cost Delaware taxpayers $30.9 million during the budget year that ended in June. That was a 39 percent jump over the $22.2 million paid out in extra time in the previous fiscal year.\n\nBut forced overtime has been a problem at the DOC for more than a decade.\n\nA report that looked at what caused the July 12, 2004, hostage-taking and rape of a prison counselor that ended in the fatal shooting of serial rapist Scott A. Miller, blamed the incident on DOC's management and made dozens of recommendations to improve the safety of employees and inmates.\n\nAmong the report's findings, was that staff shortages forced corrections officers to work large amounts of overtime.\n\nThat report, issued in 2005, recommended that vacant corrections officer positions should be filled as quickly as possible.\n\nState officials, following the 2017 incident, said they are trying to reduce overtime by providing better compensation plans to attract more people and retain current corrections officers.\n\nBoth Carney and Phelps said they hope to unveil a plan this fall that would directly address staffing shortages, but declined to provide details Tuesday.\n\n\"We'll talk about it in a couple of months,\" Carney replied when asked about the interim solutions to address overtime.\n\nWhile believing Carney is being sincere about wanting to improve conditions inside the DOC, Correctional Officers Association of Delaware President Geoff Klopp said he would be willing to hold a press conference in a few months to explain what is going on inside the prisons.\n\n\"Look, if they don't follow through, you guys will be the first ones to know about it,\" Klopp said.\n\nFollowing the press conference, officials provided a tour of Vaughn, highlighting two new programs that were recently implemented for inmates. The horticulture program, which enrolls 15 men, gives them the skills necessary to grow and sustain a garden.\n\n\"You have to nurture and grow a garden,\" said Senior Counselor Kelly Embert. \"And you kind of have to do that with relationships, too. We're giving them life skills, as well.\"\n\nThe hope, Embert said, is that the vegetables planted in the garden can then go to the culinary program, which will begin this fall and aims to enroll 30 men.\n\nBoth programs involve meeting multiple times per week in both classroom and hands-on settings, and both are the kind of programming Warden Dana Metzger said he hopes to increase at Vaughn.\n\nMuch of that, relies on having enough staffing to safely operate these programs, he said — the same reason many of them were shut down in the first place.\n\nMetzger said prison staff are also looking into bringing yoga and CrossFit to the prison gym, which interests both the inmates and the corrections officers.\n\nThe mindset shift seems to be working, according to one inmate on the Inmate Advisory Council, which was created to help bridge the gap between DOC administration and prisoners.\n\nAndre Peters, a 31-year-old who has been as Vaughn for eight years and was provided to the media Tuesday from the DOC, said prisoners have more programs available to them and are communicated with more than in years past.\n\n\"Being heard, that's the No. 1 thing,\" Peters said. \"And actually seeing results.\"\n\nThe installation of hundreds of new cameras at Vaughn is helping, according to inmates and staff. Metzger said the project, which is slated to finish by the end of this year, will result in cameras inside every prison building, as well as outside areas.\n\nThough Peters said inmates feel like they're being watched, which they are, Metzger said he hopes it serves as both a deterrent and as an accountability tool for them and officers.\n\n\"It helps with safety,\" Metzger said. \"And it also gives more validity to our officers and to our staff.\"\n\nContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299, eparra@delawareonline.com or Twitter @eparra3.

Local teachers have rallied public support over budget and personnel cuts. The administration of Superintendent Steven Baule and the Muncie Teachers Association have made separate arguments for the way forward, including a two-year teacher contract, to a state fact-finder.\n\nIn an email response to The Star Press Friday afternoon, Baule said he hadn't yet seen Hicks' new memorandum. (The Star Press supplied a copy upon seeking comment.)\n\nBaule said it was true that MCS \"has been spending beyond its means for several years. Since 2007, MCS has spent at least $42 million more than it has taken in.\"\n\nBut Baule noted that MCS can't be compared to other school systems \"for a host of reasons including poverty rate, special education populations (MCS' is more than double YCS' special education percentage), hosting the Youth Opportunity Center, the outstanding bonded indebtedness, etc.\"\n\nRELATED:\n\nMCS: If MTA proposal wins, five schools will close\n\nMCS, MTA go head-to-head in hearing\n\nRevealed: MCS administrators who could be cut\n\nIn the three-page memorandum — a follow-up to a more detailed review of school financing issued by the Ball State department on March 1 and revised this week — Hicks writes that he issued the follow-up \"at the request of several elected leaders and members of the greater Muncie business community\" but that the documents are \"not intended to inform or influence\" the process of establishing new contracts.\n\nWhile the information he offered is \"known\" to both the school board and Muncie Teachers Association, Hicks writes, \"Much of what we offer here is unknown to community members and local elected leaders.\"\n\nHicks sums up the \"key points\" of his memorandum by noting:\n\nMCS student enrollment effectively peaked in 1967 and has declined \"consistently and significantly\" for 50 years.\n\n\"Since peak enrollment, MCS built two new high schools, one additional middle school and one new elementary school.\"\n\nDelaware County's population peaked in 1971 and county school enrollment has declined since 1990.\n\nSince the 2005-2006 school year, 94.8 percent of public school decline occurred within MCS.\n\nAnd in the past decade, funding and regulatory changes shifted how schools receive funding, allowed more student transfers and expanded charter schools and the private school voucher program.\n\nWhile MCS funding grew, property tax collections declined and MCS student population declined by 26 percent since 2005-2006, with half of that decline attributed to students moving to other local public schools.\n\nHicks' earlier report noted that while Cowan Community Schools receives $6,906 per student in state funding compared to $7,636 for MCS. The school systems also receive $1,319 and $1,939 in local property taxes per student.\n\nBaule said that MCS had recognized the need to \"reduce its footprint,\" but noted that depending on the fact-finder's decision, \"those recommendations may be moot.\"\n\nCiting what he called recommendations made in 2010 and 2014 that were not followed, Baule said, \"Unfortunately, the minor changes recommended in them could have impacted the need to make major cuts we now face.\"\n\nContact Keith Roysdon at 765-213-5828 and follow him on Facebook and Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/state/2023/03/20/all-counties-turn-in-school-plan-approval-tied-to-funding-awaits/70018205007/", "title": "All counties turn in school plan. Approval, tied to funding, awaits", "text": "The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future is legislation passed during the last few years from Annapolis that, in theory, influences every public school student in the state.\n\nOn Wednesday, that theory became a little closer to being “in practice,” as each of the state’s 24 jurisdictions submitted an implementation plan in advance of the March 15 midnight deadline.\n\n“It’s just a tremendous feat to see that we’ve come this far,” said Isiah Leggett, the chair of the Blueprint Accountability and Implementation Board and former Montgomery County executive, “This is important and exciting news for all of us.”\n\nEach county’s plan posted online at the Accountability and Implementation Board’s website follows a template, but the county school systems final plans ranged from 141 pages to 204 pages each.\n\nWicomico County’s Blueprint Coordinator Frederick Briggs described the process of completing the plan with its dozens of questions and five pillars, ranging from early childhood education to college and career readiness.\n\n“The collaborative process of drafting the initial Blueprint Implementation Plan for Wicomico County Public Schools was both challenging and rewarding,” said Briggs, in an email. “Our team, with support from various stakeholders from outside our system, focused on responding to all 164 questions — thoroughly capturing the quality work we are already doing while also identifying plans for growth that will benefit the students and staff of our school system.”\n\nSchool funding tied to board approving plans\n\nAnswering each of the questions is part of the “minimum requirement,” and a state law passed last year tied school funding to meeting the expectations from the Accountability and Implementation Board (AIB). The next step will be making sure each jurisdiction’s plan met the requirement or funds could be withheld.\n\nFor jurisdictions that rely on property taxes to pay for schools, the state funding is no small issue. For example, over half of Wicomico County’s $304 million school budget comes from the state.\n\n“Under the Blueprint (law), 25 percent of (jurisdictions’) new funds are automatically withheld in the current fiscal year (2023) until the AIB determines whether the minimum guidelines were met,” said Rachel Hise, the board’s executive director, during a March 16 online board meeting.\n\nBoard member Mara Doss recognized how vital the review process taking place over the next few months is.\n\n“It’s so important that we get this right, especially with the (local education agencies),” said Doss, an associate vice president at Prince George’s Community College, referring to the school systems, during the board meeting.\n\nWicomico’s Briggs said that while the plan is in, the effort is far from finished.\n\n“Although submitting our plan on March 15th culminates countless hours of work focused on improving the educational experience for our students, it is only the beginning of the critical work outlined by the Accountability and Implementation Board,” he said. “We will continue working with the AIB, the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE), and other school district staff to plan for additional improvement opportunities.”\n\nDuring the meeting, board chair Leggett focused in on July 1 as a key date for funding decisions, causing board member Joseph Manko to reflect on the “spirit of the review process.”\n\n“It’s not a compliance exercise,” said Manko, a former Baltimore City Public Schools principal, “It’s about providing support and feedback to help strengthen the plans.”\n\n“I assume some of this will be iterative,\" he said, \"and welcomed.”\n\nDozens of applications received for vacancy on board\n\nThe board has three listed as staff on the state’s website. In addition to Leggett, Doss, and Manko, three others, including William (Brit) Kirwan, a former chancellor of the University System of Maryland, who chaired the commission that helped to create the Blueprint law, are on the seven-member implementation board. There is currently one vacancy left by Fagan Harris, who became chief of staff to Gov. Wes Moore.\n\nDuring Thursday’s meeting, Hise said 45 applications were received for Harris’ position. That number is two greater than the total number of valid applications received for all slots in 2021. She indicated that names of nominees could be sent to the governor after the legislative session ends in April. In that case, the individual would work in an interim capacity until he or she receives a hearing from the state Senate’s Executive Nominations Committee next year.\n\nMath scores across the state low. Board chair says, ‘work ahead.’\n\nThe board’s work with local jurisdictions comes as Maryland students returned to pre-pandemic levels of proficiency in English Language Arts, but the state's students lag in mathematics.\n\nLess than a quarter (22%) of third -through eighth-grade students statewide were proficient on the math Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program (MCAP), according to data from the Maryland State Department of Education released in January.\n\nOnly 31 percent of Montgomery County’s students scored proficient while Washington County, by comparison, had a 26 percent proficiency rate, and Wicomico County, on the state’s Eastern Shore, a 19 percent rate.\n\nNo jurisdiction had above 40 percent of students in that cohort proficient on the math assessment, and only one jurisdiction (Howard County) had a proficiency rate above 30 percent on the Algebra I assessment, which was reported at the same time.\n\nLeggett, in recognizing the accomplishment of receiving each of the plans, acknowledged the path as the board prepares for the plans review.\n\n“We have a great deal of work ahead of us,” he said.\n\nDwight A.

I've got work to do in Congress.\"\n\nYet those issues will weigh heavily on next year's race.\n\nWhen Delaware voters head to the polls in November 2016, they will also be casting ballots for a new president and a new congressman. Carney, who has broad Democratic backing and an overwhelming voter registration advantage, will begin next year's campaign as a clear frontrunner over any Republican.\n\nThe Republican race will feature longtime Sen. Colin Bonini, of Dover, and retired state trooper Lacey Lafferty.\n\nDelaware Gov. Jack Markell, who is backing Carney's campaign, is constitutionally bound to two four-year terms, and will leave office in January 2017. Along with Markell, U.S. Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons, both Delaware Democrats, are supporting Carney's candidacy.\n\nBonini, who has represented the Dover area in the General Assembly since 1994, will likely have political and financial advantages over Lafferty, a political newcomer with no experience raising money or building support for a statewide campaign. Bonini ran for state treasurer in 2010, narrowly losing to Democrat Chip Flowers.\n\nBonini declares for governor's race\n\nRep. John Carney enters 2016 governor race\n\nEither Republican will face imposing challenges against the Democratic candidate next fall.\n\nDemocrats outnumber Republicans by 125,000 voters statewide. Just two of Delaware's statewide elected officials are Republicans – Treasurer Ken Simpler and Auditor Tom Wagner. Both chambers of the General Assembly are controlled by Democrats. And a Democrat has controlled the governor's office since 1993, when Republican Gov. Michael Castle completed two terms in Delaware's top political office and began his career in Congress.\n\nYet, the issues are the same for a Democrat or Republican.\n\nBusiness leaders are already cautioning that lawmakers could face exploding budget deficits that threaten to define the next decade in Dover. A September report from the Delaware Business Roundtable, a coalition of Delaware's top CEOs, said Delaware lawmakers could face a $600 million annual budget gap in 2025 without action to curtail spending on benefits for public employees, public education and Medicaid, the low-income health insurance program.\n\nDelaware policymakers \"haven't really addressed spending in a big way since the financial crisis, but they don't have the revenue to fund the spending they have,\" acknowledged James Butkiewicz, an economist and chair of the Department of Economics at the University of Delaware.\n\nMedicaid costs, for example, are up 59 percent since Markell took office, according to a News Journal review of Delaware budget data. Fringe benefit costs for state employees, including pension contributions, are up 27 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, tax collections are falling in key areas such as taxes on gambling or revenue from Delaware's unclaimed property law – which forces Delaware-registered corporations to turn over revenue from unclaimed gift cards, uncashed checks or dormant stock accounts.\n\n\"We need to decide as a state what we want from state government and how we're going to pay for it. There are not going to be simple solutions,\" said Tom McGonigle, Markell's first-term chief-of-staff who helped navigate an $800 million budget deficit in recession-ravaged 2009.\n\n\"We are going to have to decide whether we want to have a Medicaid program as extensive as we have, whether we want to have class sizes where they are now, the benefit package that we give to state employees,\" McGonigle added. \"We have to make these decisions and figure out how we are going to pay for them.\"\n\nIt is not clear that top legislative Democrats in Dover take the problem as seriously as does the Business Roundtable. Democratic leadership negotiated until dawn on July 1 to overcome a $60 million budget deficit that amounted to just 1.5 percent of total operational spending in Delaware's budget. They ultimately relied on one-time money from financial crisis-related settlements with Citigroup and Bank of America to balance higher state spending.\n\nIn a News Journal column, leadership Democrats in the Delaware House and Senate criticized the Roundtable report as a mere lobbying effort, and were largely dismissive of its findings.\n\n\"It's not every day in Delaware that a lobbying effort garners so much attention,\" wrote House Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf, D-Rehoboth, and Senate President Pro Tem Patricia Blevins, D-Eslmere. They called the Roundtable's report a \"breathless, sky-is-falling view into the future.\"\n\nIt is true that Delaware's problems amount to more than negotiations over dollars-and-cents budgeting.\n\nData released last week by the Markell administration show that Delaware public school students who are minorities, come from low-income families or have a disability continue to achieve at far lower levels than their peers.\n\nThe achievement gap persisted as Delaware schools switched this year to a more difficult standardized test, the Smarter Balanced assessment. The gap was stark along racial lines. Just 10 percent of black, high school juniors met proficiency standards on the math portion of the test. Thirty-one percent of white students were proficient compared with 57 percent of Asian-American students. That disparity was evident across grade levels and subject areas.\n\nDelaware taxpayers already spend $1.3 billion on public education at the state level – much of it on salaries and benefits for teachers. That accounts for one-third of all Delaware state government operating spending.\n\nPer student, Delaware spent more in 2013 on education at the local and state levels than all but nine other states and the District of Columbia, according to an analysis by Governing magazine.\n\nStill, says Sen. Harris McDowell, a Democrat from Wilmington who co-chairs the General Assembly's budget committee, underachieving students need more attention from state policymakers.\n\n\"We're not addressing the shortfall of kids when they hit the system the first day – kids who are arriving at school unprepared to receive the education for which we're paying,\" McDowell said. \"That's not their fault. You could put the fault on the parents. But that's a no win game. What we have to do is identify the missing needs and replace them. It's going to take money.\"\n\nDelaware's next governor also will face stubborn economic challenges. Markell's tenure has been marked by a falling joblessness – the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.7 percent in February 2010 to 4.9 percent in August.\n\nYet economic growth in Delaware continues to lag other states and trail economic progress nationwide. Delaware's gross domestic product, a measure of goods and services produced in the state, grew at a rate of 1.2 percent in 2014, a full point behind the national economy, according to U.S. Department of Commerce data.\n\nButkiewicz, the University of Delaware economist, said slow income growth and the addition of lower-paying jobs are partly to blame. But solving those issues could be tricky.\n\n\"The quality of jobs and the growth of income are issues. They're not just local issues. We're seeing the same thing nationwide,\" Butkiewicz said. \"Median household income just isn't growing. It's a problem bigger than Delaware. There are no easy solutions. It's not obvious how the governor of a small state is going to do a lot better than other places.\"\n\nRich Heffron, president of the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce, said Delaware could drive economic growth by redeveloping industrial sites like the century-old century Evraz Claymont Steel plant.\n\nDelaware lawmakers and the state's next governor should consider easing restrictions under Delaware's Coastal Zone Act to allow for additional industrial development, and job creation, Heffron said. The 44-year-old law bans heavy industrial development along the Delaware River, the Delaware Bay and the Atlantic coast.\n\n\"It's been 45 years since we passed the original (Coastal Zone) act,\" Heffron said. \"We've been talking about this for a long time. There's clean industry we can move in here.\"\n\nDelaware also should invest more in higher education, and explore ways to benefit from Sunoco's $3 billion pipeline plan to transform the Marcus Hook, Pa. refinery on Delaware's northern border into a natural gas storage and distribution complex.\n\n\"Where are our opportunities?\" Heffron asked. \"How do we compete?\"\n\nRobert Perkins, executive director of the Delaware Business Roundtable and a former top aide to Republican Govs. Pete du Pont and Michael Castle, said state finances and Delaware's economic issues go hand-in-hand. And they will be forefront among the annual issues facing the state's next governor.\n\n\"The state's revenue portfolio, creating wise and reasonable spending levels, and more robust economic growth that brings with it good payment jobs are three issues that are going to be with us for a long time,\" Perkins said. \"We need to focus on them every year. Those issues are ones that have consequences for the future economic prosperity of our state and every Delawarean.\"\n\nContact Jonathan Starkey at (302) 983-6756, on Twitter @jwstarkey or at jstarkey@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2015/07/26/million-sought-planned-wilmington-stock-exchange/30711857/", "title": "$15 million sought for planned Wilmington stock exchange", "text": "Xerxes Wilson\n\nThe News Journal\n\nA new Delaware company led by prominent figures in national financial and political circles, including a former top aide to Vice President Joe Biden, is seeking a $15 million bond from New Castle County to create a stock exchange headquartered in Wilmington.\n\nCounty Council on Tuesday is scheduled to review a proposal from Delaware Board of Trade Holdings Inc., which was incorporated in June and is led by John F. Wallace, former CEO of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. Dick Grasso, former chairman and CEO of the New York Stock Exchange, and Joseph J. Grano, former chairman and CEO of UBS Capital Markets, are listed as advisers for the company.\n\nThe company wants to launch two alternative trading systems in Wilmington – one for trading of U.S. and foreign securities and the other for small and medium businesses that don't qualify for listing on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. Both would be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. All transactions would be handled electronically.\n\nCounty Chief Administrative Officer David Grimaldi said the bond would pay for technology to set up the exchange and be combined with money from outside investors to cover financial requirements. He said officials approached county leaders about the project earlier this year.\n\nThe bond would be repaid through revenues from the exchange and the company would assume the debt if it can't cover payments, he said.\n\n\"There is no risk to the county,\" Grimaldi said. \"This helps us get back to the core of being a business-friendly state.\"\n\nThe exchange is expected to create about 100 jobs paying an average of $150,000 and contribute to the \"ecosystem\" of account and corporate services in the city, he said.\n\nCompany officials have been asked to present the proposal to the county Finance Committee and County Council on Tuesday.\n\nSenior managers for the company include Nick Niehoff, a former Nasdaq executive and CEO of the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, and Dennis Toner, an aide to Biden for more than three decades in the U.S. Senate and later as vice president. Toner, of Rehoboth Beach, was also on the board of the U.S. Postal Service from 2010 to 2012.\n\nWilmington attorney Michael Kelly, who is representing the company, said they are deciding between locations on the riverfront and on King Street downtown. Kelly said the company hopes to be running 90-120 days after the bond deal is approved.\n\n\"I think it is great for Delaware because of jobs, jobs, jobs and it puts us on the map,\" Kelly said. \"This is the corporate capital of the world. It is natural.\"\n\nDelaware is the corporate home to 64 percent of Fortune 500 companies. Corporations are attracted to Delaware because of low taxes and advanced business laws. The state's key attraction is the Court of Chancery, considered to be the nation's preeminent business court.\n\nDelaware set a record for business formation in 2014, with 169,000 new entities forming under the Delaware General Corporation Law. That beat the old record of 162,000 set in 2000. The Division of Corporations also reported 89 percent of all 2014 U.S.-based initial public offerings were based in Delaware.\n\nThe company, in a planning document submitted to the county, said the exchange also will \"grow Wilmington's recognition as a business center\" by using \"live broadcasts, social media and conference networking.\"\n\n\"We are going to have financial media here. We are going to have companies that want to raise money fly into Delaware, do the public relations thing and list on the exchange,\" Grimaldi said.\n\nIt would be the first alternative trading system in Delaware. Gov. Jack Markell and former Delaware Economic Development Office Director Alan Levin met with the representatives of the organization about the project in May, Markell spokeswoman Kelly Bachman said by email. It is unclear now what state regulatory approvals the project might require.\n\nA spokeswoman for Wilmington Mayor Dennis P. Williams said they had not heard enough about the proposal to comment.\n\nThe stock exchange is seeking to capture a share of business created by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act passed by U.S. Congress in 2012, which sought to make it easier for small companies to raise capital.\n\nSmall companies can now sell up to $50 million in shares in a 12-month period without the full reporting requirements of going public. Previous rules capped such offerings at $5 million.\n\nLawrence Hamermesh, a professor of corporate governance at Delaware Law School, said the previous system meant stakes in a company couldn't easily be sold or traded.\n\n\"Five million was trivial. Fifty million is not,\" he said. \"This is the [regulation] that has the most potential to change the shape of the capital markets for small companies.\"\n\nHe said the company appears to be \"trying to get on the ground floor and recognize that the regulatory situation has shifted with opportunities that were not here two years ago.

The lawsuit, filed Monday, alleged that 46-year-old Dennis Brown of Fleming Island, Florida, suffered a cardiac arrest on the way home from his local Panera, where he drank three Charged Lemonades.\n\nAccording to the suit, Brown generally avoided drinking significant amounts of caffeine and did not consume energy drinks as a rule, thanks to his diagnosis of high blood pressure. Brown, who was known to frequently stop by the Panera Bread after his shifts at a supermarket, was also diagnosed with an unspecified chromosomal disorder, developmental delay, and intellectual disability, said the lawsuit.\n\nAnother death linked to Panera's Charged Lemonade\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by Philadelphia-based law firm Kline & Specter, PC, which also represents the family in the case of Sarah Katz who likewise allegedly died after consuming a Charged Lemonade drink.

Experts say 53.4 million Americans will travel at least 50 miles roundtrip this year, 6.4 million more than 2020's holiday, which was negatively affected by COVID-19.\n\nThis year's holiday travel period runs from 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, Nov. 25, to 11:59 p.m. on Sunday, Nov. 29, a AAA report states.

This year's tally is expected to be only 5% shy of the near-record, pre-pandemic level reached for the 2019 holiday.\n\nThat gap is projected to be even closer among Florida residents.\n\nThe report shows the gap among Florida residents will be only 2% when compared to 2019, with 321,000 more people from the Sunshine State expected to take a trip. AAA predicts nearly 2.9 million Floridians will travel for Thanksgiving, also up 13% from 2020.\n\n“It’s beginning to look more like a normal holiday travel season, compared to what we saw last year,” said Debbie Haas, AAA-The Auto Club Group's vice-president of travel for AAA said in a press release.\n\n“Now that U.S. borders are open, vaccinations are readily available, and new health and safety guidelines are in place, travel is once again high on the list for Americans who are ready to reunite with their loved ones for the holidays,” Haas noted.\n\nLocal residents are planning trips\n\nMany Marion County residents say they are planning trips for Thanksgiving. Some will travel out of county, while others will head across town to the homes of friends and/or family. A few say they plan to stay home and keep the gatherings small.\n\nOcala resident Sandra Birken Fernandez said on a Star-Banner Facebook post seeking comments from travelers that she will be traveling by car this Thanksgiving this year, though she would fly if needed.\n\n\"We flew to California in late September, and all Southwest flights went very smoothly, 100% on time (very cheap, too),\" Fernandez noted on the post seeking comment.\n\nButterball CEO:Smaller Thanksgiving turkeys may be harder to find this year\n\nDuring the holidays this month and next, Fernandez said she \"will use the car for shorter trips (eight hours or less) and airplanes to visit family long-distance.\"\n\n\"I am not concerned about congregating indoors because I am fully vaccinated against COVID, and so are most people in my small family,\" she noted.\n\nRecently at Sam's Club, Ocala resident Maryanne Longo pumped gas into her car and talked about her plans for a trip to the Northeast for Thanksgiving.\n\n\"I'm traveling this Thanksgiving, but I'm flying,\" she noted, adding it's her first trip in two years. \"I can't wait to see my grandchildren and girls (daughters).\"\n\nMeanwhile, at the same gas station, Victoria, Texas resident Dan Hamby said he will be traveling this holiday season.\n\n\"We're going to New Mexico, Flagstaff and Palm Springs to meet family,\" he noted. \"We're all traveling.\"\n\nOcala resident Cindy Polcyn is planning a small gathering because she is still concerned about COVID-19.\n\nPolcyn, 64, said she was vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine, but was sickened for three days after the first dose and two days after the second one.\n\n\"I am 64 and do not yet meet the criteria for the booster, which i will get,\" she wrote in the Facebook post. \"I know people who as late as last week passed away from COVID.\"\n\nPolcyn said she is still concerned about the coronavirus.\n\n\"I still wear a mask in public places and go shopping at off times so stores are not crowded,\" she noted. \"COVID numbers are getting better, but COVID is still here. We will be celebrating but small gatherings.\"\n\nBusier roads and airports\n\nWith 6.4 million more Americans traveling this Thanksgiving, travelers should be prepared for roads and airports to be noticeably more crowded than last year’s holiday, according AAA's detailed report and press release.\n\nAAA predicts road travel to increase 8%, while domestic air travel, which has hit hard in 2020, is expected to be up 80% from last year.\n\n“The re-opening of the U.S. borders to international travelers means airports will be even busier than we’ve recently seen, so travelers must plan for longer lines and extra time for TSA checks,” Haas said in the release.\n\n“With flight delays and cancellations becoming a problem recently, air travelers are encouraged to consider travel insurance,\" Haas said. \"If your flight is cancelled, there are various (insurance) policies that would help offset unexpected expenses like a hotel, transportation and food.”\n\nAAA noted that even with air travel seeing a boost this year, a study revealed that the average airfare is $132, about 27.3% less than last year.\n\nThe report noted that Tuesdays and Wednesdays are still the most expensive and heaviest travel days, while Mondays and Thursdays are generally the lightest and least expensive.\n\nAAA says the week of Nov. 9 about two weeks before Thanksgiving and that could bring the best prices. Each day the closer it gets before Thanksgiving, the more the potential that airfare will escalate.\n\nThe study also found that hotel costs have increased by 39% in one year, with average nightly rates ranging between $137 and $172. Car rentals have increased by 4% to $98, the study showed.\n\nGas prices have had the largest increase, surging from $2.03 per gallon in Thanksgiving 2020 to $3.28 per gallon two weeks before the holiday. That means gas is nearly ^3% higher than last year.\n\n“Since many Floridians were unable to travel last year, it's unlikely that higher gas prices will keep them from hitting the holiday road in 2021,” said Mark Jenkins, spokesman for the AAA-The Auto Club Group. “Gas prices do not typically make the difference of whether Floridians will or will not travel.\"\n\nHe noted, however, the higher gas prices could impact how far they may drive.\n\n“Thanksgiving is one of the busiest holidays for road trips and this year will be no different, even during the pandemic,” says Bob Pishue, a transportation analyst for INRIX, a group that studies holiday traffic trends.\n\n“Drivers around major metros must be prepared for significant delays, especially Wednesday afternoon,\" Pishue noted. \"Knowing when and where congestion will build can help drivers avoid the stress of sitting in traffic.”\n\nJoe Callahan can be reached at (352) 817-1750 or at joe.callahan@starbanner.com.

We need to try to bend the curve, stop this exponential increase.\"\n\nThe advice at cdc.gov is repeated locally by Matthew Rill, a Baptist Medical Center emergency room physician and co-founder of Telescope Health. He said the Jacksonville area has been seeing some of its highest infection rates since the onset of the virus in March, so stay home and safe.\n\n\"Unfortunately gathering with family and friends outside of whom you see regularly this holiday season does put you and your loved ones at much higher risk of being infected with COVID-19,\" Rill said. \"I do not recommend large family and friend gatherings this holiday season.\"\n\nThe period from Christmas and New Year's usually sees high demand for vacations and travel, the American Automobile Association said. But while it predicts the majority of Americans will stay home due to pandemic-related health concerns, up to 84.5 million people will still take a trip of 50 miles or more sometime from Wednesday to Jan. 3, AAA said.\n\nStill, those on the road or air will be at least 34 million less compared to last year’s holiday season, an almost 29 percent decline, AAA said. The same trend could be seen in Florida, with projected holiday travelers down almost 30 percent. Even with AAA forecasts of almost 4.5 million Floridians traveling 50 miles or more, that's still a drop of almost 1.7 million people from last year.\n\n“While Thanksgiving is traditionally spent gathering with friends and family, the year-end holidays are when Americans traditionally venture out for longer, more elaborate vacations. That will not be the case this year,” AAA Auto Club Group spokesman Mark Jenkins said. \"Public health concerns and official guidance to not travel will encourage the vast majority of Americans to stay home for the holidays.”\n\nJacksonville International Airport COVID precautions\n\nDespite CDC warnings about the virus prior to Thanksgiving, Jacksonville International Airport saw 20,048 passengers going through TSA checkpoints on the five-day holiday weekend. Again, that was far below Thanksgiving of 2019.\n\nTSA figures for this year's travel on the day before Thanksgiving, usually the busiest travel day, saw 4,725 passengers flying out of Jacksonville vs. 11,400 on the same day last year. And AAA's pre-Thanksgiving estimate of a 10 percent decline in nationwide Thanksgiving travelers is now expected to be closer to 15 percent to 20 percent when final numbers are tallied.\n\nJacksonville airport officials don't have estimates yet for the Christmas and New Year's travel period. But the busiest days will be Wednesday, Monday and Jan. 3, based on scheduled flight numbers through the rest of the month.\n\nThe number of scheduled flights is down on those days from last year's Christmas holiday season, with 61 set for Wednesday vs. 102 on the same day in 2019. This year's numbers are similar on the other busy travel days: 60 flights Monday vs. 2019's 102; 56 on Dec. 30 vs. 102 last year; and 61 on Jan. 3 vs. 99 last year, JIA said.\n\nThe airport is maintaining its health and safety regulations, including frequent cleaning of high-touch areas throughout the terminal and hand sanitizers placed in numerous spots. There are plexiglass barriers at ticketing and gate areas, mandatory temperature checks for employees and reduced seating at restaurants.\n\n\"Masks are required,\" airport officials said. \"Travelers are encouraged to socially distance whenever possible in the terminal.\"\n\nThe economy parking lots, opened for Thanksgiving, will not re-open during the Christmas and New Year’s holidays. But there are reduced rates in garages and daily surface lots.\n\nDespite precautions, a road trip is a better idea this holiday season, Rill said. AAA predicts road trips will account for 96 percent of holiday travel nationally, up to 81 million Americans. That's still a 25 percent drop compared to last year.\n\n\"Driving reduces the number of close interactions with others, if it’s somewhere you can reach within one day,\" the doctor said. \"Although the airlines are taking extra measures to reduce risk of infection, flying is still risky due to close contact with others, enclosed spaces and high-touch surfaces.\"\n\nFor anyone who travels, the CDC recommends they get tested for COVID-19 one to three days before going, and another three to five days after travel. They should also reduce nonessential activities for seven days after travel. Those who do not get tested should reduce nonessential activities for 10 days after travel, the agency said. Especially get tested before and after to protect elderly and high-risk family and friends, plus guard against further spread of the virus, Rill said.\n\nHe emphasized that people wear a triple-layer face covering, which is much more effective than single-layer cloth. Wash hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, as well as maintain that 6-foot safe social distance.\n\nVacationers also should pack face masks, disinfecting wipes, hand sanitizer and a thermometer.\n\nRill said the bottom line for anyone planning to be with friends or family for the holidays: If someone there is at a high risk of getting COVID-19, don't go.\n\n\"I highly recommend you consider a virtual family gathering this season,\" Rill said. \"The latest public reports indicate that nearly one in 10 are testing positive for COVID-19, and many without external symptoms. The absolute safest way to congregate this holiday season would be virtually or with loved ones you are around daily.\"\n\nThere could be one holiday present for Florida travelers: lower gas prices, AAA said. Florida drivers are paying an average of $2.14 per gallon, 31 cents less than last year's Christmas Day. If the state average remains below $2.21 per gallon on Christmas Day 2020, it’d be the lowest price for the holiday in four years.\n\nTo check COVID-19 travel restrictions in the United States and Canada, go to AAA's interactive map at bit.ly/2Wz2ngX.\n\nDan Scanlan: (904) 359-4549", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/12/21/winter-storm-warning-forecast-blizzard-frigid-temps/10937260002/", "title": "Most of US to be 'dangerously cold' as holiday week winter storm ...", "text": "This page recaps the weather and forecast for Wednesday, Dec. 21.

Heavier snow could exceed a foot over the Great Lakes through Friday. St. Louis, Detroit and Chicago will all be hit. “The big deal in these areas is not the amount of snow, but the extreme cold accompanying the snow and the extreme wind,” Kines said.\n\n\n\nMidwestern U.S. states into the Great Lakes can expect blizzard conditions from snow and strong winds, and light to moderate snowfall is forecast.

The combination could make for treacherous travel regardless of whether heavy snow is falling.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned of whiteout conditions on roads in the central and eastern U.S. where blizzards occur.\n\n\"Traveling in these conditions will be extremely dangerous, to at times impossible,\" the National Weather Service said. \"You risk becoming stranded and more vulnerable to the bitterly cold weather.\"\n\nWHAT IS A BOMB CYCLONE? A winter hurricane, explained\n\nThe worst air travel delays Wednesday were expected in major hubs such as Minneapolis and Denver amid the increasingly potent storm, AccuWeather said. Plummeting temperatures also could create flash-freeze conditions on roads where standing water doesn’t dry quickly, according to the weather service.\n\nSNOWSTORM ON THE WAY:Pre-Christmas blizzard expected to wallop northern US could strengthen into a bomb cyclone\n\nBlizzard's low temperatures could break records\n\nA low-pressure system developing along the storm’s frontal boundary is expected to strengthen rapidly by Thursday night over eastern Michigan, the National Weather Service said.\n\nThe rapid strengthening could lead to record-breaking frigid temperatures over parts of the Gulf Coast and eastern U.S. by Friday, according to meteorologists.\n\n\"Across Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, there are probably going to be some record lows set up there,\" Kines said.\n\nWHAT DEFINES A BLIZZARD?Heavy snow and high winds expected to sweep across country\n\nWHAT IS THUNDERSNOW?Explaining how a thunderstorm can produce snow\n\nStaying safe in life-threatening cold temps\n\nMeteorologists expect the most widespread weather hazard over the next few days to be related to the extremely cold air mass set to chill the central and eastern parts of the U.S.\n\nWind-chill values could drop as low as minus 70 degrees across the central High Plains, according to the National Weather Service.

Sauter and Thomas C. Frohlich\n\n24/7 Wall St.\n\nMost dangerous holiday produced 540 deaths this year\n\nThe traditional summer kickoff weekend is also deadly\n\nSome surprising results in government study\n\nAAA estimates that during this Christmas and New Year's season, nearly 95 million Americans will hit the road, traveling long distances to visit friends and family. Unfortunately, during the end-of-year holiday travel period, nearly 27,900 Americans will be seriously injured in auto accidents, and more than 250 will die.\n\nThe National Safety Council (NSC) has released reports estimating the number of traffic accidents and fatalities that occur on major holidays, including Christmas, New Year's, Thanksgiving, Memorial Day, Labor Day, and Independence Day. According to the NSC, the deadliest holiday this year will likely be the Fourth of July, which saw an estimated 540 motorists die during the travel period, which spans roughly four days. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the NSC's most recent estimates of motor vehicle accidents and casualties for the six big holidays.\n\nKen Kolosh, manager of statistics at the NSC, explained that while travel during all these major holidays increases, the number of fatalities doesn't always jump significantly. \"The New Year's holiday generally results in a significant increase in the number of fatalities when looking at a comparable period in same month,\" Kolosh noted. On the other hand, he added that in the case of Christmas, there isn't a significant increase.\n\nOne major reason for the difference may be alcohol consumption. A separate report released by the Council this month shows that holidays like New Year's Day and Independence Day are more likely to see people drink and drive. During the New Year's period, between 2007 and 2011, an estimated 42% of traffic fatalities were the result of drinking and driving. On Christmas, just 35% of accidents were the result of drinking and driving, less than any of the major six holidays.\n\nAs might be expected, poor weather is regularly a factor in the accidents and deaths on the road. However, according to Kolosh, the actual effects of a severe blizzard on a major holiday are not what you might expect. \"It's a little bit counterintuitive, but good weather in winter months actually results in more fatalities,\" he said. The reason for this, he explained, is people are less likely to travel more than absolutely necessary in bad weather.\n\nFor each holiday, the number of accidents fluctuates each year. In 2012, there were more than 350 fatalities during the Christmas travel period. This year, the National Safety Council estimates there will be just 105. The figure is lower largely because Christmas falls in the middle of the week and the travel period isn't spread out over a weekend.\n\nTraffic accidents and deaths during a holiday are also influenced by how many people actually travel that year. According to Kolosh, the strength of the economy influences the amount of driving Americans do. \"Macroeconomic issues such as recessions greatly impact fatalities on the road,\" he said. \"Recessions actually tend to save lives on the road. We've reached some really historic lows during the last recession.\"\n\nBetween 2003 and 2008, years when U.S. unemployment was relatively low, there were at least 370 traffic fatalities during the Christmas season. Between 2009 and 2011, when U.S. unemployment was at its worst, fatalities averaged around 250 per Christmas travel period.\n\nTo identify the most dangerous holidays, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the National Safety Council's estimates for the six holidays it measures of traffic accidents and fatalities occurring during that holiday travel period. All figures for 2013 and 2014 are estimates from the NSF. Travel periods change year-to-year, depending on which day of the week the holiday occurs. The NSC also estimated the proportion of traffic fatalities caused by alcohol consumption. Those figures are based 2007-2011 averages.\n\nThese are the most dangerous holidays\n\n6. Christmas Day\n\n> Estimated fatalities: 105\n\n> Deaths prevented by seatbelts: 38\n\nAccording to AAA estimates, holiday travel at Christmas will increase this holiday season for the fifth year in a row. About 30% of Americans are expected to travel during this time. From the afternoon of Christmas Eve through Christmas Day, the NSC estimates there will be 105 deaths and an additional 11,200 severe injuries in traffic accidents. This is significantly lower than in previous years. Last year, there were 351 fatalities. This decline is largely because Christmas falls in the middle of the week and the traveling period is significantly shorter than usual. The worst Christmas in recent history was in 2001, when 575 people were killed.\n\n5. New Year's Day\n\n> Estimated fatalities: 156\n\n> Deaths prevented by seatbelts: 57\n\nPeople are much more likely to drink and drive around January 1 than during any other major holiday. Nearly half of all 286 traffic fatalities during the New Year's travel period in 2010 were alcohol related. Between 2007 and 2011, alcohol accounted for 42% of all traffic deaths during the holiday. By comparison, during Christmas, alcohol was a factor in just 35% of fatalities. The 2010 New Year's period represented a low point for fatalities, at just 286. Traffic deaths ticked up to 348 by 2012. However, since the upcoming New Year's day — like Christmas — falls in the middle of the week, the total travel period for the holiday is shorter, the estimated 156 fatalities would be the lowest in some time. Safety is another reason the number of fatalities is projected to be so low, as the NSC estimates that 57 lives will saved by seat belts during the holiday.\n\n4. Labor Day\n\n> Estimated fatalities: 394\n\n> Deaths prevented by seatbelts: 143\n\nAccording to a AAA estimate, roughly 34.1 million Americans traveled at least 50 miles over the long Labor Day weekend this year. During the holiday period, which ran from Friday evening through midnight Monday, there were nearly 400 traffic-related deaths and more than 42,000 serious injuries, according to the NSC. If this year's estimate is accurate, there will not have been more than 400 driving fatalities during Labor Day for five straight years. Between 1995 and 2008, there were at least 450 deaths every year.\n\n3. Thanksgiving Day\n\n> Estimated fatalities: 436\n\n> Deaths prevented by seatbelts: 158\n\nOver the six-year period between 2006 and 2011, traffic deaths around Thanksgiving accounted for nearly 15% of all vehicle-related fatalities in November. Between 2001 and 2007, driving fatalities during the holiday were in excess of 500 each year, peaking at 623 in 2006. Over the last five years, however, deaths have not exceeded 500. In 2011, just 375 people died on the road over the holiday, the fewest deaths since at least 1995. This year, the NSC estimates deaths rose to 436, with an additional 46,600 nonfatal injuries, which include all unintentional injuries that require medical consultation, over the travel period running from Wednesday evening through Sunday.\n\n2. Memorial Day\n\n> Estimated fatalities: 407\n\n> Deaths prevented by seatbelts: n/a\n\nMemorial Day weekend — the first major holiday weekend of the year and widely considered the start of summer — has 13.1% more traffic deaths, on average, than a typical non-holiday weekend. The Monday of the four-day weekend, Memorial Day itself, has 32% more fatalities than the preceding three days, according to a study on holiday fatalities by Arnold and Cerrelli. The reason is likely the increased travel during the last long weekend day. The NSC estimate of 407 traffic deaths during the 2013 Memorial Day weekend is slightly higher than the 367 deaths during the 2012 holiday weekend. Since 2010, driving deaths during the holiday have remained below 400. Before 2010, the last time there were less than 400 deaths was 1998.\n\n1. Independence Day\n\n> Estimated fatalities: 540\n\n> Deaths prevented by seatbelts: 196\n\nThe NSC estimates that the Fourth of July will go down as the most dangerous holiday for travelers in 2013 with 540 deaths and nearly 58,000 serious injuries. Drinking and driving played a major role in this. According to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, between 2007 and 2011, alcohol accounted for 61 traffic fatalities per day over the Independence Day travel period, more than any other major holiday. Between 2007 and 2008, motor vehicle deaths around Independence Day more than doubled from 184 to 472. However, even the fatality rate that year did not approach the levels of the early 2000's, when deaths exceeded 500 nearly every year. In 2006, there were 629 automobile-related deaths. In 2002, there were 662.\n\n24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

The company would not disclose — for competitive reasons — the number of riders in Indiana but spokeswoman Lanesha Gipson said routes in an out of Indianapolis will be increased from 31 to 35 on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday.\n\nAt Indianapolis' Union Station Tuesday, travelers criss-crossing the country converged as they waited to catch their connecting buses and trains.\n\nPaula Botello, 44, Indianapolis, planned to take a Greyhound bus to Louisville Tuesday morning to visit her boyfriend for a turkey dinner Thanksgiving Day.\n\n\"I've never taken the bus, ever, so I don't really know what to expect,\" said Botello, who paid $81 for the one-way ticket and was sitting on a chair with a single travel bag. \"It's comfortable, so far.\"\n\nRobert Brown, 57, was returning home to Overland Park, Kansas, to be with his family at Christmas after a grueling week attending his 81-year-old father's funeral.\n\nBrown said he took an 11-hour Amtrak trip to Dayton, Ohio, last Tuesday. \"It was a very pleasant trip with a cafe car,\" he said.\n\nHe was returning on Greyhound.\n\n\"I haven't been on the bus for 40 years,\" he said. \"It's not bad. It's what you make of it. I've met some very nice people.\"\n\nCall Star reporter John Tuohy at 317 444-6418 and follow on Twitter @john_tuohy.\n\nThe price of gas in Indiana is at $2.77 its lowest since 2009.\n\nIndiana Thanksgiving drivers/gas price p/gallon.\n\n2008 - 734,556/$1.69.\n\n2009 - 780,905/$2.56.\n\n2010 - 818,191/$2.82.\n\n2011 - 854,735/$3.17.\n\n2012 - 903,015/$3.49.\n\n2013 - 901,187/$3.27.\n\n2014 - 952,056 (forecast)/$2.77.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/11/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airlines/2023/11/15/thanksgiving-travel-tips-2023-phoenix-sky-harbor-airport/71506389007/", "title": "Thanksgiving travel 2023: How crowded will the Phoenix airport be?", "text": "Expect a side of bustling crowds if you're traveling for your Thanksgiving turkey this year.\n\nWith 55.4 million Americans planning to travel 50 miles or more from home this Thanksgiving, AAA thinks the 2023 holiday will have the third-highest travel volumes on record and the highest since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAmerican Airlines forecasted a record number of passengers nationwide for the holiday.

The TSA screened from 2.1 million to 2.4 million passengers per day from Nov. 17-23, 2022, the seven days before Thanksgiving, data showed. The busiest day to fly was Nov. 23, 2022, with more than 2.4 million passengers.\n\nIs Thanksgiving Day a good day to fly?\n\nThanksgiving traditionally is the least busy day of the holiday period. The TSA screened more than 1.4 million passengers on Thanksgiving 2022.\n\nIs Phoenix airport very busy?\n\nSky Harbor does not forecast Thanksgiving weekend traffic in advance, but data from prior years shows November is one of the airport's busiest months because of Thanksgiving.\n\nThe airport recorded more than 3.9 million passengers in November 2022, making it the third-busiest month of 2022 and the busiest of the fall season.\n\nHow much does it cost to park at Sky Harbor?\n\nHere's how much passengers can expect to pay to park at Sky Harbor Airport for Thanksgiving 2023:\n\nGarages at the terminals cost $30 per day. Premium parking close to the terminal elevators costs $33 per day, while valet parking costs $39 per day.\n\nThree economy garages, one on the airport's west side and two on the east side, charge $16 per day.\n\nTwo economy surface lots, one on the east side and one on the west side near the 24th Street PHX Sky Train station, each charge $14 per day. You can ride the free PHX Sky Train to your terminal.\n\nAn economy \"park and walk\" lot that offers no transportation to the terminals is $9 per day.\n\nTo make sure you get a spot, reserve your parking ahead of time at www.skyharbor.com.\n\nIf you didn't make a reservation, use Sky Harbor's Find a Spot tool, at apps.skyharbor.com/findaspot, before you head to the airport. It will show you parking availability and pricing near your terminal.\n\nOff-site parking is available through companies like PreFlight Airport Parking and the Parking Spot.

The passenger can ride the free Sky Train to the terminals.\n\nIf you're picking someone up, wait in one of the free cellphone lots at Sky Harbor instead of driving laps around the terminals.\n\nHow early do you need to get to Phoenix airport?\n\nDomestic travelers should allow at least two hours before their flight is scheduled to depart. International travelers should allow at least three hours.\n\nPassengers should check their flight status with their airline before arriving at the airport.\n\nThose looking to get through security fast can consider the airport's free PHX Reserve program, where guests can reserve a place in the TSA line.

I once got in a nasty car wreck on Christmas Eve picking up my last present of the season.\n\nBut one trip will always stick out: In the winter of 2008, a friend and I drove up to New England to see the Mighty Mighty Bosstones play their annual Christmas shows in Boston and New Year’s Eve show in Providence, R.I. (I was 20. Ska was on a bit of an upswing. Stop laughing at me.)\n\nWhen we woke up on the morning of Dec. 31 with an hour's drive to Providence ahead, we were met with two inches of snow on the ground.\n\nGee, we stupidly thought to ourselves, sure glad we aren’t leaving now.\n\nAn hour or so later, there was 3 inches of snow on the ground and it wasn’t letting up. We packed as quickly as we could and hit the road.\n\nROAD SAGE: 'Peak' toll pricing is an absolute joke\n\nI don’t know what your version of “hell” is, but for me, it comes close to a three-hour, 55-mile drive (through an unfamiliar area) during a snowstorm in a Kia that was clearly not designed to handle slush, let alone the kind of snow that gives me heart murmurs (and the kind of snow that New Englanders shrug off as, “Oh, it’s Wednesday”).\n\nIf I remember correctly, we only had to dig ourselves out once (on a local road) and skidded out two or three times. I assume that’s what a normal Saturday in the dead of winter is like for New Englanders, anyway.\n\nNCAA president 'very pleased' with revisions to Indiana religious freedom law\n\nLuckily, Mother Nature seems to be in a good mood this winter and a Christmas or New Year’s snowstorm seems to be out of the question, at least in New Jersey. But that only means more cars and everything that comes with them – traffic, crashes and never-ending repeats of that annoying Mariah Carey song.\n\nAAA expects 100.5 million people to travel this year, more than 90 percent by automobile. And it’s nothing new: A study from GasBuddy said that only 19 percent of holiday travelers made new plans due to plummeting gas prices.\n\nAnd in a shocker to no one: Traffic is the leading cause of holiday stress for about 80 percent of respondents.\n\nROAD SAGE: Harsh truths for Thanksgiving travelers\n\nMaybe I’m weird (spoiler: I am), but the traffic doesn’t stress me out. It’s a fact of life.\n\nTerrible weather during a trip can make me sweat, but that’s not what I remember when I think about that trip. I can vividly recall the inside jokes, the songs we sang along to and the stupid decision to walk a half-mile from a friend’s apartment to the Middle East concert venue in Allston wearing jeans and a T-shirt.\n\nBut that terrible Boston-to-Providence drive? I had to look through old Facebook posts to remember much of it.\n\nIt’s a simple formula, folks: Enjoy the holidays and forget how you got there.\n\nAlso, if you could cool it with that Mariah Carey song, I’d appreciate it.\n\nSend questions, comments, road tips and angry rants to mdavis@gannettnj.com.

Two-time WNBA MVP Elena Delle Donne played there as well.\n\n“The opportunity to join Conference USA is a very proud moment for our entire university,” athletic director Chrissi Rawak said. “With this step forward, we will continue to offer an incredible student-athlete experience and elevate the visibility of all that is remarkable about UD.\"\n\nThe Blue Hens currently play in the Coastal Athletic Association. The CAA, which changed its name earlier this year from the Colonial Athletic Association, had 15 teams in football this season. The league lost James Madison after the 2021 season, and the Dukes’ transition to the FBS has gone so well they reached the AP Top 25 this year.\n\nUMass, Old Dominion and Georgia State are a few other former CAA programs that now play in the FBS.\n\nDelaware will compete in Conference USA in baseball, men’s and women’s basketball, cross-country, football, men’s and women’s golf, women’s soccer, softball, men’s and women’s tennis, track and field, and volleyball. The school said there would be more information in the months ahead about where its other programs will compete. The Blue Hens reached the NCAA Tournament in men's lacrosse last season and nearly upset top-seeded Duke.\n\nDelaware's most recent FCS football title came in 2003, and it has reached the championship game twice since then. The Blue Hens beat Lafayette last weekend in the FCS playoffs. Coach Ryan Carty's team plays at Montana in the second round this weekend.\n\nDelaware's varsity programs will stay in the CAA through the 2024-25 season, and all of them except football will remain eligible to compete for conference championships and the NCAA postseason. Football is not eligible for a conference title or the FCS playoffs once its transition to the FBS begins after this season.\n\nThe school said its 2024 football team will play an FCS schedule. It will be in Conference USA the following year, but won't be eligible to play in the league championship game until 2026.\n\nThe football team plays at 22,000-seat Delaware Stadium.\n\n\"We are confident that we have the infrastructure in place at UD to compete with the very best in college football and simultaneously witness the growth of our other intercollegiate programs in the department,” Rawak said. “UD Athletics continues to ascend, and Blue Hen football is prepared to take the next step and lead the way.”\n\nFBS football requires extra scholarships, and with gender equity in mind, Delaware said it will be adding another women's varsity sport that will be announced later.\n\n___\n\nAP College Football Writer Ralph D.
