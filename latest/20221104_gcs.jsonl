It may soon cost you $19.99 a ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nTwitter is considering offering verified accounts to users who are willing to pay $19.99 a month for a subscription service, and it may take away the coveted blue check marks of existing users if they don’t start paying for the product within 90 days, according to internal Twitter documents viewed by CNN.\n\nIt’s possible the plan and pricing could change, as Twitter’s new billionaire owner Elon Musk works to put his stamp on one of the world’s most important social media platforms. It’s also unclear if some verified users may be exempt from paying the fee; many international organizations and charities, for example are verified on Twitter.\n\nThe changes would update an existing paid Twitter feature known as “Twitter Blue, which currently costs $4.99 a month and is available in four countries including the United States, to include the verification feature. According to internal Twitter planning documents viewed by CNN, it appears the pay-for-verification feature would only be rolled out in those four countries to start and would be priced at $19.99 a month.\n\nThe Verge first reported the proposed pricing plan on Sunday. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n“The whole verification process is being revamped right now,” Musk tweeted on Sunday. Later that day, Musk engaged with a poll tweeted out by Jason Calcanis, a member of the billionaire’s inner circle, asking how much they would pay to be verified on the platform. A large majority of responders selected the “wouldn’t pay” option.\n\n“Interesting,” Musk tweeted in response to the poll.\n\nMusk has moved quickly to shake up Twitter, including by firing its top execs. In tweets over the weekend, Musk polled his followers about whether to bring back Vine, Twitter’s defunct short-form video service, and said “absolutely” in response to a user’s suggestion to rethink the platform’s character limits. It’s unclear how committed Musk is to pursuing any or all of these changes.\n\nEven before the deal was completed, Musk suggested the possibility of tying verification to a paid subscription service. In April, Musk said Twitter’s paid subscribers “should get an authentication checkmark.” In another tweet, he said: “Price should probably be ~$2/month, but paid 12 months up front & account doesn’t get checkmark for 60 days (watch for CC chargebacks) & suspended with no refund if used for scam/spam.”\n\nWhile the blue check mark has emerged as a status symbol for users, it’s also designed to ensure users can determine which accounts are authentic and which are not, particularly for celebrities, brands and other influential accounts. If Musk were to create a paid barrier for verification, it could make it harder to distinguish whether a notable name is a bot or not.\n\nMusk, who previously said he wants to “defeat the spam bots,” made the prevalence of spam and fake accounts on Twitter central to his effort to get out of the deal, before reversing course earlier this month and moving forward with the acquisition.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Jennifer Korn", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Jennifer Korn"], "publish_date": "2022/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/10/31/elon-musk-revamping-twitter-verification-blue-checkmark/10652240002/", "title": "Elon Musk: Twitter verification charge means blue check mark will cost", "text": "The process to gain a coveted blue check mark on Twitter may soon change.\n\nAfter reports of a $20 monthly fee for Twitter verification were met with backlash, new \"Chief Twit\" Elon Musk outlined a new payment structure to gain a coveted blue check mark.\n\nMusk's latest plan will have Twitter's subscription service, Twitter Blue, offer users verification and other benefits for $8 per month, with prices adjusted according to each country's purchasing power parity. Currently, verification is free.\n\nThat idea will likely stay in play after Musk indicated Monday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he will remain CEO of the newly purchased social media platform.\n\nReports Monday said the company was considering a $20 monthly fee for the blue check mark to the dismay of many verified accounts. Author Stephen King tweeted Monday saying he would leave the social media platform if it began charging that much for a blue check.\n\n\"We need to pay the bills somehow! Twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers. How about $8?\" Musk replied to King on Twitter. \"I will explain the rationale in longer form before this is implemented. It is the only way to defeat the bots & trolls.\"\n\nMusk said the monthly fee would also offer users priority in replies, mention and search; the ability to post long videos and audio; half as many ads; and a paywall bypass for certain publishers.\n\n\"This will also give Twitter a revenue stream to reward content creators,\" Musk said in a Tuesday tweet.\n\nThe reports of changes in the verification process came just days after Musk closed the deal to buy Twitter after months of legal wrangling between the billionaire and the company's management.\n\nStudy:Twitter's hate speech spiked following Elon Musk's takeover\n\nWhat is Twitter's verification process?\n\nAccording to current Twitter's current verification requirements, the blue verified badge is meant to signal the authenticity of accounts of public interest such as government office accounts, brands, celebrities and journalists.\n\nMusk called the current verification process a \"lords & peasants system.\"\n\nHis vision for the new verification system would give public figures a secondary tag below their name, as is the case for politicians currently.\n\nElon Musk now owns Twitter:What's next for the social media giant?\n\n'Freed' bird:Day 1 of Elon Musk's Twitter and the social media platform's path forward\n\nHow much does Twitter verification cost?\n\nThe current Twitter verification process is free, but the account must be \"authentic, notable and active\" to receive a blue check mark, according to current requirements.\n\nBut that may change under Musk.\n\nWhat is Twitter Blue?\n\nMusk's new plan would have verification tied to Twitter Blue. The subscription service was launched in June last year and gives subscribers \"exclusive access to premium features,\" including an option to edit tweets.\n\nThe service currently costs $4.99 per month.\n\nGraphics:Did Elon Musk fire everyone at Twitter? Ned Segal, Parag Agrawal get the ax. What to know\n\nWhat's the blue check mark on Twitter?\n\nThe blue badge lets users know an account's authenticity has been verified by Twitter. Public figures such as politicians, athletes and journalists are typically verified.\n\nVerified accounts are identified with a blue check mark badge next to their display name.\n\nHow do I get verified on Twitter?\n\nTo get the blue check mark, Twitter requires eligible accounts to be \"notable and active\" and fall into one of its seven categories for verification:\n\nGovernment\n\nNews organizations and individuals in news\n\nCompanies, brands and organizations\n\nEntertainment\n\nSports and gaming\n\nActivists and organizers\n\nContent creators and influential individuals\n\nAccounts ineligible for verification include parody and unofficial fan accounts and individuals or groups associated with \"coordinated harmful activity or hateful content.\"\n\nTo apply, users need to confirm their identity by providing a link to an official website, a photo of a government-issued identification document, or an official email address. The type of evidence users need to submit depends on the categories for verification under which they fall.\n\nTwitter may remove blue badges from inactive and incomplete accounts and from accounts that have severely or repeatedly violated rules.\n\nDo you want to get verified on Twitter?:Here's how to get the blue check mark\n\nWill Twitter bring back Vine?\n\nMusk's vision for Twitter will likely bring other big changes at the company. Musk has instructed Twitter engineers to work on a reboot of the six-second video platform Vine, Axios reported Monday.\n\nTwitter shut down Vine in 2016, just three years after launching the service. Axios, citing unnamed sources, said the Vine reboot could be ready by the end of the year.\n\nSeparately, The Verge reported Musk told engineers to look into how much work it would take to bring back the video service.\n\nMusk tweeted a poll on Sunday asking if he should bring back Vine.\n\nWhat else has Musk changed at Twitter?\n\nTwitter's board was dissolved after Musk took over the company, making him sole director, according to a securities filing.\n\nThe company said all nine members of the board of directors were ousted as of the consummation of the $44 billion merger that closed Thursday.\n\nOne of Musk's first moves as owner of Twitter was also firing top executives, including the company's CEO Parag Agrawal.\n\nNews that Musk will continue as CEO of Twitter was not unexpected. But his ability to run five major companies, including Twitter, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Tesla and Neuralink, at the same time has raised questions about how well those duties may be executed.\n\n\"Tesla Inc. boss Elon Musk said in a filing on Monday he will serve as chief executive of Twitter, the social media company he just bought for $44 billion, a move that Wall Street analysts have said could stretch the billionaire thin,\" Reuters reports. \" ...

Citing Russia’s Ministry of Defense, Putin said 41,000 recruits were currently in combat formations of the Russian Armed Forces. However, Moscow’s mobilization efforts have been beset by errors, caused angry protests and prompted a mass exodus since it was announced in September. More than 200,000 people traveled from Russia into Georgia, Kazakhstan and the EU in just the first week, collective data from those regions showed. Tensions are also rising over the future of the Black Sea grain deal, with Russia claiming the corridor – which allows the safe passage of grain and oilseeds to reach global markets – is suspended. Ukraine, however, is insisting it is committed to its continuation.\n\n2. Paul Pelosi\n\nPolice have debunked a salacious conspiracy theory about the attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband. The false claim, being pushed by big names like Elon Musk and Donald Trump, Jr., suggests Paul Pelosi and the man who attacked him were gay lovers who had gotten into a fight. It runs contrary to the explanation police and federal law enforcement have outlined – that the suspect broke into Pelosi’s house and attacked him. “There is absolutely no evidence that Mr. Pelosi knew this man,” San Francisco Police Chief William Scott told CNN. “As a matter of fact, the evidence indicates the exact opposite.” Analysts say the explosion of social media posts discussing the theory shows how quickly conspiracies can spread, especially as violent threats against lawmakers are on the rise.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Disturbing' conspiracy theory takes root following Pelosi attack 03:37 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Mississippi\n\nMore than two months after residents in Jackson, Mississippi, were plunged into a public water crisis, the EPA announced Monday that the water in the city is safe to drink again. Water issues in the region were compounded after flooding overwhelmed the city’s already troubled water system and the main treatment plant failed, resulting in brown, cloudy water flowing from pipes. It also prompted a catastrophic water shortage and weeks of boil water notices. The city remains under a state of emergency, however, as Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves recently extended the order until late November.\n\n4. Trump\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to stop the IRS from turning over his tax returns to a Democratic-led House committee. Trump filed the emergency request Monday after a federal appeals court cleared the way last week for the returns to be disclosed to the House Ways and Means Committee in the coming days. The case is the most direct way for the House to obtain Trump’s federal tax returns after pursuing them through different avenues for years. Also on Monday, the criminal tax fraud trial against the Trump Organization began with New York prosecutors laying out an alleged 15-year scheme within the organization to pay high-level executives in perks like luxury cars and apartments without paying taxes on them. Trump is not a defendant in this case and is not expected to be implicated in any wrongdoing, but the charges against the real estate business he built from the ground up are the closest any prosecutor has gotten to the former President.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear what jurors in Trump Org. trial said about Trump 03:29 - Source: CNN\n\n5. Seoul crowd crush\n\nSouth Korean authorities say they had no guidelines on how to handle the huge crowds that gathered for Halloween festivities in Seoul as families mourn the 156 victims of Saturday night’s crowd crush. The incident took place in the narrow neon-lit alleyways of the popular nightlife district Itaewon, where witnesses described being unable to move or breathe as thousands of partygoers stood shoulder-to-shoulder in a street no more than 13 feet wide. With all of the victims now identified, officials say the tragedy affected mostly young people who had gone to Itaewon Saturday night, eager for South Korea’s first Halloween celebrations in years. Among the victims was Rep. Brad Wenstrup’s niece, Anne Marie Gieske, the Ohio Republican said in a statement Monday.

According to internal Twitter documents viewed by CNN, the company is considering a pay-for-verification feature that would give the coveted blue check marks only to users who are willing to pay $19.99 a month for a subscription service. Twitter may also take away the check marks of existing users if they don’t start paying for the service within 90 days, the documents said. However, it’s possible the plan and pricing could change, as Twitter’s new billionaire owner Elon Musk looks to put his stamp on the social media platform.\n\nTODAY’S QUOTE\n\n“I thought that part of what it meant to be an American and to believe in American pluralism is that actually our institutions, you know, are reflective of who we are, as people in all of our variety.”\n\n– Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, a liberal, speaking passionately Monday about why diversity is important in college admissions practices. With a 6-3 conservative-liberal majority, the Supreme Court is poised to strike down affirmative action – meaning colleges and universities would no longer be able to take race into consideration in admissions programs. This decision will likely overturn decades-old precedent and could diminish the number of African American and Hispanic students in higher education, advocates say.\n\nTODAY’S WEATHER\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Rain and snow for the Pacific Northwest as record heat hits Midwest 02:17 - Source: CNN\n\nCheck your local forecast here>>>\n\nAND FINALLY\n\n5 Deliciously Unique Coffees Around the World\n\n5 deliciously unique coffees around the world\n\nAs you drink your morning cup of coffee, watch this video to see the many diverse ways that you can prepare it.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nMisinformation is trending now that Elon Musk, the self-described “Chief Twit,” has bought Twitter, his favorite social media platform.\n\nMeanwhile, displays of hate are breaking out in public now that Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, has despicably fashioned himself as a folk hero for those spewing antisemitic messages, pushing his own anti-Jewish conspiracy theories.\n\nThe stories dovetail not just because they are built on the wild spread of false claims, but also because West’s Twitter account – locked in early October for an antisemitic tweet in which he said he was going “death con 3 on Jewish people” – was recently reactivated. More on that below.\n\nTweeting a conspiracy theory about Pelosi\n\nMusk, the world’s richest man, promised to keep Twitter from becoming “a free-for-all hellscape” and said he bought the platform to protect free speech, but over the weekend he grabbed real headlines for sharing fake news.\n\nHe responded to a tweet from Hillary Clinton in which he linked to a story with made-up accusations about the violent attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul. Read more about Musk’s tweet.\n\nMusk later deleted that tweet, but Twitter is crawling with false memes about the attack, as CNN reported Monday.\n\nIt’s impossible to wade through them. An emergency call taken out of context. An incorrect report about what the suspected attacker was wearing. It all feeds into the silly but specious conspiracy theories that are rampantly circulating, now, it seems, with Musk’s endorsement.\n\nRather than correct the mistake, Musk threw barbs at The New York Times, making a joke about the newspaper and accuracy.\n\nPointing fingers\n\nMusk’s tweet of the false story joined in with anger from conservatives at the allegation from Clinton and others that violent rhetoric should be associated with the GOP. In her tweet, Clinton had linked to a story from the Los Angeles Times about Pelosi’s alleged attacker and wrote that Republicans should be held accountable for spreading conspiracy theories.\n\nRead more on the partisan finger-pointing from CNN’s Stephen Collinson, who writes, “Republicans, while condemning the violence, are denying they have any culpability in fostering a poisoned political environment. Some even used it to pivot to new attempts to sow doubt on the integrity of US elections.”\n\nAnybody can be taken in by misinformation\n\nThis is a good place to note that pretty much anybody can be fooled by fake news on social media.\n\nCNN previously reported on a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2021 that suggested three-quarters of Americans overestimate their ability to spot something fake online.\n\nThe study involved surveys of 8,200 people and found the more confident a person was that he or she could spot false headlines, the worse that person was at it.\n\n“In all, these results paint a worrying picture: The individuals who are least equipped to identify false news content are also the least aware of their own limitations and, therefore, more susceptible to believing it and spreading it further,” according to the researchers, led by Ben Lyons, a professor of communications at the University of Utah.\n\nRepublicans, the study noted, have less trust in the media and were more confident in their ability to spot false news than Democrats.\n\nCheck everything\n\nThe need to verify what you see online is getting ever more important but also harder for users.\n\nIt’s not just news stories that can be fake. And it’s not just on Twitter.\n\nCNN Business has reported on a different study in which researchers submitted blatantly false election-related ads to Facebook, TikTok and YouTube. TikTok approved nearly all the false ads, and Facebook approved a significant portion, according to the report. YouTube, on the other hand, was able to identify the false ads and rejected them. Read more about the experiment.\n\nWhat should you do? Take a beat\n\nI asked CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan – who has for years covered the topic of misinformation and how it spreads online – how people can protect themselves.\n\n“Misinformation is clearly more pronounced on the right and far-right in American life at the moment, but it doesn’t mean it’s exclusive to one side of the political spectrum,” he said.\n\n“Often we can all be too quick to hit retweet or share on a post that seems to confirm what we want to believe to be true.”\n\nA sudden rise in antisemitic, racist tweets\n\nI suppose there’s a distinction between straight misinformation and hate, but it is blurred every day.\n\nThe New York Times noted data from the Anti-Defamation League that shows that antisemitic tweets and language surged after Musk took control of Twitter.\n\nThe Washington Post also cited data from a group that analyzes social media messages that showed use of the N-word surged since Musk’s takeover – something the NBA star LeBron James called out on Twitter.\n\n“I dont know Elon Musk and, tbh, I could care less who owns twitter. But I will say that if this is true, I hope he and his people take this very seriously because this is scary AF. So many damn unfit people saying hate speech is free speech.”\n\n‘Inauthentic’ accounts are a problem. Twitter promises crackdown\n\nMusk responded to James by pointing to a tweet by Twitter’s head of safety and integrity, Yoel Roth, that argued most of the accounts using the N-word were “inauthentic.”\n\n“We’ve taken action to ban the users involved in this trolling campaign — and are going to continue working to address this in the days to come to make Twitter safe and welcoming for everyone,” Roth said on the platform.\n\nThe prevalence of inauthentic Twitter accounts nearly derailed Musk’s purchase of the company.\n\nIs this a person or a troll? Is it news or made up?\n\nThat’s another thing to consider online. Is that viral or provocative post coming from a real person with real thoughts, or from a news organization that verified its reporting? Or is it from a Russian- or Chinese-managed bot?\n\nThe FBI warned this month that operatives affiliated with both governments are promoting misinformation about the integrity of US elections this year, according to a CNN report. There have been multiple, previous reports about Russia’s effort to exploit underlying racial divisions in the US, something we reported on most recently in June.\n\nChanges coming\n\nMusk, in an attempt to make Twitter profitable, is considering charging users for the right to have their account verified, which could actually make it more difficult to know which accounts are real.\n\nHe’s also promising a new council to review the company’s content moderation policies.\n\nHe is, however, claiming no part in the reinstatement on Twitter of West, which Musk said was undertaken before he took control of the company. West’s is one of just 124 accounts Musk follows on the platform.\n\nInspiring the fringe\n\nWhile Musk will presumably be asking corporations to advertise on Twitter, West has been excommunicated from his lucrative deals with Adidas and Gap and is no longer being feted on Fox, as he was by Tucker Carlson in early October.\n\nInstead of inspiring people to buy sneakers, he’s now inspiring people to unfurl anti-Jewish banners and make Nazi salutes over the 405 freeway in Los Angeles and to project antisemitic messages on a stadium for the Saturday game between the University of Georgia and the University of Florida.\n\nWest seems to be uncomfortable with that new role. In a long and rambling video posted to YouTube, he said he’s about love, not hate.\n\nPer CNN’s report on those comments: “I have no association to any hate group,” West said as he closed his remarks in prayer. “If any hate happens upon any Jewish person, it is not associated (gestures to himself) because I am demanding that everyone walk in love.”", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Now it wants to ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nIn recent months, bots have been top of mind for many who track the social media industry, thanks to Elon Musk’s attempt to use the prevalence of fake and spam accounts to get out of his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter. But bots aren’t just a challenge for Twitter.\n\nLinkedIn, often thought of as a tamer social platform, is not immune to inauthentic behavior, which experts say can be hard to detect and is often perpetrated by sophisticated and adaptable bad actors. The professional networking site has in the past year faced criticism over accounts with artificial intelligence-generated profile photos used for marketing or pushing cryptocurrencies, and other fake profiles listing major corporations as their employers or applying for high-profile job openings.\n\nNow, LinkedIn is rolling out new features to help users evaluate the authenticity of other accounts before engaging with them, the company told CNN Business, in an effort to promote trust on a platform that is often key to job searching and making professional connections.\n\n“While we continually invest in our defenses” against inauthentic behavior, LinkedIn product management vice president Oscar Rodriguez said in an interview, “from my perspective, the best defense is empowering our members on decisions about how they want to engage.”\n\nLinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft (MSFT), says it already removes 96% of fake accounts using automated defenses. In the second half of 2021, the company removed 11.9 million fake accounts at registration and another 4.4 million before they were ever reported by other users, according to its latest transparency report. (LinkedIn does not disclose an estimate for the total number of fake accounts on its platform.)\n\nStarting this week, however, LinkedIn is rolling out to some users the opportunity to verify their profile using a work email address or phone number. That verification will be incorporated into a new, “About this Profile” section that will also show when a profile was created and last updated, to give users additional context about an account they may be considering connecting with. If an account was created very recently and has other potential red flags, such as an unusual work history, it could be a sign that users should proceed with caution when interacting with it.\n\nThe verification option will be available to a limited number of companies at first, but will become more widely available over time, and the “About this Profile” section will roll out globally in the coming weeks, according to the company.\n\nLinkedin's new 'About this Profile' feature will show users when an account was created, when it was last updated and whether it has been verified using a work email or phone number. Courtesy Linkedin\n\nThe platform will also begin alerting users if a message they have received seems suspicious — such as those that invite the recipient to continue the conversation on another platform including WhatsApp (a common move in cryptocurrency-related scams) or those that ask for personal information.\n\n“No single one of these signals by itself constitutes suspicious activity … there are many perfectly good and well-intended accounts that have joined LinkedIn in the past week,” Rodriguez said. “The general idea here is that if a member sees one or two or three flags, I want them to enter into a mindset of, thinking for a moment, ‘Hey, am I seeing something suspicious here?’”\n\nThe approach is somewhat unique among social media platforms. Most, including LinkedIn, allow users to file a report when they suspect inauthentic behavior but don’t necessarily offer clues about how to detect it. Many services also only offer verification options for celebrities and other public figures.\n\nLinkedIn says it has also improved its technology to detect and remove accounts using AI-generated profile photos.\n\nThe technology used to create AI-generated images of fake people has advanced significantly in recent years, but there are still some telltale signs that an image of a person may have been created by a computer. For example, that person may be wearing only one earring, have their eyes centered perfectly on their face or have strangely coiffed hair. Rodriguez said the company’s machine learning model also looks at smaller, harder to perceive signals, sometimes on the pixel level, such as how light is dispersed throughout the image, to detect such images.\n\nEven third-party experts say detecting and removing bot and fake accounts can be a difficult and highly subjective exercise. Bad actors may use a mix of computers and human management to run an account, making it harder to tell if it’s automated; computer systems can rapidly and repeatedly create numerous fake accounts; a single human could simply be using an otherwise real account to perpetuate scams; and the AI used to detect inauthentic accounts is not always a perfect tool.\n\nWith that in mind, LinkedIn’s updates are designed to give users more information as they navigate the platform. Rodriguez said that while LinkedIn is starting with profile and message features, it plans to expand the same kind of contextual information to other key decision-making points for users.\n\n“This journey of authenticity is really significantly bigger than issues around fake accounts or bots,” Rodriguez said. “Fundamentally, we live in a world that is ambiguous and the notion of what is a fake account or real account, what is a good investment opportunity or job opportunity, are all ambiguous decisions.”\n\nThe job hunting process always involves some leaps of faith. With its latest updates, however, LinkedIn hopes to remove a little of the unnecessary uncertainty of not knowing which accounts to trust.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/11/05/twitter-elon-musk-takeover-layoffs-turmoil/8277528001/", "title": "Paid Twitter verification is rolling out: What to know about Elon ...", "text": "Elon Musk became the owner of Twitter on Oct. 27, paying $44 billion for the social network.\n\nMany Twitter employees were fired on Friday, part of Musk's plan to shrink its workforce by at least half.\n\nWhile Musk worries about Twitter revenue, many users are concerned about its online culture and consider leaving the platform.\n\nTwitter just finished its first full week with new owner Elon Musk at the helm.

I will unlock it.”\n\nHe tried to back out of the deal and Twitter sued him in July to force the completion of the acquisition.\n\nEventually, Musk offered to buy Twitter at the original price of $54.20 a share.\n\nElon Musk and Twitter:Billionaire's takeover raises more questions than answers about data privacy\n\nBroadband boost:Comcast is upping upload speeds.

On Thursday, employees got an email saying the company planned Friday to start job cuts.\n\nAbout half the company's staff was cut, prompting a lawsuit from some employees.\n\nMusk tweeted there was \"no choice when the company is losing over $4M/day.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as CEO in November 2021, apologized to employees saying, \"I own the responsibility for why everyone is in this situation: I grew the company size too quickly. I apologize for that.\"\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?:Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nHate speech, misinformation concerns persist\n\nMusk has long been critical of Twitter's content moderation policies and signaled his intent to reduce – but not eliminate – Twitter's control over what users are allowed on the platform and what they post.\n\nIt's a position cheered by some conservatives. But misinformation watchdogs worry his ideas will lead to an increase in fake content and hate speech. So far their concerns appear to be playing out:\n\nResearch suggests hate speech spiked. Hate-driven tweets quadrupled in the 12 hours after the acquisition, compared to the week leading up to Musk's takeover, according to researchers at Montclair State University.\n\nHate-driven tweets quadrupled in the 12 hours after the acquisition, compared to the week leading up to Musk's takeover, according to researchers at Montclair State University.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 things you need to know Tuesday, the 1st of November 2022. Today the Supreme Court on whether colleges may consider the race of their applicants, plus the latest from Brazil where Jair Bolsonaro still has not conceded and more.\n\n♦\n\nThe Supreme Court gathered yesterday to debate one of its most important questions of the term. Producer PJ Elliott spoke with USA TODAY Supreme Court correspondent John Fritze to find out more on whether colleges may consider the race of their applicants.\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nThere's two cases here, one involving UNC, one involving Harvard, and they're both pretty much raising the same question, which is whether these colleges can consider race when they do their admissions. And it seemed pretty clear that the majority of the court's conservatives were opposed to that idea. I don't think there's any question really that the court is going to rule against the schools. I think the question at this point is how far they go.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nJohn, what are the potential ripple effects of this case?\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nThere's been a lot of debate about that. A lot of academics feel like there could potentially be ripple effects into the private sector economy, into the employment economy, a lot of companies these days have DEI, diversity and inclusion programs intended to really reverse systemic discrimination and racism. That's not directly at issue in this case, we want to be clear about that, but the way things work at the Supreme Court is when you get a decision one way, there's often a bunch of other litigation that comes up behind it.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nThey are now going to go back and hand drafts back and forth for the next several months, and I expect we will not get a ruling anytime soon. I suspect this is going to be one they're going to do at the very end of the term, likely in June of next year.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou can find John's full story in today's episode description.\n\n♦\n\nA full day after losing Brazil's runoff presidential election, President Jair Bolsonaro has still not conceded. As of last night, he still hadn't spoken to the public or the media neither conceding nor challenging the election's results as some have feared. Left-leaning former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva won the runoff Sunday night with 50.9% of the vote to Bolsonaro's 49.1%. It was the closest election since Brazil's return to democracy in 1985. This was the scene as thousands of Lula supporters took the streets of São Paulo to celebrate.\n\n[Sounds of celebration]\n\nAnd unlike Bolsonaro, Lula spoke...\n\nTranslation of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva:\n\n\"It's not fair for a people so kind, so affectionate, a population that likes music like Samba, happy people to suffer so much because of a fascist government that didn't like people, who didn't like Black people, who didn't like indigenous people.\"\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBefore the runoff, Bolsonaro had repeatedly questioned the reliability of his country's electronic voting system, similar to former President Donald Trump who he admires. He also said he has proof of fraud, though has not provided any evidence. But in his silence, many of his closest allies publicly said he lost. Lower House Speaker Arthur Lira told reporters on Sunday, \"The will of the majority seen on ballots shall never be contested.\" São Paulo's governor elect and others also sent blessings to Lula. Like Trump, Bolsonaro has his own legal concerns. He's the target of a Supreme Court inquiry and to the spread of fake news and a Senate investigation has recommended that he be charged with crimes for his mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic. In his previous presidency from 2003 to 2010, Lula expanded a widespread social welfare program, but he's also remembered for corruption and served nearly two years in prison. This time around, he's pledged to boost spending on the poor, reestablish relationships with foreign governments and ban clear cutting in the Amazon rainforest.\n\n♦\n\nIn the wake of the Supreme Court's rejection of Roe vs. Wade, progressive men are being called on to raise their voices and become more active for abortion rights. PJ Elliott spoke with USA TODAY National Correspondent Bill Keveney for more.\n\nBill Keveney:\n\nThe conservative men is a reference to a lot of the legislators and governors in states that have passed strict abortion bans. But for progressive men, there are various groups and efforts that are trying to persuade men to support abortion rights, particularly in their choices in the election to make their voices heard. It's partly that abortion so directly affects women. So much of the focus has been on women, rightly so, but men are voters, too. They have opinions and there's a call on both sides, but in particular because of so much opposition to the Supreme Court decision for more liberal men to come out to persuade others and to vote in support of abortion rights.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nBill, let's talk about Kansas for a second. What happened there and how were they able to uphold abortion rights despite being such a conservative state?\n\nBill Keveney:\n\nKansas is a conservative state, but it's also a reminder that states can be red or blue, but they're not monolithic and they're a little bit more like the Western states where some of the conservative is more of a libertarian conservatism, and I think a lot of this was seen as perhaps whether should government be involved in this decision, in a personal decision.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nA 42-year old man has been charged with attempted murder, assault, and attempted kidnapping in connection with the violent attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In announcing charges against David DePape, the Justice Department said the suspect told police that he was looking for Nancy Pelosi and wanted to break her kneecaps if she did not answer his questions truthfully. Federal authorities hit him with a special assault charge that carries up to 30 years in prison and with attempted kidnapping of a United States official. The suspect allegedly assaulted Paul Pelosi with a hammer and police say he carried a backpack with tape, rope, gloves, and zip ties. San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins also unveiled her own charges, attempted murder, elderly abuse, threats to a public official and other local charges.\n\nBrooke Jenkins:\n\nWhat is clear based on the evidence that we have thus far is that this house and the speaker herself were specifically targets of the defendant.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAccording to court documents, Paul Pelosi engaged in conversation with the suspect before moving to a bathroom where he called 911. The attack came just over a week before midterm elections and amid a surge in threats against public officials. On the day of the Pelosi attack, a joint bulletin was released by the Department of Homeland Security, FBI, National Counterterrorism Center and US Capitol Police. It read, \"The most plausible domestic violent extremist threat is posed by lone offenders who leverage election-related issues to justify violence. Enduring perceptions of election fraud related to the 2020 general election continue to contribute to the radicalization of some domestic violent extremists and likely would increase their sensitivity to any new claims perceived as reaffirming their belief that US elections are corrupt.\"\n\n♦\n\nThe process to get that coveted blue check mark on Twitter may soon change. New Twitter owner and CEO Elon Musk said that the social media platform will change its verification process, tweeting yesterday that it's being revamped. He did not give any specific details, but there are reports that the company plans to charge $20 a month to be verified. The platform previously launched its Twitter Blue subscription service offering what it calls premium features, including the undo tweet feature. As of now, users can be verified without subscribing to Blue, but the company is now considering a plan that would require verified users to subscribe for $4.99 a month or risk losing their verification, according to the Platformer, a Silicon Valley newsletter. And technology news website The Verge is reporting that the company will actually raise the price of Twitter Blue to $19.99 a month. The current verification process has been free, but the account must be what Twitter calls authentic, notable, and active.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk has already made sweeping changes to Twitter's leadership. He fired top executives and made himself CEO last week. He's since also ousted all nine members of Twitter's board making him sole director. He's reportedly considering bringing back the video platform Vine, which shut down in 2016. As for his plans on content moderation, he tweeted on Friday that he's forming a content moderation council with diverse viewpoints. Critics have said they worry the app will become a cesspool of misinformation and hate speech without major restrictions. Others have applauded Musk for possibly lifting limits on speech. It's still not clear whether Musk will let some banned accounts back on like that of former President Donald Trump.\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things.

The move makes Twitter one of the best-known tech platforms so far to launch a feature for the flashy NFT trend.\n\nNFTs, or “nonfungible tokens,” are one-of-a-kind, verifiable digital collectibles, often works of art, that can be traded on the blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. While not exactly new, NFTs have exploded into a lucrative industry over the past year, with digital art works selling for millions of dollars, and artists, celebrities and companies jumping on board to make and sell them.\n\nNFTs such as characters from the popular “Bored Apes” collection have been popping up as people’s avatars on Twitter (TWTR) in recent months. The new feature, which is only available to users who pay for Twitter (TWTR)’s subscription service, will go a step further. It will verify someone’s ownership of the NFT by linking the person’s digital wallet where the NFTs are stored to their Twitter (TWTR) account.\n\nThe images will also look different on Twitter than typical profile pictures. The new NFT avatars will show up as a hexagon, instead of a circle, and users can click on them to get more information about the artwork, including its creator and where it’s listed.\n\ngm!\n\n\n\nYou asked (a lot), so we made it.

Meta Platforms is reportedly considering launching a marketplace for NFTs on Facebook (FB) and Instagram, according to reports from the Information and the Financial Times.\n\nIt also marks Twitter’s latest foray into “decentralized” technologies. In July, Twitter’s founder and then-CEO, Jack Dorsey, said bitcoin would be a “big part” of the company’s future. In September, the company introduced the ability for users to tip creators using bitcoin. Twitter also announced last year that it was building a crypto team to focus on cryptocurrencies, blockchain and related technologies.\n\nThe rollout of the new NFT profile pictures is fairly limited for now.

But for most people, that should translate to your primary email and social media accounts.\n\n► T-Mobile breach: Carrier investigating claims of a data breach that reportedly affected 100 million of its wireless customers\n\nI'm not famous. Why do I care?\n\nEven if you don't have a huge digital presence, you've probably encountered two-factor authentication before. Ever signed into an account using your name and password and then been asked to take a second step to prove you are who you say you are? That's two-factor authentication at work.\n\nIt's often used to reset passwords and sign into all types of sensitive accounts, including work-related software, social media platforms and maybe even your 401(k) account.\n\nMany users often choose to have a text sent to their phone to complete the process. That's pretty secure, right? After all, you are holding your phone in your hand right now, so no one else can get at it – right?\n\n► Lock down your phone from snoops and hackers: Security tips and tricks\n\nWrong. SIM swaps have been a risk across the industry for years as attackers have exploited customer-service reps to stage account takeovers.\n\nMore secure alternatives\n\nYour options for upgrading from text-based two-step verification fall into a few common categories, ranked from easiest to most secure:\n\nA yes/no prompt shown in an app on a mobile device also signed into the same account. You then approve it if you know for certain that the new login is legitimate.\n\nA one-time code generated by special software such as Google’s Authenticator apps for Android and iOS that you type into the device or browser doing the new login. Many premium password-manager services will also generate these codes.\n\nAn encrypted USB security key that you associate with your account and then confirm by plugging into the new device (or, in the case of NFC wireless-enabled keys, by tapping it against an NFC-enabled mobile device). These cost extra, usually starting at $25, but they can’t be fooled by phishing pages at lookalike addresses – and one can protect multiple accounts.\n\nWho supports what?\n\nUnfortunately, not every service supports all the options I just listed.\n\nApple, for example, requires a phone number, although the company suggests “verifying an additional trusted phone number other than your own phone number.” Normally, Apple will verify a new login to its iCloud service by pushing a one-time numeric code to an Apple device you’ve already designated as trusted, which you then enter into the new device. Apple does not support USB security keys or one-time codes generated on non-Apple devices.\n\nFacebook made its own case for unlisting your digits when it got caught using wireless numbers users had added for security purposes as an ad-targeting factor. Go ahead and delete your number from the social network; instead, you can verify Facebook logins with a simple yes/no dialog in its mobile apps, one-time codes generated by either its own apps or third-party apps like Google Authenticator, or a USB security key.\n\nGoogle, among the earliest major supporters of two-step verifications, now suggests the device-prompt approach as its first line of defense and no longer requires a phone number for verification. You can also secure your login with one-time codes or a USB security key. Another reason to enable at least one of these confirmation options: It should vastly lower the odds of getting locked out of your Google accounts if you forget a password.\n\nMicrosoft also offers a full menu of phone-number-free verification methods. You can verify a login through a device prompt sent to its Microsoft Authenticator app (available for both iOS and Android), entering one-time codes generated by an authenticator app or password manager, or via plugging in a USB security key. In my experience, Microsoft has been pickier in accepting that last method than the other services listed here.\n\nIf you’re using a password manager to generate any of these one-time codes, you should have non-phone-number two-step verification set up there as well. That will also be one password worth writing down – and storing someplace safe at home that you can locate in an emergency.\n\nTravelers, take note\n\nOh, and here's another downside to using your phone number for two-factor authentication: Relying on your wireless service for verification can also leave you cut off in situations where you have no service, such as on airplanes or when traveling overseas. If you choose the text option, you won't get the verification text until you have cell service again.\n\nSo the next time you get prompted to choose how to verify your identity, don't be so quick to choose the \"send a text\" option. It may take an extra minute or two but it could save you a lot more time and hassle by preventing identity theft.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/04/26/elon-musk-twitter-celebs-leaving/7450645001/", "title": "Elon Musk: Tucker Carlson, others leaving, rejoining after Twitter buy", "text": "Elon Musk struck a $44 billion deal to buy Twitter on Monday.\n\nIn the hours following, Tucker Carlson, Mark Levin and more returned to the app.\n\nJameela Jamil wrote her \"last tweet,\" while other celebrities are also considering leaving.\n\nElon Musk struck a $44 billion deal to buy Twitter on Monday.

It wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company. Solving for the problem of it being a company, however, Elon is the singular solution I trust. I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness,\" Dorsey tweeted on Monday.\n\nHere's a list of who's leaving, returning to, or criticizing Twitter after the Musk takeover:\n\nWho's returning to Twitter?\n\nTucker Carlson\n\nFox News' Carlson returned to Twitter hours after Musk's deal was finalized. Carlson was suspended from Twitter in March, after violating the platform's rules for hateful content. Tweets from the Babylon Bee and Charlie Kirk referred to Assistant Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine – who is a transgender woman – as a \"man\" and, in a now-deleted Tweet, Carlson insisted that both posts were \"true.\"\n\nAs Musk's deal is not yet complete, it is unclear if Carlson's suspension ended because of the new owner.\n\nMark Levin\n\nLevin, host of the syndicated radio show \"The Mark Levin Show\" and \"Life, Liberty & Levin\" on Fox News, also returned to Twitter on Monday – for the first time since January 2021.\n\nLevin was not banned from Twitter, but he suspended his own account in January 2021 \"in protest against Twitter's fascism.\" \"Thanks to new ownership, I’ve decided to come back!\" Levin tweeted on Monday.\n\nAzealia Banks\n\nTwitter has suspended Banks multiple times. In 2016, the rapper was suspended following reported racist and homophobic tweets directed at Zayn Malik. She was also suspended in 2020 for a series of transphobic tweets.\n\nFollowing Musk's Monday acquisition, Banks took to her Instagram Stories on Tuesday, writing, \"I actually *have* to thank Elon for buying twitter, I actually got back on.....\" She also detailed her experience being banned, calling Dorsey \"racist AF\" and writing about \"his plot to capitalize off the first Black Lives Matter movement.\"\n\nOn Instagram, Banks posted a screenshot of what appeared to be a new Twitter handle early Tuesday, which is not verified on the platform yet.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nTwitter permanently suspended Greene's personal account in early January for repeated violations of the social media platform's COVID-19 misinformation policy.\n\nAfter Musk's deal was finalized on Monday, Greene used her Congressional account, which is still active, to share screenshots of the five tweets flagged for misinformation that lead to the banning of her personal account. She then wrote, \"My personal freedom of speech was violated on this platform along with an unknown number of Americans, and I want my personal account back.\"\n\nAs of Tuesday, Greene's personal account has not returned.\n\nWho's leaving Twitter?\n\nJameela Jamil\n\n\"The Good Place\" actress, writer and activist Jamil wrote her \"last tweet\" on Monday.\n\n\"Ah [Musk] got twitter. I would like this to be my what lies here as my last tweet,\" Jamil tweeted. \"I fear this free speech bid is going to help this hell platform reach its final form of totally lawless hate, bigotry, and misogyny. Best of luck.\"\n\nSee celebrity reactions:Jameela Jamil posts her 'last tweet,' Ice-T jokes Musk should shut Twitter down\n\nWho has criticized Musk's acquisition?\n\nIt was reported that activist Shaun King deleted his Twitter account Monday, after tweeting, \"At its root, @ElonMusk wanting to purchase Twitter is not about left vs right. It’s about white power.... He’s upset that Twitter won’t allow white nationalists to target/harass people. That’s his definition of free speech.\"\n\nKing has continued to tweet Tuesday, confirming that he didn't delete his account. King has since shared articles detailing racism and civil rights lawsuits at Tesla.\n\nIn addition to Siskind, others shared that they were considering leaving the app – including actor and wrestler Mick Foley.\n\n\"I’ll be giving some serious thought to leaving @Twitter for good in the near future,\" Foley wrote on Monday. \"I do not have a good feeling about where this platform is heading.\"\n\nWhat's everyone talking about? Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nStill, some celebrities noted why they plan to stay.\n\n\"I’m not going anywhere,\" tweeted \"Star Trek\" actor and activist George Takei. \"Should this place become more toxic, I pledge to strive even harder to lift up reason, science, compassion and the rule of law. The struggle against fascism, misinformation, and hate requires tough fighters. I hope you stay in the fight, right beside me.\"\n\nMany also pointed to the enormous price tag on Musk's acquisition deal – stressing that $44 billion could have impacted the world in a multitude of other ways.\n\n\"Just a thought–next time we have $44 billion laying around, can we please spend it to solve the pandemic, climate change, hunger, poverty, and malnutrition?\" wrote Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding, founder of World Health Network.\n\n\"$44 billion could help so many people, this greedy world disappoints me,\" actress, singer and transgender activist Plastic Martyr wrote.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}]}

In 2014, my brother and alleged co-conspirator, Rengan Rajaratnam, was acquitted by a federal jury in the same district, based on the same evidence related to the same charges.\n\nLast year, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, once featured on the cover of Time magazine for prosecutions against people like me on insider trading, convened an eponymous task force and concluded that “for too long, insider trading law has lacked clarity, generated confusion, and failed to keep up with the times.”\n\nBharara was joined on his task force by a sitting federal judge who shared the same epiphany about the infirmities of the law, and this was the same judge who imposed an unprecedented $93 million penalty on me.\n\nI'm not asking for one iota of sympathy, quite the contrary as I could not be happier with my current life and my loved ones, even with the challenges arising from my conviction. But I cannot look forward without reflecting on the stories I heard from countless inmates during my incarceration.\n\nOne common thread connected so many of these stories: the complete absence of any consequence for prosecutors who acted in bad faith, from minor indiscretions to major, life-altering corruption. I hope that I can play a small role by bearing witness to and advancing the discussions around criminal justice reform.\n\nExonerations needed too often\n\nThere is a growing buzz around this topic and for good reason. Muhammad Aziz and the late Khalil Islam – each of whom served prison time for decades – were recently exonerated in the killing of Malcolm X in the 1960s. Last March, three New York City men – George Bell, Rohan Bolt and Gary Johnson – were exonerated after spending more than two decades in prison for a double homicide conviction that came after key evidence was allegedly withheld by the prosecution. The district attorney even sought the death penalty for Bell, but, thankfully, failed at getting it.\n\nCOLUMN:3 officers face federal charges in Floyd death. Guilt hinges on proving 'willful' violation.\n\nTexan Michael Morton spent nearly 25 years in prison after being wrongly convicted of murdering his wife. The prosecution hid exculpatory evidence that would have proved his innocence. Ken Anderson, the prosecutor who cost Morton a quarter-century of his freedom, was sentenced to just 10 days for his corruption. Anderson’s sentence was remarkable – not for its brevity but because, as of the 2020 publication of an Innocence Project report, Anderson was the only prosecutor to ever be sentenced to any term of incarceration for prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nFurther, exonerations have been issued in nearly 3,000 wrongful conviction cases in America since 1989. And according to the National Registry of Exonerations, more than half of people who were eventually exonerated were put away because of, at least in part, official misconduct.\n\nSystem makes trials too tough\n\nAs of 2018, 98% of federal criminal defendants' cases did not go to trial, with 90% of defendants being pressured to accept plea bargains rather than take the risks and costs associated with defending themselves, according to data from the Pew Research Center.\n\nCOLUMN:Truck driver sentenced to 110 years shows hazards of prosecutors manipulating trial system\n\nThe government has crafted over time an expedient system of lopsided justice that almost always ends with some form of a “voluntary” confession, an acknowledgment of guilt in exchange for a reduced sentence, and a public “victory” for the prosecution. These convictions allow prosecutors to sweep under the rug the weaknesses in their cases and the failings in their prosecutions.\n\nWhen cases actually go to trial, prosecutors have been known to ratchet the stakes by training witnesses on exactly what to say on the stand. The cooperating witness offers the prosecution an opportunity for a kind of “redemption” that is difficult to take seriously. The successful testimony of the cooperating witness garners leniency in subsequent sentencing offered to that witness.\n\nIndeed, conflicts of interest are implicitly woven into a broken system. And all too often, potentially exculpatory evidence – to which only the government enjoys access – is hidden.\n\nPOLICING THE USA:A look at race, justice, media\n\nSo how do we fix it? In the case of the three exonerated New York men, several law professors have tried to expose the prosecutorial misdeeds that led to the original convictions, and they were threatened by the city. They are still fighting for accountability, and we should hope they succeed.\n\nFor my part, I am committed to supporting incredible organizations – such as The Marshall Project, Equal Justice Initiative and The Innocence Project – that selflessly speak truth to power.\n\nThis problem should concern everyone because it’s about all of us: our barbers, our mail delivery people, our neighbors, the thousands of exonerated Americans. We need to be steadfast with dogged persistence to create a justice system that delivers fairly argued decisions rather than questionable or even phony prosecutorial victories.\n\nRaj Rajaratnam is a Sri Lankan-American former hedge fund manager and founder of the Galleon Group, a New York-based hedge fund management firm that managed billions of dollars.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/15/assailing-columbus-vr-seniors-otter-attack-news-around-states/40319855/", "title": "Assailing Columbus, VR for seniors: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: The U.S. Army is defending a decision to close its historic, 57-year-old space and technical library at Redstone Arsenal. Army officials say it was a joint decision made by interested parties. Al.com reports that the Redstone Scientific Information Center closed its doors Sept. 30. The center was established in 1962 by a charter between the Army and NASA. It was overseen by a board of directors made up of senior leaders and scientists at Redstone’s various missile organizations. Dr. Wernher von Braun and Maj. Gen.

Alaska Public Media reports Kenny Brewer waded waist-deep into Taku Lake and suffered a bite on his hand while pulling the dog away from the river otters that converged on the pet. The 27-year-old Anchorage dietitian says he and his wife were walking the husky-mix, which was bitten by a group of otters that dragged the dog underwater temporarily. Brewer says a veterinarian cleaned the dog’s cuts, sliced away damaged tissue and stitched a drain tube into its leg. Wildlife biologists say they were not aware of previous attacks by river otters in Anchorage. One biologist says the animals likely perceived the dog as a threat.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Two retirement communities in the city are the launching pad for a program to see how virtual reality technology helps senior citizens with cognition, dementia, loneliness and other issues. The Arizona Daily Star reports Watermark Retirement Communities wants to eventually make the technology available at dozens of facilities nationwide. With a cordless headset system called Oculus Quest, elderly residents have been able to ride a roller coaster, visit the Egyptian pyramids and visit places they used to live. Watermark also wants to allow residents across its communities to be able to meet up virtually. Grayson Barnes, a 20-year-old Rochester Institute of Technology student, spent two years developing the Engage VR program for Watermark. He says most research suggests dementia patients are more like themselves after experiencing virtual reality.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A judge says he’s running for a seat on the state’s Supreme Court, setting up another potentially expensive and heated race in a state that has drawn heavy involvement from outside conservative groups. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Morgan “Chip” Welch on Monday announced he was running for the seat currently held by Justice Jo Hart in next year’s election. Hart, who has served on the court since 2013, has not said whether she’s seeking reelection next year. Arkansas’ nonpartisan Supreme Court races in recent years have drawn the focus of outside conservative groups that have spent millions on TV ads and attack mailers. A state justice won reelection last year after two conservative groups spent nearly $2.5 million trying to unseat her.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state will ban the sale and manufacture of new fur products starting in 2023. Legislation signed Saturday by Gov. Gavin Newsom makes California the first state to enact such a ban. It doesn’t apply to used fur products or fur used for religious or tribal purposes. And it excludes the sale of leather; cowhides; deer, sheep and goat skin; and anything preserved through taxidermy. There’s a fine of up to $1,000 for multiple violations. Democratic Assemblywoman Laura Friedman, the bill’s author, says there are “sustainable and humane” substitutes for fur. Opponents of the legislation have said it could create a black market and be a slippery slope to bans on other products.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: A report by the Colorado Fourteeners Initiative says the state’s 54 highest summits continue to see an increasing number of people seeking to climb the fourteeners, or those at least 14,000 feet high. The Gazette reports that an analysis by the nonprofit initiative estimates 353,000 people were attracted to the peaks during 2018’s hiking season, up 5.7% from the 2017 count. That’s almost 100,000 more than the first report from four years ago. Colorado Fourteeners executive director Lloyd Athearn says the heightened numbers come with his organization increasing its monitoring capabilities on the mountains. According to the report, Mounts Bierstadt, Elbert, Lincoln, Bross, Democrat and Sherman as well as Quandary, Grays, Torreys and Longs peaks all see more people. And for the first time, Quandary Peak was the busiest fourteener. Bierstadt previously held the rank.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A new state report shows the state’s utilities are “well aware of the increasing dangers” of cyberattacks and appear to have successfully thwarted recent threats they encountered. Four utilities participated in the third annual cybersecurity review of Connecticut’s electricity, natural gas and public water utilities. The list includes Eversource, Connecticut Water, Aquarion Water Co. and Avangrid. The report says the utilities conducted “extensive new work” over the past year to boost their cybersecurity resilience, including vetting the hiring of all employees and vendors. Phishing, spear phishing, threats to cloud information storage and insider threats are cited as some of the most worrisome threats facing the state’s utilities. The report highlights a need for better information sharing between the federal Department of Homeland Security and the state utilities concerning cyber compromises.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: ChristianaCare researchers say they have created a new computer program that will allow scientists to see the impact gene editing has on tumor cells, an idea they hope to patent. It wasn’t invented by a hospital doctor or a researcher, though they did help. The idea came from Rohan Kanchana, a junior at Newark Charter School who interned there last winter. The 16-year-old is too young to do technical lab work at ChristianaCare’s cancer center, but he could code. The new computer program revolves around a technology called CRISPR, the genetic version of spell-check on a Word document. If a person has an incorrect word – or, in this case, a gene – the technology will identify and correct it, says Eric Kmiec, director of the Gene Editing Institute at ChristianaCare’s Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Plans are in the works to add potentially thousands more dockless scooters to D.C. streets, WUSA-TV reports. As of now, 6,210 dockless scooters are permitted in the district. For 2020, the District Department of Transportation is considering a proposal that would boost the number to 10,000. The comment period to add more scooters goes until the end of October. After that, DDOT officials say they will evaluate the responses and determine the next steps. The proposal also includes the addition of dockless bikes, allowing for up to 10,000 in the district. The vehicles wouldn’t be designated to one area but spread out across all eight wards.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Gatorland has built new homes for some of its most distinctive-looking residents, thus creating an exhibit for a rare albino gator and two even-more-rare leucistic gators, the Orlando Sentinel reports. The White Gator Swamp will be the site of a baby gator boom, officials hope. Those very light-skinned residents are now being encouraged to make offspring. “It’s the largest breeding facility for white alligators anywhere in the world,” says Mark McHugh, Gatorland’s CEO. The white gators were introduced to their new digs Oct. 4. Leucistic gator Trezos hesitated to enter the waters, while his brother, Feros Zombi, dived off the side of a ramp after raw-chicken inspiration. Albino alligator Pearl did a reptilian sort of strut before making a splash. Albino gators have no pigment at all, while leucistics have some coloring in their skins. All three have separate waters and potential mates to explore.\n\nGeorgia\n\nBrunswick: Marine salvage experts seeking to remove an overturned cargo ship close to the state’s seacoast say they will haul it away in pieces because it cannot be safely righted and refloated intact. Their Unified Command said in a statement Saturday that the hull of the 656-foot Golden Ray would be dismantled, along with the ship’s other components and cargo, and taken away in what it described as a “complex situation.” The Golden Ray overturned Sept. 8 near the Port of Brunswick. Rescuers drilled into the hull’s steel plates and rescued four crewmen trapped in the bowels of the ship for more than a day in scorching heat and darkness. The Coast Guard has said it would take “weeks, if not months,” to remove the ship, which overturned while heading to sea.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: As Rep. Tulsi Gabbard travels throughout Iowa and New Hampshire trying to kickstart her Democratic presidential bid, she is facing a serious challenge back home in Hawaii for her U.S. House seat. State Sen. Kai Kahele, a fellow Democrat, is picking up endorsements and criticizing Gabbard for not paying enough attention to constituents in Hawaii while she campaigns for president thousands of miles away. The 45-year-old Native Hawaiian is a combat veteran and pilot for the Hawaii Air National Guard. He flies passenger jets for Hawaiian Airlines and is a member of the pilots union, a helpful attribute in union-friendly Hawaii. Gabbard hasn’t indicated whether she will run for reelection.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Authorities have released plans to stop devastating wildfires in southwestern Idaho, southeastern Oregon and northern Nevada with one option creating 1,500 miles of fuel breaks up to 400 feet wide along existing roads. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management on Friday released a draft environmental impact statement for the Tri-State Fuel Breaks Project and is taking public comments through the end of November. The BLM says creating fuel breaks by clearing vegetation will help firefighters stop wildfires and protect key habitat for sage grouse and other wildlife on land also used by ranchers and outdoor enthusiasts. The BLM says options include fewer miles of fuel breaks all the way down to no fuel breaks at all. The region in recent decades has seen repeated giant rangeland wildfires.\n\nIllinois\n\nMarengo: A French religious order has reached a preliminary agreement with a northern Illinois county that would allow nuns to build a winery, brewery, gift shop and coed boarding school there. The consent decree between McHenry County and Fraternite Notre Dame Inc. could end nearly four years of litigation and local opposition to the order expanding its operation in Marengo. The order sued the county in 2015, alleging that by blocking the expansion, the county was violating the U.S. Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act and the Illinois Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The Chicago Tribune reports that U.S. Magistrate Judge Iain Johnston is scheduled to decide this month whether to approve the agreement. McHenry County State Attorney Patrick Kenneally and county board Chairman Jack Franks declined to comment.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Butler University has raised more than half of the $250million it needs for a campaign to invest in science education, increase enrollment beyond resident undergraduates and boost community outreach. The private university has pooled $171 million from more than 27,000 donors during its largest fundraising campaign, which runs through May. The university plans to add a $100 million science facility. But university President James Danko says the campaign will also help fund efforts to encourage working professionals to enroll. Melissa Beckwith, vice president of strategy and innovation, says the university could partner with local companies to provide education for employees who aren’t enrolled as undergraduates. The university will also try to offer Indianapolis public school students dual degree credits.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Backers of a skateboard park under construction downtown say they have reached their $6.3 million funding goal. The Lauridsen Skatepark will be the nation’s largest when completed in spring 2020. The 88,000-square-foot skate park is being built on 5 acres of land between Second Avenue and the Des Moines River. Recent gifts by the Lauridsen Family Foundation and the state’s Enhance Iowa fund enabled organizers to reach their fundraising goal. Nix and Virginia Lauridsen have donated a total of $1.6 million to the project. Besides the skate areas, the park will include viewing platforms, handicap accessible walkways, shade structures and landscaping. Organizers expect about 40,000 skaters a year will use the park. They note skateboarding will be an Olympic sport in 2020.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: The Kansas City T-Bones are officially locked out of their stadium. The Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas, changed the locks and padlocked the gates to the stadium Monday because the team has failed to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid debts. The government issued an eviction notice in August after the T-Bones accumulated more than $760,000 in back rent and utility payments. The team was given a one-month reprieve in September after making a $50,000 payment. The Kansas City Star reports team owners have said they are working to sell the team, but no deal has been reached. The T-Bones played in an independent league and have no Major League Baseball affiliation.\n\nKentucky\n\nWinchester: Daniel Boone National Forest officials say multiple fires have burned hundreds of acres there, with almost all the fires caused by people. WTVQ-TV in Lexington reports three crews from Puerto Rico have volunteered to restore what they can in the forest. Officials want to clean up damage from fires before dry weather returns. The volunteers are working 16 hours a day performing such tasks as reseeding, preventing erosion, and knocking down trees that could fall and hurt someone. Volunteer Roberto Martinez told the station people from the U.S. went to Puerto Rico to help when Hurricane Maria struck there, and now it’s his chance to return the favor. Daniel Boone representatives say it could be a few more weeks before parts of the forest open to the public.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The National World War II Museum’s $25 million education and outreach building will open Thursday. After an opening ceremony, it will break ground for its final exhibit hall and hold an open house at the new building, called the Hall of Democracy. It features a research library, classrooms, an auditorium, the Institute for the Study of War and Democracy, and the WWII Media and Education Center. There’s also a special exhibit gallery. The opening exhibition is about the capture, extradition and trial of Adolf Eichmann, who played a major part in the Nazi mass executions of Jews. The new building is the museum’s sixth, including three exhibit pavilions, a theater and a restoration building. Its 239-room hotel and conference center is expected to open in late fall.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A scientist with an environmental group says she has found what she believes is the first recorded appearance of a potentially damaging species of crab in Maine waters. Marissa McMahan of the Massachusetts-based group Manomet says she located the smooth mud crab earlier this month on a research trip. The crabs, which are typically found south of Cape Cod, can pose problems for aquaculture businesses because they prey on young oysters. The single specimen is still alive, as McMahan collected it. Other outside species of crabs already pose a threat to Maine’s ecosystem. Acadia National Park officials said earlier this fall that a molted shell of an Asian shore crab was found along the shore. It was among the first confirmed reports of the species in the area.\n\nMaryland\n\nAdamstown: A rural fire chief says an “elusive” 3-foot-long alligator has finally been caught. WJLA-TV reports the gator was caught Saturday in a retention pond on a private property in Adamstown after animal control officers and others spent hours Thursday and Friday trying to capture it. The station reports officers ended up placing a live animal cage trap with bait on the muddy shoreline after initial efforts using a fishing line failed. Carroll Manor Volunteer Fire Chief Mike Smallwood says he found the “crafty and smart” reptile inside the metal cage about 6:30 a.m. Saturday. Maryland residents are not allowed to own exotic animals, including alligators. The station reports Frederick County Animal Control says the alligator was likely abandoned by its owner due to its size.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Two state lawmakers want to make it easier for communities to purchase dormant railroad tracks to convert into recreational trails. The MetroWest Daily News reports state Sen. Jamie Eldridge and state Rep. Carmine Gentile, both Democrats, jointly filed legislation that, if approved, would allow cities and towns to use Community Preservation Act money to purchase railroad lands to transform into trails for walking, running and bicycling. Community Preservation Act money can be used to preserve open space and historic sites, create affordable housing and develop outdoor recreational facilities. But the state Department of Revenue has ruled it cannot be used to buy federal rail banks and rights of way. Eldridge, of Acton, says rail trails improve public health by providing safe opportunities for exercise and boost economic development.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A church that served as a popular venue for national civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, is getting a grant for needed renovations. The National Park Service has awarded the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office $500,000 for King Solomon Baptist Church. Work includes rehabilitating the roof and preparing construction drawings. The church built in 1917 for a white congregation was bought in 1955 by an African American congregation. King spoke twice at King Solomon, and Malcolm X gave his “Message to the Grassroots” speech there in 1963. King Solomon’s pastor, the Rev. Charles Williams II, says the goal “is to continue the church’s tradition of empowerment, education and research.” The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: More than 100 mannequins in blaze orange sweatshirts were set up along Minnesota Highway 23 in the city Saturday. The display, organized by Pathways 4 Youth, represented the number of youth experiencing homelessness on any given night in Central Minnesota. “A lot of people in the community just don’t know,” says Tim Wensman, board chair and president of Pathways 4 Youth. The event kicked off the organization’s “Now That You Know” campaign, which aims to raise awareness on youth homelessness, as well as highlight how people can support the organization’s efforts. Pathways 4 Youth is a resource center for youth ages 16 to 24 who are experiencing homelessness. The center helps them finish their education, find secure employment and gain stable housing. It also connects youth with a place to shower, food and hygiene products, and a warm evening meal.\n\nMississippi\n\nMeridian: The city promises there will be sunshine Oct. 26, even if it’s a cloudy day. That’s the day Meridian will honor the late David Ruffin, one of the lead singers of the Motown group The Temptations. He sang the hit “My Girl,” which included that sunny lyric. The Meridian Star reports the city will add signs ceremonially naming four blocks of a downtown street “David Ruffin Boulevard.” Born in nearby rural Whynot, Ruffin claimed Meridian as home. Mississippi’s Arts + Entertainment Experience will also place Ruffin’s star on its walk of fame, while Jackson State University’s marching band, the “Sonic Boom of the South,” will lead a parade. LaMont Robinson, head of the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame and Ruffin’s son-in-law, presented the idea to the city.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The CEO of Dow Inc. has donated $6 million to a new University of Missouri health institute focused on personalized medicine. The university says the gift from Jim Fitterling is one of the first from an individual donor for the NextGen Precision Health Institute. The $220.8 million center is expected to open in October 2021. The state has contributed $10 million so far, with other funding coming from a combination of private and corporate support. Fitterling said in a statement that as a cancer survivor, he is “keenly interested in advancing research that helps patients and their families enjoy better outcomes and better qualities of life.” He began working at Dow just two weeks after graduating from the University of Missouri’s College of Engineering in 1983.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: State forest experts have proposed a timber harvest and prescribed-burns project to reduce the risk of wildfires in the Lolo National Forest. The Missoulian reports the proposed treatments were designed to contribute to the overall forest health and fuel-reduction objectives and make the forest more resilient to drought, wildfire, insects and disease. Forest experts say the project would cover about 36 square miles in Missoula and Mineral counties and include harvesting timber for mills, tree thinning and prescribed fires. Experts say some existing roads are expected to be decommissioned for work. Experts say they are seeking additional public input on the proposal at a meeting Wednesday. Submitted comments would be accepted by mail, electronically and hand-delivered for the next 30 days.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorfolk: People who want to help preserve monarch butterflies can obtain free milkweed seed pods through the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission. The pods, seeding instructions and monarch educational information will be available while supplies last at Game and Parks’ Northeast District Office in Norfolk. Milkweed is the host plant for the monarch. Monarchs lay eggs only on milkweed, and it’s the only plant monarch caterpillars will eat. Scientists say the monarch population has drastically declined over the past 20 years. Contact Jamie Bachmann at 402-370-3374 or Jamie.bachmann@nebraska.gov for more information.\n\nNevada\n\nTonopah: Nye County has decided to abandon a controversial proposal that would have further limited the hours when legal prostitutes were allowed to leave licensed brothels. The southern Nevada county had proposed an ordinance that would have barred brothel workers from leaving for more than six hours during a 10-day period. Brothel owners, local prosecutors and others supporting the proposal said they were concerned prostitutes would have unprotected sex when they left brothels. The Las Vegas Sun reports Nye County decided to drop the plan after receiving criticism from sex workers and advocates who said it violated their rights. Sex workers and advocates say they also want the county to repeal an existing rule requiring prostitutes to be retested for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV any time they leave for more than 24 hours at a time.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: Shakers have long been known for the simple design of their furniture and household objects, but a new exhibit at the Currier Museum of Art explores their cutting-edge skills in brand management. The Manchester museum is featuring a new exhibit called The Shakers and the Modern World, drawn from both its own collection and the holdings of Canterbury Shaker Village. Andrew Spahr, the museum’s director of collections, says the Shakers at one time caused anxiety with attempts to convert outsiders to their religion, but then they developed a branding strategy to counter negative public opinion and were quick to embrace printed media and photography to promote a more positive view. The exhibit will be accompanied by public and educational programs developed with Canterbury Shaker Village, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s black bear hunt is underway this week. The first three days of the hunt beginning Monday are for hunters armed with bows and arrows. Archers and muzzleloading rifle hunters can participate on Thursday and Friday. The hunt is restricted to five zones. Gov. Phil Murphy has again prohibited hunting on state lands. The bear hunt for firearms only is set to begin Dec. 9. Hunters killed 225 bears in 2018, the lowest amount since 2003.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Police data shows 42 Native Americans have been reported missing in the city so far this year, after 36 in 2018. Dawn Begay, the city’s Native American affairs coordinator, says the figures represent open missing persons cases in Albuquerque. Figures from U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey show the metro area is home to roughly 50,000 Native Americans. Of the 36 missing in 2018, 15 were women. Begay shared the numbers Friday at an event held to highlight the issue of missing and murdered indigenous women in New Mexico’s largest city. An Urban Indian Health Institute study last year listed Albuquerque among cities with the highest number of missing Native American women. Authors of the report had counted 37 missing and homicide cases total for Native American women and girls.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state Department of Environmental Conservation is selling patches to support maintenance work on outdoor recreation facilities. The latest design of the New York State Trail Supporter Patch resembles the round yellow disks marking connector trails on state lands. The previous design was red, like markers used by DEC on east-west directional trails. The patch is available for $5 at sporting license outlets or online at the state’s fishing and hunting license portal. The patch was introduced in 2007 to help raise funds to maintain trails across the state. Sales have raised more than $41,000 to date. Projects supported by patch sales include a boardwalk in Texas Hollow State Forest, foot bridges on the Northville Placid Trail, maintenance of Otter Creek Horse Trails and lean-tos in the High Peaks Wilderness.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper aims to create a state-funded program to help residents in four counties recover from Hurricane Dorian after the federal government declined a request for assistance targeting them. The Federal Emergency Management Agency last week told Cooper there wasn’t enough damage from last month’s storm to individuals and households in Carteret, Dare, Hyde and New Hanover counties to warrant a federal declaration. So Cooper wrote Friday to the U.S. Small Business Administration requesting another kind of declaration for low-interest loans in the four counties and those surrounding them. If it’s approved, Cooper’s office said he would create a grant program to supplement the loans for individuals and businesses.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The North Dakota auditor says the Commerce Department broke state law on bidding contracts for the state’s new “Be Legendary” logo. State Auditor Joshua Gallion released the audit Monday. The logo sparked criticism earlier this year when the contract for it was awarded to a Minnesota firm headed by a woman who once worked for Gov. Doug Burgum’s old Fargo software business. The company was awarded the $9,500 job without competition because it came in below the $10,000 threshold required for additional bids. Gallion says the audit of the agency found another contract related to the logo, bringing its total cost to more than $87,000. The Commerce Department says it did nothing wrong.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: A local air base is facing the increasingly common dilemma of an aging workforce. The Dayton Daily News reports about half of the 30,000 people working at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base are nearing the end of their careers. Air Force Gen. Arnold Bunch Jr. says filling those jobs and taking care of employees is “critical.” More than a third of employees at the Air Force Research Laboratory are eligible to retire. This could be challenging because nearly 70% of the lab’s workforce has at least a master’s degree. According to a U.S. census estimate from 2017, only 10% of Ohioans 25 and older hold an advanced college degree. The president of the Southwestern Ohio Council for Higher Education says the Air Force should focus on attracting and recruiting nontraditional candidates.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: A Republican state senator who unsuccessfully tried to criminalize abortion has announced plans to challenge GOP U.S. Rep. Markwayne Mullin next year. Sen. Joseph Silk, from Broken Bow, says he’ll try to unseat Mullin, who has served four terms representing eastern Oklahoma in the U.S. House. In a statement, Silk says he chose to enter the 2020 Republican primary for the 2nd Congressional District because he was frustrated with what he called the “very liberal” leadership in the Oklahoma Legislature. Republicans hold overwhelming majorities in both the Oklahoma House and Senate. Mullin’s chief of staff, Mike Stopp, says Mullin intends to run for another term, but he declined to comment on Silk’s candidacy.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The frustrated owner of North Portland’s never-used Wapato Jail has announced he will bulldoze the facility unless someone comes up with funding to convert the facility into a homeless shelter in the next two weeks. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports Jordan Schnitzer, president of Harsch Investment Properties, said Thursday that he planned to sign a demolition contract by the month’s end. Assuming no last-minute stakeholder steps in, Schnitzer said his company will break ground on a new warehouse there by spring. Schnitzer said he was “sickened” that a year-and-a half-long quest to convert the 150,000-square-foot jail into a shelter would end with the facility reduced to rubble. But city leaders, along with local nonprofits, had been reticent to place people lacking shelter in adapted jail cells 11 miles away from Portland’s downtown core.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDoylestown: Some of Bucks County’s covered bridges will be getting a makeover due to a $2.5 million refurbishment project, to include all seven county-owned spans. At one point there were more than 50 covered bridges in Bucks County, but now only a dozen remain. Those still standing were built between 1832 and 1874, when horse-drawn buggies were the main means of transportation. Ten bridges still carry cars and trucks as well as the occasional walker and cyclist. The other two are in parks. While mostly made of wood, many of the spans are held up by steel structures that need to be stripped and repainted. County operations director Kevin Spencer says other work includes fireproofing interior and exterior wood surfaces, replacing cedar facing and siding boards, and other maintenance.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A statue of Christopher Columbus was vandalized Monday, on the U.S. holiday named for him. The statue in Providence was splashed from head to toe with red paint, and a sign reading “Stop celebrating genocide” was leaned against the pedestal. The word “genocide” was written in orange paint on the rear of the pedestal. The statue has been the target of vandals on Columbus Day in the past. The New World explorer has become a polarizing figure. Native American advocates have pressed states to change Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day over concerns that Columbus spurred centuries of genocide against indigenous populations in the Americas. Police are investigating, and a spokeswoman for Mayor Jorge Elorza said the statue would be cleaned.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state is adding a new area code. The latest set of digits will augment the Palmetto State’s oldest area code – 803. In the region stretching from Aiken to Rock Hill with Columbia at its center, new numbers beginning with 839 will be available in the Midlands starting May 26, 2020. The Post and Courier reports historically, the 803 area code was the only one in the state after World War II ended. In 1995, 864 came to the Upstate. The coastal 843 area code was created in the late 1990s. Ahead of the new number’s availability, millions of landline callers are asked to practice dialing the area code before every local number. Calls dialed without area codes will stop going through April 25, 2020.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Krystal Trull’s daughter went months without autism treatments after the family lost insurance coverage. Trull lost access to the therapy that first gave 4-year-old Nikole the gift of speech. She worried if Nikole would be able to recover. Months after petitioning state leaders to require insurers to cover an intensive form of autism treatments called Applied Behavior Analysis, Trull commended a decision announced Friday that Sioux Falls-based insurers would again cover the therapy for some families. Sanford Health and Avera Health will begin offering coverage in 2020 after a loophole in state law caused South Dakota families such as the Trulls to lose insurance coverage this year. Gov. Kristi Noem, Sanford and Avera announced the coverage in a joint statement Friday.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A woman whose father was executed for murder 13 years ago asked a judge Monday to order the testing of DNA evidence in the case. The hearing in Memphis focused largely on whether April Alley can legally bring a petition for DNA testing on behalf of her father’s estate. Sedley Alley was convicted of the 1985 murder of 19-year-old Marine Lance Cpl. Suzanne Collins in Millington. She had been out jogging when she was kidnapped, beaten, raped and mutilated. Alley confessed to the crime but later said the confession was coerced. He was executed by lethal injection in 2006. April Alley’s attorneys include Innocence Project co-founder Barry Scheck, who told the court they filed the petition for DNA testing after law enforcement officers in St. Louis contacted him about a possible alternative suspect in Collins’ murder.\n\nTexas\n\nWaco: The Mayborn Museum moves the outside inside to teach kids some basic lessons on the natural world in its new Backyard Ecology Hall. The Waco Tribune-Herald reports the hall, a $1.2 million revamping of the museum’s first-floor children’s space, consists of four large exhibit rooms and a spacious common area for live demonstrations – and families needing a place to sit and rest. The rooms blend interactive activities, live reptiles, insects and specimens from some of the Mayborn’s collections to shape lessons with connections to local ecosystems. The exhibits, created specifically for the Mayborn, aim at students from fourth- to eighth-grade levels but contain material for younger children, older students and adults, assistant exhibits director Rebecca Nall says.\n\nUtah\n\nClearfield: Two firefighters are receiving praise after they found a creative way to keep a young girl calm at the scene of a car accident. North Davis Fire District Fire Chief Mark Becraft said the firefighters let a young girl paint their nails after she and her mother were in a car accident Saturday in the northern Utah city of Clearfield. Chief Allen Hadley and Captain Kevin Lloyd checked on the crying, screaming girl while medics evaluated her mother. Nobody was seriously injured. They asked her about the nail polish she was holding and offered to have their nails painted. Both men have young daughters. Becraft said the girl was instantly soothed. Hadley and Lloyd left the scene with purple manicures.\n\nVermont\n\nWallingford: A group of outdoor lovers is working to raise the profile of the White Rocks National Recreation Area in the Green Mountain National Forest, and they’re looking for some help. The Rutland Herald reports Nate Rand, of Wallingford, says he and a friend have talked about forming the White Rocks Outdoor Collaborative, and they’ve been using a social media group to gather potential members and coordinate their efforts. Rand says about 100 people have joined a Facebook page, but the idea is still in the formative phase. Rand says many people are familiar with the White Rocks hiking trails, but comparatively few are aware that the White Rocks National Recreation Area offers opportunities to hike, snowshoe and cross-country ski.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A federal appeals court has put a hold on two permits needed for construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday issued a stay of permits from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service while it reviews a lawsuit filed by environmental groups in August. The Sierra Club said in a statement that the suspension effectively means construction must stop on the 300-mile natural gas project. The lawsuit alleges that the Fish and Wildlife Service’s approval of the project failed to adequately protect endangered species along the pipeline’s path. Also on Friday, the company building the pipeline agreed to pay more than $2 million and submit to enhanced monitoring to settle a lawsuit brought by Virginia officials.\n\nWashington\n\nSpanaway: A food bank that serves roughly 1,100 people in Pierce County has been damaged in a fire. Spanaway Food Bank director Harold Smith says families in need of food showed up throughout the day Friday and were directed to other food banks for help. Smith says the food bank’s freezers and refrigerators were lost, and the food might not be salvageable. The fire was reported about 6 a.m., and Central Pierce Fire & Rescue spokesman Darrin Shaw says the structure was heavily involved when crews arrived. The cause of the fire wasn’t immediately known. Smith says the facility, which has operated for four decades, hands out about 15,000 pounds of food every month.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state Department of Education data says more than half of the state’s teachers missed more than 10 days of school last year. WSAZ-TV reports 52.75% of teachers missed more than 10 days, according to its research of data from the education department. The prior year’s number was 52.46%. The year before that it was 51.44%, and in 2016 it was 50.83%. State Superintendent Steve Paine says teachers have a hard, stressful job, but some are missing too much school. The percentage of teachers who missed more than 20 days was nearly 11%. The omnibus education bill that passed a few months ago included a $500 attendance bonus for teachers who miss fewer than four days. Paine said the state needs to determine if that has an effect.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The city’s natural history museum is hoping its new live spiders exhibit can educate visitors instead of scaring them away. The Milwaukee Public Museum is hosting the Spiders Alive! exhibit through January. It features 17 species of live arachnids from around that world, including tarantulas, black widows, brown recluses and wolf spiders. It also includes some relatives of spiders, including scorpions. The exhibit’s on-site curator, Jon Bertolas, says he guarantees that visitors will leave with a greater appreciation of spiders. Visitor Sandra Romanshek says she decided to check out the exhibit because spiders are important for the environment, even though she thinks they are creepy crawlers.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: State lawmakers have advanced legislation that would help expand a network of highway crossings for wildlife. The Casper Star-Tribune reports a legislative committee unanimously approved three bills Friday creating a special wildlife conservation account to help fund additional crossings, signage and game fences in sensitive wildlife habitats. Lawmakers say the committee is expected to sponsor the bills in the 2020 session. Officials say the fund could increase federal dollars appropriated under an infrastructure bill containing $250 million for wildlife crossings at key migration chokepoints. Lawmakers say migration corridors were a means of preserving wildlife and striking a balance between energy development and conservation interests.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/20/corrections-clarifications-archive/30417315/", "title": "Corrections & Clarifications: Archive", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nTo report corrections and clarifications, contact Standards Editor Brent Jones:\n\nPlease indicate whether you're responding to content online or in the newspaper.\n\nThe following USA TODAY corrections and clarifications were published between October 2012 and December 2014 :\n\nDecember 2014\n\nNews: A Dec. 19 article on Fidel Castro misstated the year of the Cuban missile crisis.

His son wrestles with the carnage\n\nIt was about 3:45 a.m. July 23, 1967. William Scott, known as Bill, was among a crowd of mostly young African Americans gathering to watch the police hustle club patrons into waiting paddy wagons. He had a particular interest in two of the people being led away.\n\nHis father, William Walter Scott II, was the principal owner of the club, an illegal after-hours drinking and gambling joint. His older sister, Wilma, was a cook and waitress. The night was hot and sticky, and the crowd’s initial teasing of the arrestees devolved into raucous goading of police as they became more aggressive, pushing and twisting the arms of the women.\n\n“You don’t have to treat them that way,” Bill Scott yelled. “They can walk. Let them walk, you white sons of bitches.”\n\nBy the time the wagons were full, the crowd had swelled, the taunts had grown more hostile and, though police manpower was thin early Sunday, several scout cars responded to the scene. Cops stood at the ready in the middle of 12th Street, billy clubs in hand, forcing the throng back on the sidewalk.\n\nScott, tall and lean, mounted a car and began to preach to a crowd long accustomed to the harsh tactics of the overwhelmingly white Detroit police in black neighborhoods: “Are we going to let these peckerwood motherf—— come down here any time they want and mess us around?”\n\n“Hell, no!” people yelled back.\n\nScott walked into an alley and grabbed a bottle, seeking “the pleasure of hitting one in the head, maybe killing him,” he remembers thinking. Making his way into the middle of the crowd for cover, he threw the bottle at a sergeant standing in front of the door.\n\nThe missile missed, shattering on the sidewalk. A phalanx of police moved toward the crowd, then backed off. As the paddy wagons drove away, bottles, bricks and sticks flew through the air, smashing the windows of departing police cars. Bill Scott said he felt liberated.\n\n“For the first time in our lives we felt free. Most important, we were right in what we did to the law.”\n\nThe rebellion was underway.\n\nA personal history\n\nBill Scott’s thrown bottle was a catalyst for one the most destructive civil disorders in U.S. history — five days of looting, arson and violence in Detroit that killed 43 people and resulted in thousands of injuries and arrests in a summer jolted by violence across dozens of U.S. cities.\n\nBut Scott, a bright but troubled product of the 12th Street neighborhood, left a multi-layered legacy more enduring than broken glass. It’s a legacy that still resonates today, as the 50th anniversary of 1967 draws near and Detroit reevaluates whether the despair and tensions of that summer continue.\n\nThree years after the looting and burning, Scott, by then 22 and a student at the University of Michigan, self-published a memoir titled “Hurt, Baby, Hurt” that describes his experiences growing up as a young black man in majority-white Detroit, working in his father’s blind pig and living along 12th Street, the west-side thoroughfare that was Detroit’s crowded and rowdy sin strip.\n\n►Related: The 1967 riot movie wraps short stint of Detroit filming\n\n►Related: The 1967 riot or a rebellion? No question what to call it\n\nHe writes of growing anger at what he felt was the city’s racial oppression, where Detroit’s notoriously aggressive police were not shy about knocking heads on corners where black men lingered. Bill Scott’s account of his role in the violence comes from the memoir.\n\nIn 1969, an early version of his book won a prestigious Hopwood Award, the U-M literary prize whose student winners over the years included future heavyweights Arthur Miller, Lawrence Kasdan and Marge Piercy.\n\nLargely forgotten, Scott’s memoir reads today like a newly discovered time capsule, but one with contemporary significance amid the divide between police and African-American communities across the nation. Perhaps no other account delves in such a deeply personal way into the rage and despair that drove so many black Detroiters into the streets that summer.\n\nScott, who spent a childhood steeped in self loathing, embarrassed by the radical black politics of his father and secretly imagining he was white, describes his political transformation through the racial animus he said he witnessed routinely in Detroit.\n\nBut the story of Bill Scott did not begin with a thrown bottle on that July night nearly 50 years ago. Nor would it end with his subsequent downward spiral, marked by drug addiction, mental illness and homelessness.\n\nFor Bill Scott would have a son, Mandela. And that son would have his own dramatic journey — from a privileged upbringing that led him to the Ivy League, to his own racial awakening, when he realized that no matter how carefully his life was constructed, his skin color would always set him apart from the white world he had so confidently navigated.\n\nThe saga of Bill Scott must be told without Scott himself. Now 68, he has disappeared somewhere in coastal Florida. The political fire and promise of his youth would be derailed by substance abuse and mental illness, those close to him say.\n\n“I’d never met anyone remotely like him. It was terrifying and exhilarating,” said Auburn Sheaffer Sandstrom, who first encountered Scott in a U-M graduate class and married him four years later.\n\nPercy Bates, a professor of education at U-M, knew Scott briefly when Scott was a child and became closer to him in Ann Arbor, when Scott showed glimmers of his potential.\n\n“Anybody who knew him knew that he was very bright, but he was just unable to use that brightness to any positive end,” Bates said. “I think later he probably would not have been able to produce the book or anything like that that required persistent attention.”\n\nThe father\n\nThe origins of the Scott family’s story is a familiar one in Detroit.\n\nWilliam Walter Scott II, the owner of the blind pig and Bill Scott’s father, was born in Georgia and came to Detroit as child, just as the “Great Migration” of African Americans from the South to a fresh start in northern cities began before World War I. The influx would boost Detroit’s black population seven-fold within a decade as the auto industry transformed the city into an industrial metropolis starving for workers.\n\nWhen Bill Scott, his sister Wilma and their siblings – Tyrone, Reginald and Charlotte — were young, their father made a good living at Dodge Main and other factories. But between 1947 and 1963 the city’s manufacturing economy hemorrhaged 134,000 jobs, triggering the start of Detroit’s long decline. William Scott lost his factory job, and subsequently the family lost its house.\n\n►Related: Witnesses to history tell stories of Detroit riot\n\n►Review:'Detroit '67' is must-see local theater\n\nUnable to find work, William Scott II turned to “the numbers,” the illegal, lottery-like gambling game ubiquitous in black neighborhoods, even as his political activism grew.\n\nHe eventually became involved in organizing black political power by training volunteers for local campaigns. His second-floor suite of rooms on 12th Street was officially known as the United Community League for Civic Action. On the night of the 1967 raid, one room contained a wall chart of local precinct delegates. William Scott’s wife, Hazel, worked in the Detroit office of G. Mennen (Soapy) Williams, Michigan’s Democratic governor from 1949 to 1961, who was popular in the black community.\n\n\n\nBut the elder Scott’s disgust with Detroit’s white political system grew. Years later, he would tell a sociologist studying the riot that political leaders pass legislation “just to control and contain the Negro.”\n\nMr. Scott did not hide his militancy, or his anger. He fumed at being called “boy” by police and roughly frisked for no apparent reason. In 1973, when Coleman Young was elected Detroit’s first black mayor on a police-reform platform, he told his daughter Wilma, “I can finally get off my knees.”\n\n“All the people have had their revolutions, and we’re the last. It’s something that’s got to come, you can’t stop it. When people get sick and oppressed, they’re gonna riot,” William Scott told the sociologist.\n\n“My father was a survivor,” said Wilma Scott, now 70, who spent more than 40 years as an office worker at Detroit’s Henry Ford Hospital. “And he was a survivor without being a criminal. Except for the numbers, which he did not feel was a crime, okay?\n\n“To this day, I understand his logic. He was a black man that was determined just to be free. It’s as simple as that. To say he had to depend on a white man for his living – he did not like that. Especially after being in the factory and being laid off.”\n\nThe son\n\nBill Scott was born two years after Wilma, in 1948. In his memoir, he describes a bleak childhood of constant moves, being bullied at school and spending lonely days wandering through alleys, looking for useable junk.\n\nHe was close to his mother, but she was often hospitalized with heart problems and died when Bill was 14. He said he feared his father, writing that he beat him, though Wilma Scott says she did not witness such violence.\\\n\nBill Scott did not see his own early promise. He had trouble learning in school, and thought himself “ugly,” “dull,” “strange,” “useless,” even “mentally retarded.” By age 10, he was unruly and suffering emotional problems. He was sent to the Hawthorn Center, a state-run facility for emotionally-troubled children in Northville, and later to a similar institution, the Boys Republic in Farmington Hills. In his own mind, he wrote, he pretended to be white because, he felt, being black was bad, but white children were considered good.\n\nIt was in the early 1960s that Bates, the U-M professor, first met Bill Scott at a camp in Pinckney. The boy, he said, “didn’t trust anybody, he couldn’t get close to anybody. He was constantly acting out, calling people names, throwing stuff, hitting people. It was just clear that he had some serious issues.”\n\nBut Bill Scott received counseling at the two youth homes and met adults who mentored him. He writes glowingly of both places, and they seemed to help him stabilize.\n\nAs he moved into middle school, the unruly boy began to blossom. Scott writes of becoming intellectually curious and aware of the importance of good values: respecting women and elders; obeying the law; refraining from stealing or premarital sex. He began attending church. “I liked the sound of this heaven place,” he wrote.\n\nAfter a brief, tumultuous stay in a foster home, Scott returned to his father’s temporary home, a three-room apartment near 12th Street.It was in this rapidly changing neighborhood that Bill Scott said he bumped into the reality of being a black man in Detroit. After years in white-run institutions and attending church, his values were “almost in exact opposition to the way my people lived” back on 12th Street.\n\nBecause of his polite bearing, he was mocked by neighborhood toughs, who called him “Proper” and “Whitey.” He said he stood out because he was a “decent” person. “I didn’t have processed hair, a rag hanging from my head or dirty clothes,” he writes, “and, most of all, I had the ‘proper thoughts.’”\n\nAt Northern High, Scott noted that virtually all the students were black and most of the faculty was white, a recipe for failure, he believed.\n\nHe called Northern “a nigger factory” that churned out unschooled students who wanted to learn but were at the mercy of teachers who either didn’t want to teach black students, or didn’t know how.\n\nTest scores showed 9th graders at Northern reading at a sixth-grade level. But Scott was smart and ambitious and determined to attend college, even as his white counselor tried to steer him to vocational courses. At one point, he tried to transfer to a more competitive majority-white city school, but was refused. So he made the best of it, playing drums in the band, lettering in football, learning to pole vault and, in 1966, graduating.\n\nThree months later, some 2,300 Northern students attracted national attention by staging a walkout and boycott to protest their poor-quality education in a school that lacked the top-notch facilities and wider opportunities enjoyed by students at mostly white city schools, such as Redford High. The protests, a sign of growing militancy among young African Americans, were an unprecedented challenge to authority, and the principal and at least two other officials lost their jobs.\n\nAs he moved through his teens, Scott began to face another fact of life for many young black men in the 1960s: the Detroit police.\n\nScott wrote that he tried to live like a “civilized Negro,” staying active in a middle-class black church. But as he left a church meeting one day when he was 17, cops stopped him for jaywalking across 12th Street. When Scott asked what he had done, he said one of the officers threw him against the scout car and called him “boy.” They gave him a $10 ticket. Scott wrote that he ripped it up in front of them and threw in a trash can next to their car.\n\nNext was a run-in with the department’s notorious Big Four — three plainclothes cops with a uniformed driver in a big car — a unit that cruised precincts and routinely harassed blacks. Walking out of a store, Scott and brothers Tyrone and Reggie were stopped and frisked for no reason, Scott writes. The confrontation ended with Scott shouting, “You can kiss my black ass.” He said police backed off when an angry crowd began to form.\n\nScott’s racial consciousness continued to grow during a months-long job search in the spring and early summer of 1967 when, despite an uptick in the city’s economy, 25 to 30 percent of black youths between 18 and 24 remained unemployed. Failing to find work, he was forced to drop out of Michigan Lutheran College, a Detroit school he attended before U-M.\n\nThe frustrations piled up, along with a growing perception that his fellow church members attended services to “wallow in their own self-hatred” and ask God’s forgiveness “for being black.” He felt like he was pulling himself up by his bootstraps – as society demanded – but getting nowhere.\n\nIt was these accumulated grievances, hardly unique to Bill Scott or to blacks in Detroit, that reached a boiling point in the summer of 1967, when dozens of U.S. cities exploded in violence. At age 19, the Bill Scott who threw the first bottle at police was a young man determined to break with his past. “I decided to reject anything that was white,” he writes.\n\nIt also softened how he viewed his father.\n\n“I began to look at the cat and see that he was farther ahead than anyone I’d met in my entire life and he was the only person I wouldn’t listen to,” Scott writes. “I guess he was the most courageous and bold man I ever saw in my life.\n\n“I could now understand why my father had given up in the white conventional world. I was black and being black meant I had to live black…no more hating myself because I was black.”\n\nHe went to work at his father’s club.\n\n12th Street transformed from bustling to burned out\n\nThere is not a street in Detroit today that resembles the 12th Street of 1967 in the stretch near the blind pig where the riot started that year..\n\nFifty years ago, the mile-and-a-half section of 12th Street north of West Grand Boulevard was a densely packed commercial strip of markets, pharmacies, party stores, bakeries, shoe stores, beauty parlors and photo studios. With two and three-story buildings along both sides, and a constant flow of people and traffic, 12th looked like a typical Detroit shopping district when the city had 1.5 million or more residents.\n\nMany blacks living on the side streets off 12th (now known as Rosa Parks Boulevard) were upwardly mobile and already middle class. But the stretch of 12th north of Virginia Park on Detroit's west side had developed into a frenetic strip of legal and illegal adult entertainment: bars, prostitutes, pimps, pawn shops, gambling, drugs, after-hours drinking, crime and cops.\n\nThe neighborhood personified the city’s rapidly changing geography after World War II. Up through the 1940s, the area had been largely Jewish, but as Jews began moving northwest, and African Americans took their place on side streets dense with apartment buildings and solid multi-family homes.\n\nUrban renewal projects destroyed the downtown black ghetto in the 1950s and new laws cut into housing segregation, prompting even more African Americans to flood into the 12th Street neighborhood, though store owners remained mostly white.\n\n“Twelfth Street was like a jungle or an unsolvable maze,” William Water Scott III would later later write in his memoir, titled “Hurt, Baby, Hurt,” three years after the 1967 Detroit riot.\n\nIt was a “Hollywood strip” filled with “shady-looking characters” hanging out on corners.\n\n“It was hard to predict what was going to happen next – I mean one night somebody might get shot or cut up and next night everybody on the street could be happy and cool; plain drunk.”\n\nFor much of the summer of 1967, Scott, whose nickname was Bill, earned $25 a night as doorman at his dad’s club, letting people in and trying to keep police out. The club was dark and smoky, with a bar, pool table, gambling room, kitchen and a dance floor with loud music from a juke box. ”Everyone was dancing, laughing, having a nitty-gritty-funky good time,” Scott recalled.\n\nBlind pigs like the one Bill's father, William Scott, operated were long an institution in Detroit’s black neighborhoods. They served blacks when African Americans were barred from downtown restaurants and bars before World War II. After the color line was broken in mainstream establishments, blind pigs continued to play a major cultural role in black Detroit, historian Sidney Fine wrote, and raids by white cops were often seen as having “racial and symbolic significance.”\n\nPolice raided William Scott’s club twice in 1966 and again in June 1967, when the vice squad arrested 28 people on misdemeanors. The DPD tried to stage other busts but couldn’t get an undercover cop past the door. Once, they burst in only to find a children’s Halloween party in progress.\n\nAs summer unfolded in 1967, police confrontations with black residents added to racial tension in Detroit. Rumors of impending unrest raged across the city amid scattered disorders in African-American neighborhoods across the country, including a small, two-day disturbance on Kercheval Avenue on Detroit’s east side in 1966. By late July 1967, violence had torn through 33 American cities, most notably Newark, where six days of violence left 26 people dead.\n\nDetroit was still on edge from the fatal shooting in June of a black Vietnam veteran. The man had dared to take his pregnant wife to Rouge Park, then surrounded by an all-white neighborhood. Whites taunted the couple with racial slurs, pelted them with bottles and suggested they might rape the woman. Someone shot the veteran; his wife was not assaulted but would suffer a miscarriage, according to the Michigan Chronicle.\n\nThen, on July 1, a black prostitute was fatally shot at 12th and Hazelwood. Police variously said the assailant was a pimp or a prospective customer, but rumors circulated in the black community that an off-duty white officer had killed her after she allegedly slashed him with a knife.\n\nBill Scott said he was at the blind pig during the police raid in June and an officer hit him in the head. He wrote that he chose to “Uncle Tom my way out” that night and play nice with police, but he fumed. The next time, he vowed, he would fight back, “hopefully to kill him if need be.”\n\nOn the early morning of July 23, 1967, Scott wasn’t working the door; his job search had finally borne fruit, and he had found a good position in an auto factory. But he writes that he drove up to the club in time “to see this honky cop swing a sledgehammer into the plate glass door.”\n\nAfter Scott whipped up the crowd, threw the bottle and watched the last paddy wagon drive away, he said he entered the club to find the interior in shambles. The jukebox and wine bottles were broken; even the typewriter he used for his writing had been smashed.\n\nHe said he returned to the street and threw a litter basket through the window of a drug store, triggering an alarm and jacking up the adrenalized atmosphere on 12th Street. “I had to destroy something,” he writes.\n\nPeople slowly entered the drugstore. “I wasn’t even thinking about looting at the time it all started,” Scott writes. “My interest was to strike out at something that was more powerful and more legitimate than me; at the time this was the white store owners.”\n\nHe joined others in breaking windows, and mounted a box to play traffic cop, directing drivers along the increasingly unruly street. There were no real police in sight. At one point, a “young diddy-bopper” stopped him on the street and said, “I am so glad you started this thing.”\n\nScott says he was staggered by the comment, as his actions began to sink in. He felt sick to his stomach, but soon recovered, believing that whatever the motivation of the looters, they shared a lack of respect for the law, “the law that had abused them and their right to live,” he writes.\n\n“Yes, I started a riot, although it was going to happen some other time. Nevertheless, I had made it possible for cats to get those material things they desired when there was a larger human fight on hand.”\n\nThe outline for the beginning of the riot that Scott describes in his book is generally supported by official city reports and studies by historians and other experts. But while Scott is the only person to claim he started the disorder, no official or researcher ever confirmed he was the instigator.\n\nIn “Violence in the Model City,” Fine, the U-M professor, took note of Bill Scott’s account and also wrote that police identified another young man, dubbed “Greensleeves” for his green shirt and pants, who screamed at police and urged bystanders to fight back. Fine wrote that Greensleeves, Scott “and, no doubt, others, helped to communicate” their outrage to the crowd, “which probably saw the blind pig raid in the context of long-standing grievances.”\n\nBy 9 o’clock that Sunday morning, police reappeared on 12th Street. And Bill Scott went home to sleep.\n\nArrest, and regrets\n\nScott awoke Sunday afternoon to find smoke in the house, which was on a nearby residential section of 12th Street. A neighboring home was on fire, and his father figured the flames would spread before the fire department could arrive. Firefighters showed up, though, and extinguished the blaze, but it rekindled, destroying their house and most of their block.\n\n12th Street was a chaotic scene, with sirens, fires and stunned people running back and forth, fearing for their lives. Scott went to stay with a friend.\n\nThe next morning, with widespread confusion across the city, Scott looked for a newspaper. He walked more than a mile, to the usually busy corner of Grand River and West Grand Boulevard, but the streets were deserted, with buildings burned and looted. He watched as two young men climbed through the broken window of a drugstore when suddenly a line of squad cars drove up. Scott told the police he was only watching, but they cuffed him and took him downtown.\n\nCharged with illegally entering the store, Scott spent the next 15 days in a gulag of crowded, sweltering, stinking lockups, from the oily confines of precinct garages to stifling buses with shut windows in the July sun to the Belle Isle bath house, as Detroit Police sought innovative ways to store thousands of arrestees. He was finally released after charges were dropped.\n\nTaking the bus back to 12th Street, Scott got off at Seward and walked past the hollowed-out neighborhood of loose bricks, broken glass and boarded-up buildings.\n\nDays of looting, arson and sniping had left 43 people dead; 1,189 injured; more than 7,000 arrested; 2,509 businesses and homes looted or burned; and metro Detroiters rattled to their cores.\n\n“The further I walked down Twelfth, the more I became aware of the destruction around me, which made me feel less of a man for being part of it,” he writes.\n\n“A man doesn’t destroy his home; he protects it at all cost. This I hadn’t done; I let another man come and force me to destroy my own. This put me at his mercy. I became a boy once more. He could control me completely.”\n\nBill Scott spoke to his father, who was laying low, fearing retaliation from police for what had happened outside his club. Bill returned to the factory where he had found work, but was fired for missing two weeks with no explanation. His car had been towed, and he couldn’t afford to get it back. He was filled with hatred, he wrote. The thought of killing police constantly crossed his mind.\n\nA month later, Bill Scott paid the $1.80 Greyhound bus fare and moved to Ann Arbor, “never to return,” he wrote, “until?”\n\nThat is how his book ends. But not his journey.\n\nA new life in Ann Arbor\n\nBill Scott never did move back to Detroit. For the Ann Arbor of that era was a cauldron of activism, music, drugs and experimental ways of living and thinking, with John Sinclair and the White Panthers, SDS, feminist scholars, the Black Action Movement, Iggy and the Stooges and $5 tickets for small amounts of marijuana. A CIA recruiting office on Main Street was bombed in 1968.\n\nScott was admitted to the University of Michigan and earned a degree in education in 1970 and a master’s degree in journalism in 1972. He won a second Hopwood Award in 1972 for a short story titled “The Black Astronaut on the Moon.”\n\nHe worked as a drug counselor, dressed well and had a steady stream of girlfriends. He also traveled, spending time in the Pacific Northwest. At at one point he suffered a debilitating back injury in an automobile accident, for which he began taking pain medication, and various street drugs.\n\nHe returned to U-M in 1987 to the school of education to work on his second master’s degree. That’s when he met Auburn Sheaffer.\n\nThe daughter of a dentist, Sheaffer was a white girl raised in comfort in nearly all-white Findlay, Ohio, 100 miles south of Detroit, who as a youngster became fascinated with the black experience. She studied the Underground Railroad in grade school, wrote a paper on racism in eighth grade and discovered novelist Toni Morrison as a teenager. The immersion in black culture had a powerful effect on her.\n\nShe first encountered Scott in an advanced English class titled “Class, Gender and Race in U.S. Literature.” Sheaffer first noticed Scott sitting by the window as the class discussed slave-era writing. He was tall, and wore a fedora, dark glasses, clogs and a tweed jacket. Sheaffer recalls a lot of debate coming from the feminists in the class when suddenly the black guy in the big hat spoke up.\n\n“When I hear upper-class white women talking about black men with venom in their voices I worry about my penis getting cut off,” he said.\n\nThe other students were horrified.\n\n“Stricken!” she recalled. “Just stricken! I mean, silence! Horror! It landed like a lead balloon.”\n\nDespite the outburst, there was chemistry between Sheaffer and Scott, despite the difference in their backgrounds and ages. He was 39; she was 24. He was raised on Detroit’s streets. She took opera lessons growing up, spent a college year in Paris and belonged to a sorority. “I was pedigreed,” she recalled.\n\n“Man, he was beautiful,” she says. “Forty years old and a radical revolutionary, fine-ass poet from Detroit. It was primordial with me. I wanted to make him my man.”\n\nThey drank at Ashley’s bar, discussed radicals and poets and attended anti-racism meetings. Scott shared his encyclopedic knowledge of history and politics. When Sheaffer won her own literary award, Scott sent her flowers and the soundtrack to “A Man and a Woman,” a romantic French film from 1966.\n\nBut Sheaffer, young and in love, failed to pick up on some danger signs. While it is unclear if he has ever received a diagnosis, his sister Wilma says she believes Bill Scott suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, which worsened as he grew older.\n\nAlan Wald, now retired, was the professor in the class where Sheaffer and Scott met.\n\n“Bill was not prepared for any kind of graduate class,” Wald said. “He didn’t really have the power of concentration or the commitment to carefully read the books and engage in thoughtful dialogue. He wanted to get up and sort of pontificate his opinions.\n\n“He gave me the impression of someone who was already mentally in trouble.”\n\nPercy Bates, the U-M education professor who had known Bill Scott since his youth, remembers well how Scott later would call him when he was in trouble – usually involving a problem with a young woman.\n\n“Generally the crisis was pretty much the same,” Bates said. “He was into what he was doing, but they were trying to rehabilitate him or trying to get him on the right track. I think in most cases, he succeeded in getting them on his track rather than them being able to get him off where he was.”\n\nDespite her concerns, Sheaffer stayed in the relationship, but one day their lives took an ominous turn: One of Scott’s activist friends introduced the couple to crack cocaine. It was the late 1980s, when crack’s surge in major cities was becoming an epidemic. Before long, drugs consumed their lives, leaving Scott more paranoid and unpredictable.\n\nIn February 1991 Sheaffer gave birth to a son. They named him William Walter Mandela, after the South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, who had visited Detroit the previous summer.\n\nThe baby’s early life was not promising. Sheaffer recalls speeding down I-94 in a car filled with alcohol, drugs and young Mandela eating chocolate to keep him quiet while mom and dad looked for drugs and got high.\n\nThere were run-ins with police. Over the years, Bill Scott was arrested for larceny from a building, retail fraud and possession of marijuana, and did several short stints in the Washtenaw County Jail. Sheaffer was busted for similar petty crimes.\n\nMarriage ends. Mandela’s life begins\n\nThe liaison between Sheaffer and Scott did not end well. One night in 1992, Sheaffer found herself curled up in a fetal position, emaciated and covered in bruises from what she says was her husband’s physical abuse.\n\nShe sat on the dirty carpet of a cluttered Ann Arbor apartment, going through crack withdrawal while her baby slept in the next room. Scott was out on the streets, trying to find more crack. She knew if he scored, he would not share.\n\n“I’d never been in a more dark or desperate place. If I could, I would have jumped out of my own skin.”\n\nThat is Sheaffer speaking last year on the stage of the popular Moth Radio Hour, the nationwide storytelling showcase in which ordinary people deliver monologues before live audiences, with their stories distributed via radio and podcast. Her talk is titled “A Phone Call.”\n\nShe describes how she worried that her druggie lifestyle would cost her her baby, so she punched in a phone number for a Christian counselor recommended by her mother.\n\nIt was the middle of the night. The man she awakened immediately started listening in a way that reassured Sheaffer. She talked for several hours. He listened to Sheaffer discuss Scott’s abuse and her drug problem. “This man didn’t judge me,” she told the audience. “He just sat with me, and was present and listened and had such a kindness, such a gentleness.” He would say, “Tell me more.”\n\nAs dawned neared, the conversation wound down and Sheaffer thanked the man repeatedly. Then she asked how long he had been a Christian counselor. He told her that he had been trying to avoid that subject but had to be honest now.\n\n“That number you called? Wrong number.”\n\nHe was not a counselor, but a random Good Samaritan who had listened and cared. She never learned the man’s name and never talked to him again. Yet his hours of listening led her, gradually, to get her life together.\n\nShe divorced Scott in 1995, and eventually took Mandela — the “sticky, chocolate-covered baby boy,” as she put it — back to lily white Findlay, where she raised him, surrounded by her parents and other relatives.\n\nSheaffer later remarried and settled in Akron, where she teaches college English composition and studies for a doctorate in urban education.\n\nBill Scott made a different choice. He headed south, eventually settling in Daytona Beach, Fla., where by all accounts he has struggled. He has spent much of his time homeless, and has been arrested more than 50 times, for misdemeanors like trespassing, sleeping in the park and having an open container of alcohol, and such felonies as stealing from stores, possessing a weapon and buying drugs.\n\nIn July, I spent three days in Daytona Beach with photographer Brian Kaufman in a failed effort to find Scott. Street people and the director of a local homeless-aid center said Scott hadn’t been seen for months. His family has no idea where he is. Public records show he is not in jail and has not died in the county that includes Daytona Beach.\n\nBut this is not the end of Bill Scott’s story. For closer to home, there is his son, a talented young man with a promising future, like his father before him.\n\nMandela\n\nNow 25, Mandela Sheaffer remembers with fondness being raised as a biracial child surrounded by white people in Findlay, Ohio.\n\n\n\n\"It was a great place to grow up,” he says.\n\nMandela Sheaffer is thoughtful and self-assured. He talks quietly and laughs easily, like his mother. He wears his hair in dreadlocks, pulled back and resting neatly on his shoulders. His glasses are the browline style popular in the 1950s and famously worn by Malcolm X.\n\nIn Findlay, he recalls a few sideways glances from people while growing up because he looks black. Once, when he was 10, he said, the manager of a market followed him down the aisles as if he might steal something. But by high school, Sheaffer was a football star, signing autographs for little white kids and feeling little discomfort.\n\n“I was protected,” he said. “Generally, it was pretty cool.”\n\nThat does not mean young Mandela did not struggle with his blackness — and work to figure out the meaning of race in his life. He said he went through an identity crisis for years.\n\n“I’m biracial. I grew up in a white community. I didn’t even know what it meant to be black in America. I was in a protective bubble.” He said he didn’t meet the black side of his family in Michigan until he was 21.\n\nWith good grades and his athleticism, colleges came calling. He narrowed his choices to Stanford and Princeton, and decided to go East.\n\nWhen he traveled to the Princeton campus in New Jersey for a football visit, the team paired him with a group of black players to show him around. It surprised him.\n\n“I honestly didn’t know almost any black people in Ohio,” he said.\n\nHe said he began to realize that society was demanding he figure out if he was black or white. He said he tried to locate a middle ground.\n\n“It’s almost an internal pressure, I would say. It’s almost like you have to perform for the black population and perform for the white population, not in a bad way. But I had to come to the conclusion that I was Mandela. I didn’t want to identify either way. I just want to be me, right?”\n\n“It was absolutely a struggle,” he said.\n\nThen Bowling Green happened.\n\nLeaving the bubble\n\nIn March 2012, Sheaffer sat on the porch of a house in Bowling Green, Ohio – home of Bowling Green State University. The house was the home of his longtime girlfriend, who was white, as were her roommates. As he waited for the women to return, he said he bantered with the dozens of young people walking past. A pink flamingo on the porch added to the light-hearted mood.\n\nIt was a typical night in Bowling Green. He asked people how their night was going, and recalled: “At one point, someone said he was having a shitty night, so I went off the porch and gave him a hug. It was fun. The porch is right by the sidewalk. Everyone was within five yards of me.”\n\nSuddenly, a squad car screeched to a stop in front of the house. Sheaffer, saying he had no idea what was happening, did not want to get involved in a possible police matter so he stepped inside and closed the door. After a few minutes, as more police arrived, he learned the cops were after him.\n\nThey wanted to see his ID, so he opened the door. The officers grabbed him, dragged him out of the house, snapped on handcuffs and took him to jail.\n\nAt 6-foot-2 and 200 pounds, Sheaffer was bigger than most of the officers.\n\n“They said, ‘Don’t resist, don’t resist, we’ll put you down.’ I was like, ‘I’m not doing anything.’ You could tell they were freaked out, just by my presence. I said, ‘Guys, you’re making a huge, huge mistake. I don’t even know why you’re arresting me in the first place.’ And they really couldn’t tell me.”\n\nHe spent 18 hours behind bars. Meanwhile, back at Princeton, student activists began a social media campaign on his behalf to publicize what some believed was racial profiling.\n\nA month earlier, in Florida, George Zimmerman had shot and killed Trayvon Martin, the 17-year-old African American high school student, and protests were beginning to spread nationwide. The Black Lives Matter movement was born the next year, when a jury acquitted Zimmerman.\n\n“Racism claimed in student arrest,” read the headline in the Daily Princetonian student paper.\n\nHe was booked for disorderly conduct and obstructing official business. Police said he “recklessly” yelled at passersby “under circumstances in which the conduct is likely to provoke a violent response,” according to the Daily Princetonian’s reporting, citing police records. The police report said that when Sheaffer walked into the house he had delayed “the performance of a public officer.”\n\nBut the police story gradually fell apart. The charges were dropped and he was released from jail. Sheaffer said the BGSU chief of police later called him to apologize.\n\nUniversity spokesman Dave Kielmeyer recently confirmed Sheaffer’s version. After reviewing the incident, then-Police Chief Monica Moll “determined the officer could have made a better decision,” Kielmeyer said.\n\nSheaffer said he later learned the initial police officer suspected he might be up to no good when he noticed an African-American man on the porch of a house the officer knew to be occupied by young white women.\n\nDespite the absolution, the incident left Sheaffer distraught and introspective.\n\n“That’s when I had the stark realization that I’m black in America — that night,” he said. “Without a doubt, I’d been protected my whole life, in a white community. If I had been in Findlay it would have been fine. But 20 minutes away, it just blows up in your face.”\n\nThe encounter with police, he said, “flipped a switch” inside him.\n\n“I started to really identify being black in America at that point because it was cast on me. I really wanted to keep ‘I’m Mandela, I’m myself.’ But in America, I’m black. No matter what.”\n\nOne way Sheaffer processed the incident was to pour his energy into his senior thesis, a major research paper that is a long tradition for Princeton students.\n\nIn some ways, he was following the path of his absent father, Bill Scott, who wrote about his evolving racial identity, racism and encounters with police four decades earlier. Mandela Sheaffer was thinking about race and the meaning of being black in the most personal terms. He called the exercise cathartic.\n\n“It was not until I was unlawfully and unjustly arrested at the age of 21 that my eyes were opened to the fact that I was, in fact, a ‘black’ adult male,” he wrote in the thesis, “living in a white society where I could be harassed, detained and jailed, even though I had never had so much as an after-school detention in my entire life.”\n\nSheaffer said he knows the “white privilege” of his family, friends and fellow students at an Ivy League school, and his ability to hire a lawyer, gave him an advantage many black suspects do not have, leaving them to linger in county jails for weeks.\n\nAnd he’s conscious of the privilege he continues to enjoy. Today, Mandela Sheaffer makes good money working with corporate clients in his job with Microsoft in Chicago. His 27th-floor apartment looks out on one of the city’s magical landscapes of a curving river flanked by glittering skyscrapers. It’s a status that young African Americans from his father’s era could scarcely imagine.\n\nBut Sheaffer said he wonders if he should be doing more.\n\nHe notes the irony of his white mother being more politically militant than he is. A year ago at Thanksgiving, when she was visiting, Auburn Sheaffer joined Chicagoans on Michigan Avenue to protest the shooting death by police of an unarmed 17-year-old African American named Laquan McDonald. Mandela Sheaffer stayed home.\n\n“Right now,” he says, “it would be admirable for me to just throw everything away and start fighting, and doing whatever, but it’s not logical. It wouldn’t make sense right now where I am with my life.”\n\nWilliam Walter Mandela Sheaffer is the grandson of the militant hustler who owned the blind pig where Detroit’s deadly 1967 insurrection began. He is the son of the man who tossed a bottle that helped to start the disorder and then wrote about it in a searing memoir.\n\nMandela, succeeding in Chicago, does not know either man.\n\nHe did not meet William II, his grandfather. And he does not remember his father, though he has a photo of his dad holding him. He said he has not read his father’s book, though he believes he will check it out one day. But he’s not without his father’s writings. Mandela has note fragments written on cards and books that his father sent to him when he was little and living with his mom.\n\nOne note refers to a tiny koala bear, given to Mandela, that was originally part of a pair his parents had carried as tokens of their love.\n\n“Dearest Mandela, you are now the keeper of the bear. Once there was two and now there is just one,” the father wrote. “Now you keep him safe with love and hope.”\n\nBridge magazine contributor Bill McGraw worked at the Detroit Free Press for 32 years as a reporter, editor and columnist.

Some even fly into Seoul from other countries in the region for the festivities.\n\nBut for the past two years, celebrations were muted by pandemic restrictions on crowd sizes and mask mandates.\n\nSaturday night marked the first Halloween since the country lifted these restrictions – lending it particular significance for many eager participants in Seoul, as well as international visitors including foreign residents and tourists.\n\nHotels and ticketed events in the neighborhood had been booked solid in advance, and large crowds were expected.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nWitnesses told CNN there was very little – if any – crowd control before the mass of people turned deadly.\n\nVideos and photos posted to social media show people crammed together, standing shoulder to shoulder in the narrow street.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter returns to Itaewon's narrow alley one day after the Halloween disaster.

Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter the first emergency calls came in around 10:24 p.m., authorities rushed to the scene – but the sheer volume of people made it difficult to reach those who needed help.\n\nVideo posted to social media showed people performing compressions on other partygoers lying on the ground as they waited for medical assistance.\n\nThe thousands of people in Halloween costumes contributed to the widespread sense of confusion and chaos. One witness described seeing a police officer shouting during the disaster – but some revelers mistook him for another partygoer.\n\nThe cause of the crush is still under investigation, though officials said there were no gas leaks or fires on site.\n\nWho were the victims?\n\nThe casualties were young, mostly in their teens and early 20s, authorities said. Known for its nightlife and trendy restaurants, Itaewon is popular among backpackers and international students.\n\nAmong the 154 dead were at least 26 foreign nationals, according to authorities, with victims from countries including the United States, China, Iran, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Japan, Australia, Norway, France, Russia, Austria, Vietnam, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.\n\nAll but one of the victims have been identified, South Korea’s Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said in a briefing on Monday.

Three teachers also died.\n\nAs of 5 p.m. local time Sunday (4 a.m. ET), the number of injured had risen to 133, of whom 37 were seriously injured, the ministry said.\n\nThe Seoul city government said more than 4,000 missing people reports had been received. That number could include multiple reports for the same person, or reports filed Saturday night for people who have since been found.\n\nPolice said there is no active search for those reported missing as they believe no one went missing from the scene; rather, they said the missing person reports have been used to help identify those who died.\n\nEmergency services treat injured people in Seoul on October 30.

When asked whether she had seen any officials trying to limit the number of people entering the alley, she replied: “Before the incident, not at all.”\n\nAnother eyewitness described the situation getting “worse and worse,” saying they could hear “people asking for help for other people, because there were not enough rescuers that can just handle all that.”", "authors": ["Sophie Jeong Gawon Bae Paula Hancocks Hilary Whiteman Jessie Yeung", "Sophie Jeong", "Gawon Bae", "Paula Hancocks", "Hilary Whiteman", "Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/03/15/purim-dates-2022-heres-what-know-jewish-holiday/7041902001/", "title": "Purim dates 2022: Here's what to know about the Jewish holiday", "text": "Purim begins at sundown on Wednesday.\n\nThe holiday recalls the ancient story of how Queen Esther bravely saved the Jewish people.\n\nIt is a tradition for groups of Jewish people to read from the Book of Esther aloud during Purim.\n\nPurim begins this week, and the holiday will bring celebrations, costumes, sweet treats and other traditions to Jewish communities around the world.\n\nThe holiday, which starts at sundown Wednesday, recalls the ancient story of how the figure of Queen Esther bravely saved the Jewish people.\n\n“At the last minute, the story is flipped upside down, and the Jewish people are saved through the heroic acts of a particular heroine, Queen Esther, who realizes that she's in the right place in the right moment in order to change the fate of the Jewish people,” Rabbi Benjamin Berger, vice president of Jewish education at Hillel International, explained to USA TODAY.\n\nHow is Purim celebrated today? How will Jewish communities come together this week? Here’s what you need to know.\n\nWhat is Purim?\n\nPurim is a holiday centered around the biblical Book of Esther, in which Queen Esther stops a plot devised by Haman, the king's counselor, to massacre Jews.\n\n“Jews have celebrated the holiday of Purim as a day when they triumphed over one of their most fearsome enemies named Haman,” Pamela Nadell, a professor of history at American University, told USA TODAY.\n\nBerger said Jewish people continue to “celebrate this day where the tables were turned, where what we thought was going to be the destruction ended up being the salvation of the Jewish people.”\n\nWhat is Tu BiShvat? Everything to know about the Jewish holiday that celebrates nature\n\nWhat is Rosh Hashanah? Here's what you need to know about the Jewish New Year\n\nHow is Purim celebrated?\n\nThere are four main acts that Jewish people do on the day of Purim, Berger said. The first is to read the story of Esther, called the Megillah.\n\nIt is a tradition for groups of Jewish people to read from the Book of Esther aloud, together as a community.\n\n“During the reading, every time the wicked Haman’s name is mentioned, they make a lot of noise,” Nadell said, explaining that people will stomp their feet, shout and use a grogger, a kind of noisemaker.\n\nOther traditions include having festive meals, bringing food to loved ones and giving charitable gifts.\n\n“It's also very important on the holiday to also make donations, to give charity,” Nadell said. “You have this wonderful, raucous celebration, and then you also have remembering those who are less fortunate.”\n\nBerger added that the tradition of giving charitable gifts “is a recognition that we can't sit here in joy and in the levity of the moment if we're not also taking care of those who are in need.”\n\nHe also pointed to commemorations that individual groups organize for Purim. For example, this year, \"Hillel International is urging Jewish students and the global Jewish community to abstain from food and donate what they would have spent on meals” to relief efforts in Ukraine amid Russia’s ongoing invasion of the country, according to a news release from the organization. The show of support comes from an ancient tradition to fast ahead of Purim.\n\nSome groups of Jewish people will also bake and eat hamantaschen, a cookie named after the villain Haman, among other Purim celebrations.\n\nIs Purim like Halloween?\n\nThough experts told USA TODAY some Jews don’t embrace comparing the holiday to Halloween, Purim is often likened to modern Halloween celebrations because both involve dressing up in costumes and going to carnivals and other festivities.\n\n“You can think of Purim as the Jewish Halloween,” Nadell said. “Jews wear all sorts of fanciful costumes, and they dress up. Little girls will dress up as Queen Esther, and boys will dress up as one of the male heroes of the story, he was Esther's uncle, his name was Mordechai.”\n\nBut she added that children – and some adults – will “dress up in all sorts of things.”\n\n“Honestly, I've even seen people dress their pets up in costumes, just like they do on Halloween,” she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/theme-parks/2022/10/30/disney-world-disneyland-christmas-holidays-2022/10540533002/", "title": "Disney World, Disneyland holidays 2022: What to know before you go", "text": "The holidays have arrived at Walt Disney World, and Disneyland will soon follow.\n\nFans of Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party have eagerly awaited the pandemic return of the after-hours event at Magic Kingdom, but that's not the only thing coming back for the 2022 holiday season.\n\nYear after year, Disney lovers are drawn to the Florida and California resorts' elaborate decorations, seasonal food and beloved entertainment like Disneyland's \"A Christmas Fantasy Parade\" and EPCOT's Candlelight Processional, making it one of the busiest times to visit.\n\nHere's what travelers should know about spending this holiday season at Disneyland and Disney World.\n\nDisneyland vs. Disney World:What's the difference and which is better?\n\nMerry Grinchmas:Holiday celebrations at Universal Studios\n\nWhat holidays does Disney celebrate?\n\nBoth Disneyland and Disney World go all out for Christmas, but that's not the only holiday they celebrate.\n\nDisney Festival of the Holidays at Disney California Adventure also revels in Three Kings' Day, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa and Diwali.\n\nEPCOT International Festival of the Holidays also celebrates Hanukkah and Kwanzaa, in addition to Christmas traditions around the world.\n\nWhat day does Disney put up Christmas decorations?\n\nLike Cinderella's carriage turning into a pumpkin at the stroke of midnight, Walt Disney World and Disneyland transform after parks close Halloween night, so guests arriving on and after Nov. 1 feel like they're walking into winter wonderlands.\n\nAll November and December, the parks dazzle with decorations that take a full year to prepare.\n\nHow long does Disney Christmas last?

This year, you might be out of luck in the candy aisle.\n\n“We will not be able to fully meet consumer demand,” for the October holiday, warned Hershey CEO Michele Buck in prepared remarks about the company’s second-quarter results Thursday.\n\nThe problem? Consumers are demanding more regular and Halloween-themed candy than Hershey can make, at least right now.\n\nMany consumer goods manufacturers have been struggling to meet surging demand for their products during the pandemic, especially with the ongoing supply chain issues. That’s meant that they’ve had to reduce production of certain less popular items or, as in the case of the late, great Choco Taco, cut them altogether.\n\nHershey is in the same boat.\n\nHershey doesn't expect to meet demand for Halloween candy. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDemand for sweets surged during the pandemic and has remained high. Meanwhile interest in Halloween has only gotten stronger. That’s bittersweet news for Hershey, which has seen its sales spike — the company reported double-digit sales growth in the quarter compared to last year -— but it has also had to make some production sacrifices.\n\nThe chocolate maker uses the same manufacturing lines for its regular and seasonal products. That means it can’t amp up production of both regular sweets and Halloween or holiday items. Instead, it has to do one or the other.\n\n“We had a strategy of prioritizing everyday on-shelf availability,” Buck said during an analyst call discussing the company’s second-quarter results. “That was a choice that we needed to make,” she said. “It was a tough decision.”\n\nThat likely means ceding ground to competitors such as Mars Wrigley, which makes M&Ms, Snickers, Skittles and other candies, and Brach’s, during the busy Halloween season. Hershey is adding more manufacturing lines and hoping that it will be able to meet demand in the next couple of years.\n\nBut it has other issues.\n\nIn addition to capacity constraints, the company is still struggling with disruptions along its supply chain, including higher dairy prices and scarce ingredients. In order to get the ingredients it needs, Hershey has to source them from other suppliers, which is costly.\n\nThese issues are largely related to the war in Ukraine, Buck said.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/10/22/why-some-schools-dont-celebrate-halloween/92580862/", "title": "Why your school isn't celebrating Halloween", "text": "Mackenzie Ryan\n\nThe Des Moines Register\n\nDES MOINES — In many Iowa schools, Halloween is a holiday that isn't welcome.\n\nSchools have been nixing the celebration since the '90s, according to longtime educators and Register news archives.\n\nSchools in Des Moines, West Des Moines, Johnston and other communities are opting instead for more neutral \"fall parties\" — without the controversy and hoopla of Halloween.\n\nIt's also a policy that's relieved at least some concern about \"creepy clown\" costumes disrupting local schools, since all costumes are banned.\n\nHere are five reasons schools are saying \"no\" to Halloween:\n\n1. Religious concerns\n\nSome parents have long condemned Halloween as a holiday celebrating devil worship, a concern that appeared in a 1996 Register story.\n\nWhile these complaints also sparked pushback — \"People try to read too much into some things,\" one parent said at the time — it prompted schools to stop the celebrations.\n\n\"If you're doing a whole school thing, and some people don't want to do it, how do you do something that honors everybody's wishes?\" said Iowa State professor Greg Robinson, a former elementary school principal and superintendent in Urbandale.\n\nIt's been at least 18 years since Beaver Creek Elementary in Johnston celebrated Halloween, for example, in part because of religious sensitivity.\n\n“We have a lot of families that have different traditions and different religious beliefs,” Principal Eric Toot said. \"Some people don't like the connotations around Halloween, which is why the decision was made.\"\n\nSchools have that flexibility, but the ACLU of Iowa said educators shouldn't be worried about legal consequences if they do celebrate the holiday.\n\n\"Unless they are using Halloween as a means to engage in religious indoctrination of the kids in some way, like telling all the kids they have to dress up as specific religious figures, they are not crossing the line or getting into any scary territory,\" said Legal Director Rita Bettis.\n\n2. Scarier costumes\n\nChildren kept coming to school with more realistic — and more disturbing — costumes.\n\nRobinson still remembers a first-grader who wore a realistic-looking mask with an ax cutting into his head.\n\n\"It had blood and things like that,\" he said. At the time, he recalls thinking: \"Is this something we really want to have?\"\n\nAround the country, some schools responded by setting strict dress-up rules or requiring costumes to be a storybook character, which gave the celebration an academic focus.\n\nBut Robinson was among those who switched to a \"fall party,\" which is a more general celebration of autumn — usually a scaled-back version without costumes.\n\nAmid the \"creepy clown\" threats this year, that may come as a relief to some parents.\n\nUnlike schools in Colorado, New Jersey and other states, many Iowa districts haven't taken the added step of banning clown costumes.\n\nMost popular Halloween costumes of 2016\n\n3. Academics\n\nThe change also came during a time of increasing pressure to raise the academic bar, pressure that schools still feel.\n\nEducators complained that Halloween hoopla was overshadowing learning.\n\n\"It got to the point where people were spending a lot of time worrying about 45 minutes,\" Robinson said. \"It's not why kids are coming to school.\"\n\nFor example, while classrooms at Dallas Center Elementary have \"fall parties\" with crafts and treats, and some children change into costume, it's a very limited celebration.\n\n“We want to focus on learning, and that’s a distraction,” said Principal Diann Williamson.\n\n4. Party concerns\n\nAlthough not the primary reason, schools had growing concerns about food allergies.\n\nSchools were adapting how they approached classroom treats, making parties more difficult to coordinate.\n\n“If we weren’t providing the treats, we had to look at what was coming in and what wasn’t,” Robinson said.\n\nLongtime educators said the shift also came amid changing social norms. More parents were working, and fewer parents were available to help coordinate and supervise parties.\n\n\"We used to have homeroom parents and volunteers that would bring in cookies or treats,\" he said.\n\n5. Economic concerns\n\nAs costumes became more elaborate, schools worried about the pressure Halloween celebrations put on family budgets.\n\nSome students arrived in costumes that \"cost a fortune,\" Robinson said. Other families chose not to participate at all.\n\nThat's one of the reasons Johnston schools stopped celebrating — educators worried about the celebration dividing students.\n\n“There's a lot of differences in the type of costumes that can be worn, and what some could afford and not afford,” said Ann Thelen, district spokeswoman. “It put parents in a competitive position.”\n\nKnowing how much fun students enjoy dress-up days, Toot said his school incorporates the activity in simpler ways, such as during Johnston's homecoming celebration.\n\n\"It's a fun day,\" he said.\n\nMost popular pet Halloween costumes of 2016", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/10/04/these-37-states-have-cancelled-popular-halloween-events/42702997/", "title": "Halloween 2020: Coronavirus crisis cancels these events in 37 states", "text": "Hristina Byrnes and John Harrington\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nNothing in 2020 has been the same – and Halloween won’t be an exception.

Some cities even tried issuing an outright ban on trick-or-treating because social distancing would be near impossible if hundreds of children took to the streets at the same time.\n\nAs of Sept. 28, more than 7.2 million Americans have been infected with the novel coronavirus and over 208,000 have died.

However, there is one Jewish holiday that can be observed during a pandemic with surprisingly little adjustment.\n\nSukkot, the week-long fall harvest festival which started Friday evening, has been honored outside for thousands of years. The primary way to celebrate: To build and dwell in a man-made hut called a “sukkah.”\n\nAlthough the holiday has long been overshadowed by the Jewish high holidays Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, the “symbolism of the sukkah this year feels particularly rife,” says Rabbi Andrea London of Beth Emet synagogue in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nSo what is Sukkot and what makes it special this year? Let’s take a look:\n\nWhat is Sukkot all about?\n\nThe holiday commemorates the Israelites' nomadic life in the desert after escaping slavery in Egypt.\n\n“We were wandering for 40 years, we were in temporary shelters and we built temporary huts,” says Becky Sobelman-Stern, the chief program officer at the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles.\n\nIt is also an agricultural holiday connected to the fall harvest.\n\n“This is really the Jewish Thanksgiving,” adds London. She says it's a time to be thankful for our food and and pray for rain to bring a good harvest next year.\n\nAlready dining outdoors? On Sukkot, you're supposed to eat in a sukkah (hut)\n\nObservant Jews make sukkot (that's the plural of sukkah and also the holiday name) out of materials found in nature — Sobelman-Stern uses palms found in her yard — and sometimes with the help of sukkah kits that can have steel tubing and wooden panels. The sukkah is supposed to have three walls and a roof that provides shade but also allows guests to see through it to the stars.\n\nThe sukkah is meant to be a place for outdoor dining. It is also customary to sleep in the sukkah all week, though “not everyone does the sleeping part, especially here in Chicago,” London says.\n\nPeople who don’t have the space or ability to erect a temporary hut outside can use porticos and overhangs to get into the spirit of the holiday. The holiday “is outside. It’s about decorating. It’s about being creative,” Sobelman-Stern says.\n\nWhy Sukkot feels more meaningful this year\n\nWith the holiday encouraging Jewish people to eat and socialize in open outdoor structures, “in some ways, Sukkot seems made for COVID world,” says Rabbi Sarah Krinsky of Adas Israel Congregation in Washington, D.C.\n\n“It does go deeper than that, too, though: Sukkot is about recognizing the places of fragility in our lives. It reminds us of what is temporary,\" she says.\n\nThe holiday also serves as a reminder of what’s important in life, London adds. “And how do we pursue those things? How do we be people who live with compassion and justice? How can our faith in God support us in times of trials and tribulations in crisis?”\n\nSukkot is meant to inspire thought and discussion around those questions, and also this one: “Who else, deceased or alive, would you like to have in the sukkah this year?”\n\nOn Sobelman-Stern’s list is the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died at the start of Rosh Hashanah.\n\nIt's a Jewish holiday that requires joy\n\nSukkot is the only Jewish holiday in which there is a commanded emotion, Krinsky explains. “In this case, profound joy,” she says.\n\nStepping outside, enjoying nature, decorating a sukkah and sharing food with friends (though likely fewer this year than on any other year, because of the threat of COVID-19) is meant to \"lead us to a deeper sense of presence, gratitude and even joy,\" says Krinsky. Finding joy on the holiday feels particularly important this year, she says, when doing so can be feel like a \"profound challenge and opportunity.\"\n\nAnd if the aforementioned activities don’t put a smile on your face, one specific tradition should: The shaking of the lulav and etrog.\n\nThe lulav, which is meant to symbolize the body, is made from binding the frond of a palm tree to myrtle and willow branches. The etrog, which is meant to symbolize the heart, is a citron fruit that looks like a large lemon. Both are shaken in all directions as a way to recognize God’s presence. It’s OK to treat the ritual as a dance.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/23/national-trick-treat-day-new-halloween-thing-what-know/4064258002/", "title": "National Trick or Treat Day is a new Halloween thing: What to know", "text": "A group working to change the date of Halloween was dividing the country, so instead, it opted to create a new \"holiday\" – National Trick or Treat Day.\n\nThe Halloween & Costume Association’s petition originally intended to move Halloween to the last Saturday of October but evolved into an additional day of celebration after it faced some opposition. Now it has more 150,000 signatures and is backed by Party City.\n\nThe day has also made it on the National Day Calendar. This, the group says, makes the day officially official. At least as official as it can get.\n\nAccording to the National Day Calendar website, there is an application process for \"brands, nonprofits, and corporations to register an official National Day that aligns with their product or service.\"\n\nFor reference, the site also lists in November a National Deviled Egg Day, National Chicken Lady Day and National Pizza with the Works Except Anchovies Day.\n\nStill, the Halloween & Costume Association has good intentions – to increase safety for children and help parents navigate a late-night holiday that often lands on a school night.\n\nHere's what parents need to know about the new holiday, with some help from Aneisha McMillan, who does marketing for the HCA.\n\nWhat is National Trick or Treat Day?\n\nNational Trick or Treat Day (NTTD) is a day for families and communities to come together by \"throwing block parties, community events, costume contests, parades, walks and runs, trunk-or-treating and daytime trick-or-treating as well,\" McMillan tells USA TODAY.\n\n\"NTTD is just an additional day to celebrate Halloween.\" The group is also referring to it as \"ALLoween.\"\n\nWhen is National Trick or Treat Day?\n\nThe last Saturday of October. For Halloween 2019, that is Oct. 26.\n\nHow would Saturdays and daytime trick-or-treating improve Halloween?\n\nHCA has a list of scary statistics on its petition concerning children's safety on Halloween.\n\nIt notes that, on average, children are more than twice as likely to be hit by a car and killed on Halloween than on any other day of the year, according to Safe Kids Worldwide.\n\nThe HCA also claims that many parents fail to use \"high visibility aids\" on costumes, flashlights or other measures to help prevent nighttime accidents.\n\nParents signing the petition also voiced concerns about the challenge to celebrate the event during a weekday when parents are working.\n\n\"It makes more sense to have it always on a Saturday so that we don't have to worry about getting the kids home and in bed early for school the next day. Also, for most people, they wouldn't have to worry about working that day or the day following,\" one wrote as their reason for signing the petition.\n\nMORE HALLOWEEN:\n\nDoes this mean we should be prepared to pass out candy on two days?\n\nNot necessarily. McMillan says there \"are no rules\" to NTTD and they are leaving celebrations up to neighborhoods, cities and communities. Just as city officials set trick-or-treating hours for Halloween night, cities have the ability to decide what's best. In fact, some cities have changed trick-or-treating times due to inclement weather. This is the same concept.\n\nHow do I know if my community is participating?\n\nMcMillan expects NTTD to evolve over time through \"grassroots\" efforts and through local organizations and communities hosting NTTD events and activities. Parents and caregivers should check with area officials for any changes to trick-or-treating hours in their area.\n\nCould the actual date of Halloween ever change?\n\nProbably not. Halloween is not a federally-recognized holiday. The spooky tradition originated with the \"ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, where people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts,\" according to a History.com post detailing the history and evolution of Halloween.\n\nIf a U.S. president was so moved to change the date of Halloween, it would require the government passing a bill to make Halloween a federal holiday, then, of course, setting the date to be the last Saturday of October.\n\nBottom line: It's unlikely to happen, but that doesn't mean you can't celebrate the tradition whenever you want – though your neighbors might be confused when you show up at their door in costume asking for candy in July.\n\nHappy Hallo-trick-or-treat-o-ween!\n\nFollow the latest from USA TODAY Parenting at usatoday.com/life/parenting.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2015/10/29/10-cute-not-corny-halloween-style-picks/74744416/", "title": "10 cute-not-corny Halloween style picks", "text": "Arienne Thompson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWhen it comes to getting into the holiday spirit, there's festive and then there's freaking ridiculous.

And the Houston Astros starter, with three of his fellow hurlers, would prove them right.\n\nThe Astros on Wednesday produced the first combined no-hitter in World Series history – and the Fall Classic’s second no-hitter overall – as Javier and Houston’s bullpen blanked the host Philadelphia Phillies 5-0 to tie the best-of-seven series at 2-2 and secure their place in baseball lore.\n\nJavier tossed six innings of no-hit ball while starting for the Astros, striking out nine and walking two over 97 pitches before being relieved.\n\nBryan Abreu and Rafael Montero then each pitched a perfect inning before Ryan Pressly closed out the Phillies in the ninth, leaving the hosts without a hit at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia.\n\nAfter the last out, Javier ran from his dugout to hug Pressly on the mound, surrounded by their celebrating teammates. In an interview on the field, he was asked when he knew the night would be special.\n\n“It’s funny. My parents told me today I was going to throw a no-hitter, and thanks to God, I was able to accomplish that,” Javier told Fox Sports, via a translator.\n\nJavier, who hails from the Dominican Republic, later told reporters his father had arrived just a day earlier in the US to watch him pitch.\n\nJavier departed the game with a 5-0 lead, with the Astros scoring all their runs in the fifth. Houston manager Dusty Baker said postgame he was thinking of Javier and protecting his health when deciding to pull him after the sixth, noting Javier’s increasing pitch count and the strength of the Astros’ bullpen.\n\n“It’s always tough to take a guy out, but you have to weigh the no-hitter and history versus trying to win this game and get back to 2-2 in the World Series,” Baker said.\n\nThe only previous no-hitter in 118 years of World Series history came from one pitcher, Don Larsen, who tossed a perfect game in the 1956 World Series.\n\nThe Astros now hold the distinction of throwing the first combined no-hitter not just in the World Series but in postseason history, according to Major League Baseball. Outside the Astros’ and Larsen’s feats, the only other no-hitter in the postseason was tossed by Roy Halladay for the Phillies in the 2010 National League Divisional Series.\n\nPhiladelphia manager Rob Thomson noted the Phillies had a no-hitter pitched against them by the New York Mets earlier this year, then won the next day.\n\n“These guys, they got a short memory. They’re going to go home tonight. They’re going to go to bed and come back in here tomorrow and prep and compete like they always do,” Thomson said.\n\nThis is Houston’s second no-hitter this season. On June 25, Javier, Hector Neris and Pressly combined for one against the Yankees.\n\nThe Astros catcher who called his team’s pitches Wednesday, Christian Vazquez, also ran to embrace Pressly after the game. Houston’s pitching coach, Joshua Miller, praised Vazquez for his role.\n\n“He’s calling every pitch, he’s seeing the movement, he’s seeing the hitter reaction,” Miller said, according to MLB.com. “It’s huge, knowing what to call and when to maybe vacate the general game plan in certain situations.”\n\nVazquez said he did not think of completing Wednesday’s no-hitter until “maybe the last inning” due to the potent Phillies lineup, which slugged its way to a Game 3 victory Tuesday.\n\n“We’ve not finished the job yet, but this is very, very special for us. And when we get old we’re going to remember this,” Vazquez said.", "authors": ["Travis Caldwell Jill Martin Jason Hanna", "Travis Caldwell", "Jill Martin", "Jason Hanna"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/11/02/astros-combine-no-hitter-vs-phillies-world-series-cristian-javier/8253025001/", "title": "World Series no-hitter! Cristian Javier, Astros silence Phillies for first ...", "text": "PHILADELPHIA – Cristian Javier could have claimed a near-unprecedented piece of World Series history all to himself Wednesday night. Instead, he shared in the glory – and with two more victories, the Houston Astros may reap the ultimate prize.\n\nJavier pitched six no-hit innings, so dominating the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 4 that he certainly could have become just the second pitcher to throw a solo no-hitter in a World Series game. But he exited after six innings and 97 pitches, and Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero and Ryan Pressly finished the job, joining Javier for a combined no-hitter and a 5-0 Astros victory that squared this World Series at 2-2.\n\nIt was just the second no-hitter in World Series history, joining the New York Yankees’ Don Larsen, who threw a perfect game in Game 5 of the 1956 Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers. And it was just the third no-hitter in playoff history, the first since the late Roy Halladay pulled the feat off in Game 1 of the 2010 National League Division Series against the Cincinnati Reds, on the same Citizens Bank Park mound where Javier and friends worked their Game 4 magic on Wednesday.\n\nGAME 4: After combined no-hitter vs. Phillies, Astros back in control of World Series\n\nTHURSDAY: World Series collides with TNF, both feature Philly, Houston teams\n\nFollow every game: Live MLB Scores\n\nNEVER MISS A MOMENT: Follow our sports newsletter for daily updates\n\nJavier, a 25-year-old from the Dominican Republic, was pitching in front of his father for the first time after his father arrived Wednesday for the game. He said his parents told him he'd throw a no-hitter.\n\n\"When they told me that, obviously I got a lot more motivated,\" he says. \"I kept my faith in God and obviously I knew I had a big commitment today being down 2-1 in the series.\n\n\"And with my parents being here, I just tried to give my best, give my family the best that I could.\"\n\nPurists might be aghast that Javier, who struck out nine and walked two, was not allowed a chance to finish his gem. But doing so was unrealistic: Javier had only thrown more than 97 pitches on four occasions this season, topping out at 115 on June 25.\n\nAnd what happened that day? Javier and two relievers combined on a no-hitter at Yankee Stadium.\n\nSee, the Astros won 106 games this season and Javier’s 11.7 strikeouts per nine innings would have ranked third in the major leagues if he pitched enough innings to qualify. On a club with Justin Verlander set to win his third Cy Young Award this year and lefty Framber Valdez growing renowned for his playoff heroics, Javier, in fact, might be their best pitcher.\n\nTake out a relief appearance during the American League Division Series, and Javier, as a starting pitcher, has pitched 36 ⅔ consecutive scoreless innings, dating to Sept. 7.\n\nAnd manager Dusty Baker’s decision to yank him when he did will heighten the chance Javier pitches a portion of Game 7, should the Astros require it.\n\n\"It's always tough to take a guy out,\" says Baker, who was the opposing manager when Halladay no-hit the Reds in 2010, \"but you have to weigh the no-hitter and history versus trying to win this game and get back to 2-2 in the World Series.\"\n\nBesides, it was hard to argue with the cavalry that followed Javier and helped combine for 14 strikeouts.\n\nAbreu: Strikeout, strikeout, strikeout of J.T. Realmuto, Bryce Harper and Nick Castellanos.\n\nMontero: Strikeout, flyout and Kyle Tucker's running catch of Jean Segura’s shallow fly ball to end the eighth.\n\nAnd finally, closer Pressly, who struck out Brandon Marsh, walked Kyle Schwarber to break a streak of 18 consecutive batters retired, induced a fly to right from Rhys Hoskins and a grounder to third base from Realmuto, to spark a giddy but muted infield celebration.\n\nBut it was Javier who laid down the spike strips for a Philadelphia Phillies offense that was unbeatable at home and careening through the playoffs in unstoppable fashion.\n\nHe struck out Realmuto and Nick Castellanos three times each and Bryce Harper twice, this one night after Harper kick-started a home run bacchanalia with a two-run homer in Game 3, part of five Phillies longballs that game. After leadoff batter Schwarber sent a charge into Javier’s first pitch, driving it deep to the opposite field, Javier allowed just one ball out of the infield.\n\nOh, and there was that other small matter of evening up this World Series.\n\nIn this do-or-die Game 4, the Astros snapped a 16-inning scoreless streak with a five-run eruption in the fifth inning, as the first five batters reached base, Yordan Alvarez broke a scoreless tie when he was hit by reliever Jose Alvarado’s first pitch and Alex Bregman broke the game open with a two-run double.\n\nIt was a typical evening for this Astros offense in this series, prone to long droughts followed by sudden, impactful rallies. So far, the formula has kept them even in this World Series.\n\nThey’ll have Verlander in a Game 5 that will give one team the edge as the series shifts back to Houston. If it goes to a Game 7, don’t be surprised if Javier takes down an inning or two.\n\nThat’s largely because he stepped aside rather than join Larsen in the history books. A championship ring would make that a worthwhile tradeoff.\n\n\"We grew up watching the World Series,\" says Bregman, who is playing in his fourth Fall Classic. \"We know baseball's been going on for a long, long time. So to be a teammate on a team that did that and what Javy and all the guys did is really special.\n\n\"It's a moment that we'll all cherish forever and we'll all remember forever. It was really awesome.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/11/02/javier-astros-pitch-2nd-no-hitter-in-world-series-history/50897055/", "title": "Javier, Astros pitch 2nd no-hitter in World Series history", "text": "AP\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) — Hammered the night before, Cristian Javier and the Houston Astros desperately needed to figure how to keep Bryce Harper and the Phillies in the ballpark.\n\nHow about a no-hitter, would that do?\n\nJavier and Houston's bullpen combined on just the second no-hitter in World Series history, silencing a booming lineup and boisterous fans as the Astros blanked Philadelphia 5-0 Wednesday night to even the matchup at two games each.\n\n“You get slapped in the face yesterday and you want to come back today and make a statement,” closer Ryan Pressly said.\n\nThe only previous no-hitter in the World Series was a perfect game by Don Larsen of the New York Yankees against the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1956.\n\nFollow every game: Live MLB Scores\n\nJavier and three relievers weren't perfect in Game 4, but they were close.\n\nPlus, they'd done this before: Javier, the starter in a combined no-hitter against the New York Yankees in June, was pulled with a no-hitter in progress after six innings and 97 pitches this time.\n\nBryan Abreu, Rafael Montero and Pressly each followed with a hitless inning for the first combined no-hitter in postseason play. Astros arms totaled 14 strikeouts and three walks in ensuring this year’s championship will be decided this weekend back at Minute Maid Park.\n\nSoon after J.T. Realmuto grounded out to end it, the quartet of pitchers posed with catcher Christian Vázquez near the visiting dugout, each putting a hand on the game ball for a photo. It's a picture no one could've envisioned 24 hours earlier, when Philadelphia clubbed a Series record-tying five home runs in a 7-0 romp in Game 3.\n\n“That’s crazy, man,\" Vázquez said. “It was special.”\n\nThe four pitchers and Vázquez also signed a ball headed to the Hall of Fame.\n\nJavier said his parents predicted Tuesday night he was going to throw a no-hitter. The 25-year-old righty from the Dominican Republic said his father, Cecilio Javier, arrived in the United States on Tuesday, and this was the first time his dad saw him pitch.\n\n“I just came out holding onto God, trying to be positive, trying to attack the strike zone,\" he said via translator. \"Thanks to God I was able to accomplish that.”\n\nIn 2010, Roy Halladay pitched a no-hitter for the Phillies in the NL Division Series, also here at Citizens Bank Park. Halladay's gem came against a Cincinnati team managed by Dusty Baker, Houston's current skipper.\n\n“Oh, yeah, I was on the other end in this ballpark. I mean, that’s what’s strange about life,” Baker said.\n\nWith Larsen and the Houston combo, those are the only three no-hitters in the postseason.\n\nThe closest the Phillies came to a hit was in the third inning, when Kyle Schwarber grounded a hard foul past first base. On fair balls, nothing.\n\n“It’s cool,” Schwarber said, sarcastically. “We’ll be in the history books I guess.”\n\nGame 5 is on Thursday night in Philly. Astros ace Justin Verlander will again chase that elusive first World Series win when he faces Noah Syndergaard.\n\nThey can only hope to pitch as well as Javier.\n\nBy the time Javier exited, the lone hit maker on the Philadelphia side who showed up on the scoreboard was rocker Bruce Springsteen, pictured surrounded by Phillies fans.\n\nAnd a few innings later, as fans started leaving the stadium, there actually were boos for postseason star Harper and the Phillies. First lady Jill Biden, a noted Phillies fan, was among those in the crowd of 45,693 who had little to shout about.\n\n“For me? I mean, a loss is a loss,” Phillies manager Rob Thomson said. “That’s the way I kind of look at it.”\n\nAlex Bregman delivered the big hit Houston hoped for, a two-run double in a five-run fifth inning, and that was plenty for the Astros.\n\nCompletely in charge, Javier struck out nine — including five straight — walked two and hardly allowed any loud contact. He tamed a club that had been 6-0 at home this postseason while hitting 17 home runs.\n\n“New day, new opportunity,” Abreu said. “What happened yesterday stays in the past. Today is a new opportunity.”\n\nOpponents hit only .170 against Javier during the regular season, the lowest mark in baseball among pitchers with at least 130 innings.\n\n“When I first met him he told me he had a disappearing fastball and I’m like, `There is no such thing.’ But I guess so,\" Baker said.\n\nJavier threw 70 fastballs and the Phillies barely touched him.\n\n“I think it’s the best fastball I've ever seen,\" Vázquez said.\n\nVery still on the mound, Javier carved his own quiet spot in the middle of the Phillies’ storm. Backing off onto the grass, straightening his hat, rubbing the ball, taking deep breaths, he proceeded at his own pace.\n\nNext year, Javier won’t be able to work quite this way. Major League Baseball is instituting a pitch clock — 15 seconds to throw with the bases empty, 20 with someone on — and Javier often surpassed those limits on this evening, drawing boos from a crowd eager for action.\n\nThis performance by Javier came a year after Atlanta’s Ian Anderson was taken out after pitching five hitless innings against Houston in the World Series. Pressly permitted the only other Phillies runner, walking Schwarber in the ninth.\n\nPhiladelphia was no-hit by five New York Mets pitchers in April, one of several crushing losses that led to manager Joe Girardi's firing two months later.\n\n“We came back the next day and won,” said Thomson, then the bench coach. “So these guys, they got a short memory.”\n\nThis was the fourth no-hitter of the season — two combos by the Astros, the team job by the Mets and the only individual effort, by Angels rookie Reid Detmers.\n\nMaybe it was the team’s switch to orange tops, or the lucky lunch Baker had at a Philly hoagie spot, but the Astros sure looked different than the previous night, when they got shut out on a feeble five singles.\n\nBlanked for 16 innings, Bregman and the Astros chased Aaron Nola in their big fifth.\n\nHouston’s hits resonated far away, too.\n\nChants of “Let’s go, Astros!” erupted when highlights and the score were shown at the Toyota Center as the Houston Rockets hosted the Los Angeles Clippers in an NBA game.\n\nAnd there figure to be Astros cheers at NRG Stadium in Houston on Thursday night when the Texans take on the Philadelphia Eagles, the NFL’s only unbeaten team, in a matchup that’ll be played at the same time as Game 5.\n\nIt was quiet in Philly, though, as fans who came wanting to see a win were reduced to merely hoping for a hit.\n\nHUNGRY FOR A HOAGIE\n\nWawa encouraged Phillies fans hungry for a Game 4 win to dig in for a bite of their sandwiches during the game. One problem, the popular Pennsylvania-based convenience store chain tweeted of the Phillies an hour before first pitch, “Each time they get a hit, take a bite of your hoagie!”\n\nWawa might have bit off more than it could chew with that tweet.\n\nTwitter fans had a field day at Wawa’s expense.\n\nFamished fans tweeted photos of skeletons next to untouched sandwiches. One snapped a photo of an unwrapped hoagie resting on a pants leg. Others cracked they died of starvation. Some asked what they should do with their stale hoagies.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAstros: Verlander is 0-6 with a 6.07 ERA in eight World Series starts after failing to hold a five-run lead in the opener.\n\nPhillies: RHP Syndergaard had been set to start Game 3 before it was washed out Monday night.

No. 3,000 was Larry Parrish.\n\n1985 — The New York Mets beat the Braves 16-13 in 19 innings at Atlanta. The game went until just before 4 a.m. on July 5, and was followed by a fireworks display for the 10,000 still left in the stands. Keith Hernandez of the Mets hit for the cycle in 10 at-bats. The score was tied 8-8 after innings. Both teams scored two runs apiece in the 13th. The Mets scored a run in the 18th to take an 11-10 lead, but Braves pitcher Rick Camp tied the score with a homer. Camp then gave up five runs in the top the 19th. Ron Darling, the seventh Mets pitcher, closed the game giving up two runs.\n\n2000 — St. Louis' Keith McDonald homered in his first major league at-bat as the Cardinals defeated Cincinnati 14-3.\n\n2006 — Victor Martinez went 5-for-6 and Jhonny Peralta and Travis Hafner each hit two of Cleveland's six home runs, powering the Indians to a 19-1 rout of New York. The win was Cleveland's largest at home in more than 56 years, since a 21-2 victory over the Philadelphia Athletics on June 18, 1950.\n\n2006 — Jose Contreras tossed 6 2-3 scoreless innings to win his 17th straight decision and lead the White Sox to a 13-0 victory over Baltimore.\n\n2008 — Colorado homered six times to rally from a nine-run deficit for the biggest comeback in franchise history and an 18-17 victory over Florida.

San Diego took a 2-0 lead into the ninth but Robert Suarez – who was making his major league debut – walked the first two batters he faced and then hit Carson Kelly with a pitch to load the bases.\n\nStammen entered and immediately threw a wild pitch that scored Christian Walker to make it 2-1. And then Beer, in just his 13th big league at-bat, crushed a breaking ball that gave the Diamondbacks a comeback victory on National Beer Day in the United States.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nAstros win 10th straight Opening Day game\n\nFramber Valdez outpitched Shohei Ohtani with 6 ⅔ innings of two-hit ball, and the Houston Astros tied the longest opening day winning streak in major league history with a 3-1 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Thursday night.\n\nOhtani struck out nine while pitching one-run ball into the fifth inning for the Angels, who lost their season opener for the eighth time in nine years. Last season’s AL MVP went 0 for 4 at the plate while taking advantage of baseball’s offseason rule change allowing him to remain the designated hitter after he finishes pitching.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nMets beat Nationals behind Tylor Megill\n\nMark Canha and Starling Marte – two products of the Mets’ quarter-billion dollar offseason spending spree – drove in runs to back five shutout innings from Tylor Megill, Jacob deGrom’s fill-in as the opening day starter, and New York won manager Buck Showalter’s debut 5-1 against the Washington Nationals on Thursday night.\n\nThings took a scary turn for the Mets in the top of the ninth inning Thursday night when Pete Alonso was hit up near the face on a pitch by Nationals reliever Nate Thompson.\n\nAlonso's helmet went flying as he hit the ground, but he popped up and was headed to first before being pulled back toward the dugout by manager Buck Showalter. The pitch glanced off his shoulder first and hit the C-flap on his helmet.\n\n\"All good, just a busted lip,\" Alonso said after the game. \"That’s it. I’ve got all my teeth, no concussion, I’m all good.\"\n\n– Andrew Tredinnick, Associated Press\n\nYu Darvish holds D'backs hitless through six\n\nPadres right-hander Yu Darvish held the Arizona Diamondbacks hitless through six innings with four walks and three strikeouts – but his night came to an end after 92 pitches.\n\nTim Hill relieved Darvish and gave up a leadoff single to Pavin Smith in the bottom of the seventh, ending the bid for a team no-no.\n\nJoe Musgrove threw a no-hitter for San Diego in 2021, the first in franchise history.\n\nShohei Ohtani dazzles in 2022 debut\n\nReigning AL MVP Shohei Ohtani got the Opening Day start for the Angels and racked up nine strikeouts in 4 ⅔ innings against the Astros, giving up one earned run. Ohtani struck Houston second baseman Jose Altuve out three times but left the game trailing 1-0.\n\nThanks to MLB's new Shohei Ohtani Rule, Ohtani was able to stay in the game as the designated hitter after his night ended on the mound.\n\nReds spoil Braves' World Series celebration\n\nIt was supposed to be a party for the sold-out crowd of 40,545 at Truist Park. It was a chance to remember Atlanta’s unlikely run to a title last year and a coronation for one of the National League’s top contenders this season. New addition Matt Olson received a standing ovation in his first at-bat.\n\nTyler Mahle and the Reds had different plans. Mahle didn’t allow an earned run across five innings, striking out seven, and he helped spoil the party in a 6-3 victory over the defending World Series champions. Brandon Drury hit a three-run homer in the sixth inning as the Reds totaled 10 hits.\n\n– Bobby Nightengale\n\nBobby Witt Jr.'s first hit wins it for the Royals\n\nMaking his big-league debut Thursday, Bobby Witt Jr. hit a go-ahead double in the eighth inning to lift Kansas City to a 3-1 win over the Cleveland Guardians.\n\nWitt, one of the top prospects in baseball, started at third base for the Royals and had gone hitless in his first three at-bats until his extra-base hit against Triston McKenzie.\n\n“You couldn’t have scripted that any better,” Royals manager Mike Matheny said after the game. “This isn’t one he’s going to forget, and I probably won’t, either.”\n\nScott Barlow worked around trouble in the ninth inning to finish off the Royals' win.\n\nWITT Q&A: Royals phenom talks new position, 'boss' Patrick Mahomes\n\n100 NAMES TO KNOW: Young players to watch in 2022\n\nTyler O'Neill homers for St. Louis\n\nCardinals left fielder Tyler O'Neill's first home run of the season was a three-run shot in the second inning of the opener against the Pittsburgh Pirates. The homer gave St. Louis a 4-0 lead an inning after O'Neill had opened the scoring with an RBI single\n\nO'Neill finished eighth in NL MVP voting and won his second Gold Glove in 2021, hitting 34 homers with 15 steals and a .912 OPS.\n\nNico Hoerner puts Cubs ahead\n\nChicago shortstop Nico Hoerner hit a two-run home run in the fifth inning against reigning NL Cy Young winner Corbin Burnes, giving the Cubs a 3-1 lead in their season opener.\n\nMilwaukee scored the first run of the 2022 season in the fourth, on an RBI groundout by Lorenzo Cain. Hoerner's go-ahead homer came after Patrick Wisdom's sac fly tied it up.\n\nAlbert Pujols gets a standing ovation in Cardinals return\n\nPlaying his first game for the Cardinals since 2011, Albert Pujols got a standing ovation from the crowd in St. Louis on Opening Day. Pujols, 42, was the starting designated hitter, batting fifth for the Cardinals.\n\nSeiya Suzuki gets first big-league hit\n\nThe Cubs inked Japanese star Seiya Suzuki to a five-year, $85 million contract in March and the 27-year-old made his debut Thursday, starting in right field and batting sixth for Chicago.\n\nSuzuki drew a walk in his first big-league plate appearance (second inning) and then singled leading off the bottom of the fifth against Corbin Burnes.\n\nXander Bogaerts, Red Sox couldn't get extension done\n\nBoston shortstop Xander Bogaerts can opt out of his contract after this season and said Thursday that he and the team weren't going to get an extension done before Opening Day.\n\nBogaerts is entering the third year of a six-year, $120 million contract that he signed with the Red Sox at the beginning of 2019. If he opts out, the 29-year-old would be one of the top players available on the free agent market.\n\nKe'Bryan Hayes, Pirates agree on big extension\n\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates are set to issue the largest contract in franchise history, agreeing to an eight-year, $70 million extension with third baseman Ke'Bryan Hayes ahead of the 2022 season opener.\n\nJason Kendall's six-year, $60 million deal signed in 2000(!) had been Pittsburgh's biggest contract to date.\n\nHayes burst onto the scene in 2020, batting .376 in 24 games to earn Rookie of the Year votes, but wrist injuries limited him to 96 games last season.\n\nOpening Day tickets easy to find; rain delays other games\n\nOf the seven openers on Thursday, just two – Astros-Angels at Anaheim and Pirates-Cardinals at St. Louis – are sold out. The Atlanta Braves, the defending World Series champions, have standing room only tickets available for both Thursday’s opener and Friday and Saturday’s games against Cincinnati.\n\nThe weather also hasn’t cooperated, with rainy conditions already booting the Red Sox-Yankees opener in the Bronx and the Twins’ game against Seattle to Friday. Fortunately for all teams involved, those games were regularly scheduled home openers and will utilize Friday rain dates to get the games in - though that still didn't guarantee a full house.\n\n– Gabe Lacques\n\nPadres, Twins make opening day trade\n\nThe Minnesota Twins acquired right-handed pitchers Chris Paddack and Emilio Pagán from the San Diego Padres for All-Star left-handed pitcher Taylor Rogers and outfielder Brent Rooker.\n\nThe Twins also will receive a player to be named later and the Padres will get $6.6 million in cash under terms of the deal announced Thursday.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nAfter ugly winter, Rob Manfred is 'thrilled' to get 2022 started\n\nMajor League Baseball players openly chastised him. Frustrated fans solely blamed him. He was a living piñata for the media.\n\nMLB commissioner Rob Manfred might have been the most hated man in all of sports during the 99-day lockout.\n\nHere we are, with Opening Day arriving a week late on Thursday, and a day even later for the latest chapter of the New York Yankees-Boston Red Sox rivalry. Their season-opener, with Manfred scheduled to be in attendance, was postponed until Friday at Yankee Stadium.\n\n“I have never anticipated a season as much as this one,’’ Manfred told USA TODAY Sports in a wide-ranging interview. “I think given the last two seasons, the idea of having normal, unrestricted fans in the ballpark is a really exciting thing for me.\n\n“I can’t wait for this one to get going.’’\n\n– Bob Nightengale", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/baseball/iowa-cubs/2018/04/07/chicago-cubs-white-sox-iowa-cubs-minor-league-kris-bryant-anthony-rizzo-ryne-sandberg-greg-maddux/487799002/", "title": "The biggest names in 50 years of minor league baseball in Des ...", "text": "When it comes to the Iowa Cubs, fans are always looking ahead. That's the nature of Minor League baseball. They want to know which player on Chicago’s Triple-A roster could be the next one helping the big league club win games.\n\nWell, with Iowa celebrating its 50th season of Triple-A baseball in Des Moines in 2018, we decided to take a look back. The Register, in a nod to this historic occasion, compiled our all-time team from the last half-century here.\n\nOur list is based off a traditional 25-man roster. It's made up of former Iowa Cubs and Iowa Oaks, the former Triple-A affiliate in Des Moines from 1969-2017, over the last 50 years. And we passed over players who just made rehab stints in town.\n\nWe had plenty of help too. This list was compiled with the help of Iowa chairman/principal owner Michael Gartner, president/general manager Sam Bernabe, vice-president/assistant general manager Randy Wehofer and Register columnist Randy Peterson, who previously covered the team.\n\nThe team includes a manager, a starting rotation, including a No. 1 starter, relief pitchers and bench players.\n\nManager: Ryne Sandberg\n\nSandberg came up with the Philadelphia Phillies but was traded to the Cubs, where he became one of the greatest second basemen of all time. It was here that he got his first shot at managing in the minor leagues. As a player, “Ryno” was a nine-time Gold Glover and 10-time All-Star. Sandberg did some of his best work with his glove, tallying a .989 fielding percentage. He was the National League’s MVP in 1984 and elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2005. When he was done playing, he embarked on a managerial career that brought him to Des Moines for one summer, when he was named the Pacific Coast League’s 2010 Manager of the Year.\n\nIowa Cubs stats: 82-62 record as manager.\n\nMLB stats: Player: 16 seasons, 285 batting average, 403 doubles, 282 home runs. Manager: 3 seasons, 119-159 record.\n\nMORE IOWA CUBS:\n\nThe starters\n\nCatcher: Joe Girardi\n\nGirardi put together a lengthy career as a player and as a manager. As a player, he was an All-Star and three-time World Series champion. As a skipper, he was the 2006 National League Manager of the Year and guided the New York Yankees to a World Series title in 2009. In 11 seasons as a big-league manager, Girardi has compiled a 988-794 record with the Yankees and Miami Marlins. But before all that, he was a catcher in Iowa who honed his hitting skills by having his future wife toss tube socks to him in their Des Moines apartment.\n\nIowa Cubs stats: 44 games, .240, 5 doubles, 2 home runs.\n\nMLB career stats: 15 seasons, .267 batting average, 186 doubles, 36 home runs.\n\nFirst baseman: Rafael Palmeiro\n\nPalmeiro is one of the most productive and controversial players in the game. He was a four-time All-Star, three-time Gold Glove winner, smashed more than 500 home runs and tallied over 3,000 hits. But after emphatically denying to Congress that he used steroids, Palmeiro failed a test and has been marred by it ever since.\n\nIowa Cubs stats: 57 games, .299 batting average, 14 doubles, 11 home runs.\n\nMLB stats: 20 seasons, .288 batting average, 585 doubles, 569 home runs.\n\nSecond basemen: Tony LaRussa\n\nLaRussa spent parts of six seasons in the big leagues, but that’s not how he made his mark. What LaRussa is known for is his work as a manager. In 33 big-league seasons, he won three World Series titles, four Manager of the Year awards, and tallied 2,758 career wins. He did it both with Iowa, first as a second baseman and later as a skipper in Des Moines. LaRussa was even the starting second baseman on Opening Day in Iowa's first Triple-A season in 1969.\n\nIowa Cubs stats: Player: 224 games, .277 batting average, 32 doubles, 12 home runs. Manager: 69-67 record.\n\nMLB career stats: Player: 6 seasons, .199 batting average. Manager: 33 seasons, 2,758-2,365 record.\n\nShortstop: Shawon Dunston\n\nDunston was selected by the Cubs as the first overall pick in the 1982 draft. He lived up to some of the hype with a lengthy major league career, averaging .267 in 12 seasons with the Cubs. He was the everyday shortstop for most of his career. He ended up with stops at the San Francisco Giants, St. Louis Cardinals, New York Mets, Pittsburgh Pirates and the Cleveland Indians.\n\nIowa Cub stats: 139 games, .259 batting average, 21 doubles, 9 home runs.\n\nMLB career: 18 years, .269 batting average, 292 doubles, 150 home runs.\n\nThird base: Kris Bryant\n\nBryant hasn’t been in the big leagues long, but he’s already made a big mark. A first-round pick by the Cubs in 2013, Bryant rapidly rose to the majors, where he quickly became a star. He’s already a two-time All-Star, Rookie of the Year winner and MVP. And in 2016, he helped the Cubs snap the curse with a World Series title. Bryant’s first full minor league season included a 70-game stint in Iowa and ended with him being named USA Today’s Minor League Player of the Year. He started the 2015 season in the minors but was there so briefly that he didn’t even play in a home game in Iowa that year.\n\nIowa Cub stats: 77 games, .298 batting average, 15 doubles, 24 home runs.\n\nMLB career stats: 4 seasons, .288 batting average, 107 doubles and 95 home runs (as of Thursday morning).\n\nOutfield: Joe Carter\n\nCarter belted one of the biggest home runs in baseball history when he smashed a walk-off home run to win the World Series for the Toronto Blue Jays in 1993. But Carter did more than that: He was a five-time All-Star, two-time World Series champion and the American League’s RBI leader in 1986. During his first stint with Iowa, he hit .307 and belted 22 home runs in 124 games.\n\nIowa Cub stats: 185 games, .308 batting average, 39 doubles, 36 home runs.\n\nMLB career stats: 16 seasons, .259 batting average, 432 doubles, 396 home runs.\n\nOutfield: Manny Ramirez\n\nRamirez was one of baseball’s most successful, entertaining and controversial figures. He was a two-time World Series champion, nine-time Silver Slugger Award winner and 12-time All-Star. Ramirez’s oddball antics, known as “Manny being Manny,” also made him a memorable figure. But a lot of that is overshadowed by his alleged cheating, which led to multiple run-ins for using performance-enhancing drugs. That's what he was mostly known for by the time he joined Iowa as a player/coach in 2014. Ramirez did play, but was used mostly to help mentor some of Iowa's young players.\n\nIowa Cub stats: 24 games, .222 batting average, 2 doubles, 3 home runs.\n\nMLB stats: 19 seasons, .312, 547 doubles, 555 home runs.\n\nOutfield: Harold Baines\n\nBaines was the first overall pick in the 1977 draft and went on to put together a long, productive and mostly underrated big-league career that spanned over two decades. He was a six-time All-Star, a Silver Slugger winner and was a coach on the Chicago White Sox’s 2005 World Series title team. Baines had just one season in Iowa on his way to the majors.\n\nIowa Oaks stats: 125 games, .298 batting average, 25 doubles, 22 home runs.\n\nMLB stats: 22 seasons, .289, 488 doubles, 384 home runs.\n\nPitcher: Greg Maddux\n\nMaddux is arguably the most successful player to ever wear an Iowa uniform. With his pinpoint control, Maddux became a 300-game winner. Maddux also won the Cy Young Award four times, was an eight-time All-Star and 18-time Gold Glove Award winner. In 2014, he garnered 97.2 percent of the votes and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first time on the ballot. Maddux made his first appearance in Iowa when he went 10-1 with a 3.02 ERA in 18 starts.\n\nIowa Cubs stats: 22 games, 13-1 record, 2.65 ERA, 87 strikeouts.\n\nMLB stats: 23 seasons, 355-227 record, 3.16 ERA, 3,371 strikeouts.\n\nThe rest of the rotation\n\nKerry Wood\n\nWood was a hard-throwing right-hander and the fourth overall pick in the 1995 draft by the Cubs. He broke onto the scene in 1998, when, in just his fifth career start, he threw a one-hitter and tied a Major League record with 20 strikeouts against the Houston Astros. Wood went on to win the National League Rookie of the Year that season and became a two-time All-Star. But injuries plagued him over the years and, stopping at Iowa during his rise through the minors, he became a regular in Des Moines for rehab starts that still rank among the biggest draws in team history.\n\nIowa Cubs stats: 17 games, 6-3 record, 4.03 ERA, 123 strikeouts.\n\nMLB stats: 14 seasons, 80-68 record, 3.67 ERA, 1,582 strikeouts.\n\nVida Blue\n\nThe southpaw was one of the best in his era. Blue was a six-time All-Star and three-time World Series champion. He won at least 20 games in a season three times, including the 1971 season, when he tallied 24 victories and earned himself American League MVP and Cy Young Award honors. Blue also tossed a no-hitter in 1970 and was part of a combined one in 1975.\n\nIowa Oaks stats: 17 games, 12-3 record, 2.17 ERA, 165 strikeouts.\n\nMLB stats: 17 seasons, 209-161, 3.27 ERA, 2,175 strikeouts.\n\nJake Arrieta\n\nArrieta was originally a prized prospect with the Baltimore Orioles but didn’t take off until he was traded to the Cubs. In 2015, he led all of baseball with 22 wins, including a no-hitter. The success earned him National League Cy-Young Award honors. A season later, he fired his second no-hitter, was named an All-Star and helped the Cubs to a World Series title.\n\nIowa Cubs stats: 7 games, 2-2 record, 3.56 ERA, 38 strikeouts.\n\nMLB stats: 8 seasons, 88-56 record, 3.57 ERA, 1,070 strikeouts (as of Thursday morning).\n\nHideo Nomo\n\nNomo was a trendsetter, star and to most people, a forgotten member of the Iowa Cubs. He became the first Japanese major leaguer to permanently relocate to the United State when he debuted with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1995. His quirky windup helped him become an All-Star and National League Rookie of the Year winner in 1995. Nomo also fired off two no-hitters. He did a brief stint with Iowa when the Cubs gave him several starts with Iowa to see where he was before Nomo declined to continue on in the minors.\n\nIowa Cubs stats: 3 games, 1-1 record, 3.71 ERA, 18 strikeouts.\n\nMLB stats: 12 seasons, 123-109 record, 4.24 ERA, 1,918 strikeouts.\n\nCloser: Goose Gossage\n\nGossage was one of the first big-time closers in baseball and among the best relievers to ever play in the big leagues. He was a World Series winner in 1978, led the league in saves three times, was a nine-time All-Star and inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008. During the 1980 season, Gossage compiled 33 saves and tallied a microscopic 2.27 ERA.\n\nIowa Oaks stats: 12 games, 5-4 record, 3.68 ERA, 1 save, 66 strikeouts.\n\nMLB stats: 22 seasons, 124-107 record, 3.01 ERA, 310 saves, 1,502 strikeouts.\n\nThe bullpen\n\nMark Prior\n\nPrior came up as one of the biggest prospects in baseball when the Cubs selected him in the second round of the 2001 draft. He rapidly rose through the minors, won 18 games in 2003 and was named an All-Star that season. Injuries hampered him for the rest of his career and forced him to make multiple rehab assignments with Iowa, which became must-see events at the park.\n\nIowa Cubs stats: 6 games, 2-2 record, 2.64 ERA, 51 strikeouts.\n\nMLB stats: 5 seasons, 42-29 record, 3.51 ERA, 757 strikeouts.\n\nRod Beck\n\nNicknamed “Shooter,” Beck was a successful closer and a fan-favorite in Des Moines as he became a national story. On the field, he was a three-time All-Star and the 1994 National League Rolaids Relief Man award winner. Off the field, he made friends around Iowa and headlines around the country when he lived in a camper outside Iowa’s stadium and opened it up to fans after games to drink with him.\n\nIowa Cub stats: 23 games, 1-1 record, 0.56 ERA, 4 saves, 28 strikeouts.\n\nMLB stats: 13 seasons, 38-45 record, 3.30 ERA, 286 saves.\n\nCarlos Zambrano\n\nZambrano was as electric as he was entertaining. The right-hander was a three-time All-Star and three-time Silver Slugger Award winner. His 16 wins were the most in the National League. Two years later, he fired off a no-hitter on Sept. 14, 2008. His fierce attitude caused him run-ins on the field but also made him a fan-favorite as well.\n\nIowa Cubs stats: 66 games, 12-10 record, 3.80 ERA, 215 strikeouts.\n\nMLB stats: 12 seasons, 132-91 record, 3.66 ERA, 1,637 strikeouts.\n\nJamie Moyer\n\nThe southpaw became one of the most durable pitchers in baseball history. In fact, Moyer is one of only 29 players in baseball history to have appeared in major league games in four decades. He had plenty of success along the way. Moyer was an All-Star in 2003 and helped the Philadelphia Phillies to a World Series title in 2008.\n\nIowa Cubs stats: 6 games, 3-2 record, 2.55 ERA, 25 strikeouts.\n\nMLB stats: 25 seasons, 265-209 record, 4.25 ERA, 2,441 strikeouts.\n\nThe bench\n\nFirst base: Mark Grace\n\nGrace was a fan-favorite and one of the most productive first basemen in Cubs history. He was a three-time All-Star and four-time Gold Glove Award winner. His single in the bottom of the ninth inning off Yankees closer Mariano Rivera helped the Arizona Diamondbacks to a come-from-behind victory in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series.\n\nMLB stats: 16 seasons, .303 batting average, 511 doubles, 173 home runs.\n\nIowa Cubs stats: 21 games, .254 batting average, 4 doubles.\n\nFirst base: Anthony Rizzo\n\nRizzo was one of the centerpieces behind the Cubs’ resurgence after Chicago acquired him in a trade with the San Diego Padres in 2012. The Cubs started him in Iowa and he rediscovered his swing in Des Moines. When the Cubs eventually brought him up, he went on to become a Gold Glove winner, three-time All-Star and a main part of the team’s 2016 World Series title team.\n\nIowa Cubs stats: 70 games, .342 batting average, 18 doubles, 23 home runs.\n\nMLB stats: 8 seasons, .267 batting average, 204 doubles, 167 home runs (as of Thursday morning).\n\nOutfield: Karl \"Tuffy\" Rhodes\n\nRhodes belted arguably the biggest home run in franchise history when his extra-inning shot gave the Iowa Cubs a walk-off victory to win the American Association championship in 1993. The following season, he smashed three home runs on opening day.

Then the American League's top team went a step further by acquiring two top pitchers from the Oakland Athletics as they make a push for their first World Series title since 2009.\n\nWhat other deals could be made as the countdown to the deadline continues? USA TODAY Sports will provide updates on all the key trades.\n\nFOLLOW ON TUESDAY:Live updates on rumors, deals; will Juan Soto get traded?\n\nFollow every game: Live MLB Scores\n\nOPINION:Yankees are making it clear at trade deadline: World Series or bust\n\nANALYSIS:Brewers believe they can still win without All-Star closer Josh Hader\n\nBraves get Jake Odorizzi, Robbie Grossman\n\nThe Atlanta Braves stayed busy late Monday night, adding two more veteran players.\n\nThe Braves are reportedly adding veteran right-handed Jake Odorizzi in a trade with the Houston Astros and outfielder Robbie Grossman in a deal with the Detroit Tigers.\n\nThe Braves are sending veteran left-hander Will Smith to the Astros. Odorizzi, an 11-year major-league vet, was in his second season with the Astros, with whom he posted a 4-3 record and 3.75 ERA in 12 starts. Smith, meanwhile, has appeared in 41 games out of the bullpen this season, compiling a 4.38 ERA.\n\nGrossman hit a career-high 23 home runs in 2021, but has struggled to replicate that power outage this season.\n\nBrewers continue to add to bullpen\n\nHours after acquiring left-handed reliever Taylor Rogers from the San Diego Padres in the Josh Hader trade, the Milwaukee Brewers are getting right-handed reliever Matt Bush from the Texas Rangers. The Rangers will receive infielder Mark Mathias and minor league pitcher Antoine Kelly in the deal. In 40 appearances this season, Bush has a 2.95 ERA and 1.009 WHIP.\n\nCardinals get pitching help from Pirates\n\nBadly in need of starting pitching, the St. Louis Cardinals are making a deal with a division rival to help their rotation. The Cardinals are reportedly finalizing a deal to acquire left-hander Jose Quintana from the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 20 games as a starter with the NL Central's worst team, Quintana posted a 3-5 record and a 3.50 ERA, striking out 89 and walking 31.\n\nSox (both Red and White) get busy\n\nThe Boston Red Sox quickly get a catcher to replace Christian Vazquez, making a deal with the Chicago White Sox. Chicago sends catcher Reese McGuire to Boston for left-handed reliever Jake Diekman.\n\nVeteran outfielder Tommy Pham is also reportedly headed to the Boston Red Sox for a player to be named later. Once the deal is complete, this will be Pham's fifth team in the last five seasons\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks acquire third baseman Emmanuel Rivera from the Kansas City Royals for pitcher Luke Weaver.\n\nBraves lock up another young star\n\nThe Atlanta Braves signed All-Star third baseman Austin Riley to a 10-year, $212 million deal, the team announced.\n\nThe contract runs through the 2032 season with a 2033 club option for $20 million. Next season, the 25-year-old will make $15 million, $21 million in 2024 and $22 million for the rest of the contract.\n\nRiley is hitting .301 with 29 home runs and 68 RBI this season for Atlanta, who are three games back of the New York Mets in the NL East. Eleven of his home runs came in July, and he had a franchise record 26 extra base hits in the month, breaking a 60-year old record.\n\nAL contenders continue to wheel and deal\n\nThe Yankees, owners of the league’s best record, were always going to be a buyer at the trade deadline. It started with Andrew Benitendi on Thursday, continued Monday afternoon with the acquisition of right-hander Scott Effross and really ramped up a few hours later.\n\nNow they are acquiring right-handers Frankie Montas and Lou Trivino from the Oakland Athletics, according to ESPN.\n\nMontas will join the Yanks’ starting rotation, while Trivino will provide New York with another bullpen option. The A's will get left-handers Ken Waldichuk and J.P. Sears, right-hander Luis Medina and second baseman Cooper Bowman.\n\nThe Houston Astros, who begin the week two games back of the Yankees in the AL standings, traded for 1B/OF Trey Mancini from the Baltimore Orioles and right hander Jayden Murray from the Tampa Bay Rays. Mancini is hitting .268 with 10 home runs and 41 RBI in 92 games. The Orioles receive RHP Chayce McDermott from the Astros and Tampa Bay gets outfielder Jose Siri from Houston.\n\nThe reigning AL champions also acquired catcher Christian Vázquez from the Boston Red Sox. Vazquez, 31, spent eight seasons with the Red Sox and is hitting .282 with eight home runs and 42 RBI in 2022. Boston will receive prospects Enmanuel Valdez and Wilyer Abreu, the 28th- and 29th-ranked prospects in the Astros organization.\n\nBrewers deal closer Josh Hader to Padres\n\nWe finally have our first blockbuster deal of this year's trade deadline. Two National League playoff contenders have swapped closers as part of a five-player trade.\n\nThe San Diego Padres get four-time All-Star closer Josh Hader from the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for erstwhile closer Taylor Rogers, right-hander Dinelson Lamet, speedy outfielder Esteury Ruiz and pitching prospect Robert Gasser.\n\n\"The players we are receiving in this trade help ensure that the future of the Milwaukee Brewers remains bright while not compromising our desire and expectation to win today,\" said Brewers president of baseball operations David Stearns. \"This mix of present Major League talent and high-level prospects furthers our aim to get as many bites of the apple as possible and, ultimately, to bring a World Series to Milwaukee.\"\n\nHader solidifies the back of the Padres bullpen for the stretch run after Rogers was just moved out of the closer's role. Meanwhile, setup man and 2020 NL rookie of the year Devin Williams figures to slide into the closer spot in Milwaukee.\n\nHader leads the majors with 29 saves. Rogers is second with 28.\n\nNow, after acquiring Hader and re-signing ace Joe Musgrove (see below) ... will the Padres make another major move and go after Soto?\n\nRoyals acquire reliever Anthony Misiewicz\n\nThe Kansas City Royals acquired left-hander Anthony Misiewicz from the Seattle Mariners for cash considerations Monday.\n\nThe 27-year-old Misiewicz, who will be added to the Royals’ 40-man roster and optioned to Class AAA Omaha, appeared in 17 games for Seattle this season with a 4.61 ERA. He was optioned to Triple-A Tacoma on June 10, where he had a 3.65 ERA in 13 appearances.\n\nMisiewicz made his big league debut in 2020 and led Seattle in appearances in each of his first two seasons, including a career-best 66 last season, when his 19 holds ranked eighth in the American League.\n\n-- The Associated Press\n\nRays pick up a bullpen arm from Dodgers\n\nNot every trade can be a headline-grabber. The Tampa Bay Rays are masters at adding on the margins and they may be looking to do just that with the acquisition of lefty reliever Garrett Cleavinger from the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nCleavinger, 28, posted a 2.79 ERA in 29 innings at Class AAA Oklahoma City this season, but gave up five earned runs in 4 1/3 innings with the Dodgers. He also previously appeared in the majors in 2021 with L.A. and 2020 with Philadelphia.\n\nMinor league outfielder German Tapia goes to the Dodgers in exchange. To clear roster space for Cleavinger, the Rays released right-hander Luke Bard.\n\nWhat the Juan Soto sweepstakes should look like\n\nWith barely a day remaining to determine Juan Soto’s fate – move to a contender at Major League Baseball’s trade deadline, or draw walks in baseball purgatory for two more months – the field for his services seems to narrow.\n\nIt can be argued that the opposite should be happening.\n\nWith two full seasons and this upcoming playoff drive available to clubs aiming to acquire the Washington Nationals slugger, it’s the usual suspects, fitting a specific profile, in play for Soto. Bigger-spending, bigger-market clubs with flush farm systems are indeed the publicly-known players, with the Los Angeles Dodgers, San Diego Padres and St. Louis Cardinals certainly among the finalists.\n\nYet we can spot many more clubs that should strongly consider trading for Soto, even if many lack the prospect goods to acquire this 23-year-old hitting savant.\n\nHere’s a look at what we think good, healthy competition for this generation’s Ted Williams might look like.\n\n-- Gabe Lacques\n\nPadres re-sign Joe Musgrove\n\nBefore the San Diego Padres made the move to acquire Josh Hader, they made a major financial commitment to one of their own players.\n\nRight-hander Joe Musgrove has agreed to a five-year, $100 million contract extension with the team.\n\nThe deal makes perfect sense. Musgrove is a native of San Diego and has been the team's best pitcher this season with an 8-4 record and 2.65 ERA in 16 starts. Last season, Musgrove pitched the first and (so far) only no-hitter in Padres history.\n\nYankees bolster bullpen, add Scott Effross from Cubs\n\nWith All-Star closer Clay Holmes not quite the infallible weapon he was before the All-Star break, the New York Yankees added bullpen depth by acquiring right-handed reliever Scott Effross from the Chicago Cubs for 24-year-old pitching prospect Hayden Wesneski.\n\nEffross, 28, has a 2.66 ERA in 47 appearances (with one save) for the Cubs, and was seen as a possible closer candidate if they traded David Robertson.\n\nInstead, the side-arming Effross is traded first as the deadline enters its home stretch.\n\nNationals make a trade! Just not that one.\n\nIt wasn't a Juan Soto blockbuster that has the MLB world on edge, but the Washington Nationals did open Monday's trading with a minor deal.\n\nThe Nats sent utility infielder Ehire Adrianza to the Atlanta Braves for minor league outfielder Trey Harris. Atlanta opened up a roster spot earlier by designating Robinson Cano for assignment.\n\nAdrianza was a nice contributor to the Braves' 2021 title run when he hit .247 with a .728 OPS. However, he struggled with the Nationals this year, hitting just .179 with no home runs.\n\nHarris, 26, was Atlanta's minor league hitter of the year in 2019. He was hitting .233/.333/.317 in 59 games this season for Class AA Mississippi.\n\nUnder-the-radar trade candidates\n\nFrom Nightengale's Notebook, USA TODAY Sports' subscriber-only MLB feature:\n\nOutfielder Trey Mancini, Orioles: The Orioles shouldn’t trade him. He means too much to the organization and this is a team that has stunned everyone by hovering around .500. Yet, baseball is a cold-hearted business.\n\nStarting pitcher Noah Syndergaard, Angels: He no longer blows away hitters with his fastball. He’s not considered an ace or even a No. 2 pitcher. But, oh, has he learned to pitch with his off-speed stuff. He’d be a nice No. 3 starter for any contender.\n\nStarting pitcher Jose Urquidy, Astros: The Astros are so deep that they don’t really need him. He has a career 3.66 ERA, is eligible for arbitration for the first time this winter, and has postseason experience, too. He is being offered in package deals for a slugger.\n\n– Bob Nightengale, USA TODAY Sports\n\nJacob deGrom will make 2022 debut on deadline day\n\nJacob deGrom is set to return to the mound for the Mets on Tuesday against the Nationals after more than a year away from the major league mound.\n\n\"It’s been a long time. This has been a pretty slow process of coming back,\" deGrom said. \"I’m excited to be out there. The nerves haven’t really set in yet. I’m sure Tuesday I’ll be pretty nervous. I have a feeling it’s going to feel like my debut.\"\n\nThe two-time Cy Young winner has not pitched in a regular-season game since July 7, 2021, after forearm tightness evolved into a ulnar collateral ligament sprain that kept him out for the remainder of the 2021 season.\n\n\"You want to be out there playing,\" deGrom said. \"Every day you’re able to put this uniform, I’m thankful for. It’s been a while since I’ve been able to get out there and compete. I’m ready. It’s exciting. I’m ready to help these guys.\"\n\n– Andrew Tredinnick, NorthJersey.com\n\nBrandon Drury's breakout year makes him a top trade target\n\nCincinnati Reds slugger Brandon Drury carries a lot of value as a right-handed power bat who can play anywhere in the infield and in the corner outfield spots.\n\nHe’s one of nine MLB players with at least 20 homers and 20 doubles, joining a list of sluggers that includes Paul Goldschmidt, Austin Riley, José Ramírez and Vladimir Guerrero.\n\n“It’s definitely a little bit different because it could be a whole new clubhouse in a matter of a day,” said Drury, who has been traded three times in his career. “It’s definitely on my mind a little bit, but at the end of the day, whether I’m here or somewhere else, I get to keep playing baseball. That’s all I can control.”\n\n– Bobby Nightengale, Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nRelief market loses potential trade chip\n\nOne current closer who definitely will not be traded at the deadline is Daniel Bard of the Colorado Rockies. Bard, who has a 3-3 record with 21 saves and a 1.91 ERA in 37 games this season, signed a two-year extension on Saturday that will keep him in Colorado through the 2024 season.\n\nAmong the closers who could possibly be dealt before Tuesday's deadline are: the Orioles' Jorge Lopez, the Tigers' Gregory Soto, the Marlins' Tanner Scott, the Pirates' David Bednar and the Cubs' David Robertson.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/06/23/this-date-in-baseball/50408011/", "title": "This Date in Baseball", "text": "AP\n\nJune 28\n\n1910 — Joe Tinker of the Chicago Cubs became the first major leaguer to steal home twice in the same game, an 11-1 win over Cincinnati.\n\n1919 — Carl Mays of Boston pitched two complete games against the New York Yankees.

Pfizer’s vaccine candidate is administered to pregnant women who then make antibodies that cross the placenta and protect the baby after birth.\n\n“The [study data monitoring committee] recommended, based on the data that we have, that we should go ahead and file, that this offers the potential for a safe and effective vaccine that could really dramatically help to prevent RSV during the winter season,” Dr. William Gruber, Pfizer’s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, told CNN.\n\nIn the trial, the vaccine was given to pregnant people and appeared to be about 80% effective at preventing severe RSV disease in their infants in the first three months of life. It also cut a baby’s risk of needing to see a doctor for an RSV infection by half.\n\nPotential for first new product in decades\n\nIf approved, Pfizer’s inoculation will be the first against RSV and the first new product related to the infection in over two decades.\n\nIn March, the FDA designated Pfizer’s RSV vaccine a breakthrough therapy, a status that speeds its review.\n\n“That puts us in a very good position to essentially have something well in advance of next winter,” Gruber said, noting that both Pfizer and the FDA are conscious of the ongoing heavy RSV season in the US.\n\n“It will be up to them whether or not they can think of any other path that could allow this to come sooner,” he said.\n\nPfizer’s vaccine contains the virus’ F-protein, the site that it uses to attach to human cells. The protein is frozen into the shape it folds into before it fuses with a cell, so the immune system can build antibodies against it. Pfizer’s RSV vaccine is bivalent, containing F-proteins from both the A and B subgroups of the RSV virus, which are the two most commonly circulating strains.\n\nIn a study of 7,400 pregnant people and infants, the vaccine was 82% effective at preventing severe lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized babies for the first three months of life. It was about 70% effective at preventing severe RSV in hospitalized infants for six months.\n\nBabies were considered to have severe RSV if they were breathing very rapidly, over 70 breaths per minute in a 2-month-old; if their blood oxygen levels fell below 93%; if they required high-flow oxygen, or if they were admitted to the ICU; or if they lost consciousness.\n\nThe vaccine cut the need for infants to need to see a doctor because of RSV by an average of more than 50% compared with a placebo. That result did not fall within a statistical range that was specified by the FDA before the outset of the trial, however, so the company acknowledges that the vaccine missed that particular goalpost.\n\nGruber points out, however, that a 50% reduction in doctor visits due to RSV is still likely to be a noticeable and important benefit in the real world.\n\n“This is clearly sufficient and frankly, great news, for filing for our approval,” he said.\n\nPfizer also recently announced positive results in an ongoing trial of the same vaccine in older adults.\n\nLonger-term research\n\nThe drugmaker’s FDA filing would make it the first in a crowded field of companies developing vaccines against RSV. GSK had been testing a maternal vaccine but paused its study after learning of a safety problem.\n\nGSK said Monday that the trial remains stopped, though it did not share any details on the safety issue.\n\n“Further analysis to better understand safety data from these trials is ongoing,” spokesperson Alison Hunt said in a statement to CNN. “The relevant regulatory authorities and trial investigators have been informed. We’re committed to transparently sharing more data as we have it.”\n\nNo safety issues have been identified with Pfizer’s vaccine, Gruber said, and a panel of independent reviewers that looks over the study findings while the trial is progressing found no problems.\n\n“The vaccine is very tolerable, and no safety signals were identified,” he said, though the full results of the trial have not been published.\n\nAlthough Pfizer will suspend enrollment in the maternal vaccination trial, Gruber says it will continue to follow the infants who are enrolled.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“We know that children that have RSV end up having compromised lung status, and they become more susceptible, in many instances, to other respiratory infections that puts them back in the hospital. So we’re very interested in determining does this not only have a specific effect as the vaccine was intended to have against protection against RSV, but it may have a side benefit of allowing these children to fare better over the longer term,” he said.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/04/health/rsv-treatment-all-infants/index.html", "title": "Treatment approved in Europe to prevent RSV in infants could be ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA preventive treatment for lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV got the go ahead from the European Commission on Friday, according to one of the companies that make it.\n\nThe treatment is the first of its kind to protect all infants in their first year of life.\n\nA spokesperson from drugmaker Sanofi says that they’ve also submitted their research to the US Food and Drug Administration for approval. The company said it hopes the treatment will be available in the United States for the 2023 - 2024 RSV season.\n\nThis year, RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, has overwhelmed pediatric hospitals all around the US. Nearly every child gets RSV prior to the age of 2, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While it can often be a milder respiratory infection for many children and most adults, studies show it is still a leading cause of hospitalization in all infants.\n\nGlobally, in 2019 alone, there were 33 million cases and more than 3.6 million hospitalizations. It’s estimated there were 26,300 in-hospital RSV deaths of children younger than age five and 101,400 deaths overall, according to a 2022 study published in the Lancet.\n\nThe new monoclonal antibody treatment is a joint project with AstraZeneca and Sanofi. It will be sold under the brand name Beyfortus (nirsevimab). Sanofi said it has been working in collaboration with AstraZeneca on the project for about five years.\n\nThe treatment is given to infants in a single dose shot at the time of birth or just before the start of the RSV season. And unlike with a vaccine where the body builds up its immunity in reaction to a vaccine over time, a monoclonal antibody works right away. The most common side effects are rash, injection site reactions and fever.\n\nIf approved in the US, Beyfortus would be the only single-dose RSV protective option for the general infant population. Sanofi said that broad protection is important, since 80% of infants that are hospitalized for RSV have no comorbidities.\n\nBeyfortus can also be used for a second RSV season in children that remain highly vulnerable to RSV infection, typically meaning children with underlying medical conditions.\n\nThere is another monoclonal antibody treatment approved in the US and Europe called palivizumab, or Synagis, that protects against infection in high-risk infants. With that treatment, infants get an intramuscular injection every month during RSV season and it usually requires 5 doses. The treatment was approved in 1998.\n\nApproval for Beyfortus from the European Commission was based on trial data that showed the treatment reduced the incidence of lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV that needed medical attention by 70.1% compared to placebo in a Phase 2b trial, according to a news release from Sanofi. In a later stage Phase 3 trial conducted in 21 different countries, Beyfortus reduced the incidence of RSV-related bronchiolitis, inflammation of the tiny airways in the lungs, or pneumonia that needed medical attention by 74.5% compared to placebo.\n\n“The totality of the data that we have generated across population indicates that protection is around 80% in the all-infant population,” said Jon Heinrichs, the global project head at Sanofi Vaccines Research & Development. “We believe it will make a huge difference on RSV.”\n\nRSV has also placed a big burden on doctors office and hospitals even outside of a bad RSV season like the one the US is seeing right now.\n\n“Imagine a situation where 80% of that disease could be prevented,” Heinrichs added.\n\nFor vulnerable infants and those whose mothers decline to be vaccinated, Dr. Helen Chu, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Washington, says Beyfortus could be a “game-changer.”\n\nThe other advantage with a treatment like this is that if an RSV season were to start early like it did this year, with RSV hospitalizations shooting up to levels typically seen in December, it can deliver protection just in time for any infant.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBeyfortus would also protect the child directly. A vaccine given to a mother to offer passive protection to a child wouldn’t necessarily work for a child born after the RSV season is over. By then, the immunity would likely have worn off, Heinrichs said. Half of infants that are hospitalized with RSV are born outside of the RSV season.\n\n“So it’s really critically important in our minds at least to protect all infants from RSV disease, and we think this is the only way to do it,” Heinrichs said.\n\nIn the US, there are four new RSV vaccines that may be nearing review by the FDA, and more than a dozen are going through trials right now. Most of those vaccines are for adults. A vaccine for children is further down the road, experts say.", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/health/rsv-vaccines-therapies/index.html", "title": "New RSV vaccines may soon put an end to rough seasons | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt’s shaping up to be a severe season for respiratory syncytial virus infections – one of the worst some doctors say they can remember. But even as babies struggling to breathe fill hospital beds across the United States, there may be a light ahead: After decades of disappointment, four new RSV vaccines may be nearing review by the US Food and Drug Administration, and more than a dozen others are in testing.\n\nThere’s also hope around a promising long-acting injection designed to be given right after birth to protect infants from the virus for as long as six months. In a recent clinical trial, the antibody shot was 75% effective at heading off RSV infections that required medical attention.\n\nExperts say the therapies look so promising, they could end bad RSV seasons as we know them.\n\nAnd the relief could come soon: Dr. Ashish Jha, who leads the White House Covid-19 Response Task Force, told CNN that he’s “hopeful” there will be an RSV vaccine by next fall.\n\nCharlotte Brown jumped at the chance to enroll her own son, a squawky, active 10-month-old named James, in one of the vaccine trials this summer.\n\n“As soon as he qualified, we were like ‘absolutely, we are in,’ ” Brown said.\n\nBabies have to be at least 6 months old to enter the trial, which is testing a vaccine developed at the National Institutes of Health – the result of decades of scientific research.\n\nBrown is a pediatrician who cares for hospitalized children at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, and she sees the ravages of RSV firsthand. A recent patient was in the back of her mind when she was signing up James for the study.\n\n“I took care of a baby who was only a few months older than him and had had nine days of fever and was just absolutely pitiful and puny,” she said. Brown said his family felt helpless. “And I was like, ‘this is why we’re doing it. This single patient is why we’re doing this.’ “\n\nEven before this year’s surge, RSV was the leading cause of infant hospitalizations in the US. The virus infects the lower lungs, where it causes a hacking cough and may lead to severe complications like pneumonia and inflammation of the tiny airways in the lungs called bronchiolitis.\n\nWorldwide, RSV causes about 33 million infections in children under the age of 5 and hospitalizes 3.6 million annually. Nearly a quarter-million young children die each year from complications of their infections.\n\nRSV also preys on seniors, leading to an estimated 159,000 hospitalizations and about 10,000 deaths a year in adults 65 and over, a burden roughly on par with influenza.\n\nDespite this heavy toll, doctors haven’t had any new tools to head off RSV for more than two decades. The last therapy approved was in 1998. The monoclonal antibody, Synagis, is given monthly during RSV season to protect preemies and other high-risk babies.\n\nLessons learned after grave setback\n\nThe hunt for an effective way to protect against RSV stalled for decades after two children died in a disastrous vaccine trial in the 1960s.\n\nThat study tested a vaccine made with an RSV virus that had been chemically treated to render it inert and mixed with an ingredient called alum, to wake up the immune system and help it respond.\n\nIt was tested at clinical trial sites in the US between 1966 and 1968.\n\nAt first, everything looked good. The vaccine was tested in animals, who tolerated it well, and then given to children, who also appeared to respond well.\n\n“Unfortunately, that fall, when RSV season started, many of the children that were vaccinated required hospitalization and got more severe RSV disease than what would have normally occurred,” said Steven Varga, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa, who has been studying RSV for more than 20 years and is developing a nanoparticle vaccine against the virus.\n\nA study published on the trial found that 80% of the vaccinated children who caught RSV later required hospitalization, compared with only 5% of the children who got a placebo. Two of the babies who had participated in the trial died.\n\nThe outcomes of the trial were a seismic shock to vaccine science. Efforts to develop new vaccines and treatments against RSV halted as researchers tried to untangle what went so wrong.\n\n“The original vaccine studies were so devastatingly bad. They didn’t understand immunology well in those days, so everybody said ‘oh no, this ain’t gonna work.’ And it really was like it stopped things cold for 30, 40 years,” said Dr. Aaron Glatt, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Sinai South Nassau in New York.\n\nRegulators re-evaluated the guardrails around clinical trials, putting new safety measures into place.\n\n“It is in fact, in many ways, why we have some of the things that we have in place today to monitor vaccine safety,” Varga said.\n\nResearchers at the clinical trial sites didn’t communicate with each other, Varga said, and so the US Food and Drug Administration put the publicly accessible Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System into place. Now, when an adverse event is reported at one clinical trial site, other sites are notified.\n\nAnother problem turned out to be how the vaccine was made.\n\nProteins are three-dimensional structures. They are made of chains of building blocks called amino acids that fold into complex shapes, and their shapes determine how they work.\n\nIn the failed RSV vaccine trial, the chemical the researchers used to deactivate the virus denatured its proteins – essentially flattening them.\n\n“Now you have a long sheet of acids but no more beautiful shapes,” said Ulla Buchholz, chief of the RNA Viruses Section at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n“Everything that the immune system needs to form neutralizing antibodies that can block and block attachment and entry of this virus to the cell had been destroyed in that vaccine,” said Buchholz, who designed the RSV vaccine for toddlers that’s being tested at Vanderbilt and other US sites.\n\nIn the 1960s trial, the kids still made antibodies to the flattened viral proteins, but they were distorted. When the actual virus came along, these antibodies didn’t work as intended. Not only did they fail to recognize or block the virus, they triggered a powerful misdirected immune response that made the children much sicker, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement of disease.\n\nThe investigators hadn’t spotted the enhancement in animal studies, Varga says, because the vaccinated animals weren’t later challenged with the live virus.\n\n“So of course, we require now extensive animal testing of new vaccines before they’re ever put into humans, again, for that very reason of making sure that there aren’t early signs that a vaccine will be problematic,” Varga said.\n\nA breakthrough reinvigorates the field\n\nAbout 10 years ago, a team of researchers at the NIH – some of the same investigators who developed the first Covid-19 vaccines – reported what would turn out to be a pivotal advance.\n\nThey had isolated the structure of the virus’s F-protein, the site that lets it dock onto human cells. Normally, the F-protein flips back and forth, changing shapes after it attaches to a cell. The NIH researchers figured out to how freeze the F-protein into the shape it takes before it fuses with a cell.\n\nThis protein, when locked into place, allows the immune system to recognize the virus in the form it’s in when it first enters the body – and develop strong antibodies against it.\n\n“The companies coming forward now, for the most part, are taking advantage of that discovery,” said Dr. Phil Dormitzer, a senior vice president of vaccine development at GlaxoSmithKline. “And now we have this new generation of vaccine candidates that perform far better than the old generation.”\n\nThe first vaccines up for FDA review will be given to adults: seniors and pregnant woman. Vaccination in pregnancy is meant to ultimately protect newborns – a group particularly vulnerable to the virus – via antibodies that cross the placenta.\n\nVaccines for children are a bit farther behind in development but moving through the pipeline, too.\n\nFour companies have RSV vaccines for adults in the final phases of human trials: Pfizer and GSK are testing vaccines for pregnant women as well as seniors. Janssen and Bavarian Nordic are developing shots for seniors.\n\nPfizer and GSK use protein subunit vaccines, a more traditional kind of vaccine technology. Two other companies build on innovations made during the pandemic: Janssen – the vaccine division of Johnson & Johnson – relies on an adenoviral vector, the same kind of system that’s used in its Covid-19 vaccine, and Moderna has a vaccine for RSV in Phase 2 trials that uses mRNA technology.\n\nSo far, early results shared by some companies are promising. Janssen, Pfizer and GSK each appear effective at preventing infections in adults for the first RSV season after the vaccine.\n\nIn an August news release, Annaliesa Anderson, Pfizer’s chief scientific officer of Vaccine Research and Development, said she was “delighted” with the results. The company plans to submit its data to the FDA for approval this fall.\n\nGSK has also wrapped up its Phase 3 trial for seniors. It recently presented the results at a medical conference, but full data hasn’t been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal. Early results show that this vaccine is 83% effective at preventing disease in the lower lungs of adults 60 and older. It appears to be even more protective – 94% – for severe RSV disease in those over 70 and those with underlying medical conditions.\n\n“We are very pleased with these results,” Dormitzer told CNN. He said the company was moving “with all due haste” to get its results to the FDA for review.\n\n“We’re confident enough that we’ve started manufacturing the actual commercial launch materials. So we have the bulk vaccine actually in the refrigerator, ready to supply when we are licensed,” he said.\n\nEven as the company applies for licensure, GSK’s trial will continue for two more RSV seasons. Half the group getting the vaccine will be followed with no additional shots, while the other group will get annual boosters. The aim is to see which approach is most protective to guide future vaccination strategies.\n\nJanssen’s vaccine for older adults appears to be about 70% to 80% effective in clinical trials so far, the company announced in December.\n\nIn a study on Pfizer’s vaccine for pregnant women published in the New England Journal of Medicine this year, the company reported that the mothers enrolled in the study made antibodies to the vaccine and that these antibodies crossed the placenta and were detected in umbilical cord blood just after birth.\n\nThe vaccines for pregnant women are meant to get newborns through their first RSV season. But not all newborns will benefit from those. Most maternal antibodies are passed to baby in the third trimester, so preemies may not be protected, even if mom gets the vaccine.\n\nFor vulnerable infants and those whose mothers decline to be vaccinated, Dr. Helen Chu, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Washington, says the long-acting antibody shot for newborns, called nirsevimab, should cover them for the first six months of life. She expects it to be a “game-changer.”\n\nThat shot, which has been developed by AstraZeneca, was recently recommended for approval in the European Union. It has not yet been approved in the United States.\n\nHope on the horizon\n\nThe field is so close to a new approval that public health officials say they’ve been asked to study up on the data.\n\nChu, who is also a member of an RSV study group of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a panel that advises the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its vaccine recommendations, says her group has started to evaluate the new vaccines – a sign that an FDA review is just around the corner.\n\nNo companies have yet announced that process is underway. FDA reviews can take several months, and then there are typically discussions and votes by FDA and CDC advisory groups before vaccines are made available.\n\n“We’ve been working on this for several months now to start reviewing the data,” Chu said. “So I think this is imminent.”\n\nWatching this year’s RSV season unfold, Brown, the pediatrician who enrolled her son in the vaccine trial for toddlers, says progress can’t come fast enough.\n\n“The hospital is surging. We’re not drowning the way some states are. I mean, Connecticut, South Carolina, North Carolina, they’re really drowning. But our numbers are huge, and our services are so busy,” she says.\n\nBrown says her son is mostly healthy. He doesn’t have any of the risks for severe RSV she sees with some of her patients, so she was happy to have a way to help others.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAnd while it’s far too early to say whether the vaccine James is helping to test will prove to be effective, the trial was unblinded last week, and Brown learned that her son was in the group that got the active vaccine, not the placebo\n\nHe has done well through this heavy season of illness, she says. The NIH-sponsored study they participated in is scheduled to be completed next year.\n\nThe vaccine, which is made with a live but very weak version of virus, is given through a couple of squirts up the nose, so there are no needles. The hardest part for squirmy James, she said, was being held still.\n\n“If we can do anything to move science forward and help another child, like, sorry, James.

Parkland\n\nFamily members of the victims killed in the 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, will address the shooter face-to-face in court for a second day today. In an emotional hearing that began Tuesday, several family members took to the stand to deliver their statements directly to Nikolas Cruz, the now 24-year-old shooter who avoided the death penalty last month. Among several chilling remarks, the younger brother of one of the 17 victims shared that he walks by his sister’s room every day and sees that it’s empty. Another victim’s mother recounted “listening to the screams and the howling” of families after the shooting. Cruz will be officially sentenced this week following a jury’s recommendation he should be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\n2. RSV\n\nPfizer says it will seek FDA approval this year for a vaccine to prevent respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. The virus typically causes mild, cold-like symptoms, but it can cause serious illness, particularly in older adults and infants. Pfizer’s vaccine candidate is administered to pregnant women who then make antibodies that can protect the baby after birth. In the trial, the vaccine appeared to be about 80% effective at preventing severe RSV disease in infants during the first three months of life. If approved, Pfizer’s shot will be the first against RSV and the first new product related to the infection in over two decades. Worldwide, RSV causes about 33 million infections in children under the age of 5 and hospitalizes 3.6 million annually.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'It's awful': Doctor explains RSV symptoms as cases surge 04:03 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Ukraine\n\nUkraine’s Air Force said it has no effective defense against the types of ballistic missiles that Iran is preparing to ship to Russia to use in its war in Ukraine. Western officials say Iran is working to send approximately 1,000 additional weapons, including short-range ballistic missiles and more attack drones, which could give the Kremlin a substantial boost on the battlefield. This expected shipment would mark a significant increase in Iranian support for Russia’s war effort. In recent weeks Iranian drones have been used to target critical energy infrastructure in Ukraine. While the precise timing of when the new shipment will arrive in Russia is unclear, officials believe the weapons will be delivered before the end of the year.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This is what a missile strike looks like: Clarissa Ward reports from Ukraine 02:47 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Inflation\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to make history yet again today, approving a fourth-straight interest rate hike of three-quarters of a percentage point. This comes after Democratic lawmakers sent a letter this week to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressing concerns about the central bank’s plan to raise rates at an “alarming pace.” Noting the Fed’s new unemployment forecast, the letter pressed Powell to address the millions of job losses that could result from its war on inflation. The Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Katie Porter, highlighted comments from economists who worry the Fed is moving too aggressively. They pointed to a recent warning from the UN of a central bank-fueled global recession. This comes as the Fed raises interest rates at the fastest pace since the early 1980s – weighing down the stock market, spiking mortgage rates and fueling recession fears. Powell said last month that no one knows if the rate hikes will cause a recession, or how deep that recession might be.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hold on to the assets that you have: Larry Summers gives advice as recession looms 03:24 - Source: CNN\n\n5.

I had no idea my baby could get so sick from this,'\" said Dr. Elizabeth Schlaudecker, medical director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Cincinnati Children’s.\n\nRSV also strikes at the other end of life: It causes more than 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths among older adults every year.\n\nDespite decades of effort, the arsenal to fight RSV has so far included only one monoclonal antibody, given monthly to children at high risk for severe disease. There has never been a way to prevent RSV.\n\nBut six drug companies are developing RSV vaccines or antibodies, suggesting this year could be the last without adequate tools to fight the virus.\n\n\"We're experiencing a new hope that the RSV landscape is going to dramatically change, especially in the very young infant, in the next year or so,\" said Dr. Octavio Ramilo, chief of infectious diseases at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nOn Tuesday, drug giant Pfizer announced results from a Phase 3 clinical trial showing its experimental RSVpreF vaccine protected infants when given to pregnant participants between 24 and 36 weeks of gestation.\n\nThrough the first 90 days of a baby's life, the vaccine was more than 80% effective at preventing severe illness. At 6 months, it remained nearly 70% effective, the study showed. The trial did not raise any major safety concerns for parent or child.\n\nPfizer plans to submit an application to the Food and Drug Administration by the end of the year, which could allow its vaccine to reach the public before next year's RSV season. It typically starts in late October.\n\nEarlier this year, Sanofi Pasteur and AstraZeneca also showed protection against severe disease with their antibody nirsevimab, though the trial, which was disrupted by COVID-19 lockdowns, failed to show a statistically significant reduction in the risk of hospitalization from RSV.\n\nAntibodies can provide protection when an infant's immune system is too immature to benefit from a vaccine, said Jon Heinrichs, Sanofi's global head of innovation and emerging sciences.\n\n\"The majority of hospitalization and severe disease caused by RSV happen in that first year of life,\" he said. \"It's critical to protect these infants.\"\n\nAbout 70% of children contract RSV before their first birthday and 90% by their second. It's impossible to tell ahead of time which children will have a simple, mild case and which few will become severely ill and require hospitalization to help them breathe.\n\nThe disease is usually less severe in children older than 6 months, but RSV has been particularly bad this fall, experts say, because the precautions taken during earlier days of the pandemic protected babies against RSV in addition to COVID-19.\n\nNow, three years' worth of children are getting exposed to RSV for the first time, and a fraction are suffering severe consequences.\n\nWhy new approaches are coming now\n\nTools to fight RSV have been a long time coming.\n\n\"Pediatricians and pediatric infectious disease doctors have fought RSV for decades and honestly not made a lot of progress,\" Schlaudecker said. \"It seems long overdue that we have an effective vaccine.\"\n\nResearch into RSV vaccines was tabled for decades after two children died in a 1967 trial that concluded the experimental vaccine actually made the disease worse.\n\nIn 2013, researchers from the National Institutes of Health discovered a way to stabilize the protein that was the vaccine's target. (The same idea was used in COVID-19 vaccines, which also proved extremely effective.)\n\nEver since, companies have been working on RSV prevention tools, many of which are coming to fruition at the same time.\n\n\"Out of the blue, instead of preventing (RSV) in a very small group, we can give it to all children,\" Ramilo said. That is important because 80% of children who develop severe RSV had no obvious risk factors. Worldwide, RSV is the second most common cause of death in the first year of life, after malaria.\n\nHaving vaccines, which are inexpensive and easy to administer, as well as monoclonals will be useful, Ramilo said. Monoclonals might provide protection until a child is old enough to get a vaccine for themselves.\n\n\"Both strategies have their role and their benefit,\" he said. \"Having more than one is always good.\"\n\nPreventing that first serious respiratory infection might also pay off later in life, said Dr. Alejandra Gurtman, vice president of vaccine R&D for Pfizer.\n\n\"If you're able to avoid that damage that you have from the first infection, you may be able to have healthier lungs\" and avoid problems like asthma later on, she said.\n\nOther approaches to RSV\n\nJohnson & Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline are developing their own RSV vaccines for older adults, Moderna is developing one for children and adults over 60, and Vir Biotechnology is developing a monoclonal antibody to treat people at high risk for severe RSV.\n\nGSK's vaccine, AReSVi 006, was shown this summer to reduce severe RSV in older adults by 94%, according to a 25,000-person Phase 3 trial. The shot also had a favorable safety profile, according to the company, and could be administered along with a flu shot. FDA approval could come as soon as later this year.\n\nModerna is six months behind other companies, CEO Stéphane Bancel said in an interview in September, but it expects this month to have safety data for the first 6,000 trial participants six months after their shot. Depending on infection rates, the company will have an interim analysis sometime in the winter or spring, he said.\n\nIn adults over 60, immunity they may have gained against RSV in childhood wanes. Ailments such as lung disease increase vulnerability, and the immune system naturally weakens with age.\n\nIt's unclear whether RSV vaccines in older people would be needed every year. If so, it's possible the shot could be combined with a flu and COVID-19 vaccine, said Sanofi's Heinrichs, whose company is developing an RSV vaccine in addition to its antibody.\n\nIn August, Pfizer announced a single dose of RSVpreF was effective at preventing severe disease in adults 60 and older. The study of more than 37,000 people showed the vaccine was well tolerated, with no safety concerns.\n\nSanofi and AstraZeneca are seeking regulatory approval to give the antibody to all infants entering their first RSV season as well all children who remain vulnerable in their second year because of chronic disease. In September, the effort won the support of the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. The companies plan to submit a licensing request to the FDA later this year.\n\nProtecting young lives\n\nDr. Melissa Squires works in a pediatric intensive care unit, so she knows all too well what an infant struggling to breathe looks like.\n\nThat's why she was thrilled when pregnant with her second daughter last year to be able to sign up for a clinical trial of Pfizer's RSV vaccine at Cincinnati Children's, where she works.\n\n\"This was another opportunity for me to set my baby up for the best chance of being healthy both inside of me and outside of me,\" said Squires, a neurocritical care specialist who treats children who have strokes, seizures and traumatic brain injuries.\n\nSquires received the shot 34 weeks into her pregnancy, and her daughter Natalie was born a couple of days before Christmas. As part of the trial, she had to provide extra cord blood, allow her pediatrician to share data and answer questions by phone.\n\nMother and baby got through last winter without catching any respiratory viruses, despite having an older child at home.\n\nBeing pregnant during the pandemic, Squires said, heightened her awareness about viruses and made her more eager to protect the vulnerable.\n\n\"This was one more thing I could do to protect this new life I was responsible for,\" she said in the spring. \"To have the peace of mind that my baby is protected from one of the biggest offenders of childhood illness is just a little bit of weight off my shoulders.\"\n\nPrevention is really the only solution to the misery of RSV, Schlaudecker said.\n\n\"If we can save lives, prevent hospitalization of infants who are the most vulnerable, we need to do that as quickly as possible.\"\n\nIn newborns and babies, the bronchial tubes that go into the lung are extremely small. When they fill with fluid during an RSV infection, the child can have trouble breathing and eating. \"They are the ones we worry about the most,\" Schlaudecker said. \"Vaccinating during pregnancy is such a great, creative way to protect them.\"\n\nThe range of positive trial results \"are really thrilling from an RSV doctor's standpoint,\" she said. \"We see a light at the end of the tunnel.\"\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Chan School of Public Health. “And at the same time, we don’t know what the next strain is going to look like.”\n\nAs the VRBPAC panel – and other leading public health experts – work to answer some of those questions about the future, Rubin said that it is useful to get these issues “out there” now, and “start thinking about them.”\n\nA whole new vaccine\n\nThe Covid-19 vaccinations that people receive in the future could be completely different formulations than what are administered now – which are a composition based on the original version of the virus that emerged in late 2019.\n\nSome companies, including Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, are developing variant-specific vaccines that could target whatever variant of the coronavirus is circulating when that booster might be needed. For instance, Pfizer and Moderna have each said they are working on a vaccine that would specifically protect against the Omicron variant, even though it’s not clear whether one is needed.\n\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla has said the company is also hoping to make a vaccine that will protect against Omicron as well as all other variants of the coronavirus.\n\nThe goal is to create “something that can protect for at least a year,” Bourla told CBS in March. “And if we are able to achieve that, then I think it is very easy to follow and remember so that we can go back to really the way [we] used to live.”\n\nModerna and the biotechnology company Novavax also are working on two-in-one combination vaccines that can offer protection against both flu and Covid-19.\n\n“Our goal is to be able to have a single annual booster, so that we don’t have compliance issues where people don’t want to get two to three shots a winter, but they get one dose where they get a booster for corona and they get a booster for flu and RSV, to make sure that people get their vaccines,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said at the World Economic Forum in January of a single vaccine for Covid-19, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, a common virus that causes cold-like symptoms.\n\nVarious research teams from different institutions also are working to develop a “pan-coronavirus” vaccine – one that offers protection against multiple variants of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.\n\nThe hope is that such a vaccine could pave the way for the development of a universal coronavirus vaccine, which could head off any coronavirus and and even the menacing threat of novel coronaviruses we haven’t identified yet.\n\nThere are seven known coronaviruses that infect humans: four that cause common colds; Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS; severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS; and SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.\n\nA possible universal vaccine, however, is going to take much longer to develop – likely several years – than a pan-coronavirus vaccine or so-called “multivalent” vaccine that could protect against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nBut while the composition of coronavirus vaccines could change in the future to target any new and emerging variants, there needs to be a “framework” for how and when such changes take place, according to VRBPAC members.\n\nTo start, the FDA would seek advice from the VRBPAC before any changes to the composition of coronavirus vaccines are made, Jerry Weir of the FDA’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review told the advisory committee in Wednesday’s meeting.\n\nOn some routine basis, “the FDA and VRBPAC would review the epidemiology of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants in the US, the effectiveness of available vaccines in use, and the available clinical data and manufacturing concerns for modified vaccines, in order to determine whether to recommend an updated vaccine for use,” Weir said.\n\n“There should be some thought given to a collaborative plan – this is going forward – that includes manufacturers, the FDA and other public health agencies,” Weir added.\n\nSuch a plan “would provide the necessary clinical data needed for the future vaccine composition decisions,” he said. “These plans should be developed to respond to any emerging variant that escapes protection provided by currently available vaccines.”\n\nAfter all, as the coronavirus evolves, new variants are likely to emerge in the future.\n\nCoronavirus evolution is ‘remarkably fast’\n\nIn the two years since the start of the pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 virus already has achieved about “five years” worth of virus evolution – and the virus will continue to evolve, experts told VRBPAC in Wednesday’s meeting.\n\nWhen compared with various types of flu viruses, “SARS-CoV-2 so far has been evolving about twice as fast as influenza H3N2, about four times as fast as influenza H1N1, and about 10 times as fast as B/Victoria,” Trevor Bedford, a scientist at Howard Hughes Medical Institute, told VRBPAC members.\n\n“This means that if you look here at Omicron-like viruses, in just two years’ time, since the start of the pandemic, we’ve accomplished about five years of equivalent evolution,” Bedford said. “The evolution has been remarkably fast so far.”\n\nAs the pandemic transitions into an endemic phase, “we really don’t know” whether “wildly divergent” variants of the virus will be common or rare, Bedford said. Endemic means a disease has a constant presence in a population but is not affecting an alarmingly large number of people, as typically seen in a pandemic.\n\nYet to respond to a fast-changing virus, coordinating the possible rollout of vaccines as variants emerge in the future remains complicated.\n\n“We have multiple manufacturers. We are talking about some vaccines in development that might not be authorized or approved yet that could also be coming into the mix. How do we essentially unify what we’re doing for a booster?” Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told VRBPAC members.\n\n“It might be better to have a unified approach with a strain selection or a variant selection, much the same as we do for influenza,” Marks said, referring to how flu vaccines are updated each year to match circulating strains. “Much like with flu, once we move to a new composition … it will also change the composition of the primary series.”\n\nThe way flu vaccines are updated each year could be a model for the future of coronavirus vaccines – but VRBPAC member Oveta Fuller, of the University of Michigan, emphasized that the nation had much more than two years to understand the flu.\n\n“Let me remind us that we didn’t get to understand influenza in two years. It’s taken years to get to a uniform – somewhat still imperfect but also useful – process for what we do with flu,” Fuller said in Wednesday’s meeting.\n\n“We need to remind ourselves and step back that we are very new in this pandemic, and we don’t have the answers,” Fuller said. “VRBPAC doesn’t have the answers. FDA doesn’t have the answers. The important thing here is that the public understands how complex this is.”\n\nWhat keeps an FDA official up at night\n\nEven once Covid-19 transitions from a pandemic to endemic, will enough people complete their coronavirus vaccinations so that the disease stays at endemic levels – or will they grow tired of getting their Covid-19 booster doses? That is a concern that Marks expressed Wednesday.\n\n“What really keeps me up at night is the knowledge that we can’t keep boosting and that we’re going to have vaccine exhaustion,” Marks told VRBPAC members.\n\n“I’m talking about physical exhaustion and people not going to get boosted,” he said.\n\nCurrently, about 66% of the US population is fully vaccinated with at least their initial series – including more than 75% of adults – and about 30% have received their booster. In March, the FDA authorized second booster doses for adults 50 and older. On Wednesday, Marks called that a “stopgap” measure.\n\n“I think we’re very much on board with the idea that we simply can’t be boosting people as frequently as we are, and I’m the first to acknowledge that this additional fourth booster dose that was authorized was a stopgap measure until we got things in place for the next potential booster, given the emerging data,” Marks said in Wednesday’s meeting.\n\n“It was done because of the amount of harm that has come to our older population in the United States with 1 in 100 individuals over the age 65 having died in the past two years of Covid-19, so we need to protect that population,” Marks said.\n\n“Moving forward, we will have this issue that coming into the fall season only half of the population overall – and granted it’s two-thirds of the population over age 65 are vaccinated with a third dose – but half of the population overall hasn’t received a third dose,” he added. “That means that they will not have the more durable protection.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMarks expects to hold another meeting in early summer to discuss Covid-19 booster doses for the fall and winter, he told VRBPAC members.\n\nLooking ahead, he said, “Our goal here is to stay ahead of future variants and outbreaks and ensure that we do our best to reduce the toll of disease and death due to Covid-19 on our population.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/business/moderna-covid-vaccines-annual-booster-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Moderna CEO says Covid vaccines will evolve like 'an iPhone ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nForget taking two to three Covid shots a year. Moderna hopes to roll out a single-dose annual booster to cover the coronavirus, the flu and another common respiratory virus within the next five years.\n\nAs Covid-19 continues to mutate, Moderna will need to keep updating the vaccines that turned it into a global household name while trying to make it more convenient for consumers, CEO Stéphane Bancel said in an interview with CNN Business Wednesday.\n\nHe estimated a timeline of “three to five years” for the new combined product, and likened the development of the life-saving jab to that of a smartphone.\n\n“You don’t get the amazing camera, amazing everything the first time you get an iPhone, but you get a lot of things,” he said.\n\n“A lot of us buy a new iPhone every September, and you get new apps and you get refreshed apps. And that’s exactly the same idea, which is you’ll get Covid and flu and RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] in your single dose.”\n\nHaving recorded breakneck growth during the pandemic, Moderna (MRNA) is now under pressure to identify its next big frontier.\n\nBancel believes the Covid-19 pandemic that helped the company rack up tens of billions of dollars in revenue and generate business in more than 70 markets globally could end as soon as this year.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the virus is going anywhere, he noted.\n\n“I think we are slowly moving — if not already in some countries — to a world where all the tools are available, and everybody can make their own decision based on their risk tolerance,” he explained, adding that he believed more people would choose to “live with the virus,” much like they do with the flu.\n\nThe approach, however, will continue to vary greatly, such as among people who are immunocompromised or in countries like Japan, where it was common to wear masks even before the pandemic, he acknowledged.\n\nAnd “there’s always a 20% probability that we get a very nasty variant that drives very severe disease that has a lot of mutation,” he added.\n\nThe next big thing\n\nStill, Moderna is determined not to become a one-hit wonder.\n\nThe company has more than 40 products in development, and is planning for life well beyond Covid-19, said Bancel.\n\nIn addition to an updated annual booster, it is continuing to develop a personalized cancer vaccine, for which new clinical data will drop later this year. Bancel said the product could go up for approval in roughly two years if all goes well.\n\nThe company is also exploring a potential monkeypox jab, which is “still in the lab today,” Bancel said. The World Health Organization declared the global outbreak of the illness a public health emergency of international concern last month.\n\nAnd Moderna is looking to catch up to competitors overseas.\n\nEarlier this year, it announced a push into 10 Asian and European markets, including Singapore, Hong Kong, Denmark and the Netherlands. The investments will cost “dozens of millions of dollars” and include hundreds of new hires, said Bancel.\n\nMembers of the public waiting in line at a vaccination facility administering the Moderna Covid-19 shot in Taipei, Taiwan in April.

Its stock rallied 434% in 2020 and 143% last year.\n\nBut now, like peers Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX), the firm’s stock has slumped, dropping more than 30% so far this year and 64% from its all-time high a year ago.\n\nLast week, the company revealed that it took a writedown of nearly $500 million in the second quarter, partly because of a sudden cancellation of orders from Covax, the international vaccination program for lower-income countries.\n\nThe reversal led to huge losses for the company, which had bought new machines to fulfill those orders, and more importantly, resulted in Covid vaccines being thrown in the trash, said Bancel.\n\n“We ended up destroying the vaccines,” he said. “It was really heartbreaking.”\n\nThe CEO said he wasn’t worried about that kind of slide in demand being repeated in richer countries, in part because governments had already shown commitments to use vaccines later this year to avoid reintroducing economic lockdowns.\n\nBut “on the low-income country side, yes, I am worried,” he said.", "authors": ["Michelle Toh"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/health/respiratory-viruses-hospitals/index.html", "title": "An early rise in respiratory viruses in children is overwhelming some ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA surge in respiratory illnesses among children is beginning to put a strain on hospitals.\n\nIn particular, hospitals are seeing a rise in cases of respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, a common cold virus that can be associated with severe disease in young children and older adults. Cases are rising in multiple US regions, with some already nearing seasonal peak levels, according to the latest real-time surveillance data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSurveillance data collected by the CDC clearly shows a rise in RSV cases nationwide in recent weeks, with cases detected by PCR tests more than tripling over the past two months and nearing last year’s peaks. The CDC’s surveillance program captures data from 75 counties representing about 9% of the total US population.\n\n“RSV admissions have skyrocketed at Connecticut Children’s. October has been like never before for this virus,” Monica M. Buchanan, senior director of strategic and enterprise communications for Connecticut Children’s Hospital, told CNN.\n\nBuchanan said hospital leaders have met with the Connecticut Department of Public Health and the National Guard to begin logistic review of putting a mobile field hospital in the front lawn and more work is planned Thursday to determine a final decision and get approval.\n\nDr. Juan Salazar, executive vice president and physician-in-chief at Connecticut Children’s, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan that beds are filled to capacity and children are coming to the hospital at an “unprecedented” level: More than 100 with respiratory syncytial virus over the last 10 days, including many who require intensive care and oxygen therapy.\n\n“I’ve been doing this for a long time, I’ve been at Connecticut Children’s for 25 years, and I have never seen this level of surge – specifically of RSV – coming into our hospital,” he said.\n\nSalazar said the hospital hasn’t yet expanded to a field tent, “but we have to be prepared in case the numbers continue to increase. So if RSV increases further and it hits us with influenza at the tail end of this … we will need additional capacity for our hospital.”\n\nThe rise in cases is also coming earlier in the year than doctors would usually expect.\n\n“We used to have kind of a seasonality to different viruses,” Dr. Thomas Murray, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and associate professor at Yale University School of Medicine, told CNN affiliate WFSB. “Like the one right now, respiratory syncytial virus or RSV would come in December, it would go away followed by influenza, it would go away and another one. What seemed to happen with Covid is that now they’re all circulating at the same time.”\n\nIn most of the United States, RSV typically circulates during fall, winter and spring, but the timing and severity of RSV season in a given community can vary from year to year.\n\nIn 2021, RSV peaked during the summer, so this year’s fall and winter surge marks a return to circulation patterns seen in pre-pandemic years, according to statement from CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund.\n\nThis shift comes as other respiratory viruses – the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses and flu – drive more concern, too.\n\nSalazar said the United States is coming out of the Covid era, when children had relatively little exposure to viruses – and it’s hitting them now.\n\n“I think for the next four to eight week, we just have to be careful,” Salazar said, adding that getting vaccinated against influenza now could help curb months of surging flu cases later.\n\n“Get your kids vaccinated for influenza,” he said. “This is the time you need to do it.”\n\nThe CDC recommends that everyone age 6 months and older get a flu vaccine.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAn early increase in seasonal flu activity has been reported in most of the United States, with the nation’s Southeast and south-central areas reporting the highest levels of flu, according to the CDC.\n\n“Here we are in the middle of October – not the middle of November – we’re already seeing scattered influenza cases, even hospitalized influenza cases, around the country,” Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told CNN.", "authors": ["Chris Boyette Jamie Gumbrecht", "Chris Boyette", "Jamie Gumbrecht"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/08/health/vaccine-covid-booster-wen-wellness/index.html", "title": "Should you get your second booster shot now?", "text": "CNN —\n\nMore people can now get second Covid-19 booster shots after federal health officials announced they are allowing a broader group to get fourth doses of the two messenger RNA Covid-19 vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.\n\nAdults 50 and older, who received three previous mRNA doses, can get a second booster dose if it’s been at least four months since their first one.

There is a lot of evidence that the first booster is very important. During a time when Omicron was the dominant variant, the effectiveness of three doses against severe disease remained high, at 94%, according to a study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If this protection starts waning substantially, that would be a sign that another booster is needed.\n\nSecond, there may be new variants that develop over time. The influenza vaccine is given annually after it’s reconfigured every year for new mutations. The current vaccines work well against the Omicron subvariants, but if there are future variants that evade vaccine-induced immunity, that’s another reason for additional vaccinations.\n\nArmy veteran Robert Hall waits the recommended 15 minutes to see if he will have any adverse reactions after receiving his second Covid-19 booster shot at Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital on April 1 in Hines, Illinois. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThird, we need to monitor for how prevalent Covid-19 is. Right now, it is still rampant throughout the world, but if it ends up fading, regular booster doses may not be needed. As Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, said to CNN, “Will it ultimately get to such a low level that we might not even need a boost every year?” That’s possible, but we don’t know yet.\n\nFourth, we need to see whether there is a clear seasonality to future Covid-19 outbreaks. Other coronaviruses that cause the common cold are more prevalent in the winter, as are other respiratory viruses like RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and influenza. It’s likely that SARS-CoV-2 is, too, and there have been surges during winter months. This part, though, still needs to be seen in this coming fall and winter seasons.\n\nFinally, there are logistical considerations to think about. Adding an annual vaccine is a big undertaking. The uptake of the influenza vaccine is already low; just only about half of Americans get it every year. With the misinformation and polarization around Covid-19, encouraging this level of frequency will be a big undertaking.\n\nCNN: Right now, a second booster is already allowed four months after the first, which means that the current frequency is more than once a year. Could boosters be needed even more than once a year?\n\nWen: It’s possible. I want to emphasize that there is a lot we don’t know, simply because we don’t have the ability to foretell the future.\n\nThere are a couple of different scenarios that could occur. One is that certain groups of people may need more frequent vaccines. Recall that people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised have been recommended to get their additional booster for months. It’s possible that, going forward, certain more vulnerable populations will be recommended to get vaccines at a higher frequency than the general population.\n\nIn addition, there will also need to be contingencies if a new variant arises that evades prior immunity. There should be the option to develop, manufacture and quickly distribute variant-specific vaccines. If this happens, the frequency could end up being more than once a year for a particular time period.\n\nGoing forward, we have to consider the availability of other therapies and mitigation measures, too. For example, Evusheld is an antibody infusion that, when given to immunocompromised individuals, is very effective at reducing their likelihood of progression to severe illness. Antiviral pills and monoclonal antibodies are effective treatments when given early in the course of illness. And there are other preventive measures, including masking and testing before get-togethers, that can reduce risk, too.\n\nCNN: If the Covid-19 vaccine is going to be given annually, would it make sense to combine it with the flu vaccine?\n\nWen: In theory, yes, but we just don’t know if the Covid-19 vaccine needs to be an annual shot.\n\nThere are other vaccines that last longer. The Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria vaccine), for example, requires a booster every 10 years. The polio vaccine is a four-dose vaccine – you get four doses, and you’re done. Hepatitis B is a three-dose vaccine.\n\nIt’s possible that Covid-19 could be three or four doses, and we’re done, or it may need to be updated more frequently like influenza. Again, we just don’t know yet. If it does end up being something that’s annual, and the seasonal pattern appears similar to influenza, then having a combined shot – or at least, getting it at the same time as the flu shot – would be sensible.\n\nCNN: Why aren’t there variant-specific vaccines that target Omicron?\n\nWen: Scientists are working on these vaccines now. They are testing Omicron-specific vaccines and boosters to see if they could be even more effective than the original vaccines, which were targeting the previously dominant variants.\n\nOne consideration is that additional variants may arise, and scientists have to think about whether the Omicron-specific vaccines or the original vaccine – or some combination – will be most likely to be effective against potential variants in the future. This was among the many issues that advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration discussed in their meeting this week.\n\nCNN: If people are eligible for boosters now, should they get them, or should they wait?\n\nWen: It depends on the individual’s medical circumstance and how much they are willing to give up to avoid Covid-19, as I mentioned in our CNN Q&A last week. Someone who is over age 65 and/or immunocompromised should probably get the additional booster now.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOn the other hand, someone who is between ages 50 and 65, with no medical problems and recently had an Omicron infection, could probably wait. Some people might defer an additional booster as long as they are well-protected against severe illness. Others want to avoid any infection, even mild and asymptomatic infections. These are all personal decisions to be made in consultation with your medical provider.\n\nCNN: What’s your booster advice for people under 50? Should people get their first booster? And should they go for their second?\n\nWen: Everyone should get their first booster if eligible. The question of the second booster is more complex. If the person is under 50 and moderately or severely immunocompromised, they should also get their second booster. Another group that should get their second booster, even if they are under 50, are those who received two doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and it’s been at least four months since their last dose. All other groups under 50 are not eligible to receive their second booster at this time and should not go for their second.", "authors": ["Katia Hetter"], "publish_date": "2022/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/24/health/monkeypox-vaccine-explainer-us/index.html", "title": "Monkeypox: US is offering vaccines to certain people exposed to the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs global health leaders investigate an unusual outbreak of monkeypox across more than a dozen countries, discussions in the United States have turned to vaccination against the disease – and certain people exposed to the virus could be offered a vaccine.\n\nThe US has mobilized vaccine for monkeypox to states that have reported cases, and officials plan to move the vaccine where it may be needed, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Thursday.\n\n“The US has the resources we need to help us respond to monkeypox in this country right now. We’ve been preparing for this type of outbreak for decades,” she said.\n\nThe US has two preventive vaccines and two antiviral treatments that can be used for orthopox, the family of viruses that includes monkeypox.\n\n“One of these vaccines, with the trade name of Jynneos, is approved for the prevention of monkeypox disease in adults 18 years of age and older,” Walensky said. “CDC has mechanisms in place to move these products around the country so that they can be used for prevention or treatment for people who may benefit, wherever they may be.”\n\nCDC officials are recommending vaccination for people at highest risk of infection due to direct contact with someone who has monkeypox.\n\n“Right now, while we are in the early phase of investigating this, we know that those at highest risk for infection are those who had contact with a known monkeypox patient, with the kind of contact that would facilitate spread. So those are the individuals we’re really focusing on recommending vaccination for right now: post-exposure vaccination,” said Dr. Jennifer McQuiston, a veterinarian and deputy director of the CDC’s Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology.\n\n“We continue to watch what is happening and think about whether wider vaccination recommendations would make sense, but at this time, we only have nine known cases, and we have contacts that we’ve identified associated with those cases that would likely most benefit from vaccines,” McQuiston said. “And so that’s where we’re focusing our energies right now.”\n\nVaccines for monkeypox have been made available to some health care workers treating infected people.\n\n“I’m happy to report, even with the first case in Boston at Massachusetts General Hospital, our colleagues across the government have been able to get vaccines to that hospital. And just yesterday they’ve already started offering the vaccines to health care workers who have been exposed,” Dr. Raj Panjabi, who leads the White House’s monkeypox response, told CNN’s Laura Coates on Monday night.\n\n“The first part is to identify those who are infected and to isolate them and make sure that they get the care they need,” Panjabi said. “The second part is to ensure we vaccinate those who’ve been exposed to the infected individuals. If we do that again and again – and that’s our approach at the White House and across the government – then we have a better chance of ending this outbreak.”\n\nDr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, says not to expect a large-scale rollout of vaccines.\n\n“I think that we will need to use vaccinations in contacts of cases. This isn’t something where everybody lines up and gets vaccinated,” he said of the current outbreak. “That’s going to be critical to stopping cases.”\n\nWhat vaccines could work against monkeypox?\n\nA senior Biden administration official said Tuesday that there’s sufficient vaccine to cover the United States’ current level of cases.\n\n“Right now, we have over 1,000 doses of [Jynneos] available, and we expect that level to ramp up very quickly in the coming weeks as the company provides more doses to us,” McQuiston said Monday.\n\nThe CDC estimates that the vaccine is at least 85% effective in preventing monkeypox, based on data from Africa.\n\nAnother vaccine, called ACAM2000, is licensed in the United States to prevent smallpox. Although the vaccine could be used to prevent monkeypox, it is not licensed for that.\n\nThe United States has more than 100 million doses of ACAM2000, McQuiston said.\n\n“ACAM2000 is an older-generation smallpox vaccine that has some potential significant side effects with it,” she said. “So a decision to use that widely would have to have some serious discussion behind it.”\n\nACAM2000 is a live virus vaccine – and once the shot is given, a lesion will develop at that site. Because the virus grows at the site of the lesion, it can spread to other parts of the body or even to other people, according to the CDC, which is why people who get ACAM2000 “must take precautions” to prevent the spread.\n\nIn comparison, the Jynneos vaccine is given as a live virus that is non-replicating. That means there is no visible “take” and, as a result, no risk of viral spread, according to the CDC. Some common vaccine side effects include pain at the injection site, muscle pain, headache or fatigue.\n\nWho should get vaccinated against monkeypox?\n\nMost people won’t be vaccinated against monkeypox.\n\nThe CDC’s Advisory Committee and Immunization Practices voted last year to recommend vaccination for select groups at risk for monkeypox and other related viruses due to their occupations, like research lab personnel and health care workers.\n\nAmid the global outbreak, World Health Organization officials plan to make recommendations on who should be prioritized to receive a smallpox vaccination to lower their risk of monkeypox.\n\n“We will be making recommendations on who should be prioritized for this,” Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s emerging diseases and zoonoses lead and technical lead on Covid-19, said during a social media Q&A Monday.\n\n“This is not something that everybody needs. It is a virus that is spreading between people who are coming in close contact with those who are cases,” Van Kerkhove said. “We really need to discuss evidence-based use of these measures, access and equity.”\n\nAndy Seale, strategies adviser for the WHO Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and STI Programmes, added that vaccinations should be considered for countries where monkeypox is endemic, which are in West and Central Africa.\n\n“Communities are already saying to us, ‘if we get this right, if we contain this, if we get the access right for the outbreak, we have to do this for the endemic countries as well,’ ” Seale said.\n\nCan someone get vaccinated after being exposed to monkeypox?\n\nVaccination after exposure to monkeypox virus can still offer some protection, according to the CDC.\n\n“That’s the norm. We usually don’t do vaccination of everybody beforehand. We use vaccination as post-exposure prophylaxis,” Adalja said.\n\n“Because monkeypox has a long incubation period, just like smallpox – it’s 12 days or so, on average, for monkeypox – you can intervene with a vaccine in an exposed person, and it will abort the infection,” he said. “Or if you do get an infection, maybe it gets to them really late or late in the incubation period, it makes the infection less severe.”\n\nBut the sooner an exposed person gets the vaccine, the better. The CDC recommends giving the vaccine within four days of exposure in order to prevent illness. If it’s given between four and 14 days of exposure, vaccination may reduce the symptoms but may not prevent the disease itself.\n\nOverall, people who have been exposed to the monkeypox virus and have not gotten the vaccine within the past three years should consider getting vaccinated, according to the CDC.\n\nWill a smallpox vaccination protect against monkeypox?\n\n“Because monkeypox virus is closely related to the virus that causes smallpox, the smallpox vaccine can protect people from getting monkeypox,” the CDC website says. “Smallpox and monkeypox vaccines are effective at protecting people against monkeypox when given before exposure to monkeypox. Experts also believe that vaccination after a monkeypox exposure may help prevent the disease or make it less severe.”\n\nScientists have known for years that smallpox vaccines can be effective in preventing monkeypox, too. The variola virus that causes smallpox and the monkeypox virus belong to the same family.\n\n“The viruses come from the same family of viruses, and what we’ve seen in prior monkeypox outbreaks is that vaccinating contacts does abort infection or attenuate infection in those individuals with monkeypox,” Adalja said.\n\nThere probably is some “remnant” of protection against monkeypox for adults who were vaccinated against smallpox as children, he said, but it may not be full protection.\n\n“The smallpox vaccination program ended in the 1970s in the United States. Obviously, if someone is in the US military and they got vaccinated last year, I’m sure they’re completely protected,” Adalja said. “But people who got vaccinated as children in the era when smallpox was a routine childhood vaccination, they may have some residual immunity.”\n\nThe senior administration official said Tuesday that, theoretically, there is some protection offered from a previous smallpox vaccination, but there is not good evidence on how much protection – and that protection could wane over time.\n\nHas the monkeypox virus changed with this outbreak?\n\nThe official said that it doesn’t seem like anything has changed about the biology of the monkeypox virus and that the chances of contracting it are still very low for the general public.\n\nWHO officials have not found evidence of the monkeypox virus changing or mutating in this outbreak. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the licensed vaccines won’t work against the currently circulating virus.\n\n“It’s a very stable virus. So we don’t yet have evidence that there’s mutation in the virus itself,” Rosamund Lewis, head of smallpox secretariat at WHO Emergencies Programme, said during the Q&A on Monday.\n\n“We are beginning to collect that information,” Lewis added. “We will be convening our groups of virologists and other experts who will discuss this very question based on the sequence of the genome of some of the cases that are being detected.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThat is a “key question” that is important to answer, said Dr. Daniel Rhoads, co-chair of the College of American Pathologists Microbiology Committee.\n\n“Did something change with the biology, or is this just an unusual situation that hasn’t happened before or we haven’t recognized it before? I think anytime there’s a change in geography for these endemic diseases, that’s a key question,” said Rhoads, a pathologist at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.\n\n“Whenever we see a new infection or an infection transmitted in what seems to be a new way, I always wonder, is this just something we haven’t recognized before that’s always been around? Or is this an actual biological change, which would be due to a mutation in the virus? I don’t know,” Rhoads said.\n\n“My guess is, once they sequence the virus causing the current outbreak, they’ll be able to compare it to known sequences, and then hopefully we’ll have some insight as to whether or not this is kind of the same old monkeypox or if there’s something that appears to be different.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/05/24"}]}

It comes as fears of political violence directed toward lawmakers remain high in the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol as well as other high-profile violent incidents that have targeted members of Congress in recent years.\n\nNancy Pelosi was able to speak to her husband after the attack and before he was taken into surgery, according to a source familiar with the matter. The speaker flew with her family to San Francisco on Friday to be with her husband, and another source familiar told CNN Friday evening that she was at the hospital.\n\n“The Speaker and her family are thankful for the outpouring of support and prayers from friends, constituents and people around the country.

We will bring forward multiple felony charges on Monday and expect DePape to be arraigned on Tuesday. DePape will be held accountable for his heinous crimes,” she wrote.\n\nScott detailed Friday evening what responding law enforcement officers witnessed when they arrived at the scene.\n\nWhen officers arrived at the Pelosi residence, Scott said, the front door was opened “by someone inside,” and the officers – from outside the door – observed Pelosi and DePape each had a hand “on a single hammer.”\n\nWhile still outside the home, officers saw DePape pull the hammer away from Pelosi and attack Pelosi, the police chief said. Scott went on to say that Pelosi was struck by DePape at least once.\n\nAt an earlier news conference, Scott said the suspect had “pulled a hammer away from Mr. Pelosi and violently assaulted him with it.”\n\n“Our officers immediately tackled the suspect, disarmed him, took him into custody, requested emergency backup and rendered medical aid,” he continued.\n\nPaul Pelosi was able to call 911 at the start of the attack, according to a law enforcement source and another source familiar with the matter.

Scott declined to provide additional details on the suspect’s condition Friday evening.\n\n‘Too much hatred’\n\nThe man who allegedly attacked Paul Pelosi early Friday posted memes and conspiracy theories on Facebook about Covid vaccines, the 2020 election and the January 6 attack, and an acquaintance told CNN that he seemed “out of touch with reality.”\n\nDePape was not known to US Capitol Police and was not in any federal databases tracking threats, according to three sources who were briefed on the investigation.\n\nThe US Capitol Police said in a statement earlier in the morning that they are assisting the FBI and the San Francisco Police “with a joint investigation” into the break-in at the Pelosi residence in California.\n\nThe assailant entered the Pelosi residence through the back of the house, according two sources familiar with the early details of the incident.\n\nWith Speaker Pelosi away, there would not have been a security detail at the residence, according to one source familiar with protocol.\n\nThere may be video that US Capitol Police and law enforcement can review as there are security cameras at the home, according to two law enforcement sources.\n\nPaul Pelosi, right, the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, of California, follows his wife as she arrives for her weekly news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington on March 17, 2022.

He is expected to be arraigned on Tuesday.\n\n“We are coordinating closely with federal and local law enforcement partners on this investigation. We will bring forward multiple felony charges on Monday and expect [suspect David DePape] to be arraigned on Tuesday. DePape will be held accountable for his heinous crimes,” San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins tweeted Friday evening.\n\nHere’s a look at what we know – and still don’t know – about the attack:\n\nHow it unfolded\n\nAn intruder, identified by police as David DePape, 42, confronted the 82-year-old Paul Pelosi with a hammer early Friday morning, shouting, “Where is Nancy? Where is Nancy?” according to a law enforcement source. The assailant attempted to tie Pelosi up “until Nancy got home,” two sources familiar with the situation told CNN.\n\nPelosi called 911 when he encountered the threatening man and left the line open so a dispatcher could hear his conversation with DePape, speaking surreptitiously but making it clear that he needed help, according to a law enforcement source.\n\nSan Francisco police entered the home around 2:27 a.m. local time Friday (5:27 a.m. ET) to find Pelosi struggling over a hammer with a man, who has since been identified as DePape, according to the city’s police chief. Officers saw DePape “violently assault” Pelosi with the hammer before they tackled him to the ground and arrested him.\n\n“It is really thanks to Mr. Pelosi having the ability to make that call, and truly the attention and the instincts of that dispatcher to realize that something was wrong in that situation and to make the police call a priority so they got there within two minutes to respond to this situation,” Jenkins told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Friday.\n\nPolice said the DePape entered through a back door and it wasn’t clear if he circumvented any security measures.\n\nPelosi was taken to a hospital after the attack and underwent a “successful surgery to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands,” Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, said in a statement early Friday evening. He is expected to make a full recovery.\n\nMotive remains unknown\n\nAuthorities said Friday that the suspect is in the hospital for minor injuries. DePape was not known to US Capitol Police and was not in any federal databases tracking threats, according to three sources who were briefed on the investigation. But he had posted memes and conspiracy theories on Facebook about Covid-19 vaccines, the 2020 election and the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.\n\nA police officer stands outside the home of Nancy and Paul Pelosi in San Francisco on October 28, 2022. Godofredo A. Vásquez/AP\n\nUS Capitol Police said in a statement Friday that it is assisting the FBI and the San Francisco Police “with a joint investigation” into the break-in.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have not provided a motive for the attack, but San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said in a news conference Friday that the attack was “intentional” and “not a random act.”\n\n“It’s wrong. Our elected officials are here to do the business of their cities, their counties, their states and this nation. Their families don’t sign up for this to be harmed and it is wrong,” Scott said.\n\nFears of political violence grow\n\nNancy Pelosi was not home at the time of the attack but traveled to California on Friday to be with her husband. The security detail for lawmakers, including the speaker, does not protect their spouses when the members of Congress are not with them. Pelosi was able to speak to her husband following the attack and before he was taken into surgery, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe attack sent shock waves through Washington and sparked an outpouring of condolences and condemnation from congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle. It has also underscored fears of political violence directed toward lawmakers in the wake of the January 6 insurrection, as well as other high-profile violent incidents that have targeted lawmakers in recent years.\n\nPresident Joe Biden described the attack on Paul Pelosi as “despicable” and directly tied the assault to growing strains of right-wing extremism.\n\n“This is despicable. There’s no place in America – there’s too much violence, political violence. Too much hatred. Too much vitriol,” Biden told a fundraising dinner Friday in Philadelphia.\n\nSenate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell said in a tweet Friday that he was “horrified and disgusted” by the reports while House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy’s office said he had reached out to the speaker, a fellow Californian.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris said the assault was more evidence of “scary stuff” happening in politics around the country.\n\nAt a campaign rally Saturday in Baltimore, Harris recalled a time in the US when it was “appreciated that it is the diversity of opinions that will lead us to progress, to smart decisions.”\n\nBut now, she said, certain “so-called leaders” were using their positions to advance “preservation of their personal power” and to divide the country. They are “using the bully pulpit in a way that is propagating hate,” the vice president said.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, speaking at the same rally, asked people to pray for Paul Pelosi and reflect on what led to the brutal attack.\n\n“I want you to think upon the environment that has been created in America by some who would bring us down, who would pit one another against one another, who would degrade our Constitution and our declaration and our proposition that ‘all men and women are created equal’” the Maryland Democrat said. “We say, ‘Those truths are self-evident,’ but they are not self-executing. It is up to us to make sure that America survives the hate and division that too many purvey in our country.”\n\nRepublican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, who is set to become House Oversight chairman if the GOP gains control of the House next year, said both Republicans and Democrats need to tone down the political rhetoric and admitted that he too could work on that.\n\n“I condemn any attack of political violence from anyone of either party. It’s wrong,” Comer told CNN’s Pamela Brown on CNN Newsroom on Saturday. “I’ve said for several years now the rhetoric keeps getting worse and worse. It’s very difficult environment out there. You have a lot of people that get so fired up, because of various political causes. It puts many politicians in a dangerous spot.”\n\nComer referred back to the 2017 shooting at a baseball practice in which then-House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and several others were shot.\n\n“It’s a terrible environment, and I believe people in both parties are guilty of intense rhetoric that really leads to – feed into these people who are deranged, and create violence. It’s the same thing that happened with the shooter that shot at Steve Scalise and several other Republican colleagues. Violence is wrong, these people need to be put in jail for the rest of their life, and we need to try and do better in both parties. Myself included,” Comer said.\n\n‘An open investigation’\n\nAuthorities in San Francisco are appealing to the public to provide tips regarding the attack.\n\n“While an arrest has been made, this remains an open investigation,” the San Francisco Police Department said in a statement.\n\nAnyone with information is asked to call the SFPD Tip Line at 1-415-575-4444.", "authors": ["Shawna Mizelle"], "publish_date": "2022/10/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/politics/paul-pelosi-attack-latest-depape-court/index.html", "title": "David DePape: Suspect in Paul Pelosi attack awoke him by standing ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nDisturbing new details have emerged in the attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, including that the alleged assailant told police he was on a “suicide mission” and had a list of other prominent targets.\n\nCourt documents released on Tuesday show that the man arrested in the assault, David DePape, allegedly awoke Paul Pelosi by standing over his bedside and prevented him from escaping – all while demanding to know the whereabouts of the House speaker.\n\n“This was not a random act of violence. This was not a random residential burglary. This is something that was specifically targeted,” San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said Tuesday.\n\nHere’s what we presently know about the attack.\n\n‘Suicide mission’\n\nDePape, 42, told officers and medics at the scene that he was sick of the “level of lies” coming from Washington, DC, and “came here to have a little chat with [Pelosi’s] wife,” according to a Tuesday court filing.\n\n“I didn’t really want to hurt him, but you know this was a suicide mission. I’m not going to stand here and do nothing even if it cost me my life,” DePape allegedly said.\n\nDePape named several targets, according to the filing, including prominent state and federal politicians and their relatives.\n\nJenkins confirmed to CNN earlier Tuesday that authorities believe DePape had other “targets” besides the House speaker.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Like something from a Stephen King novel': Analyst describes Pelosi attack 03:06 - Source: CNN\n\nAsked by CNN’s Erin Burnett about the suspect’s alleged plans, Jenkins said that “there were other public officials that were apparently targets of his, and obviously he showed up at the speaker’s house first.” The case, Jenkins said, is still “very fresh” and she declined to give specific details of who had been a potential target.\n\nDePape has been “cooperative” with police and “submitted to a lengthy interview” before obtaining representation through counsel, according to the district attorney.\n\nChilling new details\n\nCourt documents released on Tuesday revealed chilling new details about the encounter. DePape allegedly awoke a startled Paul Pelosi shortly after 2 am at his bedside, carrying a large hammer and several white zip ties, as CNN has previously reported.\n\n“Are you Paul Pelosi?” DePape asked, according to the documents. He then demanded to know, “Where’s Nancy? Where’s Nancy?,” to which a groggy Paul Pelosi replied, “She’s not here.”\n\nHe then threatened to tie up Paul Pelosi and prevented him from escaping via elevator, according to the documents. Paul Pelosi asked DePape why he wanted to see his wife.\n\n“Well, she’s number two from the presidency, right?,” DePape said.\n\nAfter Paul Pelosi confirmed that she was, DePape said, “we’ve got to take them all out,” referring to politicians, according to the court documents.\n\nAt one point, DePape allowed Pelosi to use the bathroom, and it was during this time that he was able to use his cell phone to call 911, according to the court documents. Pelosi spoke cryptically to police during the brief call and was able to subtly identify himself to the dispatcher, who was then able to escalate the call.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear details from Paul Pelosi's coded 911 call that led to his rescue 01:58 - Source: CNN\n\nFollowing the call, the two men went downstairs, with DePape walking behind Pelosi and carrying with him the hammer and zip ties, according to the documents. Downstairs, DePape, noting that police would be arriving soon, told Pelosi: “I can take you out.” He then walked over to Pelosi while holding the hammer upright, causing Pelosi to reach out and put his hand on it.\n\nThe officers arrived at the scene at this point, and after Pelosi opened the door and greeted them, one of them turned on their flashlight and saw the two men holding opposite ends of the hammer, according to the court documents. An officer ordered them to drop hammer, but DePape pulled it away from Pelosi, “immediately stepped back and lunged at Mr. Pelosi, striking Mr. Pelosi in the head at full force with the hammer, which knocked Mr. Pelosi unconscious.”\n\n“The officers rushed into the house, tackled (DePape), and disarmed him. Mr. Pelosi remained unresponsive for about three minutes, waking up in a pool of his own blood,” the documents said.\n\nHow US Capitol Police learned of break-in\n\nUS Capitol Police first learned of the break-in at the San Francisco home about 10 minutes after the incident when an officer noticed police lights and sirens on a live camera feed in the Capitol Police’s Washington, DC, command center, according to a source briefed on the attack.\n\nCNN previously reported there may be video of the break-in that US Capitol Police and law enforcement could review as there are security cameras at the home, according to two law enforcement sources.\n\nThe San Francisco Police Department had stopped regularly posting a patrol car outside Pelosi’s house last year, according to two additional sources.\n\nDePape in court\n\nDePape entered a not guilty plea Tuesday to all state charges during his initial appearance in court.\n\nHe also waived his right to a hearing within 10 days at his arraignment in a San Francisco court room. Judge Diane Northway set a hearing for November 4 in San Francisco Superior Court to set a date for the preliminary hearing and bail setting.\n\nDePape has been charged with a litany of crimes, including assault, attempted murder and attempted kidnapping, following last week’s break-in.\n\nThe attempted kidnapping charge carries a maximum of 20 years in prison. He has not yet entered a plea in federal court.\n\nDePape’s attorney, Adam Lipson, said outside the courtroom, “There’s been a lot of speculation, a lot of rumor, simply based on the nature of this case. So I’m not going to add to all the speculation by talking about the facts of this case right now.”\n\n“What I will say is that there’s been a lot of speculation regarding Mr. DePape’s vulnerability to misinformation and that’s certainly something we are going to look into, that we are going to delve into, as his defense team, but again it would be premature to talk about that at this time,” Lipson said.\n\nSecurity concerns mount\n\nUS Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger said Tuesday the agency has “engaged in a review” of the incident and said the current political climate calls for more resources for the physical safety of members of Congress.\n\n“We believe today’s political climate calls for more resources to provide additional layers of physical security for Members of Congress,” Manger said in a written statement.\n\n“This plan would include an emphasis on adding redundancies to the measures that are already in place for Congressional leadership. Hopefully you can understand that we cannot disclose the details about these improvements because our country cannot afford to make it easier for any potential bad actors,” he added.\n\nManger also said the Capitol Police has “worked diligently to investigate reported threats, improve intelligence collection and analysis, and strengthen our partnerships with law enforcement agencies across the country to provide security for Members when they are traveling outside Washington, DC.”\n\nCalifornia Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on Tuesday that lawmakers won’t be any safer “until we call out what is the root cause of this political violence.”\n\n“The head of the RNC, Ronna McDaniel and also Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader, expressed sadness for Paul Pelosi. But then went onto say ‘it’s really a product of crime – that’s the Democrats fault.’”\n\n“That’s like saying Lee Harvey Oswald was connected with crime in Dallas or John Wilkes Booth was the result of a crime problem at Ford’s Theater. Not only is it ridiculous, it is part of the problem of dismissing what is causing this violence,” Lofgren said.\n\nTrump fans conspiracy theory\n\nJust one day after releasing a tepid but grounded statement on the incident, former President Donald Trump fanned the flames of an unfounded conspiracy about the attack.\n\n“It’s weird things going on in that household in the last couple of weeks,” Trump said. “You know, probably, you and I are better off not talking about it. The glass, it seems, was broken from the inside to the out and, you know, so, it wasn’t a break in, it was a break out,” the former President told conservative radio host Chris Stigall.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Disturbing' conspiracy theory takes root following Pelosi attack 03:37 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump went on to say that he’s “not a fan of Nancy Pelosi,” but that what happened was “very sad.” He added: “The whole thing is crazy. I mean, if there’s even a little bit of truth to what’s being said, it’s crazy. But the window was broken in and it was strange the cops were standing there practically from the moment it all took place.”\n\nIn the days following the attack, several prominent right-wing figures have floated conspiracy theories about the attack – including that Paul Pelosi and the intruder were gay lovers who had gotten into a fight.\n\nThe spurious theory traces back to an incorrect early news report and a handful of pieces of evidence that its proponents have spun wildly out of context. It runs entirely contrary to the explanation police and federal law enforcement have outlined.\n\n“There is absolutely no evidence that Mr. Pelosi knew this man,” San Francisco Police Chief William Scott told CNN in an interview. “As a matter of fact, the evidence indicates the exact opposite.”\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake – whose embrace of Trump’s brand of politics has been a central part of her campaign – claimed she was not making light of the assault earlier in the week despite clearly joking about a lack of security at the Pelosis’ home.\n\nIn contrast, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican who drew criticism last week after referencing the attack as part of a political swipe at Nancy Pelosi, expressed regret over his remark.\n\n“At the end of the day, I really wanted to express the fact that what happened to Speaker Pelosi’s husband was atrocious. And I didn’t do a great job,” he told Punchbowl News.", "authors": ["Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/politics/glenn-youngkin-virginia-paul-pelosi/index.html", "title": "Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin just showed how not to respond to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nJust hours removed from the news that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband had been attacked at the couple’s San Francisco home, Gov. Glenn Youngkin was on the stump for fellow Virginia Republican Yesli Vega, who is running for a House seat.\n\nAnd Youngkin said this: “Speaker Pelosi’s husband had a break-in last night in their house, and he was assaulted. There’s no room for violence anywhere, but we’re gonna send her back to be with him in California. That’s what we’re going to go do.”\n\nCNN reported that the intruder shouted “Where is Nancy?” before the attack and tried to tie Paul Pelosi up until his wife got home. The man suspected of the attack posted memes and conspiracy theories on social media about Covid-19, the 2020 election and the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol.\n\nIt’s easy to shake your head at what Youngkin said. It was clearly inappropriate and horrendously badly timed. But what makes it all worse is that it’s extremely unlikely that Youngkin, who is regularly mentioned as a potential 2024 Republican presidential candidate, will pay any political price for what he said. And in some circles, he might even get a boost from it.\n\nThanks in no small part to Donald Trump, the lines across which politicians were unwilling to go have been blurred, if not entirely eliminated. You can get away with saying anything and everything about the other political party because, well, they are viewed now as not just misguided, but purposely doing things that will decimate America.\n\nA recent NBC News poll found that 81% of Democrats and 79% of Republicans said the other party’s agenda will “destroy” America. And even this morning on his Truth Social site, Trump was decrying the “Radical Left Lunatics and Maniacs that truly hate our country” as part of a post celebrating Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover.\n\nWhen the threat the opposing party poses is seen in such existential terms, seemingly anything – whether it be in words or action – becomes justified. And when extreme rhetoric is rewarded rather than punished, guess what you get? More extreme rhetoric.\n\n“When you convince people that politicians are rigging elections, drink babies blood, etc, you will get violence,” tweeted Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger. “This must be rejected.”\n\nFollowing the rally, Youngkin spokeswoman Macaulay Porter told CNN, “As the governor clearly said, the assault on Paul Pelosi was wrong and there is no place for violence. He wishes him a full recovery and is keeping the Pelosi family in his prayers.”\n\nYoungkin’s comment and the attack on Paul Pelosi come amid a rising number of threats against members of Congress and their families.\n\nAs CNN reports:\n\n“Calls for violence against lawmakers online and elsewhere have referenced both elected officials and their families, according to sources familiar with the threat environment who told CNN that law enforcement agencies have been grappling with how to address those threats in the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.”\n\nUnfortunately, there is no evidence that even events like what happened with Paul Pelosi will cool down the hot rhetoric. In fact, there’s evidence that such rhetoric will draw people to the politician willing to cross all previously held boundaries.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/politics/paul-pelosi-attack-what-we-know/index.html", "title": "Paul Pelosi attack: What we know about the assault on the House ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe man alleged to have attacked Paul Pelosi, husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, entered a not guilty plea Tuesday to all state charges during his initial appearance in San Francisco court.\n\nDavid DePape, 42, is facing a litany of state charges, including attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon, San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said Monday. These charges are in addition to the federal charges DePape faces, which include assault and attempted kidnapping.\n\nDePape waived his right to a hearing within 10 days at his arraignment Tuesday, and Judge Diane Northway set a hearing for November 4 in San Francisco Superior Court to set a date for the preliminary hearing and bail setting.\n\nNo cameras were allowed in court for the arraignment.\n\nDePape’s attorney, Adam Lipson, said outside the courtroom, “There’s been a lot of speculation, a lot of rumor, simply based on the nature of this case.

Pelosi further conveyed that he does not know who the male is. The male said his name is David,” an FBI agent said in a sworn affidavit that was unsealed Monday.\n\nPaul Pelosi called 911 at 2:23 a.m. PT on Friday, and police arrived at his house eight minutes later, according to the affidavit unsealed Monday.\n\n“When the door was opened, Pelosi and DePape were both holding a hammer with one hand and DePape had his other hand holding onto Pelosi’s forearm,” the affidavit said. “Pelosi greeted the officers. The officers asked them what was going on. DePape responded that everything was good. Officers then asked Pelosi and DePape to drop the hammer.”\n\nAt that moment, DePape allegedly pulled the hammer away and swung it, striking Paul Pelosi in the head. Pelosi “appeared to be unconscious on the ground” after the blow, the affidavit said.\n\n“DePape was prepared to detain and injure Speaker Pelosi when he entered the Pelosi residence in the early morning of October 28, 2022,” the FBI agent said in the affidavit. “DePape had zip ties, tape, rope, and at least one hammer with him that morning.”\n\nCNN previously reported that DePape confronted Pelosi and asked where his wife was, shouting, “Where is Nancy?” The speaker was not home at the time of the attack.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, “DePape stated that he was going to hold Nancy hostage and talk to her. If Nancy were to tell DePape the ‘truth,’ he would let her go, and if she ‘lied,’ he was going to break ‘her kneecaps.’”\n\n“DePape was certain that Nancy would not have told the ‘truth,’” the FBI affidavit said.\n\n‘There’s no place for it in this country’\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas condemned the “horrific, violent attack,” during an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Monday.\n\n“There’s no place for it in this country,” Mayorkas said in his first remarks since the attack last week, adding that it was difficult to label the incident “domestic terrorism” because of the legal implications of the term.\n\nOn the same day that Pelosi was attacked, federal authorities warned in a joint assessment that domestic violent extremists pose a heightened threat to the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nAsked if he was worried about copycat attacks, Mayorkas said, domestic violent extremism is “one of the greatest terrorism-related” threats to the US, noting that DHS tracks the threat environment and pushes information out to state and local law enforcement authorities, so they are alert to the threat.\n\nMeanwhile, US Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger said Tuesday the agency has “engaged in a review” of the incident and said the current political climate calls for more resources for the physical safety of members of Congress.\n\n“We believe today’s political climate calls for more resources to provide additional layers of physical security for Members of Congress,” Manger said in a written statement.\n\n“This plan would include an emphasis on adding redundancies to the measures that are already in place for Congressional leadership.

Both were holding a hammer.\n\nThe suspect took the hammer away from Pelosi and “violently assaulted” Pelosi, according to Scott. Officers then immediately tackled the suspect, disarmed him and took him into custody.\n\nPolice said Paul Pelosi was able to call 911 during the attack. He was able to communicate the level of danger he was in, even though the suspect was in earshot, Scott said at Friday's press briefing.\n\n\"What he (Pelosi) said, she (the dispatcher) felt there was something more to it,\" the chief said, crediting the dispatcher for the quick response.\n\nThe chief said the response of the dispatcher and responding officers may have been \"life saving.\"\n\nPaul Pelosi underwent surgery for skull fracture; full recovery expected\n\nPaul Pelosi underwent successful surgery following Friday morning’s attack, according to Drew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi's spokesman.\n\n“Mr. Pelosi was admitted to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital where he underwent successful surgery to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands,\" Hamill said in a statement. \"His doctors expect a full recovery.\"\n\nThe attacker threatened Paul Pelosi life while demanding to see the speaker, Hammill said.\n\n“The Speaker and her family are thankful for the outpouring of support and prayers from friends, constituents and people around the country,\" Hammill said. \"The Pelosi family is immensely grateful to Mr. Pelosi’s entire medical team and the law enforcement officers who responded to the assault.\"\n\nSecret Service and Capitol Police were guarding the hospital, reports said.\n\nWho is David DePape? Suspect in Paul Pelosi attack has 'strong opinions,' family member said\n\nTeresa DePape, who is married to the suspect’s stepfather living in Powell River, British Columbia, told USA TODAY that DePape had left the area for California about 20 years ago.\n\n“I didn’t know David to be a violent person,” she said. “But he was an aggressive speaker.”\n\nThe family had not been in regular contact with the suspect, but Teresa DePape said David emailed his stepfather a couple years ago, indicating that he would visit the area and did not follow up.\n\n“Estranged sounds too heavy,” she said, characterizing the suspect’s relationship.\n\nWho is David DePape?:What we know (so far) about the suspect who attacked Paul Pelosi\n\nMotive for attack still under investigation, chief says\n\nScott said the motive for the attack remained under investigation and did not address reports that the suspect was looking for the speaker.\n\nThe joint inquiry involving U.S. Capitol Police, the FBI and San Francisco Police appeared to underscore law enforcement's increasing focus on the risk to public officials in the volatile political climate\n\nJan. 6 hearing: Video shows Nancy Pelosi faced risk of violence as angry mob hunted her in Capitol\n\nHomeland Security warns extremists pose threat to midterm elections\n\nA nationwide Department of Homeland Security memo Friday warned that \"domestic violent extremists (DVEs) across the ideological spectrum pose a heightened threat to the 2022 midterm elections.\"\n\nThe memo, issued the same day as the Pelosi attack, said lone offenders with heightened election-related zealotry may justify violent attacks.\n\n\"Violence will largely be dependent on drivers such as personalized ideological grievances and the accessibility of potential targets throughout the election cycle.\" said the memo, obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nAs of June 2022, the DOJ and FBI have reviewed more than 1,000 communications reported as \"abusive, harassing, or intimidating,\" and determined 11 percent met federal criteria for further investigative action, the memo said. While many of the communications reviewed by the FBI and DOJ appear to stem from perceptions of voter fraud, the communications are not specific to any single ideology or group.\n\nPast threats to election officials and workers have included attempts to intimidate them in the performance of their duties. The FBI assesses the majority of future threats to election workers in 2022 are likely to occur in states or counties where recounts, audits, or public election disputes occur, the memo said.\n\n-- Kevin Johnson\n\n‘Enough is enough’: Biden denounces attack on Paul Pelosi\n\nPresident Joe Biden opened his remarks at a Democratic Party dinner in Pennsylvania by denouncing the attack against Paul Pelosi and offering prayers for the Pelosi family.\n\nBiden said Pelosi is in “good spirits” and noted that Nancy Pelosi may have been the actual target. He cited news reports that the suspected assailant asked “where’s Nancy” and pointed out that the same chant was yelled by the members of the mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“This is despicable,” he said. “…There's too much violence, political violence, too much hatred, too much vitriol.”\n\nBiden referenced false claims by some Republicans about stolen elections and COVID being a hoax and wondered how they could not realize that such rhetoric would “corrode the political climate” and affect people “who may not be so well balanced.”\n\n“Enough is enough,” he said. “Every person of good conscience needs to clearly and unambiguously stand up against the violence in our politics regardless of what your politics are.”\n\n-- Michael Collins\n\nThreats against lawmakers on the rise since 2017\n\nWhile law enforcement authorities said Friday that the motive for the attack against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband remained under investigation, the assault underscored the deep concern for a recent surge in threats against lawmakers in the past five years.\n\nThe number of threats and so-called “concerning statements” tracked by the United States Capitol Police jumped from nearly 4,000 in 2017 to 9,625 in 2021, according to department data.\n\nResponding to an examination of operations in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack, Capitol Police last year cited the rising threat number.\n\n“Provided the unique threat environment we currently live in, the department is confident the number of cases will continue to increase,” the agency said in a May 2021 statement.\n\nThe specific targeting of Pelosi recalled some of the most troubling moments of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol assault when rioters sought out the speaker, screaming her name as they stalked the halls and later ransacked her office.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, speaking his role as chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, called Friday's attack on Paul Pelosi \"abhorrent.\"\n\n“Every elected official, regardless of political party, should be outraged and publicly condemn what happened today in no uncertain terms,\" Thompson said.\n\nHe called the attack a symptom of a much larger problem.\n\n\"We have seen a rise in domestic terrorism fueled in part by violent, racist, antisemitic, anti-democratic rhetoric,\" Thompson said. \"From Charlottesville to January 6, armed attackers sought to impose their views on their fellow citizens not with their vote, but with their fist. Members of Congress and other Federal, State, and local officials have received death threats. So-called vigilantes have been intimidating voters at ballot drop-boxes and harassing local election officials. America is better than this.\"\n\nNeighborhood is 'pretty horrified' at brazenness of the attack\n\nThe Pelosi large red-brick home is located along a long hilly stretch filled with colorful multi-story Victorian-, Spanish-style mansions alongside modern-looking renovated homes.\n\nOfficers Friday afternoon checked IDs to let residents who live on the block come and go while police and the FBI conducted its investigation.\n\nMany residents said they were awakened by the early morning sounds of police sirens, a common occurrence in the city. Many said they were also surprised that a private security patrol wasn’t around at the time.\n\nJack Bastian, 26, who lives a couple of blocks away, describes the neighborhood with majestic homes as “where the old money in San Francisco lives,” including San Francisco’s power elite and rich tech executives. Many of the homes have scenic views of the city including the Golden Gate and Bay Bridge and within walking distance from the Pacific Ocean.\n\nBastian said he was “pretty horrified” to know that someone would think it’s acceptable to break into a public official’s home. But Bastian said he was “not surprised considering the political rhetoric that’s out here” so close to the midterm elections.\n\nStopping by while walking her dog, Liz Orvos, 59, who also lives a couple of blocks away, said the incident is “very, very sad” and that “I wished I was more surprised, but not given the country’s current political climate.”\n\n“It’s a little scary, to be honest,” said Orvos, who moved to San Francisco from Charlotte, North Carolina, six months ago. “I hope this doesn’t intimidate people from voting, because we all need to vote now more than ever.”\n\n-- Terry Collins\n\nCapitol Police announced offices to protect members of Congress last year\n\nLast year, U.S. Capitol Police announced it was opening regional field offices in California and Florida to better protect members of Congress.\n\n“The USCP has enhanced our staffing within our Dignitary Protection Division as well as coordinated for enhanced security for Members of Congress outside of the National Capitol Region,” the USCP said in July 2021.\n\nBiden, Schumer, Harris offer support for Pelosi\n\nThe attack raises additional questions about the safety of members of Congress and their families as threats to lawmakers are at an all-time high almost two years after the violent Capitol insurrection.\n\n“What happened to Paul Pelosi was a dastardly act,\" Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. \"I spoke with Speaker Pelosi earlier this morning and conveyed my deepest concern and heartfelt wishes to her husband and their family, and I wish him a speedy recovery.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden called the speaker to \"express his support after this horrible attack\" and is praying for Paul Pelosi and the Pelosi family, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. \"He is also very glad that a full recovery is expected,\" she said.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris said she and second gentleman Doug Emhoff are \"appalled\" by the attack.\n\n\"The entire Pelosi family is in our hearts and we wish him a speedy recovery,\" she wrote in a tweet.\n\nFormer President Obama says politics 'too amped up'\n\nBarack Obama said Friday evening while campaigning in Atlanta for Democrats.that politics has gotten too heated.\n\n“I want to take a moment to just say a prayer for a friend of mine, Paul Pelosi, who was attacked,” the former president said.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, he complained that politics has gotten too emotionally charged.\n\n“All of this has been amped up,” he said, blaming social media and platforms he said prioritize the more profitable conflict and controversy ahead of telling the truth. “So I get why people are anxious.\"\n\nBut Obama, who campaigned on hope during his presidential runs, said the country must not despair.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nRepublican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell: 'Disgusted'\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he’s “horrified and disgusted” by reports of the assault on Paul Pelosi.\n\n“Grateful to hear that Paul is on track to make a full recovery and that law enforcement including our stellar Capitol Police are on the case,” McConnell said in a statement.\n\nMcCarthy reached out to Pelosi and is 'praying for a full recovery'\n\nHouse Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy reached out to Pelosi “to check in on Paul and said he’s praying for a full recovery and is thankful they caught the assailant,” said McCarthy’s office in a statement.\n\nHouse GOP Whip Steve Scalise, said he was “Disgusted to hear about the horrific assault on Speaker Pelosi’s husband Paul,” in a statement.\n\nIn 2017, Scalise was shot in a politically motivated attack at a practice session for the annual Congressional Baseball Game.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom: Attack consequence of rhetoric\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, the former mayor of San Francisco, said the attack \"is yet another example of the dangerous consequences of the divisive and hateful rhetoric that is putting lives at risk and undermining our very democracy and Democratic institutions. Those who are using their platforms to incite violence must be held to account.\"\n\nRepublican Sen. Susan Collins 'horrified' by attack\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who released threatening letters and calls she received this spring after protests outside the homes of Supreme Court justices, said her prayers were with Pelosi, her husband and family.\n\n“I am horrified by this vicious attack on Paul Pelosi at his home,” Collins said.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ted Cruz calls assault on Paul Pelosi 'horrific'\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, a frequent critic of the speaker, called Paul Pelosi’s assault “horrific” and said he’s praying for the Pelosi family.\n\n“May God’s protection be upon them. We can have our political differences, but violence is always wrong & unacceptable,” Cruz said in a tweet.\n\nPaul Pelosi's stock trading the subject of scrutiny\n\nPaul Pelosi pleaded guilty in August to a misdemeanor of driving under the influence charge after he was involved in a May crash in Napa Valley and recorded a .082% blood alcohol level, above the legal limit. He was sentenced to five days in jail and three years of probation.\n\nPaul Pelosi, a wealthy investor, has drawn scrutiny from Republicans for successful stock trades they say are tied to policy.\n\nSpeaker Pelosi has access to confidential intelligence and the ability to influence policy decisions that could potentially impact publicly traded companies. Facing public pressure, Congress has debated whether members should be able to buy and sell stocks.\n\nThe speaker in December said it’s “a free-market economy” and members should be able to participate in the stock market. Earlier this year, Pelosi said the House would introduce a bill that would ban lawmakers from trading, but it hasn’t reached a floor vote.\n\nMembers of Congress have received additional money for security at their homes, but some have pushed for more protection as people have shown up at their homes and as members have received an increasing amount of threatening communications.\n\nThis is a developing story.

The first time he groggily discovered a hammer-wielding intruder in his bedroom asking for his wife, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The second time, he regained consciousness in a pool of his own blood, having suffered a fractured skull grappling with the assailant in front of police.\n\nState and federal prosecutors who charged the suspect – David DePape, 42, of Richmond, California – with attempting to murder Paul Pelosi said he was on a suicide mission, threatening to kneecap Nancy Pelosi and hunt down other unspecified public officials, according to court documents.\n\n“It is certainly something that has unnerved us all,” San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins told reporters of the attack, referring to tragedies with past political leaders such as the 1978 assassinations of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and city Supervisor Harvey Milk. “It’s something we have to take very seriously.”\n\nPaul Pelosi released from hospital:House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband left a San Francisco hospital Thursday\n\nDePape, who is being held at the San Francisco County Jail, faces 13 years to life in prison if convicted of state charges including attempted murder, burglary and elder abuse. He has pleaded not guilty and has a hearing scheduled for Friday. Federal prosecutors charged him with assault on a relative of a federal official and attempted kidnapping of a federal official.\n\nPaul Pelosi was released from the hospital Thursday.\n\nHere is what we know about the attack that began just after 2 a.m., from court records and news conferences, as authorities piece together police reports, video from body-worn cameras, a recording of the 911 call and other evidence:\n\nA break-in, a startling wake-up and then a question: ‘Where’s Nancy?’\n\nDePape allegedly said he knew he would be caught on Ring security cameras positioned around the exterior of the Pacific Heights house. But he was surprised to find Paul Pelosi, 82, still asleep after the noise he made smashing the window of a glass door to get inside.\n\nPelosi, who was sleeping in a pajama top and boxer shorts, startled awake to find DePape allegedly standing over him with a hammer in his right hand and several white zip ties in his left hand.\n\n“Are you Paul Pelosi?” DePape allegedly asked. “Where’s Nancy? Where’s Nancy?”\n\nPelosi responded groggily after being awakened. “She’s not here,” he said.\n\n“Well, when is she coming back?” DePape asked.\n\n“She’s in Washington, she’s not going to be back for a couple of days,” Pelosi said.\n\nDePape then threatened to tie up Paul Pelosi about 10 times.\n\n“OK, well, I’m going to tie you up,” DePape said.\n\nPaul Pelosi stood up and tried to leave by an elevator near the bedroom, but DePape held the door and prevented his escape. DePape later told police he blocked the door because he thought it led to a safe room.\n\nPelosi then sat back down on the bed and asked why DePape wanted to see his wife.\n\n“Well, she’s No. 2 in line for the presidency, right?” DePape allegedly said. “We’ve got to take them all out.”\n\nPelosi asked if he could call anyone for DePape, but he allegedly “ominously responded that it was the end of the road for Mr. Pelosi.”\n\nCapitol Police chief:'More resources' needed after attack on Paul Pelosi\n\n'Uh, I've got a problem': Paul Pelosi calls 911 with DePape watching\n\nPelosi then asked to use the bathroom, which DePape allowed. Pelosi’s cellphone was charging in the bathroom, so he turned it on and called 911 at 2:23 a.m. and put the phone on its speaker function.\n\nDePape later told police he knew the call was being recorded but felt Pelosi had pushed him into a corner by making the call. DePape watched him from about 3 feet away while still holding the hammer and zip ties. During the call, Pelosi explained to the dispatcher a man was waiting for Nancy Pelosi to come back, but that she wouldn’t be back for about a day. DePape gestured and told Pelosi to get off the phone.\n\nTo defuse the situation, Paul Pelosi told the dispatcher that he did not need police, fire, or medical assistance. But Pelosi then asked for Capitol Police because they are usually at the house protecting his wife. The San Francisco police dispatcher, Heather Grives, said he called city police and Pelosi said he understood.\n\n“I don’t know, what do you think?” Pelosi asked DePape. Another man was heard responding: “Everything’s good.”\n\n“Uh, he thinks everything’s good,” Pelosi told Grives. “Uh, I’ve got a problem, but he thinks everything’s good.”\n\nThe dispatcher told Pelosi to call back if he changed his mind.\n\n“No, no, no, this gentleman just uh came into the house uh and he wants to wait for my wife to come home,” Pelosi said.\n\nThe dispatcher asked if Pelosi knew the man and he said he didn’t. The dispatcher then asked for Pelosi’s name and address, which Pelosi gave him. DePape then told him to put the phone down.\n\nThe dispatcher asked for the man’s name and he replied, “My name is David.” When the dispatcher asked who David is, Paul Pelosi said he didn’t know.\n\n“I’m a friend of theirs,” DePape said.\n\nBut Pelosi said again he didn’t know the man.\n\n“No, he wants me to get the hell off the phone,” Pelosi said.\n\nThe dispatcher offered to stay on the line but sent police officers to the house when the intruder forced Pelosi to hang up. The dispatcher issued an “A” priority well-being check.\n\nWhat we know:What we know about attack on Paul Pelosi, federal charges against David DePape\n\n‘I can take you out': Pelosi and DePape go downstairs, a struggle occurs, then police arrive\n\nAfter the call, DePape said he was tired and needed to sleep. But he also said he had a backpack downstairs with “a whole bunch of stuff inside,” according to court records.\n\nDePape walked behind Pelosi as they headed downstairs. Turning on the lights, Pelosi could see where DePape entered the house. DePape allegedly said he had to bash windows in the glass door several times to break through.\n\nDePape said the police would be there any minute. Pelosi tried to calm him down by saying they wouldn’t.\n\n“I can take you out,” DePape said.\n\nDePape came around Pelosi with the hammer in his right hand. Pelosi, who feared DePape would strike him, grabbed the hammer’s handle.\n\nAt 2:31 a.m. – about two minutes after the 911 call ended – Police Officers Kolby Wilmes and Kyle Cagney arrived at the house. Wilmes rang the doorbell, but DePape told Pelosi not to open it.\n\nPelosi opened the door with his left hand. In the dimly lit foyer, Pelosi nervously but calmly greeted the officers.\n\n“Everything’s good,” DePape replied, when the officers asked what was going on.\n\nWhen an officer turned on his flashlight, police could see DePape was holding the hammer with one hand and Pelosi’s right arm with the other. Pelosi had his hand on the top of the hammer.\n\n“Drop the hammer!” one officer said.\n\n“Um, nope,” DePape allegedly replied, and raised the hammer. DePape allegedly then tried to pull the hammer away from Pelosi and wrenched his right arm.\n\nAt the same time, Pelosi said: “Hey, hey, hey.” But he couldn’t keep his grip on the hammer.\n\n“What is going on here?” an officer asked.\n\nDePape allegedly wrestled the hammer away from Pelosi, stepped back and lunged for Pelosi, striking him in the head with full force.\n\nThe blow knocked Pelosi unconscious. The two officers rushed into the house and tackled DePape and disarmed him.\n\nPelosi remained unresponsive for about three minutes. He woke up in a pool of his own blood.\n\n“The suspect pulled the hammer away from Mr. Pelosi and violently assaulted him with it,” San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott told reporters. “Our officers immediately tackled the suspect, disarmed him, took him into custody, requested emergency backup and rendered medical aid.”\n\nFire Department medics took Pelosi to San Francisco General Hospital, where he had surgery for a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands.\n\nSan Francisco Police Officer Ariane Starks interviewed Pelosi in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. Pelosi said he didn’t know DePape. In another interview two days later, Paul Pelosi said the hammer didn’t belong to his family.\n\nDePape’s lawyer, deputy public defender Adam Lipson, told reporters after a detention hearing the suspect suffered a dislocated shoulder “during his arrest.\"\n\nSan Francisco DA::Dispatcher's handling of Paul Pelosi's 911 call 'may have saved his life'\n\nDePape 'came here to have a little chat' with Nancy Pelosi\n\nOnce the scuffle ended, San Francisco Police officers asked if anyone else was in the house. DePape allegedly said he acted alone. He looked at the glass door and allegedly said that was where he broke in. The laminated glass was broken near the door handle.\n\nPolice found a cellphone, cash, “clipper” cards for San Francisco’s transit system and an unidentified card from the right pocket of DePape’s shorts. When they asked for his identification, he allegedly said it might be in his backpack on the back porch, near the broken door.\n\nIn the backpack, police found a second hammer, a laptop and more bags of zip ties. The backpack also contained a journal, roll of tape, white rope and two pairs of gloves, one rubber and one cloth. A day later, during the search of a Richmond garage where DePape was staying, FBI agents seized two hammers, a sword, motor vehicle paperwork, IRS letters and Paypal credit cards.\n\nDePape allegedly explained to officers and medics at the scene what he tried to accomplish.\n\n“I’m sick of the insane f------ level of lies coming out of Washington, D.C.,” DePape said. “I came here to have a little chat with his wife.”\n\n'Heartbroken and traumatized':Nancy Pelosi shares first comments since attack on her husband Paul Pelosi\n\nDePape allegedly admitted he intended to take Nancy Pelosi hostage and “break her kneecaps” if she “lied” to him. Then she could be “wheeled into Congress, which would show other members of Congress there were consequences to actions,” according to court records.\n\nDePape said hurting Paul Pelosi wasn’t his goal.\n\n“I didn’t really want to hurt him, but you know this was a suicide mission,” DePape allegedly added. “I’m not going to stand here and do nothing even if it cost me my life.”\n\n“I told him before I attacked him, that he’s escalating things and I will go through him if I have to,” DePape allegedly said.\n\nWhile chatting in the bedroom, DePape allegedly told Pelosi he couldn’t be stopped because he had other targets. DePape later allegedly told police his targets included a local professor, several prominent state and federal politicians and relatives of those officials.\n\n“There has also been a lot of speculation regarding Mr. DePape’s vulnerability to misinformation,” said Lipson, his lawyer. “That’s certainly something we’re going to look into, that we’re going to delve into, as his defense team.”\n\nScott, the police chief, said the department is working with Capitol Police to make the house more secure.\n\n“This has shaken a lot of people,” he said.\n\nDePape allegedly explained to investigators why he didn’t leave after Paul Pelosi called 911. FBI Special Agent Stephanie Minor said DePape compared his efforts to \"the American founding fathers with the British, he was fighting against tyranny without the option of surrender.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/politics/capitol-police-paul-pelosi-attack-david-depape-suicide-mission/index.html", "title": "US Capitol Police first learned of Paul Pelosi attack through live ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nUS Capitol Police first learned of the break-in at the San Francisco home of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about 10 minutes after the incident when an officer noticed police lights and sirens on a live camera feed in the Capitol Police’s Washington, DC, command center, according to a source briefed on the attack.\n\nCNN previously reported there may be video of the break-in that US Capitol Police and law enforcement could review as there are security cameras at the home, according to two law enforcement sources.\n\nThe San Francisco Police Department had stopped regularly posting a patrol car outside Pelosi’s house last year, according to two additional sources.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported the additional details of how Capitol Police became aware of the attack.\n\nThe revelation comes the same day a court filing revealed that the man accused of violently attacking Paul Pelosi, husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, told authorities he was on a “suicide mission” and had plans to target other public officials.\n\nDavid DePape, 42, told officers and medics at the scene that he was sick of the “level of lies” coming from Washington, DC, and “came here to have a little chat with his wife,” the filing said. “I didn’t really want to hurt him, but you know this was a suicide mission. I’m not going to stand here and do nothing even if it cost me my life.”\n\nDePape named several targets, the filing said, including prominent state and federal politicians and their relatives.\n\nCourt filing details more from attack\n\nThe document provides the most detailed account yet of the attack on Paul Pelosi last week, which has touched off fresh concern about violence against lawmakers. Federal law enforcement agencies have consistently warned about the increasing threat of politically motivated violence after January 6, 2021, raising specific concerns about the likelihood that online calls for violence result in real-world attacks.\n\nAccording to the court filing, DePape “smashed through a window in a back door of the Pelosi home in search of” the House speaker and “startled” awake 82-year-old Paul Pelosi, who had been asleep wearing just a pajama top and boxer shorts.\n\n“Are you Paul Pelosi?” DePape asked, standing over Pelosi’s bed around 2 a.m., according to the filing, before repeating: “Where’s Nancy? Where’s Nancy?”\n\nPelosi, who the filing described as “still groggy,” told the suspect, “She’s not here,” before saying his wife was in Washington and was “not going to be back for a couple of days.”\n\n“Okay, well, I’m going to tie you up,” DePape said, according to the filing.\n\nAt one point during the incident, Paul Pelosi asked DePape why he wanted to see Nancy Pelosi. “Well she’s No. 2 from the presidency, right?” DePape said, according to the filing.\n\nWhen Paul Pelosi agreed, DePape allgedly said, “We’ve got to take them all out.”\n\nDePape also said he knew security cameras were everywhere, according to the filing, but that he was intent on taking Nancy Pelosi hostage and breaking her knee caps if she lied to him.\n\nPolice chief praises ‘heroic’ actions\n\nSan Francisco Police Chief William Scott told CNN’s Anderson Cooper Tuesday night that after reviewing police body camera footage of the attack, he believes the suspect intended to kill Paul Pelosi.\n\n“What is crystal clear to me is he tried to kill Mr. Pelosi,” Scott said on “Anderson Cooper 360.”\n\nPelosi appears to have been hit with DePape’s hammer at least once as seen on police body camera footage, but investigators are working to determine if he was hit more than that, Scott said. From the moment the door was opened to when DePape was tackled happened in about three seconds, and was a “very rapid series of events” that was stopped quickly, he said.\n\nEvidence also shows that the incident was clearly a break-in, the police chief said.\n\nPelosi’s 911 phone call was about three minutes long, the chief added, and he was able to subtly identify himself to the dispatcher, who was then able to escalate the call.\n\n“At the end of the day, she did figure it out and raised the priority of the call thinking that wasn’t like what was reported by Mr. Pelosi, there was something more there,” Scott said. “I say again, I think her being able to figure out along with Mr. Pelosi’s keeping his wits about him. He was heroic and the dispatcher figuring out that there was something more was also heroic.”\n\nEarlier Tuesday, DePape entered a not guilty plea to all state charges during an initial appearance in court.

It runs contrary to the explanation police and federal law enforcement have outlined – that the suspect in the attack, David DePape, broke into Pelosi’s house and attacked him.\n\n“There is absolutely no evidence that Mr. Pelosi knew this man,” San Francisco Police Chief William Scott told CNN in an interview. “As a matter of fact, the evidence indicates the exact opposite.”\n\nBut the explosion of social media posts discussing the theory shows how quickly conspiracies can spread, and how eagerly some political actors use falsehoods to push their agendas – even as violent threats against lawmakers have multiplied in recent years.\n\nA conspiracy linked to Nancy Pelosi, who has long been a lightning rod for conservatives and played a starring role in GOP attack ads, was an especially appealing target for right-wing conspiracists, according to Cynthia Miller-Idriss, an American University professor who studies polarization and extremism.\n\n“We have a population that is unable to discern what is true and what’s not, and this spreading of misinformation from credible sources undermines that,” Miller-Idriss said. “People are willing to accept conspiracy theories when they reinforce the narrative they already hold in their head.”\n\nAccording to police and an FBI affidavit included in the federal criminal complaint, DePape broke into a glass door in Pelosi’s San Francisco home early Friday morning, and then went to the bedroom to confront Pelosi, saying he wanted to talk to his wife. Pelosi managed to call 911, and officers arriving on the scene witnessed DePape hit him with a hammer.\n\nThose pushing the “gay lover” theory have pointed to a handful of purported pieces of evidence based on falsehoods and twisted storylines. They say that DePape was in his underwear when police arrived at the scene – but the local TV station that originally reported that has since corrected its story and removed the assertion. Others have suggested that a third person opened the door to Pelosi’s house, but police have debunked that.\n\nMany of the theorists have latched on to a recording of a 911 dispatcher saying that Pelosi referred to DePape as “a friend” and “sounded somewhat confused.”\n\nBut Pelosi seemed to be speaking in coded language on the 911 call to make clear he needed help, a law enforcement source previously told CNN. And the complaint notes that Pelosi told officers he had never seen DePape before.\n\nThe complaint also included an interview police did with DePape in which he admitted breaking into the house and said he surprised Pelosi. According to the complaint, DePape said that he wanted to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage because he viewed her as the “‘leader of the pack’ of lies told by the Democratic Party,” and claimed he was “fighting against tyranny without the option of surrender.”\n\nScott, the San Francisco chief, called the conspiracies surrounding the attack “pathetic” and “disturbing.”\n\n“We’ve spent a lot of energy just pushing back, really ridiculous conspiracy theories, to make sure people stay focused on our team,” he said. “These things are harmful to society, they’re harmful to the victims involved – it’s really sad that we are here in this place, but we are.”\n\nBaseless theory gains momentum on social media\n\nDespite the lack of evidence, it took less than 24 hours after the attack for the “gay lover” theory to take root in right-wing social media circles.\n\nThere have been at least 19,000 tweets mentioning the words “Pelosi” and “gay” since the day of the attack, garnering a total of more than 700,000 likes, according to a CNN analysis – and that doesn’t include tweets referencing the theory without those words, or tweets that have since been deleted.\n\nOne of the first widely shared tweets endorsing the theory appears to have come at 11:36 a.m. on Friday, the day of the attack, gaining more than 2,700 retweets.\n\nThat evening, Raheem Kassam, a former Breitbart writer and co-host of Steve Bannon’s podcast, tweeted, “They’re still pretending it wasn’t Paul Pelosi’s gay lover,” earning over 1,000 retweets.\n\nOther conservative figures like Donald Trump, Jr., Sebastian Gorka, and Dinesh D’Souza followed suit over the next few days, either explicitly endorsing the theory or referencing it approvingly. Rep. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana GOP congressman who sits on the House Homeland Security Committee, tweeted a photo of Nancy Pelosi and referred to DePape as a “male prostitute,” before deleting his tweet.\n\nMusk helped elevate the conspiracy to a much wider audience. On Sunday morning, the billionaire, who just completed his purchase of the social media network, responded to a tweet about the Pelosi attack from Hillary Clinton and wrote “there is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye.” He linked to an article in the Santa Monica Observer, an obscure website, claiming DePape was a male prostitute and Pelosi had been in a drunken dispute with him. The website has previously posted false news, such as a claim during the 2016 election that Clinton had died and been replaced with a body double for a debate.\n\nMusk deleted the tweet around 2 p.m. later that day – but by then, it had already racked up more than 28,000 retweets and 100,000 likes.\n\nConservative figures gleefully praised Musk for sharing the post. “.@ElonMusk just posted a link that says Paul Pelosi may have been drunk and with a gay prostitute,” tweeted Lavern Spicer, a former GOP congressional candidate. “I have never respected him more than now.” Her message was retweeted more than 11,000 times.\n\nGene DePape, the alleged attacker’s stepfather, said it was dismaying to see his stepson turned into a character in a conspiracy theory and used as a political talking point. He told CNN he scrolled through his Facebook news feed for hours over the weekend, where he first saw the posts claiming his estranged stepson had been lovers with Pelosi.\n\n“It’s pretty sick,” he said.\n\nDavid DePape’s own social media and blog postings show that he himself was steeped in conspiracy theories in the months and years before the attack – from musings about QAnon to antisemitic rants to claims of a looming takeover by the global elite.\n\nDePape’s posts on Facebook from last year endorse a litany of right-wing falsehoods. He posted multiple videos produced by My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell falsely alleging that the 2020 election was stolen, linked to websites claiming Covid vaccines were deadly, and shared videos questioning the January 6, 2021attack. CNN reviewed the posts before the social media company took the page down, and several of DePape’s relatives confirmed the page belonged to him.\n\nOn other blogs apparently written by DePape, he also posted antisemitic screeds and endorsed the QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\nSome conservatives’ embrace of the “gay lover” theory has muddied the waters of a story that had led to bipartisan condemnation and sympathy for Pelosi – and distracted from discussion of how other right-wing conspiracies could have inspired violence.\n\nMiller-Idriss, the American University professor, said that prominent figures carelessly spreading misinformation can lead to wider impacts on society.\n\n“It’s dangerous because it undermines peoples’ sense of truth, it helps them further divorce from reality,” she said. “It is a situation where they spread it further – and they pass it on.”", "authors": ["Casey Tolan Curt Devine Scott Bronstein Daniel A.

Twitter\n\nElon Musk will begin laying off Twitter employees this morning, according to a memo sent to staff, as several employees sue the billionaire alleging the layoffs are in violation of labor law. An email sent Thursday evening notified employees that they will receive a notice by 12 p.m. ET today that informs them of their employment status. The memo comes after previous reports said Musk had planned to lay off up to half of the company’s staff after acquiring it last week for $44 billion. Twitter had around 7,500 employees prior to Musk’s takeover. He started his tenure at Twitter by firing its CEO and two other executives, according to two people familiar with the decision. Musk also dissolved Twitter’s former board of directors.\n\n2. Flu\n\nHealth officials are reinforcing their recommendations for people to get flu vaccines as this year’s strain picks up its pace across the US. There have been at least 880,000 cases of influenza, nearly 7,000 hospitalizations and 360 deaths from the flu so far this fall – including one pediatric death – according to data from the CDC. The numbers also show there haven’t been this many cases of influenza so early in the season since 2009. After recently receiving Covid-19 vaccines and boosters, some people have been waiting until later in the season to get the flu vaccine, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen said. However, since it takes about two weeks to reach optimal immune protection after receiving a flu vaccination, people who haven’t gotten one yet should do so now.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Triple threat emerging: flu, Covid, RSV 02:52 - Source: CNN\n\n3.

Student loans\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program remains on hold while a federal appeals court considers a legal challenge brought by six Republican-led states. The Biden administration is still accepting applications for student loan forgiveness, which is worth up to $20,000 per borrower, but it is not currently allowed to cancel student loan debt until the hold is removed. The Biden administration is also facing lawsuits from an attorney general and conservative groups that claim he does not have the legal authority to broadly cancel student loan debt. As for what happens next, an appeals court will decide whether to grant a preliminary injunction requested by the states. If granted, the student loan forgiveness program could be kept on hold while the court hears from both parties. If it’s not granted, debt cancellation may begin while the appeal plays out. The ruling could come at any time.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback College alum tells CNN: The only way to open the door was to take on student loan debt 02:19 - Source: CNN\n\n5.

So say the judges in the World Championship Cheese Contest.\n\nWisconsin cheesemakers swept both categories in the debut of cheese curds in the world championship.\n\nCurds made from Muenster may have been the only bit of surprise when it comes to the winners, but they delivered the squeak and salt with clean, mild flavor.\n\nCheese curds from Arena Cheese (Arena) and Nasonville Dairy (Curtiss) rounded out the unflavored category. Hot Buffalo curds from Ellsworth Cooperative and horseradish cheddar from Cedar Grove Cheese (Plain) clinched the sweep for the state that made these cheese curd categories necessary.\n\nCheese curds were judged in their own categories in 2022 for the first time since the Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association started the World Championship Cheese Contest in 1957.

He said the planned implementation of the Food Safety Mondernization act will result in rule changes, \"it's very unclear what that means for raw-milk cheeses.\"\n\nThe FDA officials sampled raw-milk cheese at the farm, Kehler said.\n\n\"We laid them all out, and to their credit they gobbled them right up,\" he said. \"They're super-tasty.\"\n\nThe tasting was part of a tour of Jasper Hill's \"robust pathogen control program,\" Kehler said. \"We're towing the line and we're going to basically defend these cheeses that are celebrated by the world.\"\n\nAbout 30% of Jasper Hill's market — or roughly $3 million a year in business — comes from the sale of raw-milk cheeses, Kehler said.\n\n\"It's growing as part of our total volume, because we're pinning the future on a handful of raw-milk cheese,\" he said.\n\nThat includes Alpha Tolman and Bayley Hazen Blue, both of which will increase in production in coming years, Kehler said.\n\nIn the last decade, there has been substantial change in the cheese-making industry, Kehler said. He suggested that certain policymakers see artisan cheesemakers as a bunch of hippies.\n\n\"Maybe we are and maybe we're not,\" Kehler said. \"There are companies that started in the 1970s and '80s that grew out of the back to the land movement — a hippie and a couple of goats type of operations — that are real brands now. ...\n\n\"What we're trying to show the FDA is that we're growing up as an industry.\"\n\nThere's a lot of money at stake in the artisan cheese market, hundreds of millions of dollars, Kehler said.\n\n\"We're trying to develop something that's very place-based and going to be able to survive for generations here,\" he said. \"The way that we're going about doing that is by developing these beautiful raw-milk cheeses that we can identify with a place.\"\n\nTo ban raw-milk cheese would be like requiring brewers to filter and heat-treat their beer, Kehler said.\n\n\"You lose the character,\" Kehler said. \"Those beers have a lot more flavor. It's the same thing with cheese. ... We're pushing the boundaries on what's possible under current regulations. We've developed the programs to support the production of these cheeses.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/04/health/mediterranean-diet-2022-best-diet-wellness/index.html", "title": "Mediterranean diet named best diet for 2022 | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for our Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style newsletter, an eight-part series that guides you in a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that’s good for your health.\n\nCNN —\n\nIt’s a winning streak that just won’t quit. For the fifth year in a row, the Mediterranean diet was first across the finish line in the annual race for best diet, according to ratings announced Tuesday by U.S. News & World Report.\n\nTied for silver was the DASH diet, which stands for dietary approaches to stop hypertension, and the Flexitarian diet, which encourages being a vegetarian most of the time, but is flexible enough to allow a burger now and again.\n\nWhat do all of these diets have in common? They stress reducing or eliminating processed foods, and focus on meals full of fruits, vegetables, beans, lentils, whole grains, nuts and seeds.\n\n“I think it’s important to note that the top three diets – Mediterranean, DASH and flexitarian – all offer variety, flexibility and few, if any, rules,” said Gretel Schueller, managing editor of health for U.S. News & World Report, who puts out an annual ranking of diets, in an email.\n\n“All the diets that perform well are safe, sensible and backed by sound science. The diet winners also all provide adequate calories with a focus on vegetables, fruits and whole grains; a modest amount of lean protein, dairy; and an occasional treat,” Schueller added.\n\nA panel of 27 experts examined 40 diets and ranked them on several categories: How easy is the diet to follow; how likely is a person to lose significant weight, both in the short and long term; how effective the diet is in preventing cardiovascular disease or diabetes; and the diet’s nutritional completeness.\n\n“Generally speaking, the top diets are driven by what you can eat – not what you can’t eat. And right now – during these stressful times of the pandemic – that’s especially helpful for people,” Schueller said. “We want food we can enjoy. And we want food that will maintain our health, maybe even boost our immunity. The top-ranked diets offer this.”\n\nMediterranean diet\n\nIn addition to its top spot as best overall diet, the Mediterranean style of eating also captured the blue ribbon in the following categories: easiest diets to follow; best diets for healthy eating; best diets for diabetes and best plant-based diets.\n\nNumerous studies have found the Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, dementia, memory loss, depression and breast cancer. The diet, which is more of an eating style than a restricted diet, has also been linked to stronger bones, a healthier heart and longer life.\n\nThe diet features simple, plant-based cooking, with the majority of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra-virgin olive oil. Fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all, and sugar and refined foods are reserved for special occasions.\n\nRed meat is used sparingly, usually only to flavor a dish. Eating healthy omega 3 oil-packed fish is encouraged, while eggs, dairy and poultry are eaten in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet.\n\nSocial interactions during meals and exercise are basic cornerstones of the Mediterranean style of eating. Lifestyle changes that are part of the diet include eating with friends and family, socializing over meals, mindfully eating favorite foods, as well as mindful movement and exercise.\n\nBest diet for heart health\n\nIn the best heart-healthy diet category, the Mediterranean diet shared the winner’s circle with the Ornish diet, which was created in 1977 by Dr. Dean Ornish, founder of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute in California. Today the diet is offered via the consumer health website Sharecare.\n\nOnly 10% of calories can come from fat, very little of it saturated, the report said: “Most foods with any cholesterol or refined carbohydrates, oils, excessive caffeine and nearly all animal products besides egg whites and one cup per day of nonfat milk or yogurt are banned, though the plan includes some seeds and nuts.”\n\nWhile experts agree that the diet can be overly restrictive and hard to follow, according to Ornish it’s the only scientifically proven program to reverse heart disease without drugs or surgery, as shown in a randomized clinical trial.\n\nThe diet is combined with stress-management techniques, exercise, social support and smoking cessation, which “formed the basis of Ornish’s landmark heart disease-reversal trial in the 1990s,” the report said.\n\nBest diet for diabetes\n\nIn the best diet for diabetes category, the Mediterranean diet took top honors. Tied for second place were the flexitarian and vegan diets.\n\nThe flexitarian diet is a combination of two words: flexible and vegetarian. With this diet, you don’t have to swear off meat completely. You can be a plant eater most of the time and have the occasional steak or burger. A mostly plant-based diet is linked to overall better health and longevity, the report said, including a lower rate of heart disease, diabetes and cancer.\n\nThe vegan diet takes vegetarianism a step further by eliminating all animal products – even dairy and eggs. That means “no refried beans with lard, margarine made with whey and anything with gelatin, which comes from animal bones and hooves,” the report said.\n\nBest overall diet for weight loss\n\nFor this category, the popular WW (formely called Weight Watchers) plan tied with the flexitarian and Volumentrics diets for the No. 1 spot.\n\nThe flexitarian diet wants you to add foods to your diet such as non-meat proteins like beans, peas or eggs, as well as fruits and veggies, whole grains, dairy and seasonings. Then you try to follow the following calorie counts, the report said: “Breakfast choices are around 300 calories, lunches 400 and dinners 500. Snacks are about 150 calories each; add two, and your daily total clocks in at 1,500 calories.”\n\n“If you emphasize the plant-based component of this diet – eating lots of fruits, veggies and whole grains – you’ll likely feel full on fewer calories than you’re accustomed to,” according to the analysis of the flexitarian diet. “Research shows vegetarians tend to eat fewer calories, weigh less and have a lower body mass index (a measure of body fat) than their meat-eating peers.”\n\nThe WW plan, which along with the Mayo Clinic diet tied for first in best commercial diets, has an important component needed in any successful diet, the report said: social support. In addition to in-person meetings and optional one-on-one consultants, the plan offers an online community.\n\n“A backbone of the program is support via the WW app, expert-led workshops and Digital 360 plans to provide practical tools and behavior-change techniques for help along the way,” the analysis said.\n\nThe Volumentrics diet is all about cutting the energy density (calories) of the foods you eat. One of the best ways is to eat a lot of foods that are high in water, as that increases the weight of food in your stomach without packing in additional calories. Top choices include soups, which the report said is 80% to 95% water; fruits and vegetables which are 80% to 95% water and yogurt, which is about 75% water.\n\nBest diet for quick weight loss\n\nThe quick weight loss category is for the person who needs to lose a few pounds for a special occasion. These eating plans are not recommended as a long-term manner of eating, according to U.S. News & World Report.\n\nThe Atkins Diet, created in 1972 by cardiologist Dr. Robert Atkins, took first place in this category. The diet involves four phases of meal plans, starting with very few carbs and adding more as the diet progresses.\n\nHowever, “low-carb dieters may eat too much fat, raising health concerns,” the analysis found, giving the diet a 34 out of 40 in the overall rankings.\n\nThe Health Management Resources Program, or HMR, tied for second place with the OPTAVIA diet.\n\nThe HMR program is a weight loss and lifestyle-change program designed to reduce calories via meal replacements that include added fruits and vegetables. The two-week starter kit is just shy of $200 and includes 70 servings of HMR shakes and entrées, support materials, weekly group coaching and free shipping, the report said.\n\nThe OPTAVIA diet wants you to buy its “Fuelings” and supplement them with a “Lean & Green” meal (one meat, veggie and healthy fat entrée) each day.\n\n“Between 10 to 35 percent of daily calories come from protein,” the report said, which is more than government nutritional guidelines suggest. “Prices for OPTAVIA’s Optimal Weight 5&1 Plan range from about $400 to $450 for 119 servings, or about three weeks’ worth; that’s about $13-$15 per day.”\n\nBoth HMR and OPTAVIA came in at 27 out of 40 diets in the overall ratings, according to the report.\n\nComing in last\n\nThe Dukin and keto diets, which stress eating high-protein or high-fat foods with minimal carbohydrates, came in last and next-to-last in the diet rankings. Those diets are typically rated poorly by experts because they are extremely restrictive, hard to follow, and eliminate entire food groups, which is not recommended by dietary guidelines.\n\nThe Dukin, Whole30 and keto diets, which emphasize eating high-protein or high-fat foods with minimal carbohydrates, are typically rated poorly by experts because they are extremely restrictive, hard to follow and eliminate entire food groups, which is not recommended by dietary guidelines.\n\nGetting started on the Mediterranean diet\n\nWant to make the Mediterranean diet one of your goals this year? Get started by cooking one meal each week based on beans, whole grains and vegetables, using herbs and spices to add punch. When one night a week is a breeze, add two, and build your non-meat meals from there.\n\nGrains that have changed little over the centuries, known as “ancient grains,” are also a key feature of the Mediterranean diet. Quinoa, amaranth, millet, farro, spelt, Kamut (a wheat grain said to be discovered in an Egyptian tomb) and teff (an Ethiopian grain about the size of a poppy seed) are some examples of ancient grains.\n\nWhen you do eat meat, have small amounts. For a main course, that means no more than 3 ounces of chicken or lean meat. Better yet: Use small pieces of chicken or slices of lean meat to flavor a veggie-based meal, such as a stir fry.\n\nAnd rethink dessert. Mediterranean cultures close out their meals with fruit that’s in season.\n\nIf you tire of eating raw fresh fruit, get creative. Poach pears in pomegranate juice with a bit of honey, then reduce the sauce and serve over Greek yogurt. Grill pineapple or other fruits and drizzle with honey. Make a sorbet out of fruit, including avocado (it’s really a fruit). Stuff a fig or date with goat cheese and sprinkle on a few nuts. Create a brown rice apple crisp or even a whole-wheat fruit tart.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/business/cheese-whey-alcohol-distill-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "title": "Alcohol made from cheese waste could help fix dairy's whey ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nThe world loves cheese: last year, more than 21 million metric tons of it were produced globally. But to make cheese, you end up with a lot of whey, and that can be a problem.\n\nProducing one pound of hard cheese creates nine pounds of whey — the liquid byproduct that’s left when milk is curdled and strained — and while large-scale cheesemakers often turn that into animal feed or whey protein, with small cheesemakers, much of it can go to waste.\n\nEnter Wheyward Spirit. Its California distillery is taking leftover whey from local cheesemakers and turning it into an alcoholic spirit. It has just partnered with Ben & Jerry’s to replace the Irish cream liqueur in its Dublin Mudslide flavor — offering “the same taste with less waste,” according to the ice cream maker.\n\n“Our big thing is to keep [whey] in the food system,” says Emily Darchuk, owner and founder of Wheyward Spirit.\n\nDarchuk founded Wheyward Spirit in 2017 and spent several years developing its distillation process. Liquid whey is 95% water, but contains enough lactose sugar to ferment into alcohol. While this helps to save on water during distillation, it’s a more complex process than using conventional ingredients.\n\nEmily Darchuk says her whey spirit saves on water and waste. Kathryn Elsesser\n\nSince launching in September 2020, the artisanal spirit has been awarded a double-gold medal at the New York World Wine & Spirits Competition and a Good Food Award. Working with nearby small-scale cheesemakers, Wheyward says its two-person team has processed 500,000 pounds of whey that would otherwise have been wasted.\n\nContaining 40% alcohol and retailing from $54.95 for a 750 ml bottle, it is priced for the premium market — but Darchuk says that consumers are curious to try the product and are on board with the zero-waste concept.\n\n“People get the impact of it,” she says. “It’s that next movement in sustainable food.”\n\n“A drop in the bucket”\n\nBased on cheese production figures from the US Department of Agriculture, more than 100 billion pounds of liquid whey was produced in the United States in 2020. For most large-scale cheesemakers, this isn’t a problem, says Lisbeth Goddik, a food science professor at Oregon State University, with much of it converted into products like protein powders and animal feed.\n\n“The challenge is that the smaller cheesemakers can’t afford to build these whey processing centers,” she tells CNN Business.\n\nThese smaller cheesemakers account for less than 1% of the market, by Goddik’s estimates, and their whey production is “a drop in the bucket” compared to bigger outfits. But they must pay for the whey to be treated before it is disposed of, which can be a significant additional expense, she says. Some supply the whey to local farmers to use as fertilizer, but if this isn’t well managed, it can pollute water sources.\n\n“It matters a lot to the people at the small scale, and it certainly matters in the environment around them,” Goddik says. That’s where fermenting and distillation can be a useful innovation. “It’s less capital intensive than trying to process and dry the whey,” she explains.\n\nProving the market\n\nWheyward isn’t the only company transforming whey into alcohol: Bertha’s Revenge Irish Milk Gin and French vodka producer Lactalium Velvet both use whey as the main ingredient for their base spirit.\n\nDistillation could be especially useful for acid whey, the byproduct of Greek yogurt. For every pound of yogurt, three to four pounds of acid whey are produced, which unlike sweet cheese whey, cannot be used in protein powders. Goddik has researched fermenting and distilling acid whey and says it “performed very well.”\n\nTo date, Wheyward Spirit's two-person team has converted 500,000 pounds of whey into its signature distilled spirit. Wheyward Spirit\n\nCreating a high-value secondary market for whey could help the dairy industry, says Samuel Alcaine, a food scientist at Cornell University. His startup Norwhey makes an alcoholic seltzer from acid whey, which he says retains a lot of its nutritional value and minerals.\n\n“Making sure that we’re recapturing every drop, and then utilizing that in a way to help human nutrition, I think is important,” says Alcaine. He points to others who are making whey-based alcohol-free tonics, such as Superfrau! and Spare Tonic, which tout whey’s health benefits.\n\nHe believes it could offer a win for dairy processors, who can offload their excess whey for free, as well as beverage makers, who only have to pay the price of transport for their base ingredient. In the long run, dairy processors could even produce these drinks themselves, says Alcaine. In Australia, one artisan cheesemaker already has: Grandvewe is creating small batches of whey-based spirits alongside its sheep cheese products.\n\nThe whey-based drinks industry is still in its early days, says Alcaine, adding “there needs to be time to prove the market.” But Wheyward Spirit’s partnership with Ben & Jerry’s shows that whey spirits can make it into supermarket aisles, familiarizing shoppers with these unconventional products.\n\n“Hopefully it gets people to dig deeper and think about their food differently,” says Darchuk.", "authors": ["Rebecca Cairns"], "publish_date": "2022/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/05/13/5-vermont-road-trips-take-spring-2022/7441990001/", "title": "5 Vermont road trips to take in spring 2022", "text": "Adventure-seekers can start clearing their schedules now as the weather warms and mud season passes.\n\nFrom lakeshores to mountainous trails, Vermont has plenty of scenic drives to offer.

Instead, he shared in the glory – and with two more victories, the Houston Astros may reap the ultimate prize.\n\nJavier pitched six no-hit innings, so dominating the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 4 that he certainly could have become just the second pitcher to throw a solo no-hitter in a World Series game. But he exited after six innings and 97 pitches, and Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero and Ryan Pressly finished the job, joining Javier for a combined no-hitter and a 5-0 Astros victory that squared this World Series at 2-2.\n\nIt was just the second no-hitter in World Series history, joining the New York Yankees’ Don Larsen, who threw a perfect game in Game 5 of the 1956 Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers. And it was just the third no-hitter in playoff history, the first since the late Roy Halladay pulled the feat off in Game 1 of the 2010 National League Division Series against the Cincinnati Reds, on the same Citizens Bank Park mound where Javier and friends worked their Game 4 magic on Wednesday.\n\nGAME 4: After combined no-hitter vs. Phillies, Astros back in control of World Series\n\nTHURSDAY: World Series collides with TNF, both feature Philly, Houston teams\n\nFollow every game: Live MLB Scores\n\nNEVER MISS A MOMENT: Follow our sports newsletter for daily updates\n\nJavier, a 25-year-old from the Dominican Republic, was pitching in front of his father for the first time after his father arrived Wednesday for the game. He said his parents told him he'd throw a no-hitter.\n\n\"When they told me that, obviously I got a lot more motivated,\" he says. \"I kept my faith in God and obviously I knew I had a big commitment today being down 2-1 in the series.\n\n\"And with my parents being here, I just tried to give my best, give my family the best that I could.\"\n\nPurists might be aghast that Javier, who struck out nine and walked two, was not allowed a chance to finish his gem. But doing so was unrealistic: Javier had only thrown more than 97 pitches on four occasions this season, topping out at 115 on June 25.\n\nAnd what happened that day? Javier and two relievers combined on a no-hitter at Yankee Stadium.\n\nSee, the Astros won 106 games this season and Javier’s 11.7 strikeouts per nine innings would have ranked third in the major leagues if he pitched enough innings to qualify. On a club with Justin Verlander set to win his third Cy Young Award this year and lefty Framber Valdez growing renowned for his playoff heroics, Javier, in fact, might be their best pitcher.\n\nTake out a relief appearance during the American League Division Series, and Javier, as a starting pitcher, has pitched 36 ⅔ consecutive scoreless innings, dating to Sept. 7.\n\nAnd manager Dusty Baker’s decision to yank him when he did will heighten the chance Javier pitches a portion of Game 7, should the Astros require it.\n\n\"It's always tough to take a guy out,\" says Baker, who was the opposing manager when Halladay no-hit the Reds in 2010, \"but you have to weigh the no-hitter and history versus trying to win this game and get back to 2-2 in the World Series.\"\n\nBesides, it was hard to argue with the cavalry that followed Javier and helped combine for 14 strikeouts.\n\nAbreu: Strikeout, strikeout, strikeout of J.T. Realmuto, Bryce Harper and Nick Castellanos.\n\nMontero: Strikeout, flyout and Kyle Tucker's running catch of Jean Segura’s shallow fly ball to end the eighth.\n\nAnd finally, closer Pressly, who struck out Brandon Marsh, walked Kyle Schwarber to break a streak of 18 consecutive batters retired, induced a fly to right from Rhys Hoskins and a grounder to third base from Realmuto, to spark a giddy but muted infield celebration.\n\nBut it was Javier who laid down the spike strips for a Philadelphia Phillies offense that was unbeatable at home and careening through the playoffs in unstoppable fashion.\n\nHe struck out Realmuto and Nick Castellanos three times each and Bryce Harper twice, this one night after Harper kick-started a home run bacchanalia with a two-run homer in Game 3, part of five Phillies longballs that game. After leadoff batter Schwarber sent a charge into Javier’s first pitch, driving it deep to the opposite field, Javier allowed just one ball out of the infield.\n\nOh, and there was that other small matter of evening up this World Series.\n\nIn this do-or-die Game 4, the Astros snapped a 16-inning scoreless streak with a five-run eruption in the fifth inning, as the first five batters reached base, Yordan Alvarez broke a scoreless tie when he was hit by reliever Jose Alvarado’s first pitch and Alex Bregman broke the game open with a two-run double.\n\nIt was a typical evening for this Astros offense in this series, prone to long droughts followed by sudden, impactful rallies. So far, the formula has kept them even in this World Series.\n\nThey’ll have Verlander in a Game 5 that will give one team the edge as the series shifts back to Houston. If it goes to a Game 7, don’t be surprised if Javier takes down an inning or two.\n\nThat’s largely because he stepped aside rather than join Larsen in the history books. A championship ring would make that a worthwhile tradeoff.\n\n\"We grew up watching the World Series,\" says Bregman, who is playing in his fourth Fall Classic. \"We know baseball's been going on for a long, long time. So to be a teammate on a team that did that and what Javy and all the guys did is really special.\n\n\"It's a moment that we'll all cherish forever and we'll all remember forever. It was really awesome.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2022/11/03/astros-lined-up-win-their-first-world-series-since-2017/8255056001/", "title": "'We got two more wins to go:' Astros lined up to win their first World ...", "text": "PHILADELPHIA – The Houston Astros wanted to wildly celebrate Wednesday evening.\n\nThey wanted to rush the mound at Citizens Bank Park, tackle closer Ryan Pressly, jump on a human dog-pile and party.\n\nIt was a moment they will cherish forever, being only the second team in baseball history to pitch a no-hitter in the World Series, in their 5-0 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\n“We will celebrate,’’ Astros second baseman Jose Altuve said, “but not yet. We still have work to do.\n\n“No-hitters are cool. You don’t see no-hitters every day. But what we really wanted to do was win the game, and we did.’’\n\nFollow every game: Live MLB Scores\n\nThe Astros may have all of the momentum now, and even the favorable pitching matchups the remainder of the World Series, but with the Series tied at 2-games apiece, they want to hold off on the revelry until they win two more games for the title.\n\n“I love the no-hitter, it’s awesome,’’ Astros center fielder Chas McCormick said. “It’s really cool. But we got two more wins to go. We don’t lose sight of that. That’s when we’ll really celebrate.’’\n\nHistory will have to wait, the Astros say. They helped Hall of Fame officials collect memorabilia. They got an autographed game-used ball from starter Cristian Javier and relievers Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero and Pressly, along with catcher Christian Vazquez. They got an Astros’ rosin bag. And a scoresheet, too, from Hall of Fame pitcher John Smoltz, the lead FOX analyst.\n\nHey, no offense to history, but the Astros would much prefer holding that World Series trophy in the middle of Minute Maid Park on Saturday or Sunday night.\n\n“That’s what we’re playing for,’’ Astros right fielder Kyle Tucker said, “a World Series championship. If they ended up getting a hit, it wasn’t the end of the world. We’re just trying to win a game, not worry about the no-hitter. The win comes first.\n\n“Now, we need to win two more games for it to really mean something.’’\n\nYet, while the Astros tried to act like it was just a routine World Series victory, don’t let them fool you. This was huge. It wasn’t just another victory, it was an emphatic statement.\n\nThe Astros were embarrassed Tuesday night in Game 3 when the Phillies tied a World Series record with five homers in their 7-0 trouncing. The sellout crowd of 42,926 showed up Wednesday night smelling blood.\n\nInstead, the Astros no-hit the Phillies. The Phillies managed to hit only two fly balls off Javier. He made them look clueless with his disappearing 94-mph fastball, striking out nine batters, and retiring the last 11 batters he faced.\n\nWORLD SERIES NO-HITTER: Astros combine for Fall Classic's first no-no since 1956\n\nGAME 4: After combined no-hitter vs. Phillies, Astros back in control of World Series\n\nNEVER MISS A MOMENT: Follow our sports newsletter for daily updates\n\n“I think it’s the best fastball I’ve ever seen,’’ Vazquez said. “That’s how special he is.’’\n\nJavier has been so dominant that he has not given up a run in last six starts, pitching 36 ⅔ scoreless innings, and limiting the opposition to an .051 batting average this postseason, second only to Don Larsen’s .031 average in 1956.\n\nThe man is unhittable.\n\n“You get slapped in the face,’’ Pressly said, “you want to come back and make a statement. You try to have the mind of a goldfish in this game. You try not to think about anything. You just want to go out there and try to produce and put a 'W,' in the column.’’\n\nThis is a confident team, who were undefeated in the postseason, and heavily favored in the Series, only to lose two of the first three games. They knew they couldn’t afford to lose again, not with only seven teams in World Series history recovering from a 3-1 deficit to win. It's only happened once since 1985.\n\n“We need some adversity,’’ McCormick said. “And when we get some adversity, we come out really strong. Sometimes, teams need that. People need that. It was a wake-up call.\n\n“It was great to punch back.’’\n\nThe World Series may be tied at 2-2, but let’s be honest, the powerful Astros are in full control and back in the driver’s seat.\n\nThey have Cy Young favorite Justin Verlander on the mound Thursday in Game 5 against swingman Noah Syndergaard, who’ll start a bullpen game for the Phillies. Verlander may be 0-6 with a 6.07 ERA in eight career World Series starts, but he is much better in his second starts in series. He is yielding a 7.96 ERA in his five starts of a World Series, but a 3.18 ERA in his second starts.\n\n“I tell you, every single person in that clubhouse,’’ Astros third baseman Alex Bregman said, “has the most confidence in the world in him. He's a Hall of Famer for a reason.’’\n\nThen, they have Framber Valdez, who overwhelmed the Phillies in Game 2, going against Zack Wheeler in Game 6.\n\nReally, everything is all lined up the Astros to win their first World Series title since 2017.\n\nThen again, these are the Phillies, a model of resiliency, who refuse to succumb simply because they were on the other end of history.\n\n“I really don’t give a [expletive],’’ Phillies left fielder Kyle Schwarber said about the no-hitter. “It’s cool. We’ll be in history books, I guess.’’\n\nWell sorry, the Astros don't share the same opinion. Vazquez noted that he’s only the second player to catch a World Series no-hitter, joining Hall of Famer Yogi Berra who caught Larsen’s no-hitter in the 1956 World Series. And Javier was elated being the first pitcher to start two combined no-hitters in the same season, including their June 25 no-hitter against the New York Yankees.\n\n“I mean, it's crazy,’’ Bregman said. “We grew up watching the World Series. We know that baseball's been going on for a long, long time. So to be a part of, just be a teammate on a team that did that, and what Javy and all the guys did, is really special.\n\n“It's a moment that we'll all cherish forever and we'll all remember forever.’’\n\nSays Vazquez: “We've not finished the job yet, but this is very, very special for us. And when we get old we're going to remember this.’’\n\nFor Astros manager Dusty Baker it will be a historic no-hitter that he wants to remember. He was managing the Cincinnati Reds in this same ballpark on Oct. 6, 2010, when Roy Halladay threw a no-hitter in the Phillies’ 4-0 victory in the NL Division Series. Now, we have a third postseason no-hitter, and the second in a World Series.\n\n“I mean, that's what's strange about life,’’ Baker said, “and I remember being on the other end of that. Pretty remarkable.’’\n\nThe most difficult aspect of the historic evening was removing Javier from the game after 97 pitches, the exact same that Larsen threw in his perfect game. Yet, Javier had thrown more than 100 pitches only twice this season, and already has pitched 60 more innings than his career high.\n\n“It's always tough to take a guy out,’’ Baker said, “but you have to weigh the no-hitter and history versus trying to win this game and get back to 2-2 in the World Series. …\n\n“It's baseball in 2022. A young player, you think about his health and his career as much as you think about that game.’’\n\nAnd on a magical Nov. 2 evening, the world was able to witness history, and get to know a 25-year-old who has emerged as one of the finest young stars in the game.\n\n“It’s funny,’’ Javier said, “my parents told me I was going to throw a no-hitter. Thanks to God, I was able to accomplish that.’’\n\nWith a little help from his friends.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2022/10/29/astros-bounce-back-game-2-world-series-phillies/10643757002/", "title": "World Series: Astros remind Phillies who they are in Game 2 win", "text": "HOUSTON — Oh, what a difference 24 hours makes.\n\nThe Houston Astros reminded everyone once again why they are the most dangerous team in baseball Saturday evening, overpowering the Philadelphia Phillies, 5-2, and evening the World Series at one game apiece.\n\nThe game wasn’t nearly as close as the score indicated, not with Astros starter Framber Valdez dominating the Phillies’ vaunted lineup in front of a sellout crowd at Minute Maid Park.\n\nValdez, a complete a mess in last year’s World Series against Atlanta, yielding a 19.29 ERA, never gave the Phillies a chance on Saturday. He gave up just four hits in 6 ⅓ innings, while Phillies co-ace Zack Wheeler gave up three doubles and two runs to the first three batters he faced.\n\nReally, the Phillies were never in this game. They had only four opportunities with runners in scoring position the entire game. The only time Valdez was even in a hint of trouble was in the sixth when the first two Phillies’ batters reached in the sixth inning, bringing up Game 1 hero J.T. Realmuto and NLCS MVP Bryce Harper.\n\nFollow every game: Live MLB Scores\n\nValdez yawned. He struck out Realmuto for the second time in the game. And then induced an inning-ending double play from Harper, keeping him hitless for the night.\n\nWhat was most satisfying for the Astros was the awakening of the offense. They were completely shut down by the Phillies’ bullpen in Game 1, held scoreless with only four hits the final seven innings of their 6-5, 10-inning loss.\n\nThis time, they ambushed Wheeler, who entered the game with a 1.78 ERA this postseason.\n\nAll-Star second baseman Jose Altuve, having a miserable postseason with a .108 batting average and no RBI, jumped on the first pitch with a double.\n\nHe stood on second base and it was as if the anxiety, stress and failure left his body at once. He produced another single in the fifth inning, and another in the seventh.\n\nHe had just one fewer hit in four at-bats than he produced the entire postseason.\n\n“He might be the strongest dude in this building mentally,’’ Baker said before the game. “He’s probably had to be most of his life. So, I just know that any minute now, he’s one hit away from a hot streak.’’\n\nYep, just like that Altuve is back.\n\nAnd so are the Astros.\n\nJeremy Peña followed Altuve by hitting the next pitch for a run-scoring double. Two pitches later, Yordan Alvarez, who was in a 3-for-25 skid, hit another run-scoring double.\n\nFour pitches, three doubles and the Astros had a 2-0 lead.\n\nThe Astros became the first team to open a World Series game with three consecutive extra-base hits.\n\nThe Astros, thanks to an error by shortstop Edmundo Sosa, had a three-run lead after the first inning and a 5-0 lead in the fifth inning on Alex Bregman’s two-run homer.\n\nThis time, there would be no blown five-run lead like the Astros’ debacle in Game 1.\n\nThe series now returns to Philadelphia where the Phillies are 5-0 at Citizens Bank Park this postseason, and 21-9 since the ballpark opened, out-scoring the opposition by 62 runs.\n\nThe Astros are bracing themselves for perhaps the most hostile environment they’ve encountered since their 2017 cheating scandal was exposed.\n\n“It’s not like we haven’t gone through this before,’’ Bregman said. “We’ll be ready.\n\n“Really, we have no choice.’’\n\nSee you in Philly.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/sport/astros-phillies-world-series-game-3-spt-intl-trnd/index.html", "title": "Philadelphia Phillies demolish Houston Astros in history-making ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPhiladelphia had waited 4,746 days to host a World Series game and it was forced to wait another day when Monday night’s game was postponed due to rain.\n\nBut its patience was rewarded on Tuesday as the Philadelphia Phillies took a 2-1 lead in the World Series, using the long ball to power their way to a 7-0 win against the Houston Astros in Game 3.\n\nAll those thousands of days of anticipation were unleashed in a beer-soaked Citizens Bank Park afterwards as the 45,712-crowd waved red scarves and cheered its team off the field, who are now 6-0 at home this postseason.\n\n“It’s our fan base. Plain and simple,” Phillies right fielder Bryce Harper told reporters after the game. “They keep us going. Keep us fired up. We were able to come out on the field today. They were all here ready to go and they believe in us and we believe in them. So it’s been great.”\n\nBefore the series began, the Phillies had been billed as the plucky underdogs after entering the National League playoffs as the lowest seed of the six teams while the Astros went undefeated in the playoffs as the No.1 seed, sweeping the Seattle Mariners and the New York Yankees.\n\nThe Phillies are undefeated at home this postseason. Chris Szagola/AP\n\nBut it was the Phillies who proved the more dominant of the two sides on Tuesday, hitting five home runs off Astros starter Lance McCullers Jr., who was pulled in the fifth inning, accounting for all seven runs.\n\nMcCullers Jr.’s five home runs were the most allowed in a game by a single player in postseason history.\n\n“It was kind of mind-boggling because he doesn’t give up homers,” Astros coach Dusty Baker said afterwards.\n\n“He usually keeps the ball in the ballpark. He wasn’t satisfied with it. We were very surprised by it.\n\n“When it’s 4-0 in this ballpark, you don’t want to go through your whole pitching staff because 4-0 in this ballpark is really nothing the way the ball flies here.

Age: 33\n\nWhy he's an All-Star: Kemp has been a forgotten name since his last All-Star appearance in 2012.

The Astros were 42-16 by early June, then the Dodgers took off, winning 56 of 67 games during a stretch that almost defied description. When Los Angeles finally slumped, Cleveland stole the attention with a 22-game winning streak that set an American League record. The Dodgers finished 104-58, followed by the Indians at 102-60 and the Astros at 101-61.\n\nEven before Los Angeles and Houston made it to the World Series , this had been a special year in the history of the Dodgers, Astros and Indians, and that raised fun questions that any fan could appreciate: What was the best team in Dodgers history? Or Astros? Or Indians?\n\nHow about the greatest team in the storied history of the Yankees, Red Sox or Cardinals?\n\nSo AP writers all over the country teamed up to try to identify the sport's 30 standard bearers, the best team in the history of each current franchise. It's a subjective exercise, of course. Comparing eras is difficult, and the term \"best\" is hard to define. Is it simply the team that won the most games? The one that performed best in the postseason? The roster with the most Hall of Famers? There was no one-size-fits-all way of answering the question, especially since integration, expansion and free agency have made the sport vastly different now than it was in the early 20th century.\n\nFollow every game: Live MLB Scores\n\nWhat follows, however, is undoubtedly a timeline of baseball greatness — teams that dominated their seasons in rare fashion, or at least lifted their franchises to significant heights. A World Series title was not a prerequisite for inclusion on this list, but postseason play was certainly considered, along with all the other factors that make these debates so compelling. Only seasons from 1900 on were considered, and the 2017 teams are left out for now — although this year's Astros and Dodgers are certainly building strong cases for themselves as they pursue a championship.\n\n___\n\n1902 PITTSBURGH PIRATES\n\nManager: Fred Clarke\n\nRecord: 103-36\n\nPythagorean Record: 103-36\n\nPostseason: None\n\nHall of Famers: Clarke, Honus Wagner, Jack Chesbro\n\nDetails: A year before the first modern World Series, the Pirates stormed through the National League with a .741 winning percentage — the equivalent of a 120-42 record today. They outscored their opponents by 335 runs and never lost more than two games in a row. Wagner, who played more in the outfield that season than at shortstop, led the league in runs, RBIs, stolen bases and OPS. Although Pittsburgh was dominant, it was a tumultuous period for baseball, with the NL and the new American League competing for players. The leagues finally reached a detente, and in 1903, Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss approached Boston owner Henry Killilea and suggested a postseason series. The two league champions met in the inaugural World Series, with Boston beating Pittsburgh in eight games.\n\nHonorable Mention: Wagner, Clarke and the Pirates finally won the World Series in 1909 after going 110-42 during the regular season. Pittsburgh's next great era wouldn't come for a while. In 1971, Willie Stargell and Roberto Clemente led the Pirates past an outstanding Baltimore team for Pittsburgh's first of two World Series titles that decade.\n\n___\n\n1905 NEW YORK GIANTS\n\nManager: John McGraw\n\nRecord: 105-48\n\nPythagorean Record: 105-48\n\nPostseason: Beat Athletics 4-1 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: McGraw, Christy Mathewson, Roger Bresnahan, Joe McGinnity\n\nDetails: Mathewson won the pitching triple crown and backed it up in the World Series with three shutouts in six days. McGraw used only six pitchers all season, led by Mathewson (31-9, 1.28 ERA) and fellow 20-game winners McGinnity and Red Ames. In a sign of the times, the Giants stole 291 bases and hit 39 home runs — and both marks led the National League. One of the most noteworthy players on the team made only one appearance and never came to the plate. Archie \"Moonlight\" Graham — made famous in the movie \"Field of Dreams\" — made his only major league appearance June 29.\n\nHonorable Mention: A few years after moving to San Francisco, the 1962 Giants, led by Hall of Famers Willie Mays, Orlando Cepeda and Juan Marichal, beat the Dodgers in a best-of-three playoff for the pennant. San Francisco lost Game 7 of the World Series that year, 1-0 to the Yankees. Two the best Giants teams never even played in the World Series. In 1904, the Giants won 106 games, but McGraw and owner John Brush balked at the idea of playing the American League in the World Series and the event wasn't held. Barry Bonds' best team in San Francisco may have been his first, which won 103 games in 1993 but finished one game behind Atlanta in the last great division race before the wild card.\n\n___\n\n1906 CHICAGO CUBS\n\nManager: Frank Chance\n\nRecord: 116-36\n\nPythagorean Record: 115-37\n\nPostseason: Lost to White Sox 4-2 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: Chance, Mordecai Brown, Joe Tinker, Johnny Evers\n\nDetails: There wasn't a great deal of parity during the first decade of the 20th century, when teams routinely surpassed 100 victories despite a shorter season. Chicago's record win total has been matched only once, by Seattle in 2001. The 1906 Cubs featured the famed Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance double play trio, and Brown (26-6, 1.04 ERA) had one of his best seasons on the mound. The blemish on this team's legacy was the loss in the World Series to the White Sox. Even in the old days, anything could happen in a short series.\n\nHonorable Mention: The Cubs dipped to 107 wins in 1907 and 99 in 1908, but they won the World Series both those years. It would be over a century before their next title, and the team that won it in 2016 was a worthy one, outscoring opponents by 252 runs during a 103-win season. After Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo and the rest of the Cubs made it through three tough postseason rounds and brought the championship to Wrigleyville, the franchise appeared set for an extended run of success.\n\n___\n\n1912 BOSTON RED SOX\n\nManager: Jake Stahl\n\nRecord: 105-47\n\nPythagorean Record: 102-50\n\nPostseason: Beat Giants 4-3 in World Series (one game finished tied)\n\nHall of Famers: Tris Speaker, Harry Hooper\n\nDetails: In the year Fenway Park opened, the Red Sox won the pennant by 14 games, going 19-2 against the not-yet-rival and not-yet-Yankees New York Highlanders. Speaker batted .383 to claim MVP honors. Smoky Joe Wood went 34-5 with a 1.91 ERA and 35 complete games, and he beat Walter Johnson 1-0 in a memorable September matchup at Fenway. In the decisive game of the World Series, Wood, pitching in relief, allowed the go-ahead run in the 10th inning. But Boston rallied in the bottom half after an error by Fred Snodgrass. Speaker tied it with a single off Christy Mathewson, and Larry Gardner's sacrifice fly brought in the winning run. It was the first time a team won the World Series with a walk-off victory.\n\nHonorable Mention: The 1946 Red Sox had Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, Johnny Pesky and Dom DiMaggio back after World War II, and they won the pennant by 12 games. Boston lost Game 7 of the World Series to St. Louis when Enos Slaughter scored from first on an eighth-inning double. Pesky, who double-clutched on the relay, was blamed for holding the ball too long, a charge he long denied. The 2004 team won the franchise's first World Series title in 86 years behind David Ortiz, Manny Ramirez, Curt Schilling and Pedro Martinez, and Boston's 2007 champions — with Ortiz still in his prime — might have been even better.\n\n___\n\n1917 CHICAGO WHITE SOX\n\nManager: Pants Rowland\n\nRecord: 100-54\n\nPythagorean Record: 101-53\n\nPostseason: Beat Giants 4-2 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: Eddie Collins, Ray Schalk, Red Faber\n\nDetails: Two years before their scandalous appearance in the 1919 World Series, the White Sox won 100 games for the only time in franchise history. Eddie Cicotte went 28-12 with a 1.53 ERA and 29 complete games, and Shoeless Joe Jackson batted .301. Happy Felsch hit .308 and led the team in RBIs. Faber won the final two games of the World Series, pitching the last two innings of Game 5 in relief, then going the full nine as the starter in the finale.\n\nHonorable Mention: Chicago's \"Hitless Wonders\" took the pennant in 1906 despite hitting an American League-worst .230. The bats came around when the White Sox beat the 116-win Cubs in the World Series, scoring eight runs in each of the final two games. Tony La Russa managed the White Sox to 99 wins in 1983, and Ozzie Guillen guided them to the same total in 2005. The '05 team went 11-1 in the postseason to win the franchise's first World Series championship in 88 years.\n\n___\n\n1927 NEW YORK YANKEES\n\nManager: Miller Huggins\n\nRecord: 110-44\n\nPythagorean Record: 109-45\n\nPostseason: Beat Pirates 4-0 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: Huggins, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Earle Combs, Waite Hoyt, Tony Lazzeri, Herb Pennock\n\nDetails: The sport's most successful franchise reached mythical heights in 1927, when Ruth hit 60 home runs and did not even lead the team in total bases. That distinction went to Gehrig, who batted .373 with 47 homers, 52 doubles and 18 triples. By themselves, Ruth and Gehrig outhomered every other major league team except the Giants, who barely surpassed that duo with 109. The Yankees' supporting cast was impressive too, with Combs leading the American League in hits and Hoyt winning 22 games. Ruth hit the only two homers of New York's World Series sweep.\n\nHonorable Mention: Joe DiMaggio's 1939 Yankees outscored their opponents by 411 runs, an even higher margin than the 1927 team. Charlie Keller hit .438 during a World Series sweep of Cincinnati. The best of Derek Jeter's teams was the 1998 edition, which went 114-48 and finished with a World Series sweep of its own against San Diego. That exceptionally balanced team just put its first player in the Hall of Fame with the induction of Tim Raines this year, although Jeter and Mariano Rivera will surely follow.\n\n___\n\n1929 PHILADELPHIA ATHLETICS\n\nManager: Connie Mack\n\nRecord: 104-46\n\nPythagorean Record: 100-50\n\nPostseason: Beat Cubs 4-1 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: Mack, Lefty Grove, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons, Mickey Cochrane, Eddie Collins\n\nDetails: After back-to-back years as runners-up to Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and the Yankees, the A's broke through in a big way, beating out New York by 18 games to begin a run of three straight pennants. Simmons led the American League with 157 RBIs and 373 total bases, Foxx posted a league-best .463 on-base percentage, and Cochrane hit .331. But the team really excelled on the mound, giving up 97 fewer runs than anyone in the AL. Grove went 20-6 with a league-leading 2.81 ERA. The highlight of the World Series came in Game 4, when Philadelphia scored 10 runs in the seventh inning to wipe out an 8-0 deficit. In the following game, the A's scored three runs in the bottom of the ninth, wrapping up the title on Bing Miller's double.\n\nHonorable Mention: The 1972 A's started a run of three straight championships in Oakland with a star-studded roster led by Hall of Famers Reggie Jackson, Catfish Hunter and Rollie Fingers. Oakland won three straight pennants again from 1988-90, but only the '89 team won the World Series.\n\n___\n\n1935 DETROIT TIGERS\n\nManager: Mickey Cochrane\n\nRecord: 93-58\n\nPythagorean Record: 97-54\n\nPostseason: Beat Cubs 4-2 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: Cochrane, Hank Greenberg, Charlie Gehringer, Goose Goslin\n\nDetails: Greenberg surpassed 100 RBIs by the All-Star break and went on to win American League MVP honors, finishing the season with 98 extra-base hits. Cochrane was both the manager and the team's catcher, hitting .319. The Tigers won the pennant despite a 2-9 start, and the Cubs came out of the National League thanks to a 21-game winning streak in September. Detroit won its first title despite hitting only one home run in the World Series. Goslin's single in the bottom of the ninth inning brought Cochrane home with the winning run in Game 6.\n\nHonorable Mention: The Tigers won over 100 games in both 1968 and 1984, but those two World Series winners had a longer season to do it, and neither could match the 1935 team's run differential of plus-254. The '68 team included 31-game winner Denny McLain and rallied from a 3-1 deficit to beat St. Louis in the World Series. The keystone combination of Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker helped Detroit to a 35-5 start in '84.\n\n___\n\n1942 ST. LOUIS CARDINALS\n\nManager: Billy Southworth\n\nRecord: 106-48\n\nPythagorean Record: 107-47\n\nPostseason: Beat Yankees 4-1 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: Southworth, Stan Musial, Enos Slaughter\n\nDetails: The 21-year-old Musial showed signs of stardom in his first full season, while teammate Mort Cooper won MVP honors by going 22-7 with a 1.78 ERA. Slaughter led the league in hits and total bases. The Cardinals went 43-8 to finish the regular season, setting a franchise record for victories and outlasting a 104-win Brooklyn team for the pennant. They then made quick work of Joe DiMaggio and the 103-win Yankees in the World Series. From 1927-53, the Yankees played in 16 World Series, and this was the only time they were beaten.\n\nHonorable Mention: The 1944 Cardinals won 105 games and a World Series title, although Slaughter didn't play that season because of military service. Musial won MVP honors in 1946, and St. Louis beat Boston in a seven-game World Series. Two of the franchise's best teams from more recent years didn't win the World Series. The Cardinals lost in controversial fashion to Kansas City in 1985, and after winning 105 games in 2004, they were swept by Boston.\n\n___\n\n1948 CLEVELAND INDIANS\n\nManager: Lou Boudreau\n\nRecord: 97-58\n\nPythagorean Record: 104-51\n\nPostseason: Beat Braves 4-2 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: Boudreau, Joe Gordon, Bob Lemon, Larry Doby, Bob Feller, Satchel Paige\n\nDetails: Cleveland's most recent World Series winner was loaded with Hall of Famers, and Boudreau, the manager, was also the shortstop. He hit .355 in an MVP season. Gordon contributed 32 home runs and Ken Keltner hit 31. Lemon won 20 games and pitched 10 shutouts, Gene Bearden led the league in ERA, and the ageless Paige made his major league debut, going 6-1 down the stretch to give the Indians a boost in a tight American League race. Boudreau homered twice in a one-game playoff against the Red Sox that decided the pennant, and then Cleveland beat Boston's National League team in the World Series .\n\nHonorable Mention: The 1954 Indians won 111 games, although the 1948 team actually had a higher run differential. Cleveland was swept in the World Series by Willie Mays and the Giants in '54. The Indians went 100-44 in a shortened season in 1995, when baseball returned from the strike that had begun the previous year. Albert Belle, Manny Ramirez, Jim Thome and Kenny Lofton turned that team into an offensive powerhouse, but Cleveland couldn't overcome Atlanta's pitching in the World Series.\n\n___\n\n1955 BROOKLYN DODGERS\n\nManager: Walter Alston\n\nRecord: 98-55\n\nPythagorean Record: 95-58\n\nPostseason: Beat Yankees 4-3 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: Alston, Duke Snider, Roy Campanella, Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese, Sandy Koufax, Tom Lasorda (inducted as manager)\n\nDetails: Four times in the previous eight years, the Dodgers had reached the World Series and lost to the Yankees. In 1955, this beloved group finally brought Brooklyn the title. Campanella won MVP honors, Snider hit 42 home runs, and although Robinson and Reese were nearing the end of their careers, they were still significant contributors. Don Newcombe headlined the pitching staff with a 20-5 record.\n\nIt came down to Game 7 at Yankee Stadium, and there would be no more waiting for next year. With the help of a stirring catch by Sandy Amoros in left field, Johnny Podres shut out New York in the finale.\n\nHonorable Mention: The 1953 Dodgers won a franchise-record 105 games, but military service kept Newcombe away, and only one regular starter had an ERA under 4.00. After moving to Los Angeles, the Dodgers swept the Yankees in the 1963 World Series, with Koufax, Podres and Don Drysdale pitching 35 ? of the 36 innings. New York managed only four runs. In 1974, Los Angeles won 102 games behind the steady infield of Steve Garvey, Davey Lopes, Bill Russell and Ron Cey, but the Dodgers lost in the World Series to last of Oakland's three straight title teams.\n\n___\n\n1957 MILWAUKEE BRAVES\n\nManager: Fred Haney\n\nRecord: 95-59\n\nPythagorean Record: 93-61\n\nPostseason: Beat Yankees 4-3 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: Hank Aaron, Eddie Mathews, Warren Spahn, Red Schoendienst\n\nDetails: Aaron won the only MVP of his brilliant career at age 23, leading the National League with 44 homers and 132 RBIs while batting .322. He teamed with Mathews (32 HRs, 94 RBIs) to give Milwaukee a potent 1-2 punch in the middle of the lineup. Spahn, the winningest left-hander in major league history, finished 21-11 at age 36 and took the Cy Young Award. Lew Burdette had three wins against the Yankees in the World Series, including shutouts in Games 5 and 7.\n\nHonorable Mention: The Atlanta Braves won a franchise-record 106 games in 1998 in the midst of their run of 14 straight division titles. Tom Glavine won the Cy Young Award, while teammates Greg Maddux and John Smoltz finished in the top five of the balloting. But, like all but one of those great Atlanta teams from the 1990s and 2000s, the Braves fell short in the postseason. San Diego beat Atlanta in the NLCS, denying the Braves a shot at the 114-win Yankees in the World Series.\n\n___\n\n1965 MINNESOTA TWINS\n\nManager: Sam Mele\n\nRecord: 102-60\n\nPythagorean Record: 100-62\n\nPostseason: Lost to Dodgers 4-3 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: Harmon Killebrew\n\nDetails: Zoilo Versalles was the American League MVP and won a Gold Glove at shortstop to lead the Twins to a club record in victories, and teammate and fellow Cuba native Tony Oliva earned his second straight batting title. Six Twins played in the All-Star game that summer, and the team won its first pennant since moving to Minnesota from Washington in 1961. But after winning the first two games of the World Series, the Twins couldn't close out Los Angeles. They struck out 10 times against Sandy Koufax in a 2-0 loss in Game 7.\n\nHonorable Mention: Only five times has the World Series come down to a winner-take-all game in extra innings — and this franchise won two of them. The 1991 team led by Kirby Puckett, Jack Morris and Chili Davis went 95-67 and beat Atlanta in the World Series when Morris threw a 10-inning shutout in Game 7 . The 1924 Washington Senators took Game 7 against the New York Giants in 12 innings, with Hall of Famer Walter Johnson pitching four scoreless innings of relief to earn the win.\n\n___\n\n1970 BALTIMORE ORIOLES\n\nManager: Earl Weaver\n\nRecord: 108-54\n\nPythagorean Record: 104-58\n\nPostseason: Beat Twins 3-0 in ALCS; beat Reds 4-1 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: Weaver, Jim Palmer, Frank Robinson, Brooks Robinson\n\nDetails: Weaver's Orioles were at their peak from 1969-71, when they won 109, 108 and 101 games. They only won one World Series in that span, but that title came in emphatic fashion, with Brooks Robinson hitting .429 in the series against Cincinnati to go along with his usual sparkling defense . Jim Palmer went 20-10 that season, while Mike Cuellar and Dave McNally won 24 games each. Boog Powell hit 35 home runs en route to the MVP award.\n\nHonorable Mention: Pitching was the backbone of those great Baltimore teams. Cuellar won a share of the Cy Young Award in 1969, and the Orioles had four 20-game winners in 1971. After Frank Robinson won the Triple Crown in 1966, Baltimore swept the Dodgers in the World Series. The Orioles allowed two runs in the first three innings of Game 1, then shut out Los Angeles for the rest of the series.\n\n___\n\n1976 CINCINNATI REDS\n\nManager: Sparky Anderson\n\nRecord: 102-60\n\nPythagorean Record: 103-59\n\nPostseason: Beat Phillies 3-0 in NLCS; beat Yankees 4-0 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: Anderson, Joe Morgan, Johnny Bench, Tony Perez\n\nDetails: Since the start of divisional play in 1969, the Reds are the only team to make it through a postseason unbeaten. After sweeping the 101-win Phillies, they dominated the Yankees, with Bench hitting .533 in the World Series. Bench homered twice and drove in five runs in the final game at New York. Morgan won National League MVP honors for a second straight year, and George Foster drove in a league-high 121 runs. Pete Rose led the NL with 215 hits. The Big Red Machine had no major weaknesses. Cincinnati led the NL in runs, hits, doubles, triples, home runs, stolen bases, walks, batting average, on-base percentage and slugging percentage.\n\nHonorable Mention: The Reds stamped themselves as a great team in 1976, but the 1975 version actually won more games, going 108-54. Cincinnati then swept Pittsburgh in the NLCS before outlasting Boston in seven games in the World Series.\n\n___\n\n1982 MILWAUKEE BREWERS\n\nManagers: Buck Rodgers, Harvey Kuenn\n\nRecord: 95-67\n\nPythagorean Record: 97-65\n\nPostseason: Beat Angels 3-2 in ALCS; lost to Cardinals 4-3 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: Robin Yount, Paul Molitor, Rollie Fingers, Don Sutton\n\nDetails: The Brewers went 72-43 under Kuenn, with Yount — who was still a shortstop back then — winning MVP honors and Pete Vuckovich taking the Cy Young Award. \"Harvey's Wallbangers\" came into the final series of the regular season with a three-game AL East lead over the Orioles, only to drop the first three games at Baltimore. Milwaukee avoided an epic collapse by winning the finale behind two homers from Yount and eight solid innings from Sutton. In addition to Yount and Molitor, the Brewers got big offensive seasons from Gorman Thomas, Ben Oglivie and Cecil Cooper, all of whom surpassed 30 homers. Milwaukee rallied from a 2-0 deficit in the ALCS and came within a victory of winning it all.\n\nHonorable Mention: After winning the pennant in 1982, the Brewers didn't make the postseason again until 2008, and their next division title didn't come until 2011. By then, they were in the NL Central, which they won with a 96-66 record. Ryan Braun won the MVP, and Prince Fielder hit 38 homers. Again, it was St. Louis that stood in the way in the postseason. The Cardinals, who had finished six games behind Milwaukee in the division, beat the Brewers in the NLCS and won the World Series as a wild card.\n\n___\n\n1986 NEW YORK METS\n\nManager: Davey Johnson\n\nRecord: 108-54\n\nPythagorean Record: 103-59\n\nPostseason: Beat Astros 4-2 in NLCS; beat Red Sox 4-3 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: Gary Carter\n\nDetails: After winning 98 games but falling just short of the playoffs the previous year, the brash and cocky Mets set out to demolish the competition in 1986, and that's exactly what they did. Loaded with pitching, power, speed and depth, the Mets outscored their opponents by 205 runs and ran away with the NL East behind Carter, Keith Hernandez, Dwight Gooden and Darryl Strawberry. Then they outlasted Houston and Boston in epic postseason series. New York wrapped up the pennant with a 16-inning victory over the Astros, and the Mets fought off elimination in the 10th inning of Game 6 against the Red Sox, finally winning on Bill Buckner's error before vanquishing Boston in Game 7. Amid all the wild tales about parties and brawls, this team's dominance on the field is sometimes overlooked. The Mets and 1975 Reds are the only National League teams since 1910 to win 108 games.\n\nHonorable Mention: Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Seaver and the \"Miracle Mets\" went 100-62 in 1969 and then beat Baltimore in the World Series, bringing the franchise a title in its eighth season of existence. The Mets had lost over 100 games in five of the first seven. New York went 100-60 in 1988, with David Cone's breakout year boosting an already-impressive rotation. That team fell in seven games to the Dodgers in the NLCS.\n\n___\n\n1993 TORONTO BLUE JAYS\n\nManager: Cito Gaston\n\nRecord: 95-67\n\nPythagorean Record: 91-71\n\nPostseason: Beat White Sox 4-2 in ALCS; beat Phillies 4-2 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: Roberto Alomar, Paul Molitor, Rickey Henderson\n\nDetails: Fresh off their first World Series title the previous season, the Blue Jays began their pursuit of a repeat with the help of a torrid first half by John Olerud, who was still hitting over .400 at the start of August. Olerud won the batting title at .363, with teammates Molitor and Alomar finishing second and third. It almost seemed unfair when the Blue Jays added Henderson in late July. Joe Carter capped Toronto's two-year run with his World Series-winning home run against Philadelphia.\n\nHonorable Mention: The 1992 Blue Jays had a similar roster to the 1993 team. Instead of Molitor and Henderson, they had Dave Winfield and late-season addition David Cone. In 1985, Toronto won a franchise-record 99 games under Bobby Cox before losing to Kansas City in a seven-game ALCS. The core of that team — Dave Stieb, Jesse Barfield, George Bell and Jimmy Key — was outstanding but has been somewhat overshadowed by the title winners from the following decade.\n\n___\n\n1994 MONTREAL EXPOS\n\nManager: Felipe Alou\n\nRecord: 74-40\n\nPythagorean Record: 70-44\n\nPostseason: None\n\nHall of Famers: Pedro Martinez\n\nDetails: Winners of 20 of 23, the Expos had the best record in baseball and a six-game NL East lead on Atlanta when a strike in the middle of August ended the season. Montreal was then left to wonder what might have been if the Expos had been able to keep their young roster together. Reliever John Wetteland was traded to the Yankees and won World Series MVP honors in 1996, and Larry Walker signed with Colorado and was the National League MVP in 1997. Martinez won the Cy Young Award for Montreal in '97, then was traded to Boston and won that honor two more times for the Red Sox. In the decade following the strike, Montreal finished above .500 only three times and never made the playoffs. The Expos moved to Washington and became the Nationals after the 2004 season.\n\nHonorable Mention: The 2012, 2014 and 2016 Nationals won the division before losing in the NLDS, which went the full five games in '12 and '16. The 2016 team had Cy Young winner Max Scherzer and MVP runner-up Daniel Murphy.\n\n___\n\n1998 HOUSTON ASTROS\n\nManager: Larry Dierker\n\nRecord: 102-60\n\nPythagorean Record: 106-56\n\nPostseason: Lost to Padres 3-1 in NLDS\n\nHall of Famers: Craig Biggio, Jeff Bagwell, Randy Johnson\n\nDetails: Bagwell and Biggio were mainstays by the time the Astros reached their peak, winning four NL Central titles between 1997-2001. The '98 team took the division by a 12 ½-game margin. Biggio became the first player since Tris Speaker in 1912 to reach 50 doubles and 50 steals in a season. Houston turned the division race into a rout after acquiring Johnson from Seattle in late July. The tall left-hander went 10-1 with a 1.28 ERA for the Astros, and he actually received National League Cy Young votes despite making only 11 starts for Houston.\n\nHonorable Mention: The Astros won 97 games and another division title in 1999, losing again in the NLDS. Johnson was no longer on the team, but Mike Hampton won 22 games and Jose Lima won 21. Houston's first pennant came in 2005 with a team that went only 89-73 during the regular season. The trio of Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte and Roy Oswalt gave the Astros enough pitching to be a threat, and Oswalt won twice in the NLCS before Houston was swept by the White Sox in the World Series.\n\n___\n\n1998 SAN DIEGO PADRES\n\nManager: Bruce Bochy\n\nRecord: 98-64\n\nPythagorean Record: 93-69\n\nPostseason: Beat Astros 3-1 in NLDS; beat Braves 4-2 in NLCS; lost to Yankees 4-0 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: Tony Gwynn\n\nDetails: Invigorated by the acquisition of Kevin Brown, the Padres won a franchise-record 98 games but were still an afterthought heading into the playoffs, where they had to beat the 102-win Astros and the 106-win Braves to win the National League pennant . Then the 114-win Yankees awaited in the World Series. Gwynn hit a two-run homer off the facade at Yankee Stadium in Game 1, but that was the only really memorable moment for San Diego in New York's four-game sweep. Trevor Hoffman led the majors with 53 saves — this was the season when he began entering from the bullpen to the ominous strains of \"Hells Bells\" by AC/DC. Greg Vaughn hit his 50th home run in the final game of the regular season.\n\nHonorable Mention: The Padres also reached the World Series in 1984, but just like in 1998, they ran into an American League champion that was having a remarkable year. The 104-win Tigers beat San Diego in five games.\n\n___\n\n2001 SEATTLE MARINERS\n\nManager: Lou Piniella\n\nRecord: 116-46\n\nPythagorean Record: 109-53\n\nPostseason: Beat Indians 3-2 in ALDS; lost to Yankees 4-1 in ALCS\n\nHall of Famers: None\n\nDetails: After losing Alex Rodriguez to free agency, the Mariners tore through the American League with one of the greatest regular seasons in baseball history. Ichiro Suzuki arrived from Japan and immediately won MVP honors by hitting .350 with 56 stolen bases. Bret Boone drove in 141 runs, and Edgar Martinez and John Olerud provided steady production as well. The Mariners tied the single-season wins record set by the 1906 Cubs, but like that Chicago team, they weren't able to cap their tremendous year with a World Series title. The Mariners dropped the first two games of the ALCS at home, and the series never went back to Seattle. The Mariners were held to three runs or fewer in each of the four losses to New York.\n\nHonorable Mention: The 1995 Mariners were 13 games out of first place in early August before rallying down the stretch. They eventually beat California in a one-game playoff for the AL West title, then followed that up with a five-game victory over the Yankees in the ALDS. The decisive game ended in extra innings with Ken Griffey Jr. scoring the winning run on Martinez's two-run double — the seminal moment in franchise history.\n\n___\n\n2001 ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS\n\nManager: Bob Brenly\n\nRecord: 92-70\n\nPythagorean Record: 95-67\n\nPostseason: Beat Cardinals 3-2 in NLDS; beat Braves 4-1 in NLCS; beat Yankees 4-3 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: Randy Johnson\n\nDetails: After adding Curt Schilling the previous year, the Diamondbacks had a 1-2 punch for the ages at the top of their rotation with him and Johnson. Luis Gonzalez carried the offense in 2001 with 57 home runs, and Johnson won the third of his four straight Cy Young Awards, with Schilling finishing second. Arizona took a 2-0 lead in the World Series over the three-time defending champions from New York. Then the Yankees went back home and won the next three games, pulling out two of them after being down to their last out. The Diamondbacks bounced back in memorable fashion, forcing a Game 7 and then beating Mariano Rivera in the ninth inning of the finale. Gonzalez delivered the winning hit , and Johnson won three games in the series — including Game 6 as the starter and Game 7 out of the bullpen.\n\nHonorable Mention: The Diamondbacks gained instant credibility in just their second season of existence, winning 100 games in 1999 before falling to the Mets in the NLDS.\n\n___\n\n2002 ANAHEIM ANGELS\n\nManager: Mike Scioscia\n\nRecord: 99-63\n\nPythagorean Record: 101-61\n\nPostseason: Beat Yankees 3-1 in ALDS; beat Twins 4-1 in ALCS; beat Giants 4-3 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: None\n\nDetails: The 2002 Angels were easy to overlook. They finished second to AL West rival Oakland after the Athletics won 20 games in a row during the second half of the season. Garret Anderson was Anaheim's lone All-Star that year. The team may have been best known for its Rally Monkey that would appear on the big screen during games, but after entering the postseason as a wild card, the Angels promptly slugged their way to a championship. Anaheim scored 101 runs in 16 postseason games, and reliever Francisco Rodriguez — who had just made his major league debut in mid-September — was a difference maker. The Angels rallied from a 5-0 deficit to win Game 6 of the World Series, then denied Barry Bonds and the Giants again in Game 7.\n\nHonorable Mention: The Angels have largely failed to capitalize on Mike Trout's greatness, but they did go 98-64 in 2014, posting the best record in baseball before being swept by Kansas City in the ALDS. Twice in the 1980s, the Angels came achingly close to a pennant under Gene Mauch. They wasted a 2-0 lead in a best-of-five ALCS against Milwaukee in 1982, and they squandered a 3-1 advantage — and a three-run lead in the ninth inning of Game 5 — in a seven-game loss to Boston in 1986.\n\n___\n\n2003 FLORIDA MARLINS\n\nManagers: Jeff Torborg, Jack McKeon\n\nRecord: 91-71\n\nPythagorean Record: 87-75\n\nPostseason: Beat Giants 3-1 in NLDS; beat Cubs 4-3 in NLCS; beat Yankees 4-2 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: Ivan Rodriguez\n\nDetails: The Marlins were 16-22 when they fired Torborg and hired McKeon, who came out of retirement at age 72 to lead an improbable turnaround. Florida called up left-hander Dontrelle Willis and 20-year-old slugger Miguel Cabrera from the minors, and the Marlins won the National League wild card. They won 32 of their last 46 games, including the postseason. Rodriguez anchored the lineup, and the rotation included a young Josh Beckett. Florida came from behind in all three postseason series, most famously in the NLCS against the Cubs. Beckett threw a two-hit shutout in Game 5 of that series, and he also closed out New York in the World Series with a five-hit shutout at Yankee Stadium.\n\nHonorable Mention: The Marlins' only other playoff team also was a wild card that won the World Series. The 1997 team was led by Kevin Brown, Moises Alou and manager Jim Leyland, and beat the Indians in an 11-inning Game 7 to win the World Series. Edgar Renteria's single won that game. Right-hander Livan Hernandez was MVP of both the NLCS and World Series.\n\n___\n\n2007 COLORADO ROCKIES\n\nManager: Clint Hurdle\n\nRecord: 90-73\n\nPythagorean Record: 91-72\n\nPostseason: Beat Phillies 3-0 in NLDS; beat Diamondbacks 4-0 in NLCS; lost to Red Sox 4-0 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: None\n\nDetails: The Rockies won 14 of 15 to end the regular season, including a one-game playoff against San Diego for the wild card. Then they swept Philadelphia and Arizona to enter the World Series on a 21-1 run. After a lengthy break before the World Series, Colorado was swept by the Red Sox, but the Rockies' surge had the term \"Rocktober\" taking hold of Denver. Colorado beat Trevor Hoffman and the Padres in the playoff on a sacrifice fly in the 13th inning. Matt Holliday slid in for the winning run, although replays were inconclusive on whether he actually touched the plate. Holliday led the National League in batting average, hits, doubles, RBIs and total bases.\n\nHonorable Mention: The Rockies have never won a division title. They also made the playoffs as a wild card in 1995 and 2009, losing in the NLDS both times. The 2009 team set a franchise record with 92 wins behind young shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and right-hander Ubaldo Jimenez.\n\n___\n\n2008 TAMPA BAY RAYS\n\nManager: Joe Maddon\n\nRecord: 97-65\n\nPythagorean Record: 92-70\n\nPostseason: Beat White Sox 3-1 in ALDS; beat Red Sox 4-3 in ALCS; lost to Phillies 4-1 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: None\n\nDetails: A year after finishing with the worst record in baseball, Tampa Bay improved by 31 games and won the American League pennant, a remarkable accomplishment by a team with one of the lowest payrolls in the majors. That turnaround began a stretch of four postseason appearances in six years. Melvin Upton Jr. hit seven of the Rays' 26 postseason home runs in 2008, and rookie Evan Longoria hit six. The ALCS MVP was 24-year-old Matt Garza, who went 2-0 with a 1.38 ERA. David Price, who had only five big league appearances before that postseason, beat Boston in relief in Game 2 and got the final four outs of Game 7 to send the Rays to the World Series.\n\nHonorable Mention: The Rays led the American League with 96 wins in 2010, with Price, Longoria and Carl Crawford leading the way. They also won 91 games in 2011, when Longoria's homer to win the final game of the regular season put them in the playoffs. In 2013, Tampa Bay won 92 games, including a one-game playoff against Texas for a wild card. The Rays then beat Cleveland in the AL wild-card game.\n\n___\n\n2011 PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES\n\nManager: Charlie Manuel\n\nRecord: 102-60\n\nPythagorean Record: 103-59\n\nPostseason: Lost to Cardinals 3-2 in NLDS\n\nHall of Famers: None\n\nDetails: The Phillies cruised to their fifth straight NL East title while setting a franchise record for wins behind one of the game's greatest starting rotations. Roy Halladay, Cliff Lee, Cole Hamels and Roy Oswalt combined for 59 wins, and even rookie Vance Worley chipped in an 11-3 record. Halladay pitched eight complete games and finished second in the Cy Young vote, one spot ahead of Lee, who threw six shutouts. The balanced lineup included Chase Utley and former MVPs Ryan Howard and Jimmy Rollins. Philadelphia was stymied in the postseason, however, by another top pitcher. Chris Carpenter of St. Louis beat Halladay 1-0 in the NLDS finale, bringing the Phillies' season to an end.\n\nHonorable Mention: Led by Mike Schmidt and Steve Carlton, Philadelphia won 101 games in both 1976 and 1977. Those teams lost in the NLCS. The franchise's two World Series titles came in 1980 — with Schmidt and Carlton joined by an aging Pete Rose — and 2008. The '08 team had the same core of hitters as the 2011 Phillies, but Halladay and Lee hadn't arrived yet.\n\n___\n\n2011 TEXAS RANGERS\n\nManager: Ron Washington\n\nRecord: 96-66\n\nPythagorean Record: 98-64\n\nPostseason: Beat Rays 3-1 in ALDS; beat Tigers 4-2 in ALCS; lost to Cardinals 4-3 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: None\n\nDetails: With a lineup that included Adrian Beltre, Josh Hamilton, Michael Young, Ian Kinsler, Nelson Cruz and Elvis Andrus, Texas set a franchise record for victories and won its second consecutive American League pennant. Young hit .338 on the season, and C.J. Wilson and Derek Holland won 16 games apiece. Cruz slugged six home runs in the ALCS, and then the Rangers came agonizingly close to winning it all against St. Louis. The Cardinals were down to their last strike in both the ninth and 10th innings of Game 6, but they were able to extend the World Series and eventually win it.\n\nHonorable Mention: The 2010 Rangers also won the pennant following an MVP season by Hamilton. They beat the Yankees in the ALCS but lost to San Francisco in five games in the World Series. In 1996, Juan Gonzalez had the first of his two MVP seasons for Texas. Hall of Famer Ivan Rodriguez was also on that team, which won the franchise's first AL West title.\n\n___\n\n2015 KANSAS CITY ROYALS\n\nManager: Ned Yost\n\nRecord: 95-67\n\nPythagorean Record: 90-72\n\nPostseason: Beat Astros 3-2 in ALDS; beat Blue Jays 4-2 in ALCS; beat Mets 4-1 in World Series\n\nHall of Famers: None\n\nDetails: The Royals won their second straight pennant, and after losing in seven games to San Francisco in 2014, they finished the job against New York a year later for the franchise's second World Series title. Kansas City seemed to get stronger as it advanced through the postseason. The Royals were almost eliminated in the ALDS, but they won the last two games against Houston, rallying from a 6-2 deficit in the eighth inning of Game 4 . The Royals were a unique team anchored by one of the best bullpens in baseball history, with Kelvin Herrera, Wade Davis and Greg Holland giving them an edge in the late innings. Herrera and Davis became even more crucial when Holland was lost to an injury late in the season. Kansas City also relied on speed, defense — and an ability to hit for contact that matched up well with the hard-throwing Mets in the end.\n\nHonorable Mention: The 1977 Royals, led by Hall of Famer George Brett, won a franchise-record 102 games before losing to the Yankees in the ALCS. Brett was also on the 1985 team, which won only 91 games but edged St. Louis in a seven-game World Series.\n\n___\n\n(The Pythagorean record, a popular sabermetric innovation developed by Bill James, is estimated using a team's runs scored and runs allowed.

Ace Shane Bieber was dominant for 7⅔ innings, Most Valuable Player candidate Jose Ramirez hit a two-run homer and All-Star closer Emmanuel Clase got the final four outs. Easy as 1-2-3. Guardians manager Terry Francona had an interesting ride home after he momentarily thought a woman was flashing him.\n\nOn to Game 2, when another of the young stars, right-hander Triston McKenzie, will try to pitch the Guardians into the American League Division Series against the New York Yankees. The Rays will counter with flame-throwing right-hander Tyler Glasnow.\n\nHere's how the Guardians' 1-0 win over the Rays to close out the series sweep unfolded:\n\nCleveland Guardians vs. Tampa Bay Rays live updates from Game 2:\n\nOscar Gonzalez hits walk-off home run off Corey Kluber\n\nFollow every game: Live MLB Scores\n\nBottom 15th: It's over. The Guardians are headed to New York. Oscar Gonzalez drills a walk-off home run off Corey Kluber to end it.\n\nSam Hentges throws three scoreless innings\n\nTop 15th: Sam Hentges has come through for Cleveland in a big way, throwing three scoreless innings with six strikeouts. After the Rays put runners on the corners in the 15th, Hentges struck out back-to-back hitters to escape the inning.\n\nBottom 14th: There have been 28 half-innings and no runs. At some point this game has to be considered a medical concern for Guardians and Rays fans.\n\nCleveland Guardians vs. Tampa Bay Rays:What you need to know about the Cleveland Guardians vs. Tampa Bay Rays AL Wild Card Series\n\nGuardians a hit on big stage:Cleveland Guardians answer another question, show they can handle the big stage\n\nGuardians-Rays now longest scoreless playoff game in baseball history\n\nBottom 13th: This is now the longest scoreless playoff game in baseball history. A combination of elite pitching, some poor at-bats, great defense and perhaps the shadows playing a role as well.\n\nSam Hentges is still in the game. Zach Plesac and Kirk McCarty are warming. Other than Shane Bieber, who pitched yesterday, and Cal Quantrill, who would pitch Game 3 tomorrow if needed, that's it for the Guardians in terms of pitching options.\n\nCorey Kluber enters for Rays\n\nBottom 13th: Corey Kluber, old friend of Cleveland, is in to pitch for the Rays in the bottom of the 13th. This will be a strange sight for Cleveland fans on such a big stage.\n\nJose Ramirez, Josh Naylor make incredible play to keep it tied\n\nTop 12th: Josh Ramirez and Josh Naylor just put together the play of the season. With runners on the corners and two outs, Manuel Margot grounded a ball down the third base line. Jose Ramirez corralled it, threw it as he fell away from first base and Josh Naylor finished the play with one of best scoops at first base you'll ever see. That play keeps it tied, and the Guardians have another chance to close it out in the 12th.\n\nBottom 10th: Don't worry, somebody will score eventually. By rule, somebody has to score at some point.\n\nAnd for the Guardians, Eli Morgan is back out to pitch the 10th.\n\nBottom 9th: Seriously, first team to score wins. Somebody has to eventually, right? Guardians and Rays are headed to extra innings.\n\nGuardians-Rays scoreless through eight innings\n\nBottom 8th: OK fine, first team to score wins. Guardians and Rays have been terrific on the mound. Emmanuel Clase is entering for the top of the ninth.\n\nOscar Gonzalez needs Sandy Alomar Jr's belt\n\nBottom 7th: Here's a new one. Oscar Gonzalez singled and then, after a stolen base attempt on a foul ball, broke his belt. As he returned to first, first base coach Sandy Alomar Jr. quickly took off his and gave it to Gonzalez to wear.\n\nThis game is still scoreless heading to the 8th.\n\nAustin Hedges ended the 7th inning with a picture-perfect throw to nab Margot at second base. The Rays challenged the play, but the call was confirmed. If that throw isn't in the perfect spot, the Rays would have had the go-ahead run in scoring position, as Margot got a great jump.\n\nGuardians waste bases-loaded scoring chance in 6th\n\nBottom 6th: All hell broke loose with the Rays bullpen. Fairbanks walked the first two hitters he faced. Then Jason Adam hit Amed Rosario and threw two balls to Jose Ramirez.\n\nThe Guardians couldn't ask for a better scenario: 2-0 count, Ramirez at the plate, bases loaded, nobody out. Somehow, the game is still scoreless. Ramirez struck out and Josh Naylor grounded into an inning-ending double play.\n\nPete Fairbanks exits for Rays after walking two batters, Guardians have two on with nobody out\n\nBottom 6th: Fairbanks' day is done with an apparent injury after two batters. Without the injury he would have, by rule, had to face Amed Rosario after he walked Straw and Kwan. Guardians have two on with nobody out and the middle of their lineup due up. Fairbanks' velocity was down 3.8 mph on his fastball compared to his average.\n\nFairbanks appeared to tell a Rays trainer that he couldn't feel his hand.\n\nPete Fairbanks enters, and Guardians have a scoring threat\n\nBottom 6th: Pete Fairbanks entered for Glasnow and threw his first pitch to Straw a few feet over his head. He then walked Straw, who stole second base, and went down 3-0 to Kwan. All of a sudden, the Rays bullpen is active again.\n\nTop 6: The Rays' first threat of the day goes for naught, as McKenzie gets a flyout to end the inning.\n\nStill scoreless, it'll be up to the bullpens from here. Pete Fairbanks is entering for the Rays. And with McKenzie up to 98 pitches through six and James Karinchak warming, there's a good chance Terry Francona won't have McKenzie face Choi a third time, as he's put together two quality at-bats so far today.\n\nTriston McKenzie, Tyler Glasnow dueling\n\nBottom 5th: The McKenzie-Glasnow matchup has lived up to its billing. Only three total hits. Both look filthy. Runs are at a premium.\n\nMcKenzie has thrown more pitches (78-63), but Glasnow likely doesn't have many more before he'll be pulled. He returned from Tommy John surgery recently and isn't up to his full workload. Which with how he looks today is pretty fortunate for Cleveland.\n\nTriston McKenzie no-hit bid broken up in 5th\n\nTop 5th: The Rays' first hit of the day is a single by Paredes with one out in the 5th. It was also the first ball in play that wasn't an out to center field.\n\nTriston McKenzie near perfect through four innings\n\nTop 4: To not upset any of the home fans, it'll be phrased like this: through four innings, the only batter for the Rays to reach base did so via a walk.\n\nMcKenzie looks as sharp as ever thus far. Glasnow has been just as effective, limiting the Guardians to just one hit.\n\nTriston McKenzie strikes out six through three innings against Rays\n\nTop 3rd: Triston McKenzie looks to be in top form. Through three innings, he's only allowed a walk and struck out six of the 10 batters he's faced. As advertised, looks to be another pitcher's duel early on today.\n\nGuardians, Rays scoreless through two innings\n\nBottom 2nd: Tyler Glasnow has looked sharp as well, striking out four through two scoreless innings. Guardians are fortunate he isn't built up to his regular workload yet.\n\nTop 2nd: The Rays made him work, but McKenzie worked through a clean second inning. Ji-Man Choi worked a 10-pitch walk, running up McKenzie's pitch count, but a strikeout ended the inning. That'll even the playing field a bit, as Tyler Glasnow is on a limited pitch count today as he returns from an injury.\n\nTriston McKenzie cruises through first inning on all fastballs\n\nTop 1st: Triston McKenzie tossed a quick 1-2-3 inning in the first. He threw 11 pitches, all fastballs.\n\nIt's a balmy 49 degrees at first pitch. The word of the day is: bundled.\n\nGuardians AL Wild Card Game 2 lineup\n\nThe Guardians have unveiled their lineup for Game 2.

The mood was celebratory even before the results were called, with people setting off flares when he was declared winner by the country’s election authority.\n\nMany had tears in their eyes, telling CNN that they were hopeful for the country, which has been struggling with high inflation, limited growth and rising poverty.\n\nSupporters of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva react as they wait for results at Paulista Avenue, Sao Paulo. Amanda Perobelli/Reuters\n\nBut others on Avenida Paulista expressed fears. Lula da Silva’s razor thin margin has raised concerns that Bolsonaro will not accept defeat, having repeatedly claimed that Brazil’s electronic ballot system is susceptible to fraud. The entirely unfounded allegation has drawn comparisons to the false election claims of former US President Donald Trump.\n\nHours after the results were announced, Bolsonaro had yet to concede defeat or make any public statement. Meanwhile, videos on social media showed his supporters had blocked highways in two states to protest against Lula da Silva’s victory.\n\n“We will only leave once the army takes over the country,” one unidentified Bolsonaro supporter said in a video taken in the southern state of Santa Catarina.\n\nSpeaking to supporters on Sunday evening, Lula da Silva thanked all Brazilians. “The people who voted for me, the people who voted for the opponent, who went to the polls, who consented to fulfill their civilizing commitment of citizenship, I want to congratulate you,” he said, reported CNN Brasil.\n\nLula da Silva supporters thronged São Paulo Avenida Paulista on Sunday evening. Amanda Perobelli/Reuters\n\n“And, above all, I want to congratulate the people who voted for me because I consider myself a citizen who had a process of resurrection in Brazilian politics because they tried to bury me alive and I’m here,” he added.\n\nLula da Silva and Bolsonaro had previously gone head to head in a first round of voting on October 2, but neither gained more than half of the votes, forcing Sunday’s runoff vote, which became a referendum on two starkly different visions for Brazil.\n\nTensions ahead of the vote\n\nThe election came amid a tense and polarized political climate in Brazil.\n\nThe mood was sombre among Bolsonaro's supporters. Lucas Landau/Reuters\n\nBoth candidates had used this election to attack one another at every turn, and rising anger has overshadowed the polls and clashes among their supporters left many voters feeling fearful of what is to come. Voters in Sao Paulo told CNN that they were keen to end this election season as soon as possible so the country can move on.\n\nWhile there were no reports of political violence on Sunday, Lula da Silva allies accused the police of blocking buses and cars carrying Lula voters from getting to voting sites. However, the Superior Electoral Court (TSE), which runs Brazil’s elections, said no one had been prevented from voting and declined to extend voting hours, Reuters reports. The Federal Highway Police said they had complied with court orders, it added.\n\nA Lula da Silva supporter waves a flag at Avenida Paulista in Sao Paulo on Sunday. Vasco Cotovio/CNN\n\nLula da Silva was president for two terms, from 2003 to 2006 and 2007 to 2011, where he led the country through a commodities boom that helped fund huge social welfare programs and lifted millions out of poverty.\n\nHe left office with a 90% approval rating – a record tarnished however by Brazil’s largest corruption probe, dubbed “Operation Car Wash,” which led to charges against hundreds of high-ranking politicians and businesspeople across Latin America. He was convicted for corruption and money laundering in 2017, but a court threw out his conviction in March 2021, clearing the way for his political rebound.\n\nBolsonaro ran for his first term as president in 2018 with the conservative Liberal Party, campaigning as a political outsider and anti-corruption candidate, and gaining the moniker “Trump of the Tropics.” A divisive figure, Bolsonaro has become known for his bombastic statements and conservative agenda, which is supported by important evangelical leaders in the country.\n\nDuring his reelection bid, Bolsonaro appealed to supporters’ moral values and sense of national unity, and branded his left-wing adversary as “the communist threat.” His campaign, which adopted the slogan “God, Nation, Family, and Liberty,” promised an intensified version of his first term: tax cuts, policies that would support the agricultural industry, reduction of environmental rules, and a continuation of his Auxilio Brasil welfare payments to the poorest.\n\nBut poverty has grown during his presidency, and his popularity levels took a hit over his handling of the pandemic, which he dismissed as the “little flu,” before the virus killed more than 680,000 people in the country.\n\nEnvironmentalists also warned that the future of the rainforest could be at stake in this election, as Bolsonaro’s government had become known for its support of ruthless exploitation of land in the Amazon, leading to record deforestation figures.\n\nLeaders send their wishes\n\nWorld leaders congratulated Lula da Silva on his victory.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden called the election “free, fair, and credible,” saying he looked “forward to working together to continue the cooperation between our two countries in the months and years ahead.”\n\nRegional leaders described his win as a “time of hope.”\n\n“Your victory opens a new time for the history of Latin America. A time of hope and future that begins today. Here you have a partner to work with and dream big about the good life of our peoples,” President of Argentina Alberto Fernández said on Twitter.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron described it as “a new chapter in the history of Brazil. Together, we will join forces to face the many common challenges and renew the bond of friendship between our two countries.”\n\nMore than 156 million people were eligible to vote in this year’s election.

His victory heralds a political about-face for Latin America’s largest country, after four years of Jair Bolsonaro’s far-right administration.\n\nThe 76-year-old politician’s win represents the return of the left into power in Brazil, and concludes a triumphant personal comeback for Lula da Silva, after a series of corruption allegations lead to his imprisonment for 580 days. The sentences were later annulled by the Supreme Court, clearing his path to run for reelection.\n\n“They tried to bury me alive and I’m here,” he said in a jubilant speech to supporters and journalists on Sunday evening, describing the win as his political “resurrection.”\n\n“Starting on January 1, 2023, I will govern for the 215 million Brazilians, not just the ones who voted for me. There are not two Brazils. We are one country, one people, one great nation,” Lula da Silva also said.\n\nHe will take the reins of a country plagued by gross inequality that is still struggling to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. Approximately 9.6 million people fell under the poverty line between 2019 and 2021, and literacy and school attendance rates have fallen. He will also be faced with a deeply fractured nation and urgent environmental issues, including rampant deforestation in the Amazon.\n\nThis will be his third term, after previously governing Brazil for two consecutive terms between 2003 and 2010.\n\nSupporters of Lula da Silva react as they wait for results at Paulista Avenue, Sao Paulo, Brazil, October 30, 2022. Amanda Perobelli/Reuters\n\nThe latest in a leftist wave\n\nThe former leader’s victory on Sunday was the latest in a political wave across Latin America, with wins by left-leaning politicians in Argentina, Colombia and Chile. But Lula da Silva – a former union leader with a blue-collar background – has sought to reassure moderates throughout his campaign.\n\nHe has built a broad alliance including several politicians from the center and center-right, including historical opponents from the PSDB, Brazil’s Social Democrat Party. Among these politicians is his vice-president, former São Paulo governor Geraldo Alckmin, who has been cited by the Lula camp as a guarantee of moderation in his administration.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Lula da Silva has been reluctant to show his cards when it came to outlining an economic strategy – a tendency that earned sharp criticism from his competitors. “Who is the other candidate’s economy minister? There isn’t one, he doesn’t say. What will be his political and economic route? More state? Less state? We don’t know…,” said Bolsonaro during a live transmission on YouTube on October 22.\n\nLula da Silva has said that he would push Congress to approve a tax reform which would exempt low-earners from paying income tax. And his campaign received a boost from centrist former presidential candidate Simone Tebet, who came third in the first round earlier this month and gave Lula da Silva her support in the run-off. Known for her ties with Brazil’s agricultural industry, Tebet said in an October 7 press conference that Lula da Silva and his economic team had “received and incorporated all the suggestions from our program to his government’s program.”\n\nHe has also received the support of several renowned economists highly regarded by investors, including Arminio Fraga, a former president of the Brazilian Central Bank.\n\nHealing a divided country\n\nLula da Silva received more than 60 million votes, the most in Brazilian history, breaking his own record from 2006.\n\nBut despite the huge turnout from his supporters, his victory was by a narrow margin – Lula da Silva won 50.90% of the vote and Bolsonaro received 49.10%, according to Brazil’s electoral authority.\n\nHis biggest challenge now may be unifying a politically fractured country.\n\nHours after the results were announced, Bolsonaro had yet to concede defeat or make any public statement. Meanwhile, videos on social media showed his supporters had blocked highways in two states to protest against Lula da Silva’s victory.\n\n“We will only leave once the army takes over the country,” one unidentified Bolsonaro supporter said in a video taken in the southern state of Santa Catarina.\n\nLula da Silva will need to pursue dialogue and rebuild relationships, said Carlos Melo, a political scientist at Insper, a university in São Paulo. “The president can be an important instrument for this as long as he is not only concerned in addressing his base of voters,” he said.\n\nSupporters of Lula da Silva react as they gather on the day of the Brazilian presidential election run-off, in Brasilia, Brazil October 30, 2022. Diego Vara/Reuters\n\nWith more than 58 million votes cast for his rival Bolsonaro – who had been endorsed by former US President Donald Trump – Lula da Silva will have to form “pragmatic alliances” with parts of the center and the right that bought into his predecessor’s politics, adds Thiago Amparo, professor of law and human rights at FGV business school in São Paulo.\n\nAt the same time, he will have to deliver to match supporters’ expectations, Amparo added. “Many voters went to the ballot expecting that, not just to get rid of Bolsonaro, but with memories of better economic times during Lula’s previous governments.”\n\nMany will be watching for potential change to the 2017 Labor Reform Act, which subjected more workers’ rights and benefits to negotiation with employers, and made union contributions optional. Lula da Silva had said previously that he would revoke the act but recently changed the verb to “review” following criticisms from the private sector.\n\nHe may find that enacting his agenda is an uphill battle, Amparo warns, especially with a hostile Congress. Seats that were from the traditional right are now occupied by the far right, who are not open to negotiation and not easy to deal with, underlines Amparo.\n\nIn the latest elections, Bolsonaro’s Liberal Party increased its representatives in the lower house from 76 to 99, while in the Senate it doubled from seven members to 14. Lula da Silva’s Workers’ Party has also increased its number of deputies from 56 to 68 and senators from seven to eight – but overall, conservative-leaning politicians will dominate the next legislature.\n\nThat friction will require some compromises, points out Camila Rocha, a political scientist at the Cebrap think tank. “[Bolsonaro’s] Liberal Party will have the highest number of representatives and important allies and will make real opposition to the government, [Lula da Silva’s] Worker’s Party will have to sow a coalition with [traditional rightwing party] União Brasil in order to govern, which means the negotiation of ministries and key positions,” Rocha told to CNN.\n\nA supporter of Lula da Silva reacts while gathering with fellow supporters on the day of the Brazilian presidential election run-off, in Brasilia, Brazil October 30, 2022. Diego Vara/Reuters\n\nThe Amazon and climate leadership\n\nEnvironmentalists meanwhile will be watching Lula da Silva’s administration closely, as it assumes governance not only over the Brazilian nation but over the planet’s largest forest reserves.\n\nWith destruction of the vast Amazon rainforest reaching record levels under Bolsonaro’s presidency, Lula da Silva has repeatedly said during his campaign that he would seek to curb deforestation. He has argued that protecting the forest could produce some profit, citing the beauty and pharmaceutical industries as potential beneficiaries of biodiversity.\n\nIn an interview with foreign press in August, Lula da Silva called for “a new world governance” to address climate change and stressed that Brazil should take a central role in that governance, given its natural resources.\n\nAccording to the head of Lula da Silva’s government plan, Aloizio Mercadante, another tactic will be to create a group including Brazil, Indonesia and Congo ahead of the UN-led November 2022 Conference of Parties. The group would aim to pressure richer countries to finance the protection of forests as well as outlining strategies for the global carbon market.\n\nSeveral experts told CNN they believed his stance on environment and the climate issue could represent a fresh start in Brazil’s international relations.\n\nFor Amparo, environmental protection could indeed be springboard for Brazil’s global leadership, a major shift after Bolsonaro warned the world away from intervening in the destruction of the Amazon. “Lula would try to reposition, almost like a rebranding, Brazil in the international arena as a power to be taken into account,” he said.\n\n“We can expect a government that goes back to talking to the world, especially with a new stance in the environmental area,” said Melo, the Insper researcher.", "authors": ["Camilo Rocha"], "publish_date": "2022/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/americas/brazil-election-result-explainer-intl-latam/index.html", "title": "Bolsonaro silent after Brazil presidential vote loss | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nMore than a day after Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was pronounced the winner of Brazil’s 2022 presidential election, incumbent Jair Bolsonaro has yet to publicly acknowledge his loss.\n\nThe President’s delay in conceding Sunday’s race has contributed to fears that he will not cooperate with a transfer of power, amid scattered protests by his supporters. Ahead of the vote, Bolsonaro and some of his allies had made unfounded claims about electoral fraud and unfair treatment by the press.\n\n“Anywhere else in the world, the president who lost would have called me by now and conceded,” Lula da Silva told supporters on Sunday night, explaining that he was “part happy, part worried” about the transfer of power.\n\n“He still hasn’t called, I don’t know if he will and I don’t know if he will concede,” he said.\n\nBut public concession or not, experts say it’s already out of the outgoing President’s hands.\n\nLuiz Inacio Lula da Silva speaks after the election results were announced on Sunday. Danilo Martins Yoshioka/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nIt is Brazil’s Supreme Electoral Court that officially validates election results and communicates them to the Senate, Chamber of Deputies and State Assemblies.\n\nA press officer for the Electoral Court told CNN that the vote’s results are already considered validated, since the court’s declaration of the outcome on Sunday. A court session at a later point will formally confirm the win, but no date has been set for it yet, he said.\n\nElectoral Court President Alexandre de Moraes on Sunday personally called both Lula da Silva and Bolsonaro to inform them of the results and congratulate them on their participation in the democratic process, according to a press release by the Court.\n\nDe Moraes also said he did not see much room for the election to be contested. “The result has been proclaimed, accepted and those who were elected will take office on January 1,” he said in the release.\n\nJair Bolsonaro pictured on election day. Thiago Ribeiro/AGIF/Reuters\n\nBrazilian Senate President Rodrigo Pacheco has already publicly congratulated Lula da Silva and his supporters, as has Chamber of Deputies President Arthur Lira – a close Bolsonaro ally.\n\nForeign leaders from across the globe also swiftly expressed their support for Lula da Silva’s win.\n\n“I send my congratulations to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on his election to be the next president of Brazil following free, fair, and credible elections,” US President Joe Biden said after Sunday’s vote.\n\nAnd Russian President Vladimir Putin sent congratulations in a message reported by Russian state news agency TASS, adding: “The vote’s results confirm your high political authority.”\n\nThe President-elect’s diplomatic work is already underway, with Lula da Silva meeting Argentine President Alberto Fernandez – one of the first foreign leaders to congratulate him – in Sao Paulo on Monday.\n\nPrevious refusals to concede\n\nAt least twice before, Brazilian leaders have refused to participate in the transfer of power.\n\nAt the start of the Brazilian republic in the late 19th century, army marshall Floriano Peixoto did not attend the inauguration of his successor, Prudente de Moraes.\n\nAnd almost a century later, the last of the unelected military presidents, João Batista Figueiredo, snubbed the inauguration of his successor José Sarney.\n\nIn both cases, the boycott was largely symbolic. The same would be true if Bolsonaro were to refuse to concede the presidency in a public statement, according to legal expert Augusto de Arruda Botelho.\n\n“Not acknowledging the result is a non-starter from the political point of view, because at the end of the day, it is the Electoral Court that hands over power to the winner of the election,” he told CNN.\n\n“[Bolsonaro] can kick and scream as much as he wants,” he added.\n\nPlus it is in Bolsonaro’s political interest to appear the good sport, political scientist Camila Rocha told CNN.\n\nRocha’s reseach shows that refusing to concede would be damaging for Bolsonaro’s public image among his own supporters. “Even the most extreme pro-Bolsonaro supporters, like those I interviewed last year in Santa Catarina for my research, say that if Bolsonaro lost he would have to accept the result,” she told CNN.\n\n“So it is very clear that if Bolsonaro refuses to accept Lula’s victory, it could have a negative impact even among his supporters. He would certainly be perceived as a bad loser.”\n\nSupporters of Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro blocking a highway near Abadiania, central Brazil.

Some people had left their taxis and had started walking along the side of the highway to reach the terminal, the crew said.

A number of flights have been delayed, according to an airline agent who spoke to CNN. Airline pilots and crew have not been able to make it to the airport because the blockade is causing significant delays at the airport, the agent told CNN.\n\nSome police officers on the road leading to the airport told CNN that they were afraid of upsetting the protesters and were trying to avoid confrontation.\n\nSeveral protesters have made clear they do not believe the election result.\n\n“We have a President that won at the ballot box and they defrauded the ballot boxes and put the other candidate ahead and we’re against that,” said Luis Valejo, a Bolsonaro supporter.\n\nAnother, Jurandir Santos, said that even if Bolsonaro accepts the results, “the people will not accept it.”\n\nIn the first public comments by any member of Bolsonaro’s inner circle since his election defeat, Bolsonaro’s son, Sen.

Bruno Kelly/Reuters Prev Next\n\nLula vs. Bolsonaro on the campaign trail\n\nWhile there were nearly a dozen candidates on the ballot, the race was dominated from the outset by Lula and Bolsonaro, two titans of Brazilian politics who engaged in a bruising campaign season marked by bitter verbal attacks and a series of violent incidents between rival supporters.\n\nBolsonaro, 67, ran for re-election under the conservative Liberal Party. He has campaigned to increase mining, privatize public companies and generate more sustainable energy to bring down energy prices. He has vowed to continue paying a R$600 (about $110) monthly benefit known as Auxilio Brasil.\n\nHis government is known for its support for ruthless exploitation of land in the Amazon, leading to record deforestation figures. Environmentalists are warning that the future of the rainforest could be at stake in this election.\n\nBolsonaro has also been widely criticized for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 686,000 people in Brazil have died from the virus.\n\nLula, 76, focused his campaign on getting Bolsonaro out of office and highlighted his past achievements throughout his campaign.\n\nHe left office with a 90% approval rating in 2011, and is largely credited for lifting millions of Brazilians from extreme poverty through the “Bolsa Familia” welfare program.\n\nHis campaign promised a new tax regime that will allow for higher public spending. He has vowed to end hunger in the country, which has returned during the Bolsonaro government. Lula also promises to work to reduce carbon emissions and deforestation in the Amazon.\n\nLula, however, is also no stranger to controversy. He was convicted for corruption and money laundering in 2017, on charges stemming from the wide-ranging “Operation Car Wash” investigation into the state-run oil company Petrobras. But after serving less than two years, a Supreme Court Justice annulled Lula’s conviction in March 2021, clearing the way for him to run for president for a sixth time.\n\nFollowers of former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio \"Lula\" da Silva react as they listen to the partial results after polls closed in Rio de Janeiro on October 2, 2022.

He wants to bring in centrists and even some leaning to the right who voted for him for the first time, and to restore the country’s more prosperous past. Yet he faces headwinds in a politically polarized society where economic growth is slowing and inflation is soaring.\n\nHis victory marks the first time since Brazil’s 1985 return to democracy that the sitting president has failed to win reelection. The highly polarized election in Latin America's biggest economy extended a wave of recent leftist victories in the region, including Chile, Colombia and Argentina.\n\nDa Silva's inauguration is scheduled to take place on Jan. 1. He last served as president from 2003-2010.\n\nIt was the country's closest election in over three decades. Just over 2 million votes separated the two candidates with 99.5% of the vote counted. The previous closest race, in 2014, was decided by a margin of 3.46 million votes.\n\nThomas Traumann, an independent political analyst, compared the results to U.S. President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory, saying da Silva is inheriting an extremely divided nation.\n\n“The huge challenge that Lula has will be to pacify the country,” he said. “People are not only polarized on political matters, but also have different values, identity and opinions. What’s more, they don’t care what the other side’s values, identities and opinions are.”\n\nBolsonaro had been leading throughout the first half of the count and, as soon as da Silva overtook him, cars in the streets of downtown Sao Paulo began honking their horns. People in the streets of Rio de Janeiro's Ipanema neighborhood could be heard shouting, \"It turned!\"\n\nDa Silva’s headquarters in downtown Sao Paulo hotel only erupted once the final result was announced, underscoring the tension that was a hallmark of this race.\n\n“Four years waiting for this,” said Gabriela Souto, one of the few supporters allowed in due to heavy security.\n\nOnPolitics: Get political news, fast and to the point, delivered to your inbox.\n\nIn the first round of voting, on Oct. 2, the first half of votes tallied likewise showed Bolsonaro ahead, with da Silva pulling ahead later after votes from his strongholds were counted. Both men are well-known, divisive political figures who stir passion as much as loathing.\n\nThe vote will determine if the world's fourth-largest democracy stays the same course of far-right politics or returns a leftist to the top job — and, in the latter case, whether Bolsonaro will accept defeat. There were multiple reports of what critics said appeared attempts to suppress turnout of likely voters for da Silva, who was president from 2003-2010.\n\nVoting stations in the capital, Brasilia, were already crowded by morning and, at one of them, retired government worker Luiz Carlos Gomes said he would vote for da Silva.\n\n\"He's the best for the poor, especially in the countryside,\" said Gomes, 65, who hails from Maranhao state in the poor northeast region. \"We were always starving before him.\"\n\nMost opinion polls before the election gave a lead to da Silva, universally known as Lula, though political analysts agreed the race grew increasingly tight in recent weeks.\n\nFor months, it appeared that da Silva was headed for easy victory as he kindled nostalgia for his presidency, when Brazil's economy was booming and welfare helped tens of millions join the middle class.\n\nElection:Da Silva edges Bolsonaro in Brazil election, but not by enough votes to avoid runoff\n\nBut while da Silva topped the Oct. 2 first-round elections with 48% of the vote, Bolsonaro was a strong second at 43%, showing opinion polls significantly underestimated his popularity. Many Brazilians support Bolsonaro's defense of conservative social values, and he has shored up support with vast government spending.\n\nCandidates in Brazil who top the first round tend to win the runoff. But political scientist Rodrigo Prando said this campaign is so atypical that a Bolsonaro win could not be ruled out.\n\nMore than 150 million Brazilians are eligible to vote, yet about 20% of the electorate abstained in the first round. Both da Silva and Bolsonaro have focused efforts on driving turnout. The electoral authority prohibited any federal highway police operations from affecting voters' passage on public transport.\n\nStill, there were multiple reports of checkpoints and traffic stops. Television network Globo reported more than 500 stops, half of which in the northeast region, a Workers' Party stronghold. The party filed a request for the arrest of the highway police's director, and demanded the region's polls remain open later.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Brasilia, the electoral authority's president Alexandre de Moraes said the police force's director had provided clarification that no stop lasted over 15 minutes, turnout wasn't affected and polls would close at 5 p.m. local time, as scheduled.\n\nBolsonaro was first in line to cast his vote at a military complex in Rio de Janeiro. He sported the green and yellow colors of the Brazilian flag that always feature at his rallies.\n\n\"I'm expecting our victory, for the good of Brazil,\" he told reporters afterward. \"God willing, we will be victorious this afternoon. Actually, Brazil will be victorious.\"\n\nDa Silva voted Sunday morning in Sao Bernardo do Campo, a city outside Sao Paulo, where he lived for decades and started his political career as a union leader. He wore white, as he often has during the campaign, rather than his party's traditional red.\n\n\"Today we are choosing the kind of Brazil we want, how we want our society to organize. People will decide what kind of life they want,\" da Silva told reporters. \"That's why this is the most important day of my life. I am convinced that Brazilians will vote for a plan under which democracy wins.\"\n\nThe candidates presented few proposals for the country's future beyond affirming they will continue a big welfare program for the poor, despite very limited fiscal room going forward. They railed against one another and launched online smear campaigns — with considerably more attacks coming from Bolsonaro's camp.\n\nOn the eve of the election, Bolsonaro shared video on Twitter of former U.S. President Donald Trump endorsing him, saying that he has secured Brazil's universal respect on the world stage. Da Silva has specifically criticized Bolsonaro for the nation's fallen stature abroad, highlighting the dearth of state visits and bilateral meetings.\n\n\"Don't lose him, don't let that happen,\" Trump said in the video. \"It would not be good for your country. I love your country, but it would not be good. So get out and vote for President Bolsonaro. He's doing the job like few people could.\"\n\nHis four years in office have been marked by proclaimed conservatism and defense of traditional Christian values. He claimed that his rival's return to power would usher in communism, legalized drugs, abortion and the persecution of churches — things that didn't happen during da Silva's earlier eight years in office.\n\nOn Sunday, Livia Correia and her husband, Pedro, brought her two young kids to a voting station in Rio's Copacabana neighborhood, where Bolsonaro supporters regularly rally. They all wore green-and-yellow shirts. Livia, 36, said she voted for Bolsonaro because he defends the things she holds dear: \"family values, God and freedom of expression.\"\n\nDa Silva has homed in on Bolsonaro's widely criticized handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and said the president failed to care for society's neediest members. And he painted Bolsonaro as an opponent of the Amazon rainforest, given that he defanged environmental authorities and presided over a surge in deforestation.\n\nBut for many, the record of da Silva's Workers' Party is equally off-putting. A sprawling investigation revealed the party's involvement in vast corruption scandals that ensnared top politicians and executives.\n\nDa Silva himself was imprisoned for 19 months for corruption and money laundering. The Supreme Court annulled his convictions in 2019, on the grounds that the judge was biased and colluded with prosecutors. That did not stop Bolsonaro from reminding voters of the convictions.\n\nThe president's tremendous digital mobilization was on display in recent days as his campaign introduced fresh — and unproven — claims of possible electoral manipulation. That revived fears that Bolsonaro could challenge election results should he lose — much like Trump, whom he admires.\n\nFor months, he claimed that the nation's electronic voting machines are prone to fraud, though he never presented evidence, even after the electoral authority set a deadline for him to do so.\n\nMore recently, allegations focused on airtime for political ads. Bolsonaro's campaign claimed that radio stations may have hurt their candidate by failing to air more than 150,000 electoral spots.\n\n\"If da Silva wins, we're going to have a problem,\" said Pedro Correia, 40, who joined his wife and two children in Copacabana.\n\n\"It's impossible that he wins,\" he said.\n\nCarla Bridi reported from Brasilia.

Clashes among their supporters have left many voters feeling fearful of what is yet to come.\n\nThe race could be a close one. Neither gained over 50% in a first round vote earlier this month, forcing the two leading candidates into this Sunday’s run-off vote.\n\nThe candidates\n\nLula da Silva was president for two terms, from 2003 to 2006 and 2007 to 2011, where he led the country through a commodities boom that helped fund huge social welfare programs and lifted millions out of poverty.\n\nThe charismatic politician is known for his dramatic backstory: He didn’t learn to read until he was 10, left school after fifth grade to work full-time, and went on to lead worker strikes which defied the military regime in 1970s. He co-founded the Workers’ Party (PT), that became Brazil’s main left-wing political force.\n\nLula da Silva left office with a 90% approval rating – a record tarnished however by Brazil’s largest corruption probe, dubbed “Operation Car Wash,” which led to charges against hundreds of high-ranking politicians and businesspeople across Latin America. He was convicted for corruption and money laundering in 2017, but a court threw out his conviction in March 2021, clearing the way for his political rebound “in a plot twist worthy of one of the Brazilian beloved telenovelas,” Bruna Santos, a senior advisor at the Wilson Institute’s Brazil Center, told CNN.\n\nBrazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, who is running for a second term, smiles during a campaign rally in Guarulhos, the great Sao Paulo area, on October 22, 2022. Andre Penner/AP\n\nHis rival, Bolsonaro, is a former army captain who was a federal deputy for 27 years. Bolsonaro was considered a marginal figure in politics during much of this time before emerging in the mid-2010s as the figurehead of a more radically right-wing movement, which perceived the PT as its main enemy.\n\nHe ran for President in 2018 with the conservative Liberal Party, campaigning as a political outsider and anti-corruption candidate, and gaining the moniker ‘Trump of the Tropics.’ A divisive figure, Bolsonaro has become known for his bombastic statements and conservative agenda, which is supported by important evangelical leaders in the country.\n\nBut poverty has grown during his time as President, and his popularity levels took a hit over his handling of the pandemic, which he dismissed as the “little flu,” before the virus killed more than 680,000 people in the country.\n\nBolsonaro’s government has become known for its support of ruthless exploitation of land in the Amazon, leading to record deforestation figures. Environmentalists have warned that the future of the rainforest could be at stake in this election.\n\nWhat are their platforms?\n\nThe race is a tight one for the two household names who espouse radically different paths to prosperity.\n\nBolsonaro’s campaign is a continuation of his conservative, pro-business agenda. Bolsonaro has promised to increase mining, privatize public companies and generate more sustainable energy to bring down energy prices. But he has also has vowed to continue paying a R$600 (roughly US$110) monthly benefit for low-income households known as Auxilio Brasil, without clearly defining how it will be paid for.\n\nBolsonaro accelerated those financial aid payments this month, a move seen by critics as politically motivated. “As the election loomed, his government has made direct payments to working-class and poor voters – in a classic populist move,” Santos told CNN.\n\nBolsonaro’s socially conservative messaging, which includes railing against political correctness and promotion of traditional gender roles, has effectively rallied his base of Brazilian conservative voters, she also said.\n\nLula co-founded the Workers' Party (PT), that became Brazil's main left-wing political force. Andre Penner/AP\n\nLula da Silva’s policy agenda has been light on the details, focusing largely on promises to improve Brazilians fortunes based on past achievements, say analysts.\n\nHe wants to put the state back at the heart of economic policy making and government spending, promising a new tax regime that will allow for higher public spending. He has vowed to end hunger in the country, which has returned during the Bolsonaro government. Lula da Silva also promises to work to reduce carbon emissions and deforestation in the Amazon.\n\nBut Santos warns that he’ll face an uphill battle: “With a fragile fiscal scenario (in Brazil) and little power over the budget, it won’t be easy.”\n\nLula da Silva faces a hostile congress if he becomes president. Congressional elections on October 3 gave Bolsonaro’s allies the most seats in both houses: Bolsonaro’s right-wing Liberal Party increased its seats to 99 in the lower house, and parties allied with him now control half the chamber, Reuters reports.\n\n“Lula seems to ignore the necessary search for new engines of growth because the state cannot grow more,” she said.\n\nWhat will happen on Election Day?\n\nA Datafolha poll released last Wednesday showed 49% of respondents said they would vote for Lula da Silva and 45% would go for Bolsonaro, who gained a percentage point from a poll by the same institute a week ago.\n\nBut Bolsonaro fared better than expected in the October 2 first round vote, denying Lula da Silva the outright majority which polls had predicted. The incumbent’s outperformance of the polls in the first round suggests wider support for Bolsonaro’s populist brand of conservatism, and analysts expect the difference in Sunday’s vote to be much tighter than expected.\n\nThere could be any number of other surprises. Fears of violence have haunted this election, with several violent and sometimes fatal clashes between Bolsonaro and Lula da Silva supporters recorded in recent months. From the start of this year until the first round of voting, the US non-profit Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) recorded “36 instances of political violence involving party representatives and supporters across the country,” that suggests “even greater tensions and polarization than recorded in the previous general elections.”\n\nCritics also fear Bolsonaro has been laying the groundwork to contest the election. Though he insists he will respect the results if they are “clean and transparent,” Bolsonaro has repeatedly claimed that Brazil’s electronic ballot system is susceptible to fraud – an entirely unfounded allegation that has drawn comparisons to the false election claims of former US President Donald Trump. There is no record of fraud in Brazilian electronic ballots since they began in 1996, and experts are worried the rhetoric will lead to outbreaks of violence if Lula da Silva wins.\n\n“In this consequential election, the confidence we have in the strength of Brazilian democratic institutions is going to be challenged,” Santos said.", "authors": ["Tara John"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/americas/brazil-prepares-presidential-election-runoff-intl-latam/index.html", "title": "Bolsonaro and Lula address supporters as Brazil run-off looms | CNN", "text": "São Paulo, Brazil CNN —\n\nBrazilians woke up to four more weeks of campaigning after a presidential vote on Sunday destined frontrunners Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva and Jair Bolsonaro to a second round run-off later this month.\n\nResults released Monday by Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court (TSE) showed left-wing candidate and former president da Silva finished with a slight lead over right-wing incumbent Bolsonaro – 48.4% versus 43.2% – not enough to cross the threshold to victory.

We also elected the highest number of representatives in the House and Senate, which was our highest priority at the first moment,” the president tweeted, dubbing it: “the greatest victory of patriots in the history of Brazil.”\n\nMore than 123 million Brazilians waited in long lines to vote in the world’s fourth largest democracy, while another 32 million abstained.

Bruno Kelly/Reuters Prev Next\n\nSunday’s “democracy party” — a term in Brazil for elections — followed a bruising campaign season marked with violence and bitter language.\n\nIn the months leading up to Sunday’s vote, Bolsonaro had frequently criticized the Brazilian electoral system and accuracy of the country’s electronic ballots system, drawing condemnation for eroding trust in the electoral process. There were several reports of violence breaking out between da Silva and Bolsonaro supporters during the campaign months, with some turning deadly.\n\nOn Monday, da Silva supporters chattered on social media about how a potential victory would weigh against the country’s new conservative legislators. For some, excitement has soured into argument about what their candidate must do to maintain his lead over the next four weeks.\n\nDuring a speech on Monday in Sao Paulo, da Silva previewed a new strategy for the last stretch of his campaign. “Advice to our campaign command: from tomorrow there will be less talk between us and more talks with the voter. We don’t need to talk to people we already know, who have already voted for us or that we know will vote for us. We need to talk to those who don’t seem to like us, who don’t vote for us, who don’t like our parties,” he said.\n\nBolsonaro on Monday meanwhile urged supporters to “stay focused” on a prospective victory, saying that “profound change” had already taken root.\n\n“Keep the focus! One of the main and most difficult goals was achieved yesterday,” he said.", "authors": ["Rodrigo Pedroso"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/01/americas/brazil-election-explainer-intl-latam/index.html", "title": "Bolsonaro or Lula? As Brazil prepares to vote, here's what to know", "text": "CNN —\n\nBrazil’s hotly contested presidential election is less than 24 hours away, and for many Brazilians, the stakes couldn’t be higher.\n\nTwo household names – former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and current leader Jair Bolsonaro – are battling to become the country’s next president. Depending on who ultimately wins, Latin America’s largest economy will likely either continue on Bolsonaro’s conservative, pro-business path, or else take a left turn under Lula.\n\nIn recent weeks, both candidates have ramped up efforts to woo voters. But this is an arduous task in a country where 85% of voters say they have already made up their minds, according to a Datafolha poll released Thursday.\n\nFor Lula, more votes could mean victory in the first round of voting, with no need for a runoff. Meanwhile, Bolsonaro needs to catch up, after slipping 14 points behind his rival in the same survey.\n\nWhen is Brazil’s election?\n\nBrazilians will vote for their next president on Sunday, October 2, in the first round of the elections. On the same date, governors, senators, federal and state deputies for the country’s 26 states plus the federal district will also be chosen.\n\nVoting is scheduled to start at 8 a.m. local time in Brasilia (7 a.m. ET) and concludes at 5 p.m. local (4 p.m. ET).\n\nIn the Brazilian electoral system, a winning candidate must gain more than 50% of the vote. If no candidate crosses that threshold, a second round of voting will be organized, in which the options will be narrowed down to the two frontrunners from the first round.\n\nIn Brazil, opinion polls always estimate candidates’ potential performance in the first round (competing against with all other candidates) and in the second round (with just two top candidates).\n\nOver 156 million Brazilians are eligible to vote.\n\nBolsonaro looks on during a televised debate organized by a pool of local media at SBT Studios on September 24, 2022 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Rodrigo Paiva/Getty Images\n\nWho are the candidates?\n\nBolsonaro and Lula are by far the candidates to watch. Though other candidates are also in the race, they’re polling with one-digit percentages and are unlikely to pose much competition.\n\nLula, 76, was Brazil’s President for two terms – from 2003 to 2006 and 2007 to 2011. A household name, he first came into the political scene in the 1970s as a leader of worker strikes which defied the military regime.\n\nIn 1980, he was one of the founders of the Workers’ Party (PT), which went on to become Brazil’s main left-wing political force. Lula’s presidential terms were marked by programs aimed at reducing poverty and inequality in the country but also rocked by revelations of a corruption scheme involving the payment of congressional representatives to support government proposals. Due to lack of evidence of his involvement, Lula himself was never included in the investigation of this scheme.\n\nLula’s campaign for the presidency now promises a new tax regime that will allow for higher public spending. He has vowed to end hunger in the country, which has returned during the Bolsonaro government. Lula also promises to work to reduce carbon emissions and deforestation in the Amazon.\n\nBolsonaro is a former army captain who was a federal deputy for 27 years before running for President in 2018. A marginal figure in politics during much of this time, he emerged in the mid-2010s as a leading figure of a more radically right-wing movement, which perceived the PT as its main enemy.\n\nAs a President, Bolsonaro has pursued a conservative agenda, supported by important evangelical leaders. His government also became known for its support for ruthless exploitation of land in the Amazon, leading to record deforestation figures. Environmentalists have warned that the future of the rainforest could be at stake in this election.\n\nIn his program, Bolsonaro promises to increase mining, privatize public companies and generate more sustainable energy to bring down energy prices. He has vowed to continue paying a R$600 (roughly US$110) monthly benefit known as Auxilio Brasil.\n\nDa Silva speaks during an event organized by workers' unions on International Workers' Day in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on Sunday, May 1, 2022. Tuane Fernandes/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWhen will we know the results?\n\nVote counting begins right after ballots (mostly electronic) close on Sunday.\n\nBrazil’s electoral authorities say they expect final results from the first round to be officially announced that evening, on October 2. They will be published on the electoral court’s website.\n\nIn the last few elections, results were officially declared two to three hours after voting finished. If the leading candidate does not manage to muster more than half of all valid votes, a second round will take place on October 30.\n\nObservers will be watching closely to see if all candidates accept the vote result publicly. Bolsonaro, who has been accused of firing up supporters with violent rhetoric, has sought to sow doubts about the result and said that the results should be considered suspicious if he doesn’t gain “at least 60%.”\n\nBoth he and his conservative Liberal Party claimed that Brazil’s electronic ballot system is susceptible to fraud – an entirely unfounded allegation that has drawn comparisons to the false election claims of former US President Donald Trump.\n\nThere have been no proven instances of voter fraud in the electronic ballot in Brazil.\n\nThe Supreme Electoral Court has also rejected claims of flaws in the system, as “false and untruthful, with no base in reality.”", "authors": ["Camilo Rocha"], "publish_date": "2022/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/politics/trump-lula-da-silva-netanyahu-second-political-acts/index.html", "title": "In Brazil and Israel, leaders show Trump there can be political next ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt’s the season of political comebacks, and don’t think ex-President Donald Trump isn’t watching.\n\nTwice in as many days, in Brazil and Israel, former world leaders who just can’t give up that tantalizing taste of political ambition have moved to the cusp of a return to power. Past scandals, their own legal nightmares and treacherous politics aren’t stopping them from recreating that dream of a past glory. Trump would love to plow a similar furrow.\n\nBoth former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva and ex-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have shown that time out of power could be a springboard for unlikely political rebounds.\n\nThis may be a hopeful sign for Trump, who has leveraged the midterm elections next week as a show of his own power within the Republican Party, anointing a crop of nominees who promote his 2020 election fraud falsehoods.\n\nTrump has left no doubt that he’s itching to mount another presidential campaign – not just because he misses the spotlight. He possibly sees a new White House bid as a shield against possible indictment in several criminal probes.\n\n“I will probably have to do it again,” Trump told supporters at a rally in Texas last month, referring to the possibility of his third presidential campaign, which would be rooted in his still-high popularity in the Republican Party but could founder on his far more uncertain standing among a broader general electorate.\n\nAmerican presidents defeated after only one term have generally faded pretty fast into history. Trump would need to emulate a feat achieved only once before, by President Grover Cleveland, who lost the election of 1888 only to return to the White House after exacting revenge on President Benjamin Harrison after his victory four years later.\n\nThe art of the political comeback\n\nIsrael’s Netanyahu, one of Trump’s closest friends on the international stage, would love to get the band back together with Trump.\n\nOn Tuesday, the former prime minister, first elected in 1996 and who has dominated Israeli politics for much of the last quarter century, was on the verge of a stunning second comeback, as initial exit polls suggested he may have won a narrow majority in yet another election in a nation politically split down the middle.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback The born survivor who molded modern Israel 04:35 - Source: CNN\n\nAnd on Sunday in Brazil, Lula da Silva, who’s known as “Lula,” narrowly defeated President Jair Bolsonaro in a runoff election. While Trump probably would have preferred the opposite result since Bolsonaro is something of a protégé, the leftist former leader’s win showed that former presidents can have second acts.\n\nLula da Silva, a former two-term president of Brazil, has, like Trump, had his run-ins with legal authorities. In fact, his long and winding road to a political return detoured through a partial jail term for alleged corruption. The Supreme Court’s annulment of his sentences cleared him to run again.\n\nThere had been fears that Bolsonaro would emulate his US alter ego and fellow Covid-19 mask rejectionist by refusing to accept the result of an election that tipped him out of power after only a single term. But while he hasn’t conceded, the man known as “The Trump of the Tropics” says he’ll respect the constitution and hasn’t so far resorted to inciting an insurrection to try to keep his job. But he’s unlikely to go away: He lost the election by the narrowest of margins, his political movement is still strong – and, like Trump, he may be looking to the future.\n\nBolsonaro and Lula da Silva aren’t the only blasts from the past who’ve tried to pave a way back to power. In Italy, three-time former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is back in parliament after a tax fraud scandal, though his attempt to play kingmaker in coalition talks dissolved after he boasted about his ties with old friend Russian President Vladimir Putin, who just happens to be a hero to Trump as well.\n\nLike Lula da Silva and Bolsonaro, Trump enjoys fervent support from loyalist supporters who aren’t dissuaded by their run-ins with the law.\n\nLula da Silva emerged from jail as a hero to his followers, one-and-a-half years into a 12-year sentence for corruption and money laundering imposed in 2018.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear what Lula said after narrowly beating Bolsonaro 02:16 - Source: CNN\n\nNetanyahu, however, is still embroiled in his corruption trial and faces one charge of bribery and three charges of fraud and breach of trust in three separate investigations. He has adopted a distinctly Trumpian approach to his plight – slamming the investigations as a “witch hunt” and an “attempted coup” and, like the former US president, has raised doubts about the legitimacy of the judiciary.\n\nAs he travels the world, President Joe Biden has been telling allies that “America is back” or, in other words, that the disruptive Trump administration that alienated allies and saw the American president cozy up to dictators, is over.\n\nYet many foreign diplomats – as they observe the vitriol and division in the United States and Trump’s strength with his base, not to mention the state-level candidates he’s elevated this year who could oversee the 2024 election – wonder how long they can bank on the more traditional, multilateral brand of stable US leadership Biden is trying to restore. Even if Trump doesn’t run in 2024, the power of his movement is so strong in the GOP that a possible future Republican president would likely share his populist, nationalist, “America First” instincts.\n\nThe comeback that failed\n\nStill, the comeback trail is not always kind to populist leaders who have fallen from power. Ex-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson just saw his attempt to win back 10 Downing Street foiled after the short, but disastrous premiership of his successor Liz Truss.\n\nJohnson – once referred to as “Britain Trump” by the former US president – last month failed to persuade sufficient Conservative MPs to reelect him as their leader and, therefore under the British system, as prime minister.\n\nThe chaos, scandals and mismanagement of Johnson’s premiership featured partying in Downing Street when the rest of the country was being told to observe strict Covid-19 protocols. Conservative MPs opted instead for former Finance Minister Rishi Sunak, who has only been in power for a week but is already finding out what many observers believe to be the case – that the Conservative Party is ungovernable.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Who is Britain's next prime minister? 03:02 - Source: CNN\n\nJohnson, like Trump, isn’t ready to cede the limelight. On Tuesday, he told Sky News that he planned to attend the COP27 climate summit in Egypt later this month. He made the announcement after Sunak said he wouldn’t attend owing to the demands of salvaging the British economy. But on Wednesday, the sitting prime minister tweeted that he would indeed go to the conference – amid suggestions he didn’t want to be overshadowed by one of his predecessors.\n\nJohnson, unlike Trump, did not get defeated in a general election. Instead, his colleagues decided he was an electoral liability, which is very different from how the GOP has treated Trump.\n\nJohnson still believes he has a mandate to rule, given the landslide election win he masterminded in December 2019 – and it’s a safe bet he’d be ready to pounce if Sunak founders.\n\nJohnson’s hero is Winston Churchill, the original political comeback kid who endured years in the political wilderness before his country turned to him for leadership in its darkest hour in World War II.\n\nAfter his shock defeat in the 1945 election, the great Briton didn’t go away either: He returned to 10 Downing Street as prime minister six years later.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}]}

The Nets have been another mess, with bad play on the court and bad headlines off it.\n\nThe biggest — again — was created by Irving, who posted a link to an antisemitic work on his Twitter page last week, drawing criticism from Nets owner Joe Tsai.\n\nMarks said he and Nash had been talking for a week, perhaps more, before arriving at the decision that it was time for change.\n\n“It was certainly trending that way and to be quite frank the team was not doing what it was supposed to be doing,” Marks said. “We’ve fallen from our goals and of meeting our goals and it was time now because we still have lofty aspirations of where we need get to.”\n\nMarks said players were not consulted, but Durant said there wouldn't have been any need because everyone knew the situation the Nets were in.\n\n“Let’s be real. We’re pros, we’re veterans,” Durant said. “We had a tough start. It was a rocky year last year, rocky summer. We knew that everybody was being evaluated. That’s just how it is in the league.”\n\nThe Nets may move quickly to replace Nash. A person with knowledge of the matter said the Nets were in discussions with suspended Boston coach Ime Udoka — a former Brooklyn assistant who is not with the Celtics this season because he was found to have violated team rules by having a relationship with a female staffer within the organization. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because those talks were not revealed publicly.\n\nESPN first reported the talks between Udoka and the Nets. The Nets said a decision on the team’s next coach would be made in the near future.\n\nMarks denied that he had decided on a coach and wouldn't give a list of candidates. He also wouldn't discuss whether Udoka would be accepted in Brooklyn so soon after his troubles in Boston.\n\n“But I would say I will reserve that for when those decisions are made and I couldn’t give you a timeline on that,” Marks said. “Obviously there’s a reason why we made this move when we did, because time is ticking. So we do want this process to be a thorough one, we’re not going to skip steps on that and then we’ll do our due diligence like in any way. When I was hired, when anybody was hired the organization does very, very thorough due diligence on anybody, and you arrive at the best possible outcome.”\n\nNash led the Nets to a 92-62 record and the playoffs in both full seasons, his first as an NBA coach. But they lost Irving and James Harden to injuries during their second-round loss to Milwaukee in 2021, then were a first-round flop last season after trading Harden during the middle of the season.\n\nMuch of the Nets' problems during the latter season were caused by Irving being unavailable for most of their home games because he refused to get vaccinated for the coronavirus, as mandated at the time in New York City.\n\nNash handled it all as best as possible, but apparently not good enough for his best player. Durant said he wanted to be traded this summer if the Nets didn't fire Marks and Nash, but Tsai stood by them and Durant eventually pulled back his request.\n\nNash downplayed that before this season began, saying he didn't believe the reports were entirely true and that they had quickly talked through their issues.\n\nBut things started poorly this season and Nash gave some of his hardest criticism of the team during his tenure after their loss to Indiana on Saturday night, calling their defensive effort a “disaster” and saying he didn't see desire or will.\n\n“We have to look deep, deep inside ourselves and what we want to do, what we want to accomplish,” Nash said. “Do we want to give up on this because it’s been difficult early, or do we want to stay the course and start to build something?”\n\nMuch of that was ignored because the focus was on Irving's combative news conference defending his tweet, and the Nets beat the Pacers in the rematch Monday to end a four-game skid.\n\nBut Nash's tenure ended anyway a day later, hours before Brooklyn is set to host Chicago. Jacque Vaughn served as acting head coach against the Bulls.\n\nTsai alluded to the constant turbulence around the team in his statement thanking Nash.\n\n“My admiration and respect for him grew over time as he brought hard work and positive attitude to our organization every day, even in periods of exceptional storm surrounding the team,” Tsai said.\n\nNash thanked the Tsai family and Marks for giving him the opportunity, calling the job “an amazing experience with many challenges that I'm incredibly grateful for.”\n\nMarks chose his former teammate as coach in 2020 despite no experience in the job, citing Nash's ability to be a connector of personalities as a player. Nash was a two-time MVP with the Phoenix Suns who ended his 18-year career third on the NBA's list with 10,335 assists.\n\nBut his schemes were criticized as the Nets struggled defensively throughout his tenure and often didn't show the ball-moving style of play on offense that his Suns teams did, instead relying on Durant, Irving or Harden to isolate.\n\nBeyond the player changes, Nash also had to adapt to changes on his bench. Mike D'Antoni, the two-time NBA Coach of the Year, stepped down as his assistant after one season, and Udoka left to become coach of the Celtics.\n\n___\n\nAP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/columnist/jeff-zillgitt/2022/08/08/kevin-durant-ultimatum-brooklyn-nets-steve-nash-sean-marks/10271459002/", "title": "Kevin Durant's 'ultimatum' puts Nets in a bind, but empathy for ...", "text": "No one feels sorry for the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nNot for owner Joe Tsai.

Brooklyn ramped up those aspirations when it traded for James Harden in January 2021. The trio played just 16 games together because of injuries and Irving’s decision to not get the COIVD-19 vaccine, making him ineligible to play in most Nets home games in the 2021-22 season because of New York City’s vaccine mandate.\n\nThe Nets lost in the conference semifinals in 2021 and first round in 2022, and Harden is no longer with he team – traded to Philadelphia for Ben Simmons at the trade deadline. Harden, too, wanted out, and before free agency began on June 30, Irving looked for potential trades and his situation – no matter what anyone says – remains unresolved.\n\nWord has circulated for weeks that Durant and Irving were unhappy with Nash as the coach, and now Tsai is left with choices, including one not on Durant’s ultimatum.\n\n— Fire Nash and Marks and hire anew with the prospect that a new GM and coach would satisfy Durant, an iffy proposition at best. There’s no guarantee Durant would want out after a season or two, and catering to stars hasn't helped the Nets at all in the past three seasons.\n\n— Canning Marks and retaining Nash is another option if Durant is pleased with Nash but unhappy with the rosters Marks has built. Durant has had praise for Nash, both at the start of Nash's tenure in 2020 and at the end of the 2021-22 season.\n\n— Trade Durant and keep Nash and Marks. No team wants an unhappy player, especially as he enters the first year of a four-year extension worth $194.2 million. Regardless of what you think of Nash as a head coach, he’s never had a full roster or one deep and well-rounded enough to compete. Marks has been on job 6½ years, and he had the rebuild headed in the right direction with D’Angelo Russell, Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen. But the franchise’s desire to add stars derailed that rebuild, though it's hard to say it was wrong at the time to add Durant, Irving and Harden.\n\n— Trade Durant and Irving and fire Nash and Marks and start all over again. The first part of that equation is more difficult than the second, but finding a new coach and staff at this point in the offseason isn’t easy either. Irving has just one season left on his contract, and while there aren’t many (any?) teams interested, the Nets could re-engage with the Los Angeles Lakers. Sending Durant elsewhere became more complicated when the Utah Jazz landed five first-round picks and three players for Rudy Gobert. The Nets have to do better than that for Durant, and that offer doesn’t exist just yet.\n\nTraining camps open in less than two months, and the Nets need resolution to this situation or another season could be derailed.\n\nFollow Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2022/11/02/analysis-escaping-the-irving-saga-makes-nash-a-big-winner/50894077/", "title": "Analysis: Escaping the Irving saga makes Nash a big winner", "text": "AP\n\nSteve Nash got paroled.\n\nThat’s the easiest way to say it. Some will say fired, and the official term used Tuesday was that Nash and the Brooklyn Nets agreed “to part ways,” which is the popular phrasing these days when a coach leaves a team.\n\nBut the reality is this: He’s free.\n\nWhatever happens next in the never-ending string of Kyrie Irving developments won’t be taking up Nash’s time. The Earth can be flat. Alex Jones can be right about conspiracy theories. Links to antisemitic movies can be shared with millions of followers. The merits of vaccines can be debated.\n\nNot Nash's problem anymore.\n\nThis was never going to work in Brooklyn, and the signs were there long before Nash’s first game. Irving made a podcast appearance in the fall of 2020, while the bubble season — the one that Irving railed against and wouldn’t join — was still going on at Walt Disney World. On that podcast, Irving offered up that the Nets didn’t really need a head coach and that it could be “a collaborative effort” between himself, Kevin Durant and others.\n\nFor 99% of the players in the NBA, that statement would be considered wild.\n\nIt's just another entry on a long list of Irving stories.\n\nIrving, it seems, is understanding how deeply his tweet and comment last week hurt some people. He and the Nets announced Wednesday night that they would each donate $500,000 “toward causes and organizations that work to eradicate hate and intolerance in our communities.\"\n\n“I oppose all forms of hatred and oppression and stand strong with communities that are marginalized and impacted every day,” Irving said. “I am aware of the negative impact of my post towards the Jewish community and I take responsibility.\"\n\nAmong some of what Nash had to deal with during his short tenure with the Nets: the failed attempt to turn Irving, Durant and James Harden into a Big Three; the failed attempt to turn Irving, Durant and Ben Simmons into a Big Three; Irving missing most of last season because he wasn’t vaccinated; Harden getting traded; Simmons arriving but not playing last season; Simmons playing this season but not scoring; a slew of other injuries; Durant wanting a trade this summer before backing off that request; and now, the latest Irving saga.\n\nFor now, that distraction is in the hands of Nets interim coach Jacque Vaughn, who became the eighth coach that Irving has played for — Ime Udoka could soon become the ninth. The Nets’ answer to this circus will, apparently, be to go hire Udoka from rival Boston after he went to the NBA Finals last season but was suspended this season for having an inappropriate relationship with a female Celtics employee.\n\nThe Nets must love drama. Maybe that’s why they wanted to part ways with Nash. Too boring and stable, perhaps.\n\n“Steve Nash is a good friend of mine, so more than anything, I feel for Steve,\" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. “I think he has all the qualities to be a brilliant coach. Brilliant. But it was a good reminder to me and I think to all coaches that we are all at the whim of players, front offices, ownership. You really need a solid situation in which to thrive as a coach in this league.\"\n\nIrving will be a free agent this summer. There's no way to predict how that will go.\n\nHe has incredible talent. He may be the best ballhandler in the game, probably one of the best to ever play. An absolutely elite player, an NBA champion, a perennial All-Star. His skill cannot be argued.\n\nYet it’s just impossible to imagine a team committing major money and many years to Irving ever again. Even if he apologizes for sharing the link to antisemitic content — Irving, for the record, insists he supports all people, all races, all religions — the damage may have really been done this time.\n\nHe may have fared better had he quickly followed Meyers Leonard’s example.\n\nLeonard was with the Miami Heat in March 2021 when, while streaming himself playing a video game, he used an antisemitic slur. Leonard insisted he didn’t understand the meaning of the word, apologized almost immediately, got fined $50,000, was admonished by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, was told by the Heat to not be around the team and got traded a few days later.\n\nLeonard might not get back to the NBA because of injuries. But he has partaken in multiple acts of contrition — volunteering with Jewish youth, meeting with representatives from the Anti-Defamation League, holding camps, speaking to groups, and he’s done it all with no intention of any of it publicly getting out. He didn’t want to look sorry. He wanted to show he was sorry.\n\nIrving didn’t quickly back down. He made a bad situation worse before Wednesday's announcement, made in conjunction with the Nets and the ADL. And now the Nets will start over with a new coach, plus with some members of the fan base so turned off by Irving that they wore “Fight Antisemitism” shirts to a game this week.\n\nIrving saw those fans. He spoke to them. One of those fans told the New York Post that the shirts weren’t for Irving, but rather for the Nets. They want them to act.\n\nA day later, Nash was gone. That probably wasn't the action they wanted.\n\nThis isn't what Durant signed on for, though the two-time champion in Golden State did ask for Nash to be fired during the offseason. Instead of being part of a title contender, Durant has been part of exactly one playoff series win in his Brooklyn tenure. At 34, he doesn’t have an unlimited number of title chances left. It will surprise no one if his trade request reappears later this season, or this summer.\n\nIt will also be no surprise when another controversy pops up in the next few weeks over something Irving said or tweeted.

I think Adam [Silver, the NBA commissioner] should have suspended him,” Barkley said on TNT Tuesday ahead of the Nets’ game against the Chicago Bulls, in which Irving featured.\n\n“First of all, Adam is Jewish. You can’t take my $40 million [Irving’s reported salary] and insult my religion.\n\n“You’re going to insult me, you have the right, but I have the right to say no. You’re not going to take my $40 million and insult my religion. I think the NBA, they have made a mistake.”\n\nIrving told reporters on Saturday that he is “not going to stand down on anything I believe in” after he was condemned by, among others, Nets owner Joe Tsai for tweeting a link to the 2018 movie “Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America.”\n\n“In terms of the backlash, we’re in 2022, history is not supposed to be hidden from anybody and I’m not a divisive person when it comes to religion, I embrace all walks of life,” Irving said.\n\nThe movie is based on Ronald Dalton’s book of the same name, which has been blasted as being antisemitic by civil rights groups.\n\n“The book and film he promotes trade in deeply #antisemitic themes including those promoted by dangerous sects of the Black Hebrew Israelites movement,” tweeted Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. (ADL)\n\nThe NBA released a statement calling hate speech “unacceptable” and “counter to the NBA’s values of equality, inclusion and respect.”\n\n“We believe we all have a role to play in ensuring such words or ideas, including antisemitic ones, are challenged and refuted and we will continue working with all members of the NBA community to ensure that everyone understands the impact of their words and actions,” the league’s statement added.\n\nThe Nets also said they “strongly condemn and have no tolerance for the promotion of any form of hate speech.”\n\nAsked why Irving hasn’t been disciplined for his tweet, Nets general manager Sean Marks told reporters: “I think we are having these discussions behind the scenes. I honestly don’t want to really get into those right now … Really just trying to weigh out exactly what the best course of action is here.”\n\nMarks added that the team is having discussions with the ADL. He would not say whether Irving was a part of those discussions with the ADL.\n\nLate Wednesday, the Nets organization, Irving and ADL released a joint statement saying that Irving and the Nets each will donate $500,000 “toward causes and organizations that work to eradicate hate and intolerance in our communities.”\n\nIrving said in the statement he is a human being “learning from all walks of life” and intends to keep learning with an open mind and willingness to listen. He wrote that he meant no harm to “any one group, race or religion of people, and wish to only be a beacon of truth and light.”\n\n“I oppose all forms of hatred and oppression and stand strong with communities that are marginalized and impacted every day,” Irving said in the released joint statement. “I am aware of the negative impact of my post towards the Jewish community and I take responsibility. I do not believe everything said in the documentary was true or reflects my morals and principles.”\n\nIn a tumultuous period for the organization, the Nets also announced on Tuesday that they had parted ways with head coach Steve Nash.\n\nThe announcement came before the Nets’ 108-99 loss against the Bulls to go 2-6 on the season, with Jacque Vaughn appointed as interim head coach.\n\nSteve Nash was appointed as the Nets head coach in 2020 Dustin Satloff/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nMarks denied that Nash’s firing had anything to do with the Kyrie Irving situation.\n\n“No. No. We try to separate the two things,” he said.\n\n“It’s a good question, and it’s easy to sort of lump it all in, but I think for where we’re at, we’re trying to separate the basketball side and what’s best for the team moving on.”\n\nESPN and The Athletic reported that Brooklyn may hire suspended Boston Celtics coach Ime Udoka, but Marks said that the team has yet to choose the next coach.\n\n“I really don’t think it’s up to me right now to give a list of candidates who we’re talking to and where we’re going to arise and we’re going to fall on this, but I would say I will reserve that for when those decisions are made,” he added.\n\n“I couldn’t give you a timeline of that,” continued Marks. “There’s a reason why we made this move when we did because time is ticking. We do want this process to be a thorough one. We’re not going to skip steps in that and we’ll do our due diligence like on anybody.”\n\nAgainst the Bulls, Irving started the night 0-for-7 from the field, including going 0-of-4 from three-point range, not scoring his first points until there was 10:20 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nHe finished with four points, seven assists and six rebounds, while Zach LaVine recorded 20 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter to help the Bulls to victory.", "authors": ["Cnn Sport Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/ua/2020/01/20/college-football-coaches-hot-seat-arizona-wildcats-kevin-sumlin/4523680002/", "title": "College football coaches on hot seat: Arizona Wildcats' Kevin Sumlin", "text": "The Arizona Wildcats' 2020 college football schedule doesn't kick off until Aug. 29, but that hasn't stopped some sites from speculating about the future of head coach Kevin Sumlin.\n\nSumlin, who is entering his third season at the helm of the football program in Tucson, is on the college football coaching hot seat, according to some sites.\n\nIn fact, his seat is among the hottest in football, if these sites are to be believed.\n\nHow secure is Sumlin's job with the Wildcats?

He could never quite replicate the success he had with Johnny Manziel during the end of his tenure at Texas A&M, but his teams were consistently decent in the brutal SEC West. Making the jump to Arizona, where he inherited quarterback Khalil Tate, who entered 2018 with serious Heisman buzz, made all the sense in the world. Things just haven’t worked for the former A&M and Houston head coach. Tate’s passing numbers dipped from where they were under Rich Rodriguez in 2017, when he took over as starter mid-season, and his Lamar Jackson-esque rushing numbers absolutely cratered. He went from one of the most exciting players in college football to an average quarterback. The defense was even worse, ranking 109th in the country per SP+ this year. Giving Sumlin a third year is very fair, but he needs to take a big step forward in 2020, or this experiment should be over.\"\n\nLate last season, CBS Sports' Dennis Dodd wrote that the pressure to win for Sumlin was heating up.\n\nHe wrote: \"Things have cratered in Year 2 under Sumlin. The Wildcats actually lost to Oregon State last week. More than that, they gave up 56 points. That's the most allowed in a series that goes back more than half a century. Arizona doesn't seem to do anything well right now. Sumlin fired defensive coordinator Marcel Yates.

Tom Harkin — an old political friend retiring after 40 years of service — and the Democrats on the Iowa ballot this November.\n\nBetween the scripted lines, though, Clinton's first visit to Iowa since losing the 2008 caucuses could be rich with signals for 2016 and a second run at the presidency. That's what is attracting a national and international press corps of 150 or more to a balloon field in Iowa, the leadoff state in presidential voting.\n\n\"This trip is an opportunity to congratulate and thank a good friend in Tom Harkin, but also give a little inkling about what her decision might be after the first of the year,\" said Jeff Link, a Des Moines-based Democratic strategist.\n\nThe questions of how to acknowledge the widespread expectations of a presidential bid and when to make a formal declaration are fraught with risk for Clinton. She entered the 2008 race as the perceived inevitable candidate, only to see challenger Barack Obama rocket past her to seize the nomination.\n\nThis time around, she's got to put off an announcement until at least after November, lest she overshadow critical races on the midterm ballot, Iowa politicos say. And she probably wants to delay a decision even longer than that. As soon as she's officially in, she becomes the No. 1 target for not only Republicans, but also any Democrats looking to be the next Obama.\n\nWith those tricky calculations in mind, here's what observers close to Clinton and tuned in to Iowa politics say she'll be looking to accomplish in Indianola, Iowa.\n\nSend presidential signal\n\nNo matter what the purported purpose, a visit to Iowa by Hillary Clinton can be interpreted only one way: as a signal of her presidential intentions.\n\nClinton knows this, of course, and presumably wouldn't even open the door on that discussion unless it fit into a wider strategy for her slow-motion march to announcing a candidacy. If she wasn't planning a candidacy, or didn't want to encourage the chatter, the thinking goes, why would she come?\n\nHitching her Iowa comeback to Harkin's farewell steak fry, though, provides helpful cover. It gives her, in the words of Republican Party of Iowa Chairman Jeff Kaufmann, \"deniability that she's here running for president.\"\n\n\"Any of these folks coming back at this time are exploring that possibility,\" said Kaufmann. \"This gives her a safe entrance back into Iowa to reintroduce herself and check her viability within the Democratic Party.\"\n\nSolve the 'Iowa problem'\n\nAfter years of media hand-wringing over her standing in Iowa, Clinton may be looking for a raucous reception to retire the notion that she is unpopular or unelectable in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. She hasn't set foot here since finishing a disappointing third place in 2008.\n\n\"Whether it's right or wrong, there is a perception at least among the beltway crowd that she's got an Iowa problem,\" said Norm Sterzenbach, a Democratic consultant and former state party official. \"It's important for her to show the rest of the country that that's just not true.\"\n\nAiding her in that effort will be the independent group Ready for Hillary, which is planning a massive show of pro-Clinton force. The group will bus in college students, wallpaper the steak fry site with signs and slap a \"Ready for Hillary\" sticker on every jacket lapel that passes through the gates.\n\n\"What we're going to express is that Hillary's supporters can really show a united front, an organized front,\" said group spokeswoman Tracy Sefl. \"And I think for her first time back in the state, that's no small thing.\"\n\nRally Democrats in 2014\n\nDemocratic campaigns and party officials in the thick of competitive races for the U.S. Senate, House and other offices this year said the joint appearance by Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, will have tangible effects on efforts to energize volunteers and turn out voters this fall.\n\n\"We'll have thousands of Iowa Democrats who come, get to hear some great speakers, break bread together and then go back to their communities and do the hard work of the last 50-some days of the election,\" said Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Scott Brennan.\n\nDemocrats hope the Clintons' visit will make a real difference in the closely contested race to succeed Harkin in the Senate. Democrat Bruce Braley is running neck and neck with Republican Joni Ernst, and the result could decide which party controls the Senate next year.\n\nDemocrats also say the energy boost activists get from the Clintons will help turnout in competitive congressional races in Iowa.\n\nAn injection in enthusiasm for the midterm elections, in turn, could benefit Hillary Clinton in the months to come.\n\n\"They will create enthusiasm among the rank and file that really no one else could do,\" Des Moines attorney and longtime Clinton adviser Jerry Crawford said. \"And anything that she and they can do to create a stronger year this year will be remembered in 2016.\"\n\nHonor Tom Harkin\n\nFor all the calculations and ancillary benefits, though, numerous observers said the visit by the Clintons truly is about honoring the career and legacy of Harkin.\n\nThe Clintons' relationship with Harkin goes all the way back to the 1970s, when Harkin was a congressman and Bill Clinton was the governor of Arkansas. In 1992, Harkin challenged Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination, but ended up endorsing him. (A video of them sharing a stage at the 1992 steak fry shows Clinton offering his famous thumbs up while Harkin lobs verbal bombs at GOP opponent George H.W. Bush.) And Harkin and Hillary Clinton served together for eight years in the Senate.\n\nTeresa Vilmain, a longtime player in Iowa politics and the state director of Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, said she talked to the Clintons just a few days ago.\n\n\"They're clear about what their mission is,\" Vilmain said of the Clintons. \"They're very clear: thanking Tom, thanking Ruth (his wife), and helping candidates up and down the ticket in this year's elections.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/09/14"}]}

Other social platforms followed in banning or suspending Trump’s account.\n\nTrump, for his part, has said he would not return to Twitter even if his account were restored, instead promoting his own social media venture, Truth Social, which has so far appeared to struggle to get off the ground.\n\n“Banning Trump from Twitter didn’t end Trump’s voice, it will amplify it among the right and this is why it’s morally wrong and flat out stupid,” Musk said at the event on Tuesday.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO acknowledged that his acquisition of Twitter, and Trump’s return, are not yet a done deal. “I will say that I don’t own Twitter yet, so this is not a thing that will definitely happen, because what if I don’t own Twitter?” he said.\n\nThere remain some questions about whether Musk will indeed go through with the deal, or whether the decline in Tesla (TSLA) shares over the past month could negatively impact his ability to finance the deal. Twitter (TWTR) stock was trading around $47.70 on Tuesday afternoon, well below Musk’s offer price of $54.20 per share, suggesting some investor skepticism about the likelihood that the deal gets completed.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped Musk from continuing to expound on his plans for the platform in recent weeks. Musk has said his goal is to bolster free speech on the platform and to make it clearer to users when the platform takes actions that impact what people see on Twitter.\n\nOn Tuesday, he reiterated his desire to rid Twitter of bots promoting spam or scams, and his plan to make Twitter’s algorithm publicly available for anyone to view and comment on.\n\n“I would literally put the Twitter algorithm on GitHub and say like, ‘Hey, anyone want to suggest changes to this? Please go ahead,’” Musk said, adding that he sees such a move as a way to “build transparency and trust.”\n\nHe also criticized what he views as Twitter’s political bias, echoing claims from some prominent figures on the right.\n\n“I think Twitter needs to be much more evenhanded. It currently has a strong left bias because it’s based in San Francisco,” he said. “I don’t think the people there necessarily intend, or at least some of them don’t intend, to have a left bias. They just, from their perspective, it seems moderate, but they’re just coming after it from an environment that is very far left.”\n\n(Twitter has previously said its algorithms and employees do not discriminate against any particular political point of view.)\n\nIn addition to reversing the Trump ban, Musk said he would make permanent bans “extremely rare,” reserving them for “bots or spam, scam accounts where there’s just no legitimacy to the account at all.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Does kicking bad actors off social media platforms work? 04:29 - Source: CNN Business\n\nMusk also expanded on his vision for Twitter’s content moderation. Previously, Musk has said he intends for Twitter to limit its content moderation to that which governments have deemed explicitly illegal — and not to go much further.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Musk conceded that there could be a wide range of objectionable content that he would want Twitter to enforce against. In addition to illegal content, Musk identified two other categories of content that could be subject to penalties: speech that is “destructive to the world” and “wrong and bad.”\n\n“If they say something that is illegal or otherwise just destructive to the world, then there should be perhaps a timeout, a temporary suspension, or that particular tweet should be made invisible or have very limited traction,” Musk said. He added: “I think if there are tweets that are wrong and bad, those should be either deleted or made invisible, and a suspension, a temporary suspension is appropriate but not a permanent ban.”\n\nMusk didn’t say what metrics Twitter might use to determine if a tweet may be “wrong and bad” or “destructive to the world,” and when it might opt for one type of penalty over another.", "authors": ["Brian Fung Clare Duffy", "Brian Fung", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/tech/elon-musk-twitter-changes/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk now owns Twitter. Here's what he could change | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAfter spending months attempting to get out of his deal to buy Twitter, Elon Musk officially owns the hugely influential platform. Now the question is: What will he actually do with it?\n\nMusk’s takeover — which was finalized Thursday night, a source familiar with the matter told CNN — not only has the potential to create upheaval for Twitter (TWTR) employees but also for the hundreds of millions of people around the world who use the platform daily. It could also impact the upcoming US midterm elections, if Musk makes good on his promise to restore the accounts of users who were previously banned from the platform, most notably former US President Donald Trump, and limit the company’s content restrictions.\n\nIn the first weeks after agreeing to buy the company in April, and before his initial move to bail on the deal, Musk repeatedly stressed that his goal was to bolster “free speech” on the platform and work to “unlock” Twitter’s “extraordinary potential.” The Tesla CEO suggested he would rethink Twitter’s approach to content moderation and permanent bans, with potential impacts on civil discourse and the political landscape. He also talked about his desire to rid the platform of bots, even as he later made the number of bots central to his argument to abandon the deal.\n\nDuring Tesla (TSLA)’s earnings call last week, Musk acknowledged that although finalizing the $44 billion deal meant “overpaying” for the social media firm, “the long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value.” He added that he believes Twitter has “languished for a long time, but has an incredible potential.”\n\nMusk’s plans for boosting Twitter’s value could involve cutting down its workforce, something he’s hinted at before. Previous reporting suggested that he’d planned to cut 75% of staff, although he is said to have told Twitter staff this week that’s not the case. Either way, anxieties are running high. Musk immediately fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde.\n\nIn private and public statements over the past six months, Musk has tossed out a wide range of other possible changes for the platform, from enabling end-to-end encryption for Twitter’s direct messaging feature to suggesting this week that Twitter become part of an “everything” app called X, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nThere have been more far-fetched suggestions, too. In one text exchange with his brother Kimbal Musk, revealed last week in court documents, the two appeared to discuss the possibility of asking users to pay for each tweet they post with small amounts of the cryptocurrency DogeCoin.\n\nNow that Musk has completed the deal, some of those theoretical changes could soon become reality. Here’s what users should know:\n\nA big shift for content moderation\n\nFor years under former CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey, Twitter emphasized its work to bolster “healthy conversations.” The company banned many accounts promoting abuse and spam, added labels for false or misleading information, and banned the misgendering of transgender people.\n\nUnder Musk’s ownership, Twitter could unwind steps taken to make the platform more palatable for its most vulnerable users, typically women, members of the LGBTQ community and people of color, according to safety experts.\n\nMusk has said Twitter, under his leadership, would have more lenient content moderation policies. “If in doubt, let the speech exist,” Musk said in one on-stage interview in April. “If it’s a gray area, I would say, let the tweet exist. But obviously in the case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, you would not necessarily want to promote that tweet.”\n\nMusk on Thursday sought to reassure advertisers that he doesn’t plan to turn the platform into a “free-for-all hellscape” despite his promises to reduce content moderation. The remarks follow questions about whether advertisers might leave the platform for fear of their paid posts ending up alongside potentially objectionable content.\n\n“In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all, where you can choose your desired experience according to your preferences,” he said in an open letter posted to Twitter. Allowing all legal speech may not be so straight forward — content rules vary across the world and, in Europe, the new Digital Services Act imposes high moderation standards.\n\nMusk has also said he wants to make Twitter’s algorithm open source and make it more transparent to users when, for example, a tweet has been emphasized or demoted in their feed. (Leaders at Twitter have previously expressed support for moving in that direction, and the company often makes clear when it is demoting certain tweets or types of content.)\n\nUnbanning Trump and other accounts\n\nBut the most striking early change could come from who is and is not allowed on a Musk-owned Twitter.\n\nMusk has said he thinks Twitter should be more “reluctant to delete things” and “very cautious with permanent bans.” That could mean a long list of controversial far right figures and conspiracy theorists, among others, soon find their way back on the platform.\n\nMusk, for his part, has focused on bringing back one of Twitter’s most prominent former users: Trump.\n\n“I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump, I think that was a mistake,” Musk said in May. “I would reverse the perma-ban. … But my opinion, and Jack Dorsey, I want to be clear, shares this opinion, is that we should not have perma-bans.”\n\nDorsey tweeted following Musk’s May remarks that he does “agree” there shouldn’t be permanent bans on Twitter users. “There are exceptions … but generally permanent bans are a failure of ours and don’t work,” he said.\n\nTrump has said he does not want to rejoin Twitter and will instead remain on his own social media platform, Truth Social.\n\nBut if Trump were to accept a Musk offer to return to Twitter, it could restore a significant following he hasn’t had since being banned from the platform in January 2021, just as the 2024 US Presidential race ramps up. On Truth Social, Trump has only 4 million followers; on Twitter, he reached an audience of more than 88 million followers.\n\nAn owner with an erratic and controversial history on the platform\n\nAnother notable change is simply who may be making these sensitive decisions.\n\nMusk has a mixed reputation in the tech industry. He is undoubtedly one of the most ambitious and successful innovators and entrepreneurs of this era. But he has also courted controversy, often from his own Twitter profile, where he has more than 100 million followers.\n\nOver the years, Musk has used Twitter to make misleading claims about the Covid-19 pandemic, to make a baseless accusation that a man who helped rescue children from a cave in Thailand was a sexual predator, to mock people who display their gender pronouns on the platform, and to make countless jokes involving the numbers 420 and 69. He has also tweeted a (since deleted) photo comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler and has compared the now-ousted Agrawal to Joseph Stalin.\n\nMusk also previously sought to remove a Twitter account dedicated to tracking the movements of his private jet by offering to pay off the college freshman running the account (the account owner declined).\n\nThe same day he sent his letter to Twitter attempting to revive the deal, Musk was widely panned for comments he made on the platform about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He suggested making Crimea, a region Russia invaded and annexed from Ukraine in 2014, “formally part of Russia.” Most followers responded “no” to his poll and Ukraine’s Ambassador to Germany Andrij Melnyk replied in a tweet: “F— off is my very diplomatic reply to you.” In a followup tweet, an apparently frustrated Musk seemed to blame the results of his poll on a “bot attack.”\n\nUntil now, Twitter has, at least to some extent, been accountable for its policy decisions to advertisers, shareholders and its board. But those guardrails won’t necessarily exist under Musk’s leadership.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/13/tech/twitter-deal-on-hold-elon-musk/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk says his deal to buy Twitter is on hold | CNN Business", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nElon Musk said he is putting his bid to acquire Twitter (TWTR) on hold, weeks after agreeing to take the company private in a $44 billion deal.\n\n“Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,” Musk tweeted on Friday.\n\nThe news initially sent Twitter shares down more than 20% in pre-market trading before the stock rebounded somewhat. Two hours after his first tweet, Musk posted that he is “still committed to acquisition.”\n\nIn his tweet about putting the deal on hold, Musk linked to a May 2 Reuters report about Twitter’s most recent disclosure about its spam and fake account problem.\n\nIn its quarterly financial report, released on April 28, Twitter estimated that fake or spam accounts made up fewer than 5% of the platform’s active users during the first three months of the year. Twitter noted that the estimates were based on a review of sample accounts and it believed the numbers to be “reasonable.”\n\nBut it acknowledged that the measurements were not independently verified and the actual number of fake or spam accounts could be higher.\n\nTwitter has had a spam problem for years, and the company has previously acknowledged that reducing fake and malicious accounts would play a key factor in its ability to keep growing. It’s unclear why Musk would back away from the deal because of the latest disclosure.\n\nA ‘circus’\n\nMusk turned “this Twitter circus show into a Friday the 13th horror show,” wrote tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities in a note to clients early Friday.\n\nMusk would owe Twitter a $1 billion breakup fee if he were to cancel the deal.\n\n“The Street will view this deal as 1) likely falling apart, 2) Musk negotiating for a lower deal price, or 3) Musk simply walking away from the deal with a $1 billion breakup fee,” Ives wrote. “Many will view this as Musk using this Twitter filing/spam accounts as a way to get out of this deal in a vastly changing market.”\n\nStocks — tech in particular — have been sharply lower since Musk and Twitter reached a deal on a purchase of the the company nearly three weeks ago.\n\nFlouting convention\n\nThe manner in which Musk announced the deal’s pause — in a tweet -— was also unusual, at least by normal corporate merger and acquisition standards.\n\nAcquirers of a company typically conduct due diligence, a review of the firm’s finances and proprietary information, before a deal closes. In that process, they may come across information that causes them to rethink the deal or its valuation, but typically such a revelation would be disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n“Usually we’d see some sort of filing that would come first, an amendment to previous filings on the deal, that says, ‘we’ve uncovered some information in the process of due diligence and we’re reconsidering our acquisition,’” said Josh White, an assistant professor of finance at Vanderbilt University and a former financial economist for the SEC.\n\n“This happens as you get access to the books and access to proprietary information. What doesn’t normally happen is a tweet,” White said.\n\nThe unusual move may not be significant enough to warrant SEC action, White said, but it could draw the attention of Twitter’s lawyers. As part of the deal, Musk agreed to consult with Twitter before making any public statements about the deal, and to avoid making any tweets that “disparage the company,” according to filings with the SEC. Still, Twitter’s board will likely prefer the deal to go through because of its strong valuation compared to the company’s current stock price.\n\nBut if the deal falls apart, “I would expect Twitter’s current shareholders to potentially bring a lawsuit” saying Musk’s actions had damaged them by tanking the stock price, White added.\n\nTwitter did not return a request for comment on Musk’s Friday tweets.\n\nSkepticism from the start\n\nEven as Musk has worked to secure financing for the takeover, skepticism about whether the deal would go through has been swirling since Twitter’s board agreed to the offer on April 26.\n\nMusk said he would buy Twitter for $54.20 a share. But Twitter’s stock never approached that price, hovering below $50 for weeks. That was a sign investors were skeptical that Musk would ultimately make good on his offer.\n\nWall Street analysts weren’t convinced of Musk’s ability to buy Twitter, either — at least not at $54.20 a share. The consensus target price was below $52, and the vast majority put a “hold” rating on the company’s stock.\n\nPart of the problem has been Twitter’s connection to Tesla’s (TSLA) fate. Musk, Tesla’s (TSLA) CEO, was planning to borrow against part of his Tesla stake to finance the deal, but Tesla’s (TSLA) stock has been sinking fast alongside most other stocks this year.\n\nMusk’s sale of a significant number of Tesla shares to help finance his Twitter deal had also put pressure on the carmaker’s stock. Having already committed a big chunk of his Tesla shares elsewhere, he wasn’t left with much of a cushion should he need to pony up more funds to complete the Twitter takeover.\n\nIves said the news about the Twitter deal was good for Tesla (TSLA) shares, which roared 6% higher in premarket trading Friday. Shares of Tesla (TSLA), the world’s most valuable automaker, have lost about a third of their value since Musk disclosed he had taken a stake in Twitter.\n\nIn addition to selling $8.5 billion of his Tesla shares last month, or about 6% of his holdings, Musk was using his shares of Tesla as part of the collateral he needed to raise cash for the Twitter purchase. But the drop in the value of Tesla shares had raised doubts if he would be able to move forward with the financing of the Twitter deal.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has also reported that the SEC and the Federal Trade Commission were both looking Musk’s purchases of Twitter earlier this year and whether he properly disclosed them.\n\nMusk’s plans for Twitter\n\nMusk had offered few details about his plans for the social media company, though he has often spoken out about bot accounts that promoted spam content. He also says the company has been too quick to remove accounts that violate its content-moderation rules.\n\nOn Tuesday, Musk made headlines by saying he would allow former President Donald Trump to return to Twitter once the takeover was complete. Trump’s account was permanently removed after his followers’ attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nEarlier this week Twitter confirmed that it is pausing most hiring and backfills, except for “business critical” roles, and pulling back on other non-labor costs. It also confirmed that two top executives, general manager of consumer Kayvon Beykpour, and revenue product lead Bruce Falck, were leaving the company.\n\nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal sent a series of tweets Friday afternoon acknowledging the leadership shakeup at the company the previous day.\n\n“Some have been asking why a ‘lame-duck’ CEO would make these changes if we’re getting acquired anyway,” Agrawal said. “While I expect the deal to close, we need to be prepared for all scenarios and always do what’s right for Twitter. I’m accountable for leading and operating Twitter, and our job is to build a stronger Twitter every day.”\n\n-— CNN Business’ Clare Duffy and Allison Morrow contributed to this article.", "authors": ["David Goldman Chris Isidore Clare Duffy", "David Goldman", "Chris Isidore", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/07/tech/elon-musk-twitter-global-free-speech/index.html", "title": "How Elon Musk could impact Twitter's battles over speech abroad ...", "text": "San Francisco CNN Business —\n\nSince Elon Musk announced he was buying Twitter last month, the billionaire has sent out tweet after tweet outlining his plans for the platform, touching on everything from new features to security updates to monetization. But Musk’s overarching reason for committing billions of dollars to buy Twitter is to ensure the platform bolsters free speech.\n\n“By ‘free speech,’ I simply mean that which matches the law,” he said in one of his many recent tweets on the subject. “I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law. If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.” Musk has also said he thinks Twitter should be more “reluctant to delete things” and “very cautious with permanent bans.”\n\nMusk’s rhetoric has already raised some concerns in Twitter’s home market about how it would impact the platform’s approach to handling harassment, misinformation and content moderation broadly. But Musk’s posture could also create new uncertainties for Twitter’s platform if applied to markets abroad, which account for the vast majority of Twitter’s user base. That’s because definitions of free speech, and the laws governing it, often look very different around the world than they do in the United States.\n\nIn some markets, like the European Union, Twitter and its peers are facing growing regulatory pressure to bolster content moderation against hate speech and misinformation. In other markets, Twitter has faced pressure to restrict speech that is critical of local governments. Whatever Musk’s personal views on content enforcement may be, Twitter risks substantial fines and other penalties for not complying with local laws in various countries. In some cases, Twitter has even been banned or threatened with bans.\n\nSome digital rights advocates say they are unsure how much thought Musk has given to the complex regulatory environment Twitter faces abroad and how much a Twitter owned by Musk would be willing to push back against government pressure in other countries, as it has done in some countries recently.\n\n“I am not sure how much Musk is concerned about the Twittersphere outside the US,” Yaman Akdeniz, a professor of law at Istanbul Bilgi University and founder of the UK-based organization Cyber-Rights & Cyber-Liberties, told CNN Business. Turkey is one of several countries that has banned Twitter in the past, briefly blocking the platform in 2014 over anti-government rhetoric.\n\n“I believe Musk’s Twitter will simply not care about such a ban to the effect that they will challenge [or] resist such an attempt,” he said.\n\nDavid Kaye, a professor of law at the University of California, Irvine and former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, said the “concern” is that Musk “talks about free speech in this very simplistic way.”\n\nIt “suggests that all he cares about, really, is the individual speaker and their ability to post as opposed to… the desire to maximize the possibility that everybody has a voice on it,” said Kaye, who also authored the book ‘Speech Police: The Global Struggle to Govern the Internet.’\n\n“I also don’t get the sense that he’s thought through the global part of the platform,” Kaye added.\n\nMusk and Twitter did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nTwitter’s free speech battles with foreign governments\n\nIn recent years, Twitter has fought a number of free speech battles against governments in some of the company’s biggest markets, often leading the charge among social media companies in protecting its users’ rights.\n\nIn India, whose online population of around 830 million is bigger than any country except China, Twitter last year clashed with the government over demands to take down accounts related to protests by the country’s farmers. Twitter complied with some of the requests but refused to take action against accounts of journalists, activists or politicians.\n\nThe Indian government said at the time that Twitter was “welcome to do business in India” but must respect local laws. “In India, we value freedom and we value criticism because it is part of our democracy,” the government added. “But freedom of expression is not absolute and it is subject to reasonable restrictions.”\n\nMonths later, Twitter was banned in Nigeria after it deleted a tweet by the country’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, that was widely perceived as offensive and threatening to some of its citizens. The ban was lifted earlier this year after Twitter agreed to meet all conditions set by the Nigerian government, according to a government statement, which included “managing prohibited publication in line with Nigerian law.”\n\nTwitter must also grapple with repressive regimes around the world such as Russia, Myanmar and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.\n\n“Twitter has, over the years, refused to comply with unjust laws, laws that are not in line with international human rights standards,” said Jillian York, Director of International Freedom of Expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “I am definitely concerned that [Musk] lacks the understanding of international human rights issues, and the ways in which state actors around the world have both placed demands for censorship on these platforms and have used them for the purposes of harm.”\n\nMusk’s other businesses\n\nIf his latest deal goes through, Twitter will become just one more piece of Musk’s growing empire of businesses — including Tesla, SpaceX and the Boring Company — some of which depend on government relationships in the United States and abroad. That, too, could complicate Twitter’s approach to handling certain content battles.\n\nElectric carmaker Tesla (TSLA), in particular, could potentially lead to conflicts overseas, including one large country where Twitter doesn’t even operate: China. Not only is China the world’s biggest car market, but its financial capital Shanghai is also home to one of Tesla (TSLA)’s biggest manufacturing plants. Twitter, notably, has been banned in China for years, though that hasn’t stopped its government officials and prominent citizens from actively using the platform or complaining when their accounts are restricted or labeled in certain ways.\n\nSome people — including Musk’s fellow billionaire and sometimes rival, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos — have publicly questioned whether Musk’s ownership of Twitter could give China some leverage over the platform due to Tesla’s need to keep operating there.\n\nKaye says it may be hard to predict how governments might pressure Musk, or how Musk might respond. “But given the fact that he’s got these major economic interests in Tesla and SpaceX and those interests also have real sort of government relationship ramifications, you could really imagine governments saying to him: ‘We’ll give you this on Tesla… if you basically deal with the platform in this way.”\n\nSeparately, a leading official in Europe, which has been particularly proactive about regulating Big Tech platforms in recent years, alluded to the fact that Musk’s experience running Tesla and complying with regulators abroad suggests he should know he will have to do the same with Twitter. (Many European countries also have strict laws against hate speech).\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules – regardless of their shareholding,” Thierry Breton, a European Union commissioner and a leading digital regulator, said in a tweet.\n\n“Mr. Musk knows this well. He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act,” Breton added, referencing a new law passed by Europe recently that imposes new rules on how the tech industry handles misinformation and illegal content on social media.\n\nEven Bezos, after questioning China’s possible new leverage over Twitter and Tesla, acknowledged that “Musk is extremely good at navigating this kind of complexity.”", "authors": ["Rishi Iyengar"], "publish_date": "2022/05/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/30/tech/twitter-dms-encrypted-elon-musk/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk wants end-to-end encryption for Twitter DMs. It may not ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nJust two days after he announced he would buy Twitter, Elon Musk sent out a deluge of tweets about his plans for the social media platform. One stood out for its broad appeal.\n\n“Twitter DMs should have end to end encryption like Signal, so no one can spy on or hack your messages,” he wrote.\n\nWith that statement, Musk waded into a long-running debate among technologists and privacy advocates around the level of encryption apps and platforms should provide to their users. Growing concerns about privacy have led to questions about how much user data tech companies collect, and many platforms — including the Signal messaging app Musk referred to — have begun to tout end-to-end encryption as a key feature.\n\nThat capability means communications can only be seen by the senders and recipients, without the platform being able to access them. While some apps, such as Signal and WhatsApp, have end-to-end encryption by default, others including Telegram, Instagram and Facebook Messenger allow users to opt into encrypted messaging.\n\nVideoconferencing platform Zoom quickly introduced end-to-end encryption in 2020, soon after the pandemic caused a surge in users, putting a spotlight on its security practices.\n\nMeta, which owns WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger, has said it plans to roll out default end-to-end encryption for all its apps globally by 2023.\n\nTwitter, on the other hand, has not yet outlined a plan to offer end-to-end encryption for its direct messages, despite calls from industry experts and advocates for years. Those calls intensified in mid-2020, after a massive hack of the platform that compromised the accounts of several prominent individuals, including former US President Barack Obama and Musk himself. (End-to-end encryption may not have prevented that attack, since hackers directly accessed the accounts, but experts say it would reduce the scope of the information attackers could target in the future.)\n\nTwitter did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n“It would be a significant move in favor of user privacy if Twitter were to turn on [end-to-end encryption] for DMs, as it would keep the company from reading its users’ conversations or disclosing them to anyone else,” Riana Pfefferkorn, a research scholar at the Stanford Internet Observatory whose work focuses on encryption, told CNN Business. “For the company to tie its own hands in this way would prevent a bad actor within the company from abusing the access they have as an employee to user data.”\n\nIn November 2019, the Justice Department accused two former Twitter employees of spying on users on behalf of Saudi Arabia when they were at the company.\n\nAnd the fact that the influential platform will now be under new ownership is raising fresh questions about what data it has access to.\n\nHours after Musk announced he would take over Twitter, Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden — a longtime advocate for digital privacy — issued another warning.\n\n“If the US had a privacy law with teeth, or if Twitter encrypted DMs like I urged years ago, Americans wouldn’t be left wondering what today’s sale means for their private information,” he tweeted. “The protection of Americans’ privacy must be a condition of any sale.”\n\nTwitter’s relatively smaller size — its global user base is a fraction of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — and the fact that it is not seen primarily as a messaging platform, may have allowed it to fly slightly under the radar, according to Bruce Schneier, a security technologist and fellow at Harvard University’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society.\n\n“Twitter is used less for that kind of direct conversation than Signal, SMS, WhatsApp and Telegram,” he said. “It’s more semi-public.”\n\nAlso, Twitter’s architecture — a single platform that includes public tweets and DMs, and is accessed on its website as well as mobile apps across multiple operating systems — could make full encryption more complicated than mobile-first messaging platforms such as Signal, according to Deirdre Connolly, a cryptographic engineer.\n\n“No web service has slapped end-to-end encrypted messaging onto it — after its initial deployment — successfully,” Connolly said, adding that most apps offering it have either started from a mobile platform and expanded, or “have designed their web and mobile apps for [end-to-end encrypted] messaging from the get-go.”\n\n“Building a secure web application that runs in a modern, patched web browser is a fundamentally different and more difficult task than doing the same on desktop or especially mobile,” she said. “They haven’t done it yet because it’s hard. Really hard.”\n\nBut experts say giving Twitter DMs end-to-end encryption by default is an important and worthy goal. Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder and former CEO, has hinted in the past that he would be open to adding the capability (Wyden also cited Dorsey as saying in 2018 that Twitter was working on it), but the company hasn’t made any commitments.\n\nTwitter and other companies often have policies and controls in place to prevent unauthorized access to private messages. But encrypting those messages “goes beyond policy or access controls by making access impossible in the first place [and] would also limit what information a malicious outsider could obtain about a particular user, whether that’s a hacker or someone posing as law enforcement,” said Pfefferkorn.\n\nOne caveat, she added, is that fully encrypting DMs could make it harder to crack down on malicious content and cooperate with law enforcement on investigations, issues that companies such as WhatsApp and Apple have dealt with in the past. But those companies have repeatedly cited a need to protect their users.\n\n“In total, [end-to-end encryption] for DMs would be a net gain for user privacy and security,” Pfefferkorn said.", "authors": ["Rishi Iyengar"], "publish_date": "2022/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/05/us/twitter-elon-musk-race-deconstructed-newsletter/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Elon Musk's possible takeover of Twitter is unsettling for ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nA version of this story appeared in CNN’s Race Deconstructed newsletter. To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here.\n\nIf the racial discrimination lawsuit against Tesla is any indication, then it makes sense that the news about Elon Musk’s possible takeover of Twitter has unsettled many of the social media platform’s Black users.\n\nWhile the site has become increasingly venomous over the years, it has also allowed Black users to deepen kinship bonds and elevate movements. Now, that community-building might be in jeopardy.\n\n“There’s an innate sense of dread,” Meredith Clark, an associate professor at the School of Journalism and the Department of Communication Studies at Northeastern University, told CNN. “And I think that it comes not just from the announcement that Musk might buy Twitter.”\n\nClark explained that, for many Black Americans, the past decade has been rife with social and political turbulence.\n\nThere was the 2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, the 2016 election that installed in the White House a man who struggled to condemn White supremacy and the 2020 contest during which plenty of Republican Party leaders suggested that Black votes shouldn’t count, on top of so much else.\n\n“The only reason that (the Musk announcement) is sort of on the same wave as those other events is that this is a person who has made a number of statements that are concerning to Black people,” Clark said. “He’s a son of apartheid. He’s in the middle of a discrimination lawsuit brought by Black employees at his Tesla plants.”\n\nClark minced no words, “You have to be concerned about what it means not only for another billionaire to be playing with money in a way that affects something that represents connection and that you enjoy but for this billionaire, with a specific history, to be the person behind that intended purchase.”\n\nCreating connections\n\nTo understand what might be at stake, let’s pause for a moment to explore the communal dimension of Twitter that Clark nodded to.\n\nIn the early 2010s, when Twitter, which launched in 2006, was still relatively fresh, the site had a dramatically different atmosphere. People were more likely to tweet about fairly mundane things: school gossip, lunch, Shonda Rhimes’ hit TV series “Scandal.” Twitter was a place where ordinary people could talk about ordinary things.\n\nIt was also a place where ordinary people could do extraordinary things, such as fuel grassroots movements.\n\n“When you think about the folks who were helping to trend hashtags like #TrayvonMartin or #BlackLivesMatter, while there were sometimes activists involved and eventually celebrities, very often the folks who initiated those hashtags and helped to trend them were ordinary people who cared deeply about these issues and had experiences that they collectively felt needed to be heard,” explained Sarah J. Jackson, a presidential associate professor at the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania and the co-author of “#HashtagActivism: Networks of Race and Gender Justice.” “And because of the infrastructure of Twitter, the platform wasn’t limited to people you knew.”\n\nConsider Khary Penebaker. Thanks to Twitter, the Wisconsin Democratic National Committee member was able to expand his gun control advocacy nearly a decade ago.\n\n“I would’ve never been able to get my message out as broadly as I did without Twitter,” Penebaker told CNN. “I’ve become really good friends with Cory Booker, and that was a byproduct of my being able to reach him via Twitter and have him listen to my story. When he ran for president (in 2020), he included a policy plank in his platform that was specific to my story about how my mom shot and killed herself with a gun.”\n\nIt’s worth emphasizing that, in some ways, the above describes Black Twitter; as my CNN colleague Lisa France put it in 2015, Black Twitter is “a group of individuals who come together to have conversations about everything from culture to race and identity.”\n\nOr think of it like this: Much of the allure of Twitter in its younger years was that it allowed people, especially Black Americans and the members of other marginalized groups who didn’t have the megaphone of a big media platform, to forge connections – to take up space.\n\nBut over the years, the platform has gotten worse, particularly for those for whom it had long been a more obvious good.\n\n“Something we were hyper-aware of as we were writing ‘#HashtagActivism’ was that the Twitter we started studying in 2014 – with every passing moment, it was a different Twitter,” Jackson said. “The more people joined – the more mainstream media journalists and politicians and companies took up Twitter – the more it changed.”\n\nIn time, bots and trolls and bad actors inundated the site.\n\n“You could no longer assume that if someone replied to your tweet, they really wanted to engage in a conversation or debate with you,” Jackson said.\n\nChaos agent\n\nIt’s the ever-deteriorating state of Twitter that makes the news about Musk, one of the most influential agitators on the site, troubling to many Black users, who are unnerved by how Musk seems to conflate “free speech” with “sympathy for bigotry against marginalized groups.”\n\nFor some, the announcement was enough to make them quit Twitter altogether.\n\n“The moment I heard about the offer, I was like, ‘I’m out.’ It was the easiest social media decision I’ve made, ever,” the writer Ijeoma Oluo told CNN. “I don’t want to be a part of a platform that would even accept something like this.”\n\nOluo laid out that what makes Musk so upsetting to her is his behavior on Twitter.\n\n“It’s not just the way he responds to challenges or perceived insults. It’s also the way he requires a foil, someone to fight with,” she said. “I felt like I was becoming one of those people whose relevance to Twitter was as a target. And I didn’t want to be a part of why some people go to Twitter – to harass Black people and trans people and other marginalized people, especially when we try to flex the power we have to keep it safe.”\n\n“That collective power is something that terrifies many White men, particularly White men who think that tech is theirs,” Oluo continued. “And I really wish that people cared even half as much about the ways that so many voices have been pushed out of online spaces as they do about one billionaire’s desire to throw a fit on the internet.”\n\nJackson echoed some of Oluo’s sentiments.\n\n“Musk has been outspoken on Twitter about what appears to be a distaste for progressive politics,” Jackson said. “And he’s also known as this chaos agent. Some people consider him to be someone who enjoys ‘trolling for fun.’ So, for me, the news raised concerns that somebody who doesn’t seem to value democratic values at least as I define them – in terms of people having access to and safety in the public sphere – might be taking over the platform.”\n\nYet Jackson is staying on Twitter – for now, anyway.\n\n“Staying is conditional,” she said. “There are a few wait-and-see questions. For instance, is the site going to be managed in a new way, both in terms of its corporate ethics and in terms of things like how the algorithm works and how hate speech is or isn’t tolerated?”\n\nCrucially, while Twitter has been socially and politically valuable, particularly to Black Americans, it wouldn’t be the end of the world if the site were to cease being the preferred platform for deliberation and expression. That’s because those things can move elsewhere.\n\n“I don’t know what that space is,” Jackson said. “But I have faith in people to figure it out, to innovate. So, I think that we have to be careful. This (the Musk news) is a very good reason to feel dismay. But also, platforms aren’t permanent. Technologies aren’t permanent. They’re always changing.”", "authors": ["Brandon Tensley"], "publish_date": "2022/05/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/business/exxon-bp-shell-russia-oil/index.html", "title": "How Exxon, BP and Shell help Russia pump oil and gas | CNN ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nThe West is promising “massive” sanctions on Moscow in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday that European sanctions would target Russia’s military, economy and energy, and Germany’s decision this week to halt certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline built by Russia’s Gazprom shows that the vast oil and gas sector isn’t off limits.\n\nBut any action that affects Russia’s energy interests will highlight the role played by some of the West’s biggest players, which have generated billions of dollars for the Russian state and are among the country’s leading foreign investors.\n\nHere’s how ExxonMobil (XOM), BP (BP) and Shell (RDSA) are helping keep Russia’s oil-dependent economy afloat.\n\nExxonMobil\n\nThe American oil giant has more than 1,000 employees in Russia, and has been in the country for over 25 years.\n\nIts subsidiary, Exxon Neftegas Limited (ENL), has a 30% stake in Sakhalin-1 — a vast oil and natural gas project located off Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East. It has operated the project since 1995 on behalf of a consortium that includes Japanese and Indian partners, as well as two affiliates of Russia’s largest oil company, Rosneft.\n\nENL employs more than 700 Russian nationals at five major sites and production locations. ExxonMobil also has offices in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\nSince its startup, Sakhalin-1 has generated more than $18.3 billion in payments to Russian federal and regional governments.\n\nRussia isn’t as important to ExxonMobil as it used to be, however.\n\nExxonMobil previously partnered with Rosneft to conduct exploration and research activities in Russia but withdrew from those joint ventures after sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\nIt valued its Russian assets at $4 billion in its annual financial report released Wednesday. That represented less than 2% of its fossil fuel assets. The word “Russia” was not mentioned in its recent earnings call with analysts.\n\nExxonMobil did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBP\n\nOn its website, BP proclaims itself “one of the biggest foreign investors in Russia.”\n\nThat investment largely takes the form of a strategic partnership with Rosneft, in which it owns a 19.75% stake. The British company gets to nominate two directors to the Rosneft board — BP CEO Bernard Looney and former CEO Bob Dudley. The Russian government is Rosneft’s biggest shareholder.\n\nThrough three joint ventures with Rosneft, BP owns a 20% stake in the Taas-Yuryakh oil project in eastern Siberia. BP completed the deal to acquire that stake in 2015, and production from the project was expected to reach 100,000 barrels per day last year.\n\nBP also owns 49% of Yermak Neftegaz — formed in 2016 — which is conducting onshore exploration over a combined area of about 260,000 square kilometers in the West Siberian and Yenisey-Khatanga basins.\n\nThe third joint venture covers the Kharampur project, in which BP has a 49% interest. Kharampur is a mature oil field but BP and Rosneft are planning to develop the project to pump gas. BP says there is potential to “double overall field production.”\n\nBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe tanker Sun Arrows loads its cargo of liquefied natural gas from the Sakhalin-2 project in the port of Prigorodnoye, Russia, on Friday, Oct. 29, 2021.

Zuckerberg said the forthcoming headset will have “a few big features,” including eye- and face-tracking so that people’s VR avatars can accurately mimic their facial expressions and users can feel as if their avatar is looking directly at another person’s avatar in VR social apps.\n\nThe company’s most recent VR headset, Quest 2, was released in October 2020. The release of the interview with Rogan comes a week after Zuckerberg was widely criticized online for the simplicity of his avatar in Horizon Worlds, which is Meta’s flagship social VR app. (Zuckerberg later admitted the image he shared was “pretty basic.”)\n\nIn his conversation with Rogan, Zuckerberg said more about the new headset will be revealed at Connect, which is Meta’s annual VR developer conference. The company hasn’t yet announced a date for the conference this year, but it’s typically in the fall; last year, it streamed online on October 28.\n\nZuckerberg doesn’t sit for many traditional press interviews. Rogan’s podcast, while popular, has also come under criticism for the host’s inaccurate claims about Covid-19 and vaccines.\n\nIn addition to discussing VR, Zuckerberg was also pressed on some of the company’s content moderation decisions. In one exchange, nearly two-hours into the chat, Zuckerberg addressed his company’s decision to reduce the spread of a New York Post article published in October of 2020 that made allegations about Hunter Biden.\n\nZuckerberg said the article’s distribution was reduced for several days while it was reviewed by the company’s fact-checking partners. “For the, I think it was five or seven days, when it was basically being determined whether it was false, the distribution on Facebook was decreased, but people were still allowed to share it,” he said in the interview.\n\nThe reduction in the article’s distribution was addressed publicly at the time of its publication. In Oct. 2020, Meta spokesman Andy Stone tweeted “While I will intentionally not link to the New York Post, I want be clear that this story is eligible to be fact checked by Facebook’s third-party fact checking partners. In the meantime, we are reducing its distribution on our platform.”\n\nMark Zuckerberg spoke with controversial comedian and podcast host Joe Rogan for three hours. From The Joe Rogan Experience\n\nWhen pressed by Rogan about what it means for the distribution to be decreased, Zuckerberg added, “Basically, the ranking and Newsfeed was a little bit less, so fewer people saw it than would have otherwise.” Zuckerberg said he didn’t know by what percentage “off the top of my head,” but said it was “meaningful.”\n\nZuckerberg said the decision to take action on the story came after broader warnings from the FBI to be “vigilant,” given Russian propaganda in the 2016 election.\n\n“We just kind of thought, hey, look, if the FBI, which I still view as a legitimate institution in this country, is very professional law enforcement, if they come to us and tell us that we need to be on guard about something then I’m going to take that seriously,” he said.\n\nFacebook and Twitter each took steps to limit the spread of the story on their platforms at the time. Twitter’s cofounder and former CEO Jack Dorsey later said his company made the “wrong” decision on the matter.\n\nAfter fact-checkers looked into it, Zuckerberg said no one was able to ultimately say that the story was false. The situation “sucks,” he said, “in the same way that probably having to go through a criminal trial, but being proven innocent in the end sucks.”\n\nHe added: “I think the process was pretty reasonable. You know, we still let people share it, but obviously you don’t want situations like that.”\n\nOn Thursday evening, after Zuckerberg’s interview with Rogan circulated on social media, Meta’s verified communications account on Twitter responded to tweets related to Zuckerberg’s discussion of the Hunter Biden story. “Mark testified before the Senate nearly two years ago that in the lead up to the 2020 election, the FBI warned about the threat of foreign hack and leak operations,” the account tweeted.\n\nIn the conversation, Zuckerberg also touched on algorithms and content moderation, as well as lighter topics like his morning routine and his family’s love of jiu-jitsu.

Its metaverse dream feels as ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nEven by Facebook’s standards, 2021 was a rough year.\n\nA series of damning reports based on leaks from a whistleblower raised uncomfortable questions about Facebook’s impact on society; the company continued reeling from concerns about the use of its platform to organize the January 6 Capitol riot; and privacy changes from Apple threatened its core advertising business. Meanwhile, young users were flocking to TikTok.\n\nAt a virtual reality event on October 28, 2021, CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried to turn the page. Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would change its name to Meta and go all in on building a future version of the internet called the “metaverse,” proving to all in the process that the company he launched in 2004 was more than just a social media business.\n\nOne year and billions of dollars later, the so-called metaverse still feels years away, if it ever manifests at all. And the company formerly known as Facebook remains very much a social media business — one that is facing more financial pressure than when it announced the change.\n\nA sign in front of Meta headquarters on April 28, 2022 in Menlo Park, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nMeta’s Quest 2 consumer virtual-reality headset, released two years ago, is popular in its category but remains a niche product overall. Its newest headset, the much pricier $1,500 Quest Pro, is intended for enterprise customers and likely won’t move the needle with everyday consumers. And Meta’s flagship social VR app Horizon Worlds can feel like a ghost town (albeit a ghost town with laser tag).\n\nWhile some brands have since made measured bets on the metaverse, including by hiring “chief metaverse officers,” it’s not clear whether consumers actually want to work or play in it, or even know what the hard-to-define term means. The metaverse refers, generally, to a sort of virtual world that people can walk around in, as well as the idea of making the internet more ubiquitous and interconnected.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta’s core business is contracting as it confronts growing competition from TikTok and an advertising industry in retreat amid looming recession fears. The company this week reported its second-ever quarterly drop in revenue and saw profit cut in half from the prior year. It’s selling more ads but making less money on them, and user growth on its social media platforms is slowing. After hitting a $1 trillion market cap for the first time last summer, it’s now worth about a quarter of that, or less than Home Depot.\n\n“The business is not growing in 2022,” said Gil Luria, technology strategist at D.A. Davidson. “There is expectation that it will grow going forward, but that expectation may prove to be optimistic.”\n\nA bet that looked bold a year ago now looks borderline unhinged. Meta lost $9.4 billion in the first nine months of 2022 on its metaverse efforts and expects losses from the unit to “grow significantly year-over-year” in 2023. This has prompted even some of Meta’s supporters to urge it to rethink its strategy shift, and possibly slow it down. (It also prompted a tearful Jim Cramer, host of “Mad Money,” to apologize to viewers for trusting Meta’s management team and recommending that investors buy the stock.)\n\n“People are confused by what the metaverse even means. If the company were investing $1-2B per year into this project, then that confusion might not even be a problem. You would simply do R&D quietly and investors would focus on the core business,” Brad Gerstner, CEO of Altimeter Capital, a shareholder in Meta, wrote in an open letter to Zuckerberg this week. He urged Meta to “cap its metaverse investments to no more than $5B per year with more discrete targets and measures of success.”\n\nThe current pace of spending, he added, “is super-sized and terrifying, even by Silicon Valley standards.”\n\nMeta did not respond to requests for comment on this story.\n\nA sudden shift years in the making\n\nThough the name change was just announced a year ago, the shift from Facebook to Meta has been years in the making. Zuckerberg has said in the past that it’s a long-term bet for the company — not an overnight transformation. It began with Facebook’s 2014 purchase of Oculus VR, and in the years since, the company has rolled out a series of headsets that are increasingly capable, affordable and portable.\n\nMeta’s latest headset, the Quest Pro, is its first effort at combining the immersiveness of VR with the real world. It can display text and fine details in VR, track your eyes and facial features to give you a sense of connection with other people in virtual spaces, and show you a view of the world around you in color while letting you interact with digital objects — all nods toward Meta’s goal of attracting more business users.\n\nIt’s a far cry from the Oculus Rift headset available in 2016: That cost $599, but users also had to connect it to a powerful PC and use it with a sensor camera on a stand that tracked the headset. At first, that headset didn’t even come with tracked hand controllers; it initially shipped to customers with an Xbox controller and a small handheld remote.\n\nAlthough the headsets have improved dramatically, VR and AR are still nascent technologies searching for purpose and popularity. The VR headset market is still tiny compared to, say, an established gadget market like console video games. ABI Research expects 11.1 million VR headsets will ship out this year, about 70% of which it predicts will be Quest 2 headsets. That’s a drop from its estimate of 14.5 million headsets in 2021, of which Quest 2 headsets made up 85% of the total.\n\nThere’s potential for these products, some technology experts say, including in the workplace, but in the near term its adoption by everyday users remains uncertain at best.\n\n“I’m not sure this is going to translate to end-user consumers any time soon,” said David Lindlbauer, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University who leads the school’s Augmented Perception Lab. (Meta is sponsoring Lindlbauer’s research into developing advanced user interfaces for AR and VR.)\n\nA headset is not a smartphone\n\nFor Zuckerberg, and Meta, that creates a unique challenge.\n\nZuckerberg successfully pivoted Facebook’s operations once before from desktop to mobile devices shortly after taking the company public, a move that helped supercharge its advertising business and ensure its dominance for much of the next decade. But smartphones were already ubiquitous at that time; if anything Facebook was a bit late.\n\nNow, the company is trying to spearhead a new technology and hoping consumers will follow its lead.\n\nMeta has positioned the shift as a sort of existential imperative for the company. After Apple’s app tracking changes hurt Meta’s ability to target ads to its users, the company doesn’t want to rely on any outside hardware or app store in the future.\n\nA visitor to the 2022 Tokyo Game Show tests the Meta Quest 2 VR headset. Stanislav Kogiku/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nBut there’s a big difference between looking at a computer or smartphone display and wearing a headset. While Lindlbauer can imagine using a headset for perhaps an hour a day, alternating between immersive views in VR and digital imagery that mixes with the physical world, “I think we haven’t hit the sweet spot yet of something I want to wear all day,” he said.\n\nMeta is also facing an enormous challenge when it comes to showing off VR content that users like the looks of and want to use repeatedly. According to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal, internal documents show Horizon Worlds has fewer than 200,000 active monthly users, a rounding error for a company with 3.7 billion monthly active users across its various services. (A Meta spokesperson told the Journal that it’s “easy to be a cynic about the metaverse” but Meta thinks it is “the future of computing.”)\n\n“They’re starting with this idea that they want to build one big space like Horizon Worlds in which everybody’s just going to show up and start building stuff,” said Avi Bar-Zeev, founder of AR and VR consultancy RealityPrime and a former employee at Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, where he worked on the HoloLens VR headset. “There’s no virtual world that was ever successful building a canvas that people would just come and start painting.”\n\nZuckerberg has personally received intense criticism for the way Meta envisions work and play interactions in virtual spaces after posting on Facebook an image of his blocky, cartoon-like avatar in Horizon Worlds — an image he later admitted was “pretty basic.”\n\n“As far as the quick-twitch, give-me-more public is concerned, the progress seen so far is a letdown,” said Janna Anderson, director of the Imagining the Internet Center at Elon University. “Meta is suffering tremendous ridicule in social media and in the overall public zeitgeist.”\n\nThe Quest Pro’s face-tracking capabilities can help make avatars’ facial expressions look more realistic: Initially, users can access this tracking in Horizon Worlds and Horizon Workrooms, Meta said, as well as in several developers’ apps such as Painting VR and DJ app Tribe XR.\n\nBut even with facial tracking, what users see when they pop in to Horizon Worlds — blocky, human-like avatars that exist only from the torso up, floating around a virtual plaza — will for now continue to contrast sharply with the image Zuckerberg portrayed during Meta’s Connect event on October 11 of his own full-body avatar.\n\nIn the meantime, investors appear to be getting fed up with the investments in the metaverse at a time when the future of its core business is also deeply uncertain.\n\n“I think kind of summing up how investors are feeling right now is that there are just too many experimental bets versus proven bets on the core,” Jeffries analyst Brent Thill said on Meta’s earnings call this week.\n\nZuckerberg, for his part, is defending the strategy shift. “I’d say that there’s a difference between something being experimental and not knowing how good it’s going to end up being,” he responded. Separately, he added: “I think people are going to look back decades from now and talk about the importance of the work that was done here.”", "authors": ["Rachel Metz Clare Duffy", "Rachel Metz", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/08/investing/facebook-meta-ticker-symbol-change/index.html", "title": "META alert!

Instead, it will be trading under the new symbol of “META” as of Thursday.\n\nThe new ticker comes a few months after Facebook officially changed its corporate name to Meta Platforms. The Meta moniker is a reflection of the social media giant’s pivot to the metaverse, with virtual worlds becoming an increasingly important part of the future for the owner of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp.\n\nAs the company describes it, Facebook is “moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.”\n\nInitially, the company said it would change its ticker symbol in December 2021 to “MVRS,” a vowel-deficient version of Metaverse.\n\nWhy not “META”?

Increases explained.", "text": "Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for shoppers and companies, cooling demand with the aim of curbing inflation.\n\nThe Fed has raised rates five times this year.\n\nThe central bank is expected to hike rates for a sixth time on Wednesday by a big amount: 0.75 percentage point.\n\nThe cost of almost everything continues to rise at a blistering pace.\n\nWhile overall annual inflation slowed in September, it remained high at 8.2%, near a 40-year record. More alarming, the so-called core rate that excludes the volatile energy and food sectors accelerated, rising 6.6% for the largest 12-month increase in that index since August 1982 and demonstrating how widespread inflation has become.\n\nTo cool inflation, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise its benchmark short-term federal funds rate at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday by 0.75 percentage point to bump the fedfunds target range to 3.75% to 4.0%. That would be the Fed's sixth straight rate hike and the fourth consecutive one by that amount. The first time it increased rates by 0.75% was in June, which was at that time, the largest increase at a single meeting since 1994.\n\nBut why are hikes used to combat inflation, and how do they work?\n\nGloomier outlook:Could a looming recession be more severe than forecast? Some economists say 'yes' and here's why.\n\nSlowdown ahead:Amazon and Apple see slowdown ahead even as consumers are still spending. Here's why.\n\nWhen will the Fed announce the next rate hike?\n\nThe Fed is expected to announce a 0.75% increase in its fed funds rate on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. Another rate hike is also expected at its final meeting of the year in December, but economists are split on the size of it.\n\nThe Fed's economic projections released in September showed the median fed funds rate at 4.4% by year end and up to 4.6% next year. If the Fed raises its fed funds rate by 0.75% on Wednesday, the target range will be 3.75% to 4%.\n\nShould've hiked sooner? Did the Federal Reserve make an epic mistake by not hiking interest rates sooner?\n\nHow does a Fed hike work? How does it affect prime rate, 10-year Treasury bond?\n\nAs the country’s central bank, the Fed is in charge of monetary policy, meaning it sets interest rates and money supply. Its dual mandate is to promote “maximum employment and stable prices in the U.S. economy.” Stable prices mean keeping inflation in check, with a long-term mean annual target of 2%.\n\nIn 2020, CPI inflation was 1.4%. In 2021, it was 7%.\n\nOne of the Fed's main tools to control inflation is the fed funds rate, which is the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans. If that rate rises, banks may pass on their additional cost.\n\nSo although the Fed doesn't directly control all interest rates, when it raises the fed funds rate, most other interest rates eventually follow suit, including adjustable-rate mortgages, credit cards, home equity lines of credit, and other loans. Some of these are tied to the prime rate, which is based on the federal funds rate, according to Bankrate.com.\n\nBorrowing money then becomes more expensive for consumers, who in turn spend less. Demand begins to wane and inflation, in theory, starts to relent.\n\nMeanwhile, some Americans see their coffers buoyed by higher bank savings rates.\n\nThe taxman's coming:As college athletes cash in on NIL, tax experts and schools remind them to pay Uncle Sam\n\nDoes a Fed rate hike mean mortgage rates rise?\n\nYes, usually.\n\nA Fed rate hike doesn't directly affect other interest rates but trickles out to other rates.\n\n\"It’s like throwing a pebble on a pond,\" the St. Louis Fed explains on its website. \"It creates ripple effects that diminish farther away from the center.\"\n\nShort-term rates like those on short-term Treasury bills and securities and private short-term money market funds are among those most closely tied to the federal funds rate.\n\nCredit cards, home equity lines of credit, adjustable-rate mortgages and auto loans are further out from the center of the ripple.\n\nWhen the Fed raises the fed funds rate, the prime rate -- the rate banks charge its best customers and companies -- follows suit. All sorts of consumer rates, including mortgage rates, are based on the prime rate.\n\nHow many times has the Fed raised interest rates in 2022?\n\nThe Fed has raised interest rates five times this year. The pandemic’s shutdown of the economy had kept rates near zero before the Fed increased rates by a 0.25 percentage point in March, the first hike in more than three years.\n\nAn additional increase of 0.50 percentage point came in May, ]followed by a historic 0.75 percentage point bump in June, another 0.75 jump in July, and the latest three-quarters of a point one in September, putting the rate at its current range of 3% to 3.25%.\n\nHow much will the Fed raise rates?\n\nEconomists surveyed by Bloomberg predict the Fed will raise the fed funds rate by 0.75% for a fourth consecutive time on Wednesday. The Fed's median economic projections show the fed funds rate reaching 4.4% by year-end and 4.6% next year, but many economists, including at Deutsche Bank, expect the fed funds rate will have to rise at least to 5%.\n\nAre interest rate hikes good for stocks?\n\nInterest rate hikes create volatility in the stock market. The value of future earnings tends to dip when higher interest rates are expected, according to U.S. Bank, making investors less eager to bid up stock prices.\n\nTech and small-cap stocks tend to rely more on borrowing to fuel their growth, so they'll usually be among those to be hurt first by rising rates.\n\nHigher interest rates also are meant to slow the economy, which can stunt revenues and earnings for companies, potentially damaging their growth and stock prices.\n\nContributing: Paul Davidson, Medora Lee", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/11/02/fed-interest-rate-hike-live-updates/10561495002/", "title": "Fed hikes interest rates again. Will it slow them down now?", "text": "The Fed on Wednesday raised interest rates for the sixth time this year.\n\nThe hike will make it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow money.\n\nThe central bank is boosting rates to curb inflation, which hovers near a 40-year high. But the higher rates risk pushing the economy into a recession.\n\nWASHINGTON – The Federal Reserve plowed ahead with a fourth straight historically large interest rate hike Wednesday -- an increase of 0.75 percentage point -- in an effort to beat back soaring inflation.\n\nBut as the Fed’s monthslong campaign increasingly risks a recession next year, the main question now is – Will it dial back the rate hikes in December or wait until inflation shows clear signs of abating?\n\nAt a news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed could slow the pace of hikes as soon as next month.\n\n\"That time is coming and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that,\" Powell said.\n\nBut he added the Fed isn't close to pausing its rate hike campaign and needs to boost rates a good bit more to reach a level that's \"sufficiently restrictive\" to lower inflation to the Fed's 2% target. The concern, he said, is that inflation could become \"entrenched\" in the expectations of consumers and businesses and the Fed must move decisively to head off such a dynamic.\n\n\"It's very premature to be thinking about pausing,\" Powell said. \"We have a ways to go.\"\n\nA remedy for high inflation, Fed hikes:How to fix high inflation, weak growth and labor shortages? Boost worker productivity.\n\nCiting recent high inflation figures, he added that rates could well rise above the 4.5% to 4.75% range that Fed officials previously anticipated.\n\nThe inflation numbers \"do suggest to me that we may move to a higher level than we thought at the September meeting,\" Powell said. \"There's no sense that inflation is coming down.\"\n\nIn a statement after a two-day meeting, Fed officials said that in weighing future rate increases they'll consider the large increases they already have approved and the typical lag between the Fed’s actions and their effects on the economy.\n\nWall Street appeared to interpret that as a signal the Fed will soon reduce the pace of hikes, with stock rising sharply, but Powell downplayed that view.\n\nStock market today\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average shot up about 300 points, or nearly 1%, after the statement hinted at a possible rate hike slowdown. But after Powell quashed that reading, the blue-chip average dropped 505 points, or 1.6%, at the close of trading.\n\nFed latest rate hike: How will it affect mortgages, credit cards and auto loans\n\nThe Fed, as widely expected, raised its key short-term rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to a range of 3.75% to 4%, a decidedly “restrictive” level intended to fight inflation by further slowing an already wobbly economy. Since March, the Fed has hoisted its federal funds rate – what banks charge each other for overnight loans -- from near zero, its most aggressive such initiative since 1980.\n\nThe strategy, along with inflation that’s still just modestly below the 40-year high reached earlier this year, is likely to tip the economy into a recession by next year, according to most economists surveyed by Wolters Kluwer Blue Chip Economic Indicators.\n\nWednesday’s move is expected to ripple through the economy, driving up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loans. Fixed, 30-year mortgage rates already have jumped above 7% from 3.22% early this year. At the same time, households, especially seniors, are finally reaping higher bank savings yields after years of meager returns.\n\nIs inflation going down from the Fed's interest rate hikes?\n\nSince the Fed’s last meeting six weeks ago, there have been some hints that inflation soon could ease. U.S. monthly job growth has fallen from 537,000 in July to 263,000 in September, though that’s still solid number. And private-sector wages and salaries grew 5.2% annually in the July-September period, still historically high but down from 5.7% the previous quarter.\n\nThe most widely followed inflation gauge, the consumer price index, showed that overall prices in September were up 8.2% from a year earlier, down from a four-decade high of 9% in June.\n\nBut those developments have been outnumbered by signs that inflation will likely drift down just slowly. The Fed’s preferred inflation measure, which excludes food and energy costs, rose to 5.1% in September from 4.9% the previous month. Consumers’ inflation expectations in one and five years – which often affect actual price increases -- rose last month after falling previously.\n\nAnd job openings surged from 10.3 million to 10.7 million in September after coming off record highs in the spring and summer. That could again put upward pressure on wages as employers compete for a pool of workers that’s still limited compared with the pre-pandemic level.\n\n\"We aren't going to declare victory until we really see convincing evidence, compelling evidence that inflation is coming down,\" Powell told reporters in June.\n\nEven without big Fed rate increases, economists still expect inflation to slow as supply-chain bottlenecks ease, commodity prices fall, a strong dollar lowers import costs and retailers offer discounts to unload swollen inventories.\n\nPowell, however, has repeatedly said it's critical that the Fed bump up rates to tamp down consumers' inflation expectations.\n\nHow high will the Fed raise interest rates?\n\nFutures markets that predict where the Fed’s key rate is headed expect another three-quarters point increase next month and two quarter-point moves early next year before the central bank pauses its rate-hiking campaign.\n\nThat would take the key rate to a range of 5% to 5.25%. A fed funds rate of over 5% almost certainly would trigger a recession, says economist Bob Schwartz of Oxford Economics. By next September, futures markets expect the Fed to trim rates to bolster a faltering economy.\n\nWhat are current mortgage rates?\n\nThe current mortgage rates have eclipsed 7% for the first time in more than two decades leaving some Americans wondering whether to buy a home in this ever-changing housing market.\n\n\"Nobody saw this coming. We thought maybe a max of 5%, but not a 7% interest rate,\" Nadia Evangelou, a senior economist and director of forecasting for the National Association of Realtors told USA TODAY. As a result, Evangelou said the realtors association has readjusted its forecast several times this year.\n\nThe current 30-year fixed-rate mortgage on Tuesday was 7.22%, a decrease of 8 basis points from a week earlier, according to Bankrate.com. Bankrate said that the existing 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is 6.47%, a 3-basis-point increase from last week.\n\nThe average on an adjustable-rate mortgage is 5.53%, up 5 basis points from the same time last week. An adjustable-rate mortgage is a home loan with an interest rate that can fluctuate over time.\n\n— Terry Collins\n\nMortgage interest rate forecast 2022\n\nAs a result of the Fed's hikes, real estate markets have already been affected by higher rates for several months and it is widely expected to continue well into next year, Ruben Gonzalez, chief economist at Keller Williams, a property tech real estate company, told USA TODAY on Wednesday.\n\n\"As the Fed continues to combat inflation, the housing market will continue to slow as one of the most interest rate-sensitive industries. Homeowners’ equity levels are high because of the rapid appreciation, and mortgage default rates remain near all-time lows as markets cool,\" Gonzalez said. \"We're unlikely to see mortgage rates move down until the second half of next year but more likely not until 2024.\"\n\nRobert Dietz, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, told USA TODAY that he predicts the Fed will ease up on interest rates no later than 2024 which will lead to a rebound in the housing industry.\n\n\"The market for 2023 will be weak until then,\" Dietz said. \"Home prices will remain high and supply will be low.\"\n\n--Terry Collins\n\nFollow along for our coverage of today’s crucial interest rate decision:\n\nWhat is the Federal Reserve system?\n\nAfter news of the rate hike, it's a great time to revisit what the Federal Reserve system is.\n\nWe often associate the Fed with Powell and the building located in Washington, D.C., but the Fed extends well beyond that. There are 12 regional banks located in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco. Each bank has its own president.\n\nThere are 12 people responsible for deciding what to do with interest rates at every Fed meeting. Seven seats are filled by the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, which includes Chairman Powell and six other people who were nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate. The New York Fed president casts a vote on interest rates at every meeting. The remaining four votes come from a rotating cast of the other regional bank leaders.\n\n— Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nAre we in a recession right now?\n\nWhile two consecutive GDP contractions in the first two quarters this year met an informal benchmark for recession, the National Bureau of Economic Research looks at a broader range of economic activity, including employment, retail sales and industrial production, before determining when a downturn begins and ends. NBER is a non-profit, non-partisan organization that frequently publishes economic research. Within NBER is a team of eight economists tasked with determining when recessions occur.\n\nMost economists don’t believe the U.S. is in a recession, citing slowing but still-vibrant job growth. There’s little doubt, though, that the economy is losing steam as households and businesses curtail spending amid soaring inflation and the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes aimed at tempering the price increases.\n\n— Paul Davidson\n\nHow to prepare for a recession\n\nWith that in mind, it's never too early to start thinking about how to prepare for a recession.\n\nTry to put aside just enough so you can scrape by on a strictly bare-bones budget for three months in case you lose your job, said Brian Robinson, a financial adviser and partner with SharpePoint.\n\nAlso, consider putting off \"nice to have\" purchases. For instance, if your refrigerator breaks, get it repaired or buy a new one. But if the blow dryer you’ve owned for five years still gets the job done, just not as good as a newer one, hold on to it – and your cash.\n\nMake sure to take inventory of all your monthly subscriptions and ask yourself which you could live without, then cancel those.\n\n— Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nFederal Reserve meeting schedule\n\nThe Fed's last meeting of the year will take place from December 13-14. Then the central bank will reconvene on January 31 for its two-day meeting. Here is the schedule of meetings for the rest of 2023:\n\nMarch 21-22\n\nMay 2-3\n\nJune 13-14\n\nJuly 25-26\n\nSeptember 19-20\n\nOctober 31-November 1\n\nDecember 12-13\n\n— Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nI bonds interest rate\n\nThe Treasury announced Tuesday that the rate on its inflation-protected I Bonds will fall to an annual rate of 6.89% for the next six months. Anyone can invest a minimum of $25 or a maximum of $10,000 each year.\n\n— Jim Sergent\n\nFed fund rates today\n\nAfter the 75-basis-point hike on Wednesday, the fed funds rate ranges between 3.75% to 4%. That rate is the interest rate banks charge to lend money to one another.\n\n— Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nHow does raising interest rates help inflation?\n\nRising rates increase consumer and business borrowing costs, which reduces demand for products and services broadly, leading suppliers to cut prices or stop raising them. But the immediate effect varies significantly across individual goods and services.\n\n— Elisabeth Buchwald and Paul Davidson\n\nStock market today\n\nStocks opened lower ahead of the Fed's decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down by 0.3% while the S&P 500 was down by 0.7% and the Nasdaq was down by 1.3% as of 12:30 p.m. ET.\n\n— Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nS&P 500 performance during the past five rate hikes\n\nIn all but one of the past five Fed rate hikes, the S&P 500 closed at least 1% higher. The most recent hike, which occurred in late September, was the exception. Leading up to the decision, the index was higher but fell immediately after the Fed announced the 75-point hike. In the final trading hours, the S&P 500 seesawed between positive and negative territory multiple times.\n\n— Jim Sergent\n\nFederal Reserve rate hike history 2022\n\nHere's when the Federal Reserve hiked its short-term interest rate this year, and the amount by which it raised that rate.\n\nMarch 17: 0.25 percentage point\n\nMay 5: 0.50 percentage point\n\nJune 16: 0.75 percentage point\n\nJuly 28: 0.75 percentage point\n\nSeptember 22: 0.75 percentage point\n\n— Paul Davidson\n\nWhat is inflation?:Understanding why prices rise, what causes it and who it hurts most.\n\nWhat is a recession?:The economic concept explained and what happens during one.\n\nWhat does it mean when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates?\n\nWhen the Fed raises interest rates it becomes more expensive for banks to borrow money from one another. Banks pass on these higher rates to consumers by making it more expensive for them to get a mortgage, a loan, pay off credit card debt and more.\n\nOn the flip side, Fed rate hikes increase the interest you earn on money in a savings account.\n\n— Orlando Mayorquin\n\nHow will stock react to the Fed?:Here's how the stock market has moved with all 5 of the Fed interest rate increases\n\nI Bond rates:Why I chose I Bonds to protect my sons' inheritance from 40-year-high inflation", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/homes/housing-market-outlook-second-half-of-2022/index.html", "title": "What's next for the US housing market | CNN Business", "text": "So far this year, the real estate market has not been going the way many prospective homebuyers had hoped. Home prices – already at all-time highs – have continued to climb and mortgage rates have risen much faster than expected.\n\nWhile some buyers have forged ahead, others have put their home search on hold or have given up entirely because the rising costs have put ownership out of reach.\n\nBut as recession fears for the larger economy loom, the housing market is showing signs of slowing. Sales of new construction homes are down and construction is stalling. Sales of existing homes have dropped and are trending below 2019 levels. As mortgage rates remain above 5%, applications have fallen to their lowest level in 22 years.\n\nStill, neither home prices nor mortgage rates are expected to plummet and affording a home is likely to remain a challenge for the rest of the year, economists say. Home price gains are slowing, but year-over-year prices are still seeing double-digit increases. And the Federal Reserve announced another rate hike this week, which will keep mortgage rates volatile.\n\n“Affordability is the biggest issue in the housing market today, and higher rates will make that worse on a monthly basis” said Skylar Olsen, chief economist at Zillow.\n\nMortgage rates will stabilize\n\nThe big surprise for those looking to buy a home during the first half of the year was how mortgage rates shot up so much, so fast. Interest rates for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rose from 3.22% at the beginning of January to a high, so far this year, of 5.81% in June, according to Freddie Mac. In recent weeks, average rates have settled in around 5.5%.\n\n“Someone buying the same house today that they wanted to buy last year will see a 50% increase in their monthly payment,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. “People’s incomes do not rise by 50% in a year. Homebuyers are frustrated. This year, they are in total disbelief that they don’t have the money to buy at a 6% mortgage rate.”\n\nThe cost of financing a home is so great that nearly 15% of people who signed a contract to buy a home in June backed out, according to Redfin. That’s the highest share of canceled home sales since April 2020, when the market all but stopped due to the pandemic.\n\nBut Yun said that while mortgage rates may tick up or down in the months to come, the biggest jumps have already happened.\n\n“We may be topping out on mortgage rates,” he said.\n\nYun noted that mortgage rates may have largely already “priced-in” the Fed’s current and anticipated future interest rate hikes. He expects mortgage rates will settle in near 6% by year’s end and that home sales will normalize once mortgage rates become more stable.\n\nInventory will rise from last year\n\nAs the market slows, potential buyers who continue to search for a home will have less competition and more homes to chose from, offering more breathing room than the frenzied market of the past two years.\n\nEconomists were largely on target with their home price projections for the first half of the year – with annual price growth peaking in the spring and moderating as the year has gone on. But the number of sales at this point in the year is way below expectations, said Jeff Tucker, an economist at Zillow.\n\n“Sales volume has taken a much bigger hit than prices,” he said. “Buyers soldiered through those mortgage rate increases longer than we thought – that kept prices high. But some buyers began to drop out.”\n\nYun said he anticipates 2022 sales will be down by about 13% from last year.\n\nThe upshot, said Tucker, is that as sales volumes continue to fall, inventory will tick up.\n\nSoaring demand to buy a home during the past two years led to record low inventory of homes to buy and that pushed prices up. In June, inventory saw its first year-over-year turnaround in three years. The number of homes available for sale at the end of June was up 9.6% from May and 2.4% from a year ago, according to NAR.\n\nHome prices will rise more slowly\n\nThe median price of a home reached a record high of $416,000 in June.\n\nBut the pace of price growth has been slowing lately. Median home prices for existing homes were up 13.4% in June from the year before, compared with the 23% spike in home prices in June 2021, according to NAR.\n\nIn addition, prices on new construction homes are actually falling. The median sales price of a new construction home dropped to $402,400 in June, down from $444,500 in May, according to the US Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\n“This is the biggest crack yet in home-price inflation,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. “If existing home prices follow suit, we may finally see a break in annual increases that have priced millions of Americans out of the housing market.”\n\nNew construction homes make up roughly 10% of transactions and existing homes the other 90%. And prices for the vast majority of the market aren’t falling.\n\nYun said he expects home prices for this year will be up 11%. That’s less than the 16.9% year-over-year increase from 2020 to 2021, but more than he had predicted at the beginning of this year.\n\nAs higher mortgage rates tamp down buyer demand, inventory will rise and sales will fall, which should help prices to moderate the rest of this year.\n\n“Homes may be sitting on the market longer, there will be more properties with price reductions,” Yun said. “Buyers who do deeper homework may be able to find a home with a price reduction or get a better price negotiation.”\n\nAffordability will remain a challenge\n\nHome affordability is the worst it’s been since 1989, with the exception of the housing bubble from 2004-2008, wrote David M. Dworkin and Bill McBride in a report for the National Housing Conference.\n\nBut during the housing bubble, the lack of affordability was driven by mortgages offering teaser interest rates of as low as 1% that reset to a level homeowners could not reliably pay. And in the 1980’s, homes were not affordable because of incredibly high interest rates – with 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates spanning 9% to over 18%.\n\nToday’s market is different, the researchers wrote. “Soaring housing costs are driven by the compounding impact of apparent underproduction between 2008 and 2020, housing supply chain failures since 2020, and increased demand since 2020.”\n\nAnd that’s not likely to change much by the end of the year.\n\nNew home building has stalled as builders wait to see how well the current supply of homes sells before launching more construction.\n\nSam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said he anticipates homebuyer demand to continue to cool to a more normal pace of activity – but that the ability for many people to buy a home will remain hard.\n\n“The Federal Reserve’s action to help manage inflation has created significant volatility in mortgage rates and, by extension, the housing market,” said Khater. “Although house price appreciation will grow at a more moderate rate, home prices remain high relative to homebuyer incomes. Taken together, these factors are exacerbating affordability challenges and causing a slowdown in the housing market.”", "authors": ["Anna Bahney"], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/22/homes/mortgage-rates-september-22/index.html", "title": "Mortgage rates rise to nearly 6.3%, the highest level since 2008 ...", "text": "Mortgage rates jumped higher for the fifth week in a row, further pushing past 6% in the face of yet another aggressive interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.29% in the week ending September 22, up from 6.02% the week before, according to Freddie Mac. That is significantly higher than this time last year, when it was 2.88%, and it is the highest level seen since October 2008.\n\nMortgage rates have almost doubled since the start of this year. After climbing to nearly 6% in mid-June, recession fears made rates more volatile. But now all eyes are on the central bank’s campaign of interest rates hikes in its fight against inflation.\n\n“The housing market continues to face headwinds as mortgage rates increase again this week,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.\n\nAs a result of the higher rates, home prices have started to soften and sales have decreased. But there is still a shortage of available homes for sale, which have been keeping home prices elevated.\n\n“The rapid rise in rates is definitely slowing the pace of sales and throwing cold water on what was a frenzied residential real estate market only a few months ago,” said Marty Green, principal at Polunsky Beitel Green, a law firm representing mortgage firms. “Where ‘inventory’ was the big concern in 2021 and early 2022, the concern today is ‘affordability.’”\n\nFed’s rates hikes appear to be having an impact\n\nOn Wednesday, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell announced a third-consecutive 75-basis-point hike.\n\nThe Fed does not set the interest rates borrowers pay on mortgages directly, but its actions influence them. Mortgage rates tend to track the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds. As investors see or anticipate rate hikes, they often sell government bonds, which sends yields higher and mortgage rates rise.\n\nThis week’s rate hike caused those 10-year Treasury yields to jump to 3.5%, the highest level in more than a decade.\n\nThe rate increase puts added pressure on those who are trying to save up to buy a home.\n\n“Consumers can expect to see the rates on adjustable-rate mortgages, credit cards, automotive and personal loans increase in the next few weeks,” Ratiu said. “For housing markets, higher borrowing costs are the very remedy the Fed is prescribing in order to cool demand and lower overheated prices.”\n\nWhile this slowdown may not yet be reflected in inflation numbers, “there is little doubt that Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate increases are most certainly cooling the residential real estate market.”\n\nBut would-be buyers still face the most unaffordable housing market in 35 years, given the combined effect of stubbornly high home prices, surging interest rates and lagging wage growth.\n\nA year ago, a buyer who put 20% down on a $390,000 home and financed the rest with a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at an average interest rate of 2.88% had a monthly mortgage payment of $1,295, according to calculations from Freddie Mac.\n\nToday, a homeowner buying the same-priced house with an average rate of 6.29% would pay $1,929 a month in principal and interest. That’s $634 more each month.\n\nPowell still looking for a ‘reset’ in housing\n\nPowell said earlier this summer that the housing market was in a complicated situation in which home prices could still go up even though mortgage rates are also rising.\n\n“I would say if you’re a homebuyer, or a young person looking to buy a home, you need a bit of a reset,” Powell said during a Fed meeting in June. “We need to get back to a place where supply and demand are back together and where inflation is down low again and mortgage rates are low again.”\n\nAt this week’s meeting, Powell said housing prices were going up at an unsustainably fast level. The “reset,” he said, should help bring prices more closely in line with rents and other housing market fundamentals.\n\n“That’s a good thing,” Powell said. “For the longer term, what we need is supply and demand to get better aligned so housing prices go up reasonably and people can afford houses again.”\n\nAdditional reporting contributed by Nicole Goodkind.", "authors": ["Anna Bahney"], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/03/15/interest-rate-fed-hike-credit-cards-mortgages/7042398001/", "title": "How Fed's first rate hike in more than 3 years will affect credit card ...", "text": "The hike would be first increase of the federal funds rate in more than 3 years and will kick off a projected 5 to 7 such moves this year.\n\nAmericans will soon see higher rates on everything from credit cards to mortgages.\n\nBut they will also finally see rates rise on some bank savings accounts and CDs.\n\nConsumer borrowing costs are headed higher.\n\nMuch higher.\n\nThe Federal Reserve raised its key short-term interest rate by a quarter percentage point Wednesday, and Americans will soon see higher rates on everything from credit cards to mortgages.\n\nThe good news: Consumers will finally see rates rise from measly levels on at least some bank savings accounts and CDs.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/23/economy/powell-fed-labor-market/index.html", "title": "The Fed's fight against inflation could cost the US 1.2 million jobs ...", "text": "Minneapolis CNN Business —\n\nIn its efforts to bring down historic inflation and cool the economy, the Federal Reserve has used multiple euphemisms to describe the potential impact on Americans’ jobs, from economic “pain” to “unfortunate costs” and a “softening labor market.”\n\nData, however, doesn’t mince words.\n\nThe Fed’s latest economic projections, released Wednesday alongside a massive third consecutive interest rate hike of 75 basis points, show that the central bank is expecting the nation’s unemployment rate to grow to 4.4% next year – up from August’s 3.7% — and potentially as high as 5%. Assuming no change in the labor force, that would mean around 1.2 million more people will be unemployed. At the high end of the Fed’s range, at 5%, that would be 2.2 million more unemployed.\n\n“There is a gradual realization that the rose-shaded glasses view of being able to reduce labor market tightness by just curbing the number of job openings is gone,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. “We have now an implicit realization that in order to cool the labor market there will need to be a significant increase in the unemployment rate and there will need to be a cooling of employment growth with potential employment losses.”\n\nThrough the first eight months of 2022, the United States has seen an average net gain of 438,000 jobs per month, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. In August, 315,000 jobs were added.

Cannon/Las Vegas Review-Journal/Tribune News Service/TNS/Getty Images\n\nLabor market strength is expected to continue moderating in the coming months, Ataman Ozyildirim, senior director of economics at The Conference Board noted Wednesday in the think tank’s latest Leading Economic Index release. The August 2022 index showed a sixth-consecutive month of declines, potentially signaling a recession is imminent, according to The Conference Board.\n\n“The average workweek in manufacturing contracted in four of the last six months — a notable sign, as firms reduce hours before reducing their workforce,” Ozyildirim said in a statement. “Economic activity will continue slowing more broadly throughout the US economy and is likely to contract. A major driver of this slowdown has been the Federal Reserve’s rapid tightening of monetary policy to counter inflationary pressures.”\n\nMyriad factors at play\n\nStill, this isn’t a typical bout of high inflation nor a typical job market, said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\nThe pandemic capsized the labor market and scrambled supply chains to the point where more than two years later, many of those challenges still persist and new ones have been added — like spiking food and energy prices — as a result of highly volatile developments such as Russia’s war in Ukraine and extreme weather events.\n\nThe Fed can’t just “click its heels three times, raise rates and have inflation drop,” Frick said.\n\n“There’s a myriad of factors going on now, and it’s a mistake to think the Fed controls any more than a handful of those,” he said.\n\nThe Fed can influence demand, however, with higher rates rippling through areas of the economy making it harder to buy a home, more expensive to buy a car or finance a business, and making credit card balances that much more costly.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback JPMorgan Chase CEO warns policy makers to be 'prepared for the worst' 02:18 - Source: CNN\n\nWhile portions of the demand side of the economy have shown some slowing in response to the Fed’s moves, the labor market has remained an outlier. Joblessness remains near historically low levels, job openings are double that of folks looking for work, and labor force participation remains below pre-pandemic levels.\n\n“I think the Fed is mistaken if it thinks raising rates, even to 4% or above, is going to cower the labor market, because we’re still more than 4 million jobs below the pre-pandemic trend, and employers are still making money, and employers still have to hire people,” Frick said. “And it’s really, at this point, like telling the tide not to come in – to expect the labor market to soften.”\n\nA key reason Fed Chair Jerome Powell wants more slack in the labor market is out of concern that a tight employment situation will continue to push up wages, which could then keep inflation elevated. As the unemployment rate rises, workers lose bargaining power for higher wages and households pull back on spending.\n\n“Powell has said that wage increases contributing to inflation has not yet occurred, but he sees it happening in the future,” Frick said. “This is all very theoretical at this point. And I understand that if you want to decrease demand, a way to do it is to increase unemployment … but I really think it’s an open question whether it’s an issue now or not.”\n\nNo ‘painless’ path forward\n\nTo that end, American workers might have to bear the brunt of the pain for a problem that’s not caused by them.\n\nPowell and the Fed have earned plenty of detractors on this front, notably Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who tweeted on Wednesday that she’s “been warning that Chair Powell’s Fed would throw millions of Americans out of work — and I fear he’s already on the path to doing so.”\n\n“It’s unfair,” Frick said. “But no one ever said economics wasn’t sometimes cruel.”\n\nPowell has said that prolonged and entrenched high inflation would be even worse than moderate increases in the unemployment rate. The Fed’s latest economic projections are for GDP growth to slow to 0.2% from 1.7% by the end of this year.\n\n“That’s a very slow level of growth, and it could give rise to increases in unemployment, but I think that is something that we think we need to have,” Powell said. “We think we need to have softer labor market conditions as well. We’re never going to say that there are too many people working, but the real point is this: Inflation, what we hear from people when we meet with them is that they really are suffering from inflation.”\n\n“If we want to set ourselves up, light the way to another period of a very strong labor market, we have got to get inflation behind us. I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn’t,” he added.\n\nThe next batch of key employment data, including openings, layoffs, and monthly job gains, will come in the first week of October when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey and monthly jobs report for September.\n\nJobless claims data released Thursday showed that the number of first-time applications for unemployment benefits was 213,000 for the week ended September 17, according to the Department of Labor. The previous week’s total of 213,000 was revised downward by 5,000. The weekly claims, which remain near some of their lowest levels in months, underscore how employers are holding on tightly to workers as the labor market remains full of opportunities for job hunters.", "authors": ["Alicia Wallace"], "publish_date": "2022/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/15/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "title": "Premarket trading: It's getting late in the game.

Some are even starting to brace for a big surprise.\n\nWhat’s happening: New inflation data on Tuesday showed that prices aren’t easing as quickly as Wall Street had hoped. Markets plummeted as the report stoked fears that the central bank and Chair Jerome Powell would decide to hike rates more aggressively, inflicting serious economic pain.\n\nTuesday’s alarming inflation report was the last before Federal Reserve officials convene for their next decision on interest rates, and it signaled to markets that the Fed won’t pull its feet off the accelerator in its fight to moderate price increases anytime soon.\n\nInvestors are putting the odds of a three-quarter percentage point hike next week at 75%, according to CME FedWatch data. But some finance bigwigs have started discussing a scenario in which the Fed raises rates by a full percentage point for the first time in its modern history.\n\nThe odds for a full point hike are hovering around 25% in the wake of the inflation report, up from 0% one week ago. Economists at the brokerage Nomura Securities changed their forecast from 75 basis points to 100 basis points.\n\nLarry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary and President Emeritus at Harvard, wrote on Twitter that he doesn’t think gradual increases in interest rates have been working to tamp down high prices. The Fed has hiked rates four times already this year, and inflation remains near 40-year highs.\n\nMarkets might even surprise to the upside if they are reassured that the Fed is taking inflation seriously, said Summers. It’s better to take a “rip off the bandaid” approach. He added, “I would choose a 100 basis points move to reinforce credibility.”\n\nBut markets don’t often take kindly to interest rate hikes, which can negatively impact earnings and stock prices.\n\nA percentage point hike would also push the federal funds rate into what the Fed considers a restrictive range — where it says economic growth tends to slow and unemployment rates tend to rise. That limits the Fed’s chances of executing a soft landing, the Goldilocks situation where the Fed cools the economy enough to lower inflation but not enough to cause a recession.\n\nStill, some economists think shocking markets is a good thing, and at least one Fed official agrees.\n\nMinneapolis Fed president Neel Kashari said last month that he was happy markets tanked after Powell warned of pain ahead. It meant that people understood the seriousness of the Fed’s commitment to getting inflation rates back down to 2%, he said.\n\nThe Fed wants “a weaker stock market. They want higher bond yields,” former New York Federal Reserve President Bill Dudley told my colleague Matt Egan last month. “The stock market I think is finally catching onto that.”\n\nHigher bond yields, lower stock prices and widening credit spreads that make it more expensive for companies with weaker balance sheets to borrow are necessary to tighten financial conditions.\n\nThe bottom line: It’s unlikely that the Federal Reserve will raise rates by a full percentage point next week. The consensus amongst economists and Wall Street analysts is still for a 75 basis point hike, and Powell likes to communicate and prepare markets for any changes.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean a larger hike isn’t coming at the November meeting.\n\n“I wouldn’t discount a 100 basis point rate hike,” Marvin Loh, senior strategist at State Street, told me. “It was only a few months ago when a 50 basis point hike seemed unthinkable.”\n\nRailroad strike averted after marathon talks\n\nUnions and management reached a tentative deal early Thursday that averts a freight railroad strike that had threatened to cripple US supply chains and push prices higher for many goods.\n\nThe deal with unions representing more than 50,000 engineers and conductors was announced just after 5 a.m. ET in a statement from the White House, which called it “an important win for our economy and the American people.”\n\nIt came after 20 hours of talks between the unions’ leadership and the railroads’ labor negotiators hosted by Labor Secretary Marty Walsh. They began their meeting Wednesday morning with the clock ticking down to a strike that had been set to start at 12:01 am ET on Friday.\n\nWatch this space: The agreement does not mean the threat of a strike has gone away entirely. The deal needs to be ratified by union members.\n\nBut it’s good news for a wide range of businesses that depend upon the freight railroads to continue to operate, and for the wider US economy. About 30% of the nation’s freight moves by rail.\n\nFew details of the deal have so far been made public. But the statement from President Joe Biden indicated that the major issue that had brought the country within a day of its first national rail strike in 30 years had been addressed in the unions’ favor.\n\n“It is a win for tens of thousands of rail workers who worked tirelessly through the pandemic to ensure that America’s families and communities got deliveries of what have kept us going during these difficult years,” Biden’s statement said. “These rail workers will get better pay, improved working conditions, and peace of mind around their health care costs: all hard-earned.”\n\nThe world’s second biggest cryptocurrency just got greener\n\nEthereum, the world’s second most valuable cryptocurrency, has completed a massive software upgrade that its backers claim will slash its carbon footprint.\n\nThe latest: The long-awaited revamp, which is known as “The Merge,” will reduce ethereum’s energy consumption by nearly 99.95%, according to the Ethereum Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting the cryptocurrency and its related technologies.\n\nUntil now, both ethereum and bitcoin were running on a mechanism called “proof-of-work,” under which high-powered computers were required to solve complex puzzles. The merger moves ethereum to a mechanism called “proof-of-stake,” which is much more energy efficient, my CNN Business colleague Diksha Madhok reports.\n\n“Happy merge all,” Vitalik Buterin, the 28-year-old Russian-Canadian programmer who helped create Ethereum, said on Twitter. “This is a big moment for the Ethereum ecosystem. Everyone who helped make the merge happen should feel very proud today.”\n\nThe co-founder said that the upgrade will “reduce worldwide electricity consumption by 0.2%.”\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies have seen a phenomenal rise in the last few years, observers say they’re terrible for the environment. A single Ethereum transaction is equivalent to the weekly power consumption of an average US household, according to Digiconomist.\n\nInvestor insight: Ethereum is down more than 1% in the past 24 hours. But analysts think it could boost adoption in the long run, especially for investors trying to align their portfolios with broader environmental goals.\n\nUp next\n\nAdobe (ADBE) reports earnings after the bell.\n\nAlso today: US retail sales for August arrive at 8:30 a.m. ET.

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\n\nNew York CNN business —\n\nInvestors are getting spooked that the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes could damage the US economy (just look at Tuesday’s selloff).\n\nOne area of growing concern: housing. Interest rate hikes can lead to higher mortgage rates, which could cause people to think twice about buying a home.\n\nSo far, sales are slipping, while prices are holding steady. But some economists warn continued historic rate hikes by the Fed could risk crashing the housing market, underscoring the difficult task ahead for the central bank.\n\nWhat’s happening: According to Tuesday’s Consumer Price Index report, housing costs rose 0.7% in August and are up 6.2% year-over-year, the largest increase since 1991.\n\nThat increase was largely responsible for August’s higher-than-expected pace of inflation. Combined with a tight labor market, those high prices give the Fed reason to continue to go hard at its policy meeting next week and beyond, Marvin Loh, senior strategist at State Street, told me.\n\nThe Fed needs to see housing costs ease by about half a percentage point to reach its ultimate inflation goal, Loh added.\n\nThe job won’t be easy. Housing prices can remain stubbornly high, even as the Fed works to counteract them.\n\nHousing prices are “the type of sticky inflation that will not ease anytime soon,” Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, told me. “It’s why the Fed will need to demonstrate a show of resolve by increasing the policy rate by 75 basis points at its September meeting despite the encouraging declines in transportation and energy.”\n\nThe risks: Some economists are noting weakness in the housing market starting to peek through. Home sales declined in July for the sixth month in a row. Housing starts, a measure of new home construction, also plunged that month as the cost of building supplies remained high and prospective buyers were priced out of the market.\n\nSo should the Fed keep up its historic hikes? The central bank must walk a careful line — a housing slowdown has preceded nine out of the past 12 recessions, and investors haven’t forgotten America’s catastrophic housing crisis in 2008.\n\nKeep in mind: Although there are some reasons to suggest the CPI report on housing lags what’s actually going on in the market, and that housing prices could already be on their way down, we’re nowhere near a market collapse.\n\nStill, Federal Reserve officials will face a tough decision in the coming months. Do they use the housing market’s resilience as a mandate to push forward with aggressive rate hikes and risk a crash?\n\nAmericans should prepare for a heating bill shock this winter\n\nGas prices are easing in the US. But winter is coming and the CEO of Chevron, one of the world’s largest energy companies, is warning that relief at the pump could soon be offset by sweat-inducing heating bills.\n\nChevron Chairman and CEO Mike Wirth said in an interview with CNN’s Poppy Harlow “there’s certainly a risk that costs will go up” for American consumers.\n\nWirth is not predicting a rise of the magnitude seen in Europe, where natural gas prices have skyrocketed as Russia has limited exports, reports my colleague Paul R. La Monica.\n\nBut in an interview that aired Tuesday, Wirth warned that US prices could be “significantly higher” this winter.\n\nOil prices are still up more than 15% so far this year. That has helped boost sales, earnings and the stock prices of companies like Chevron. Shares of the oil producer are up 36% year-to-date, while the broader S&P 500 is 17.5% lower.\n\nWirth acknowledged that his company is making large profits while Americans struggle.\n\n“I recognize that high energy prices are difficult for consumers. That’s why we’ve talked about increasing production, trying to increase supply to markets in a commodity business,” he said. “You go through these cycles. Two years ago, we were losing billions of dollars a quarter. Now we’re making strong profits.”\n\nBearish investors flock to cash\n\nIn more doom and gloom on Wall Street, pessimistic fund managers are selling stocks and piling into cash, according to a Bank of America survey published Tuesday.\n\n“Investors’ perception of the outlook for the global economy remains bleak in September,” Michael Hartnett, Bank of America’s chief investment strategist, wrote in the report, which surveyed 212 fund managers with more than half a trillion dollars of assets under management in September.\n\nAbout 72% of respondents expected a weaker economy in the next 12 months, up 5 percentage points from August. The share of investors saying recession is likely also increased in September to 68%, the highest since May 2020.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Wall Street is bracing for corporate profits to soften and equities to continue to crash, the survey showed. The cash levels investors are holding jumped from 5.7% last month to 6.1%, their highest level since the September 11 attacks in 2001.\n\nUp next\n\nThe August Producer Price Index, another key measure of US inflation, is released at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\nJoin CITIZEN by CNN at 2 p.m. ET for a panel on inflation, jobs, and the economy featuring reporters Paul LaMonica, Phil Mattingly, Christine Romans and Vanessa Yurkevich.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nHome owners, renters and potential buyers look at housing and the real estate market from different, often conflicting perspectives.\n\nThere are alarming headlines for all three in recent weeks:\n\nThis convergence speaks to the larger problem of a shortage of affordable housing in the US, as well as the broad issue of affordability, and leads to stories like this: Majority of Americans say they’re worried about being able to pay for housing.\n\nI went to Anna Bahney, the CNN Business writer focused on real estate, to understand why there’s a housing shortage and what, if anything, anyone is doing about it.\n\nOur conversation, conducted by email, is below.\n\nA housing shortage, an affordability crisis\n\nWHAT MATTERS: I have read both that there’s a housing shortage and that there’s a housing crisis. Is there a difference between those ideas – a shortage and a crisis? And is the problem that there literally aren’t enough houses for the number of people in the US?\n\nBAHNEY: The “housing crisis” is actually an “affordability crisis.” Part of the reason housing has become so expensive for Americans is because there is a national shortage of homes. Record low interest rates during the pandemic coupled with more than a decade of under building created a supply and demand mismatch that has pushed home prices higher.\n\nThe US has fallen behind by about 5.5 million housing units over the past 20 years as builders failed to keep up with historical building trends. If you add in property destruction due to demolition or natural disasters, among other things, the total shortfall could be 6.8 million during that time, according to the National Association of Realtors.\n\nThis is a gap so deep that it would take more than a decade to catch up. But even if more homes and apartments are built, it won’t matter unless people can afford them.\n\nMortgage rates are the highest they have been since 2008 and home prices remain near record highs, pricing many prospective homebuyers out of the market. Those people then remain in the already tight rental market, pushing rents up even further.\n\nAs tenants reach the limits of what they can afford to pay each month, homeownership gets further out of reach as they struggle to save for a down payment. This widens the wealth gap and locks in place inequities between those who benefit financially from homeownership and those who don’t. It also widens the racial home ownership gap, in which 72% of White Americans are homeowners while only 43% of Black Americans own a home.\n\nThe cost of housing is driving inflation\n\nWHAT MATTERS: The cost of housing has been cited as a cause of inflation. To what extent is that true and what is the market force that could lower the cost of housing?\n\nBAHNEY: The soaring cost of housing has been a key driver of inflation. For most people, housing is their biggest expense. About one-third of the Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses to track inflation, is the “shelter” component.\n\nLast month, the index showed that inflation was worse than expected and the housing component had risen 6.2% from a year ago, the biggest increase since 1991. Stubbornly high inflation means that the Federal Reserve will likely take aggressive action at its meeting next week with either a 75 basis-point hike in interest rates, or potentially a 100 basis-point hike.\n\nBut there are some early signs of cooling in the housing market. Home sales have been dropping for six months in a row as the rising cost to buy and finance a home pushes more people out of the housing market. As demand dries up, prices will come down and eventually mortgage rates will settle.\n\nWhere is the housing shortage felt the worst?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Which parts of the country are most affected by this problem?\n\nBAHNEY: Cities in the Sun Belt like Phoenix and Austin saw some of the biggest increases in housing costs during the pandemic. In Miami the price of a home is up 33% from a year ago, and rents are up 26% from last year. But the affordability crisis is happening nationally, in all regions of the country.\n\nThe median-priced house now costs $749 more per month\n\nWHAT MATTERS: The Fed’s medicine for inflation is to raise interest rates, which has driven up mortgage rates. That might control sales prices, but won’t it make the cost of housing more expensive?\n\nBAHNEY: The Federal Reserve has been aggressively raising interest rates in order to stem inflation, which may reduce demand but also makes the cost of buying a home even more expensive.\n\nBut the Fed doesn’t set the rate borrowers pay on mortgages directly. Instead, mortgage rates tend to track the yield on the 10-year US Treasury. As investors anticipate the Fed’s rate hikes, they often sell government bonds, which sends yields higher and, with it, mortgage rates.\n\nThe rate on a typical 30-year-fixed mortgage has more than doubled from a year ago, making a home purchase that was possible then, out of reach for some today.\n\nA year ago, a buyer who put 20% down on a median priced $359,900 home and financed the rest with a mortgage rate of 2.86% – which was the average at the time – had a monthly payment of $1,192.\n\nToday, a homeowner buying the median priced home, which is now $403,800, with a mortgage at the current average of 6.02%, would pay $1,941 a month in principal and interest. That’s $749 more every month.\n\nAmericans are now spending more than 35% of their median income on monthly principal and interest payments on that median-priced home. Historically, Americans spent closer to 25% of their median income on payments.\n\nTo get back to that level, some combination of these things would need to happen, according to mortgage data company Black Knight: a person’s income would need to grow by 40%, mortgage rates would have to be cut in half, or there would need to be a 30% drop in the median price of a house.\n\nNone of those are likely to happen any time soon.\n\nHomeownership is getting out of reach\n\nWHAT MATTERS: If housing prices go down, it will mean millions of people lose value in their main asset. If housing prices don’t go down, it means millions of Americans will never own a home. It seems like an impossible situation.\n\nBAHNEY: Some housing economists have been saying lately that the housing industry is in a recession, but homeowners aren’t feeling that way. Sure, there are plenty of examples of cooling in the housing industry (mortgage firm layoffs, home builders pulling back, home sales falling). But homeowners still have tremendous equity in their homes, which has risen by an average of $60,000 in the past year.\n\nStill, millions of people are being shut out of homebuying as the affordability challenges prove insurmountable.\n\nIn April 2021, a household had to earn about $80,000 a year to afford payments on the median-priced home with a modest down payment of 3.5%. A year later, the income requirement was $108,000. This cost increase means that about 4 million renter households that could have bought the median-priced home last year could no longer do so 12 months later.\n\nHow can this problem be fixed?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: What are some of the ideas to fix this problem? Is there an effective way the government can act?\n\nBAHNEY: Most housing policy experts say that building a steady supply of new, moderately priced homes is job number one. But because those homes are not as profitable for builders as larger, higher-priced homes, it will take a concerted effort by both public and private sectors.\n\nIn May, the Biden administration announced a Housing Supply Action Plan to close the affordability gap and ease housing costs. The plan aims to boost the supply of affordable housing by enhancing existing federal financing and incentivizing areas to reform zoning and land use policies to build more lower-cost housing. It also calls for homebuilders to adopt more efficient construction methods.\n\nBut none of this is a quick fix, and some of it requires congressional action.\n\nSeparately, the Federal Housing Finance Administration, which oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has announced plans this summer to expand home financing options for buyers, particularly those of color, to close the racial homeownership gap. These programs include down payment assistance, lower mortgage insurance premiums and a credit reporting system that factors in rent payment history.\n\nSome of these ideas, including new zero down payment loans with no closing costs for buyers in specific Black or Hispanic neighborhoods, are already in place.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

In addition to writing a book, Vance is a venture capitalist and military veteran.\n\nVance criticized past and current lawmakers from both parties for decisions he said have enriched politicians and weakened the middle class.\n\n\"Our leaders decided we didn't need to make things anymore. It was a very explicit decision,\" Vance said as several people nodded their heads in agreement.\n\nHe continued: \"They decided we would trade all good middle class jobs in factories and industries for a bunch of cheap plastic garbage from the Chinese.\n\n\"It made us weak and it made us dependent on regimes that didn't like us.\"\n\nVance said he supports imposing tariffs on U.S. companies to dissuade them from sending manufacturing jobs overseas and retain middle class jobs.\n\nNo regrets for Ukraine stance\n\nVance said he has no regrets for his stance on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which drew some backlash, but has since changed slightly.\n\nOn Feb. 19, Vance shared on Steve Bannon's podcast that he does not think it should be U.S. government policy to care what happens in Ukraine.\n\n\"I do care about the fact that in my community right now the leading cause of death among 18-45 year-olds is Mexican fentanyl that's coming across the southern border,\" Vance said then.\n\nVance, acknowledging his opinion is not popular, said after the forum Wednesday night that he still does not think the invasion should be \"a matter of government policy.\"\n\n\"I think people, as individuals, we can express concern, we can pray at our churches and we can even donate resources,\" he said. \"I still don't think it's in our vital national interest.\"\n\nHe said he would rather see some of the $13.6 billion in aid to Ukraine that the U.S. House approved this week be spent on securing the southern border.\n\nHe wants to see former President Donald Trump's border wall finished to slow down the illegal shipment of fentanyl products into the U.S. \"The walls work.\"\n\nVance also wants the Mexican drug cartel to be labeled terrorist organizations.\n\nVoting rights and abortion\n\nThe forum included a Q&A session for potential voters and they didn't shy away. Topics discussed included election integrity, abortion and stocks.\n\nVance said all members of Congress should be barred from buying or selling individual stocks while in office but said many current lawmakers object to the idea.\n\nHe also reassured one man that the 2022 mid-term election — at least, in Ohio — will be safe.\n\nVance, a Christian convert, is against abortion and said the procedure destroys the \"soul of the country.\"\n\n\"If we don't have our own families, our own children ... we are eventually going to be a fallen civilization.\"\n\nDid he convince voters?\n\nAfter listening to Vance, Bloom and his wife said they remain open to all five candidates but Vance grabbed their attention.\n\n\"I think our country is at a tipping point,\" Bloom said. \"I worry about our politicians. I think they sell us out at every turn and I'm hoping J.D. Vance will be different.\"\n\nJim Stegner of Louisville also liked Vance, but he admittedly does not trust the government and those in it.\n\n\"I didn't disagree with hardly anything (Vance said),\" he said.

Vance in a Republican Senate primary in Ohio, despite objections from other GOP members that Vance is a turncoat who could lose the fall election.\n\n\"Like some others, J.D. Vance may have said some not so great things about me in the past, but he gets it now, and I have seen that in spades,\" Trump said in a statement endorsing Vance. \"He is our best chance for victory in what could be a very tough race.\"\n\nThe winner of the Ohio Republican primary on May 3 will likely face U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, in the fall.\n\nTrump made his choice even though numerous Ohio Republicans publicly urged him not to support Vance, citing his low poll numbers and the fact that he opposed Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nAfter the 2016 publication of his book \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" a memoir about the problems in the Appalachian area where he grew up, Vance described Trump as \"cultural heroin\" and a demagogue who was leading \"the white working class to a very dark place.”\n\nVance later became a fan of Trump and said Friday he is \"incredibly honored\" to have the ex-president's endorsement.\n\nPredicting Trump would reclaim the presidency in 2024, Vance said on Twitter that \"he was an incredible fighter for hard working Americans in the White House, he will be again, and I'll fight for the America First Agenda in the Senate.\"\n\nUncertainty in Ohio: Donald Trump doesn't want to back a loser in Ohio Senate race. But he hasn't found a winner\n\nThe state of Ohio: 'Rough and tumble politics': Senate primary in Ohio shows shifting tone among GOP candidates\n\nCalifornia at a crossroads?:Is one of the bluest states in the US, at a turning point over crime, homelessness?\n\nTrump's announcement capped more than 24 hours of uncertainty surrounding his Ohio intentions.\n\nAfter hearing that Trump was planning to endorse Vance, dozens of Ohio Republican officials put together a letter urging Trump not to take such a step. They and others referenced Vance's low standing in pre-election polls and past attacks on Trump and his supporters.\n\n“While we were working hard in Ohio to support you and Make America Great Again, JD Vance was actively working against your candidacy,\" the letter said.\n\nThe crowded Ohio Senate primary features five Republicans who are bunched within 15 percentage points of each other, according to an average of polls compiled by the RealClearPolitics website.\n\nVance's opponents include three prominent party members who also sought Trump's support: Josh Mandel, former legislator and state treasurer; Mike Gibbons, a businessman; and Jane Timken, former state GOP party chair. The fifth candidate, businessman Matt Dolan, is running as an anti-Trump candidate.\n\nAs Trump announced his endorsement, Vance placed third in the RealClearPolitics averaging of recent polls at 14%, trailing Mandel (21%) and Gibbons (19.3%).\n\nThe endorsement sets up an interesting test of Trump's influence: Vance has not led any major polls in the Ohio race.\n\nThe impact of a Trump endorsement will be felt soon. His candidates are competing in a series of Republican primaries to be held in May, including such pivotal states as Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia, as well as Ohio.\n\nTrump alluded to the fracas over his Ohio endorsement in his written statement, saying this was not an easy selection to make \"because I like and respect some of the other candidates in the race.\"\n\nSaying he studied the race \"closely,\" Trump said he believes Vance would be the best debater among the GOP candidates, while supporting his positions on issues like immigration, policing, trade, and China.\n\n\"Unlike so many other pretenders and wannabes,\" Trump said of Vance, \"he will put America First.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/28/midterms-2022-jd-vance-senate-candidate-ohio/7042631001/", "title": "J.D.

Vance, lifting the venture capitalist and conservative commentator to the top of the polls, and then to victory.\n\nVance, who has never held public office, bested a field of Republicans that included an ex-state treasurer, a former head of the Ohio GOP and others, most of whom had vied for Trump’s support.\n\nVance burst onto the political media scene when his memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" about growing up in a small Midwest town made him a media voice of the white working-class during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBillionaire investor Peter Thiel contributed at least $10 million to a super PAC supporting Vance, who also had the backing of several conservatives in Congress.\n\nTrump's support, though, appeared to put Vance over the top. He surged in the polls after winning the Trump endorsement derby that had consumed the race for the better part of a year.\n\nIn November, the GOP Senate nominee will square off against longtime Congressman Tim Ryan, who cruised to the Democratic nomination.\n\nOhio primary election recap:Trump-endorsed Vance wins GOP Senate race; Ryan tops Democrats\n\nDemocratic nominee:What to know about Tim Ryan, the congressman running for Senate in Ohio\n\nThink Congress is too partisan now?:Primaries could magnify division as the number of swing districts shrinks\n\nWho is JD Vance?\n\nVance has a few titles.\n\nHe is a venture capitalist who runs Narya, an Ohio-based venture capital firm he founded and launched in 2020 for startups around the country.\n\nHe got his start in the venture capital world at Mithril Capital, an investment firm co-founded by Thiel, a Republican super-donor who was an early investor in Facebook. Vance has held top positions in venture capital funds, including Revolution LLC.\n\nBut Vance’s real claim to fame is his career as a conservative commentator, which was ignited by the success of his 2016 memoir, a New York Times bestseller. Cable news shows frequently booked Vance for appearances during the 2016 election.\n\nHe has kept his political celebrity, amassing close to 200,000 followers on Twitter in the time since. He became a vocal supporter of Trump, despite criticizing him before the election, and remains a network TV regular.\n\nHow old is JD Vance?\n\nVance was born on August 2, 1984. He is 37 years old.\n\nWhere is JD Vance from?\n\nVance was born and raised in Middletown, Ohio, a small town of less than 50,000 residents near Cincinnati and Dayton.\n\nWhat does JD stand for?\n\nJ.D. are initials for James David.\n\nWhere does JD Vance live?\n\nVance is based in Cincinnati, according to his Twitter profile.\n\nWhat is JD Vance's net worth?\n\nOnline reports show varying and unconfirmed figures for Vance’s net worth, but his Senate financial disclosure provides some insight into his wealth and earnings.\n\nAccording to the report, Vance earned more than $1 million in non-investment income, including a $408,000 salary from Nayra and $347,000 in royalties from his memoir.\n\nThe report lists more than 100 investments with their total value ranging from $4 million to $10 million. Congressional guidelines allow candidates and lawmakers to report their wealth using wide ranges rather than specific values.\n\nWho is JD Vance running against?\n\nAfter winning the Republican primary, Vance will go up against Ryan, a longtime Ohio congressman, in the general midterm election in November.\n\nWhat is JD Vance’s platform?\n\nVance’s campaign outlines thirteen issues.\n\nThe main economic issues include revitalizing American manufacturing and addressing inflation. His platform suggests raising taxes on large corporations that do business overseas while cutting taxes for small American businesses.\n\nAnother of his key issues is immigration. Vance wants to finish building Trump’s wall and increase the number of Border Patrol agents. His campaign released a controversial TV ad that opens with Vance sarcastically asking viewers \"Are you a racist? Do you hate Mexicans,\" before decrying the press, which Vance says calls supporters of Trump's wall racist.\n\nAccording to his campaign, Vance would oppose amnesty for undocumented migrants in the United States and favor a more stringent merit-based immigration system than is in place already.\n\nOther promises involve some of the hot-button conservative issues that have taken shape in the Biden era. Vance says he will support cutting funding to universities that teach critical race theory or “radical gender ideology” and break up big tech companies, which Vance says censor conservatives.\n\nVance also opposes abortion, favors gun rights, and supports further voting requirements such as showing identification to vote and ending expanded mail-in voting.\n\nWho has endorsed JD Vance?\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Rep.

It details his childhood in Middletown, Ohio, and joining the Marines before pursuing an education at Ohio State University and Yale Law School.\n\nThe book was made into a 2020 Netflix film starring Amy Adams.\n\nWho is JD Vance’s wife?\n\nVance married a fellow Yale Law School classmate, Usha Chilukuri Vance, a lawyer at Munger, Tolles & Olson. She clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts from 2017 to 2018 and for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh from 2014 to 2015, when Kavanaugh was a federal district judge. Vance and Chilukuri have two children together.\n\nWhat are JD Vance’s views on Ukraine?\n\nVance made headlines in February when he said “I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another,” on former Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s podcast, just days before Putin launched his invasion. Vance said he thought Joe Biden should focus on border security at the U.S.-Mexico border, and not Ukraine’s border.\n\nVance doubled down on this sentiment as the war in Ukraine broke out.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/19/politics/ohio-senate-gop-debate-2022-josh-mandel-mike-gibbons/index.html", "title": "Ohio GOP Senate debate: Two candidates get in each other's faces ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTwo candidates in the pivotal Republican Senate primary in Ohio got in each other’s faces Friday night in a heated exchange during a debate.\n\nTempers flared onstage after former state Treasurer Josh Mandel accused investment banker Mike Gibbons of “making billions” by moving Ohio businesses to China and owning stock in Chinese oil.\n\nGibbons denied the claims, saying he “personally didn’t buy the stock” and telling Mandel he “may not understand this” because “you’ve never been in the private sector in your entire life.”\n\nMandel then rose out of his seat, and the two men began talking over each other in raised voices. Mandel, who served in the Marine Corps Reserve, told Gibbons, “Two tours in Iraq, don’t tell me I haven’t worked.”\n\n“You don’t know squat,” Gibbons responded. “Back off, buddy.”\n\n“You back off,” Mandel fired back. “You watch what happens.”\n\nModerator and conservative radio host Brandon Boxer stepped in to break the two men up.\n\nThe eruption represents the latest episode in what has become a bitter GOP primary in Ohio to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Rob Portman. Mandel and Gibbons, along with author J.D. Vance and former state GOP chair Jane Timken, have aligned themselves with former President Donald Trump, who has not yet endorsed a candidate and is unsure about whether he should. Both Vance and Timken, along with state Sen. Matt Dolan, participated in Friday night’s candidate forum in Gahanna, Ohio, hosted by right-leaning advocacy group FreedomWorks.\n\nThe barbs between Gibbons and Mandel continued offstage through their campaigns.\n\n“Josh Mandel is unhinged, unfit and flailing – because he’s losing,” Gibbons campaign spokesperson Samantha Cotton said in a statement. “He doesn’t have the temperament, experience, or fortitude to be a U.S. Senator and Ohio voters got a first-hand look at just how unprepared Josh Mandel has become and that will be reflected on the ballot on May 3.”\n\nScott Guthrie, Mandel’s campaign manager, said in a statement Friday that Gibbons “got upset tonight that he was called out for his investments in Chinese oil.”\n\n“He claims not to remember the investment, but it’s part of a pattern of Gibbons entire career making money by taking American companies and selling them to foreign interests,” Guthrie said.\n\nAn exasperated Vance, author of the best-selling book “Hillbilly Elegy” and himself a Marine veteran, blasted the showdown between Gibbons and Mandel as “ridiculous.”\n\n“I think the way you use the US Marine Corps, Josh, is disgraceful. It’s not a political football for you to toss around. Think about what we just saw. This guy wants to be US senator,” Vance said onstage.\n\nThe tone of the forum started out in a more civil manner with Dolan, the only candidate in the race who has focused more narrowly on policy than on courting Trump, telling the audience he knew they had to make a difficult choice in the upcoming primary election. “We are asking you to choose between family and friends,” he said, gesturing to his opponents onstage.\n\nCandidates addressed the war in Ukraine, how to deal with China, regulating big tech, and rooting out anti-racism education in public schools.\n\nThe Ohio Democratic Party reacted to the GOP debate, saying, “We encourage every voter to watch this forum and see for themselves why these Republicans do not deserve to be in the United States Senate.”\n\nThe winner of the Ohio Republican primary would be favored in the November general election in a state Trump won by 8 points in 2020.

The venture capitalist is best known for his memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" which depicts his family's struggles in Appalachian Kentucky and his mother's addiction during his childhood in Middletown.\n\nOther Republican candidates who are eager to secure Trump's endorsement have been quick to highlight their opponent's past. Vance called Trump \"noxious\" and \"reprehensible\" in 2016 and ultimately voted for independent Evan McMullin that year.\n\nHe also isn't registered as a Republican in Ohio because he didn't vote in the 2018 or 2020 primaries.\n\n\"Not only do we welcome to the race, we welcome him to the Republican Party,\" said Wes Farno, a senior advisor for Mike Gibbons' Senate campaign. \"He's come a long way since voting for third party candidate Evan MacMullin in an attempt to elect Hillary Clinton in 2016, and our party should be open to converts. We just shouldn't elect them to the Senate.\"\n\nVance has since deleted some tweets that were critical of Trump but said that's nothing new for him.

He said people who don't believe the country works for them are too often put down and pledged to bring a new kind of politics to the Senate.\n\n\"You have leaders of this country, in government and in business, who don’t think they owe anything to the country that made them who they are,\" he said.\n\nVance joins a slew of other Republicans clamoring for the chance to replace retiring Sen. Rob Portman, including former Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken, former state treasurer Josh Mandel, car dealer Bernie Moreno and investment banker Mike Gibbons. Running so far on the Democratic side is U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan.\n\nVance, 36, of East Walnut Hills, is a difficult candidate to pin down. He can often be seen on Fox News or voicing conservative talking points on Twitter, including a recent tweet about \"wokeness\" impacting popular culture.\n\nThe Middletown High School graduate is best known for his memoir depicting his family's struggles in Appalachian Kentucky and his mother's addiction during his childhood in Middletown. \"Hillbilly Elegy\" was pitched as an insightful look into why former President Donald Trump won the 2016 election.\n\nBut in the years since, which have included a feature-length movie based on Vance's book, natives of Appalachia have criticized Vance's take as inaccurate and exploitative. Vance's \"pull yourself by your bootstraps\" credo was overly simplistic, they argued. Practically speaking, Middletown isn't located in Appalachia.\n\nVance served in the Marines and graduated from Ohio State University and Yale Law School.\n\nSupporters who gathered Thursday to cheer on Vance's announcement said they appreciated his perspective on economic issues and wanted to support a candidate with local ties.\n\n\"I just like the way he handles himself,\" said Bob McConnell, a Middletown resident who said he knows Vance's family well.\n\nThe Trump question\n\nVance has a complicated history with Trump, which could prove challenging as he seeks to woo Republican voters in a state the former president won in 2020.\n\nHe was publicly critical of Trump during the 2016 election cycle — calling him \"noxious in an interview with NPR — and ultimately voted for independent Evan McMullin that year. He cast Trump supporters as unmarried, uneducated and less likely to attend church.\n\n\"Trump makes people I care about afraid,\" Vance said in October 2016. \"Immigrants, Muslims, etc. Because of this I find him reprehensible.\"\n\nThis year, by contrast, Vance courted Trump at Mar-a-Lago and attended his rally in Lorain County in the hope of securing his support.

While the Republican race is far murkier – author J.D. Vance is seen as the front-runner after securing former President Donald Trump’s endorsement, but a range of candidates are vying for an upset – Ryan is preparing to accomplish a markedly more difficult task in November: Running as a Democrat in a red-trending state in a likely difficult election cycle for the party.\n\nFor years, Ohio Democrats have looked to assure national party officials that the state is not a lost cause, but elections after elections have complicated that pitch. No Democrat other than Sen. Sherrod Brown has won nonjudicial statewide office in Ohio since 2008, and President Barack Obama, in 2012, was the last Democratic presidential nominee to win Ohio. In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden became the first candidate in the last 60 years to win the White House without winning the state.\n\nThe trends have left many Democrats wondering if it is even worth vying for statewide office in the Buckeye State anymore, effectively writing off a state once seen as a key political bellwether.\n\nThe blame, said Ryan, lies with the same national Democrats now casting Ohio as a lost cause.\n\n“We have not done a good job as a party of letting people know that we’re fighting for them and haven’t done the policies over the years that we necessarily needed to be done. And so, a lot of Democrats in key counties, drifted away,” said Ryan, who is making his first statewide run.\n\nRyan’s political story, in many ways, is the story of Ohio. The Democrat was first elected to Congress in 2002, representing a Northeast Ohio district that included his hometown of Niles, along with union-heavy Democratic bastions Youngstown and Warren. While Ryan initially dominated in his races – including in his home county of Trumbull – his margins began to fall as Republican strength in Ohio grew. In 2020, Ryan won with just 53% of the vote, his lowest showing in his district since his first election in 2002 (when his Democratic predecessor, James Traficant, ran as an independent and siphoned off 15% of the vote).\n\nThe shift was most stark in Trumbull County. Throughout much of Ryan’s term, Democratic presidential candidates won around 60% of the vote there – until Trump ran for president. In 2016, Trump surprised Ohio’s political world by winning Trumbull County by 6 points. He followed that up four years later by carrying the county by 10 points.\n\nTo Dan Polivka, chairman of the Trumbull County Democratic Party, Trump was a sign of how a slow political shift could speed up in just a few cycles.\n\n“The national issues got trickled down on some of the local elections,” Polivka said of 2016 and 2020. “I still think there is a Democratic base here and a lot of support for a good Democrat. But the national issues now trickle down locally and that never happened before.”\n\nRyan has been eyeing a jump from the House for years. After winning another term in 2018, he explored a presidential run, eventually making it official in 2019. The bid was short-lived – Ryan only qualified for two Democratic primary debates due to low polling and his run ended less than a year after it began.\n\n‘I’ve got my own record’\n\nTo Ohio Democrats, there is plenty of blame to go around to explain the state’s shift.\n\nFormer Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, one of two Democrats running for governor this year, said she recently sought to reassure operatives at the Democratic Governors Association that Ohio was still winnable for the right Democratic candidate.\n\n“I think my husband says it best: Democrats like to run resumes, not run people that are really connected to humans,” Whaley said. “That is what we have done for a long time. We have run really smart guys and not people who are connected to the working class.”\n\nWhaley lauded Ryan’s appeal to working-class voters, arguing that she had the same appeal to voters in the Eastern reaches of the state.\n\n“We’re both from communities that are forgotten and ignored, both by state government and federally,” Whaley said. “We are both from places that are forgotten and ignored. We both have a working-class chip on our shoulder.”\n\nAs Ryan looks at his chances in November, the issues are both personal and atmospheric.\n\nFor years, he has been one of the highest-profile Democratic elected officials in Ohio. But Ryan is largely unknown outside his corner of Ohio, something he has attempted to address by completing an 88-county tour over his first year as a Senate candidate.\n\nAnd Ryan is making his first statewide run at a time when unified Democratic control of Washington has soured voters, in Ohio and nationwide, on the party.\n\nRyan is confident he has the kind of profile Ohioans are looking for. When asked about running as a Democrat in this moment, he touted his past actions, such as running against Nancy Pelosi for House Democratic leader in 2016, quarreling with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during Ryan’s ill-fated presidential bid and opposing then-President Obama over trade policy in 2015. He then noted that while he took on Trump, he also stood by him on trade, the creation of the Space Force and combating China.\n\n“I’ve got my own record,” Ryan said. “I’ve been doing this a while, and so I’m not as tied to the Biden agenda only because I’ve got a 20-year record of doing things. … I’ve got a really good story to share with the Ohio voters that’s not tied to Biden. And so, I’ve got some room.”\n\nRyan put this message in a recent television ad, in which he blamed “both parties” for “wasting time on stupid fights.” That, for Ryan, is where the Republican Senate primary comes in.\n\nThat contest has been fierce. Before Trump endorsed Vance, most of the candidates were openly gunning for the former President’s backing, trading attacks over who best represented the MAGA agenda. Once Trump lent his support to Vance, the contest became a microcosm of the fight for the Republican Party, with several outside groups drawing Trump’s ire for backing former Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel and a candidate in the form of state Sen. Matt Dolan accusing his opponents of debasing themselves to seek the former President’s backing.\n\n“You know, the Columbus TV station doesn’t just go to Republicans,” Ryan said, joking that a range of voters, from moderate Republicans to Democrats, have been activated by what he called a “divisive” GOP primary that focused on “very narrow issues.”\n\nNo matter who emerges from the Republican primary, Ryan plans to run on the economic populist issues he believes can still win over voters who backed Trump just two years ago. That path looks like this: Focus on economics, avoid culture wars that Republicans want to highlight and be prepared to stand up to your own party.\n\nCentral to that plan is also standing up to China, something that has drawn the ire of Asian American groups, who recently accused Ryan of using a 30-second ad to push “sinophobic rhetoric” that pits “nativists against those within the #AAPI community.”\n\n“It is us versus China, and instead of taking them on, Washington is wasting our time on stupid fights,” Ryan says in the ad.\n\nRyan has not backed away from the controversy and told CNN that the response worries him that Democrats aren’t prepared to do what is needed to win in a state like Ohio.\n\n“This is the competition,” Ryan said. “And if we can’t have a national conversation about the red China communist government trying to displace us, looking the other way when Russia invades Ukraine and trying to outfox us at every turn … then we’re all going to be speaking Mandarin in 10 or 15 years.”", "authors": ["Dan Merica"], "publish_date": "2022/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/17/trump-in-youngstown-ohio-saturday-to-stump-for-senate-candidate-j-d-vance-hillbilly-elegy-tim-ryan/69486954007/", "title": "Trump in Ohio holds rally for U.S. Senate candidate J.D.

Vance clearly doesn’t give a damn about the Buckeyes — but this isn’t the first time he’s shown that he’s more comfortable ignoring Ohioans than tailgating in Columbus,” Ryan campaign spokesperson Jordan Fuja said in a prepared statement.\n\nTrump quickly pivoted to talking about the upcoming election.\n\n“Less than two months from now, the people of Ohio are going to vote and fire the radical left Democrats,\" Trump said.\n\nHe said that the choice in November is between voting for Democrats — assuring the continued “destruction” of America — or voting for Republicans in order to save the country.\n\n\"The radical Democrat Congress has turned our country into a sanctuary for dangerous criminals,\" Trump said.\n\nDebunked stolen election claim among familiar themes in Trump's Ohio rally speech\n\nTrump said the American dream was being shredded, using the recent poor performance of the stock market as an example.\n\nDuring his hour-long speech, Trump touched on his perceived persecution and the Afghanistan withdrawal. He also reiterating the debunked claim that the 2020 presidential election was rigged — \"I ran twice, and won twice,\" he said — and criticized immigration along America's southern border. He called for the death penalty for drug dealers and human traffickers.\n\nMoving on to the election, Trump accused Ryan of being a radical leftist who has been lying about being a moderate. He also attacked Ryan over his support for taking action against climate change.\n\n\"A vote for Tim Ryan is a vote for extinguishing America's future,\" Trump said. \"The entire MAGA movement is for J.D. Vance.\"\n\nTrump invited Vance on stage with him to say a few words.\n\nVance is running against Ryan for the seat being vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Rob Portman. Trump last visited Ohio in April to rally supporters behind the \"Hillbilly Elegy\" author amid a divisive GOP primary that surfaced Vance's past criticisms of the former president.\n\n\"[Ryan's] whole attack on me is that I'm out of state, from California, even though the reason I left the state when I was 18 years old was to enlist in the United States Marine Corps and go and serve my country,\" said Vance. \"Tim Ryan has not one, but two books on yoga and meditation. Tim Ryan has called to ban gas powered cars, and Tim Ryan has voted for the Green New Deal. Who's from California, Tim? It sounds like you are.\"\n\nVance then called for the firing of 87,000 newly hired IRS agents and a mass hiring of border patrol agents.\n\nCrowd reaction\n\nAlice Marshall, a Youngstown resident, said she came to Covelli Centre because the country needs to change.\n\n\"Trump, Vance, really, and the people that have a good heart are going to change this nation back to what the Constitution is, and back to the legal way it's supposed to be,\" Marshall said.\n\nHer impressions of Vance are positive despite his previous remarks critical of Trump.\n\n\"That man is so bright,\" she said of Vance.\n\nJo Ellen of Sandusky, on the other hand, was a little more lukewarm on Vance. She said she hasn't done enough research on him to have an opinion one way or another, but she has heard some negative opinion.\n\n\"(I've heard) conflicting reports that he's one of the good guys, that he's one of the bad guys that can't be trusted, that he's a RINO (Republican in name only) — I don't know,\" said Ellen. She's not at the rally to have her mind made up, though.\n\nEllen said she was at the rally for two reasons: \"I'm here to support Trump, and to boo loudly when he says he endorsed (Gov. Mike) DeWine.\"\n\nSenate rate in a virtual tie\n\nDuring the rally, Vance shared his story of growing up with the crowd. He grew up in Middletown, an Ohio city that shares some of the same history as Youngstown.\n\n\"When the jobs moved out, the drugs moved into my family,\" Vance said, \"so I was raised by my working-class grandparents.\" He said that Ohio has been good to him, presenting him with the opportunity to represent the Republican party.\n\nVance moved to attacking Ryan, saying that there are two versions of the candidate. The first is the version presented to the voters, who plays at being a moderate. The second is who he calls \"D.C. Tim, who votes 100% of the time with Joe Biden.\"\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, we need to kick D.C Tim to the curb, make him go back home and get a real job for once,\" Vance said to cheers and applause. \"I've got to say, ladies and gentleman, that's exactly what we're going to do.\"\n\nThe event could provide Vance with additional momentum as the race attracts national attention and heads into its final weeks. Groups such as the Senate Leadership Fund are pouring money into Ohio to boost Vance, who has trailed behind Ryan in fundraising. Republicans also expressed concern over the summer that Vance wasn't campaigning enough and allowing his opponent to dominate the airwaves.\n\nUSA Today Opinion:If Republicans don't regain the Senate, there's one person to blame: Donald Trump\n\nA USA TODAY Network Ohio/Suffolk University poll released Monday showed the candidates virtually tied, with Ryan leading Vance 46.6% to 45.6% of voters.\n\nThe rally also came days after Trump endorsed DeWine, who is running for reelection against former Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley for governor. Trump didn't weigh in on the four-way primary for the GOP nomination, but the governor still won with 48% of the vote.\n\nDeWine was at the Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport Saturday evening to welcome Trump to Ohio and thank him for his endorsement, according to Tricia McLaughlin, DeWine campaign spokesman.\n\nHaley BeMiller from the USA TODAY Network Ohio State Bureau contributed to this report.\n\nGet more political analysis by listening to the Ohio Politics Explained podcast", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/08/politics/fact-check-jd-vance-capitol-charges/index.html", "title": "Fact check: J.D. Vance falsely claims dozens of jailed Capitol ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nJ.D. Vance, a Republican candidate for a US Senate seat in Ohio, is a law school graduate. But Vance made a significant false claim on Thursday about legal proceedings against people who allegedly participated in the Capitol insurrection last year.\n\nOn the first anniversary of the January 6, 2021 riot, Vance tweeted out a link to a website that encourages donations to people who have been accused of involvement in the attack on the Capitol. And Vance wrote: “There are dozens of people who protested on J6 who haven’t even been charged with a crime yet are being mistreated in DC prisons. A friend suggested the below link if you’re able to support them.”\n\nIn another tweet moments later, Vance claimed that many of the prisoners are military veterans who have been “accused of nothing.”\n\nFacts First: Vance’s claims are false. Every alleged Capitol rioter who is being held in jail to await trial has been charged with a crime. Moreover, every one of the dozens of defendants listed on the very donations page Vance was promoting has been charged with a crime.\n\nMore than 90 minutes after his false tweets, Vance appeared to implicitly concede that he wasn’t correct to claim that dozens of Capitol riot prisoners “haven’t even been charged with a crime” – posting a new tweet that read, “*convicted (not charged).” But Vance did not delete either that false initial tweet or the false subsequent tweet claiming the prisoners have been “accused of nothing,” and he did not explicitly say that he had been wrong.\n\nA Vance campaign spokesman had not responded as of Friday night to a CNN request for comment.\n\nVance graduated from Yale Law School in 2013. A venture capitalist best known as the author of the bestselling book “Hillbilly Elegy,” he had more than 172,000 Twitter followers as of Thursday.\n\nThe ‘political prisoners’ claim\n\nWe won’t attempt to fact-check Vance’s subjective claim that the jailed defendants are being “mistreated”; conditions at DC jail facilities are known to be poor in general. But there is no factual basis for his claim in another tweet in the thread that “these people are political prisoners.”\n\nThe vast majority of the 700-plus people who have been charged over the Capitol riot to date were released to await trial shortly after they were arrested. The dozens who have been kept in jail before trial are only being held because a federal judge – not the Biden administration – ruled that they are either too dangerous to release or pose a flight risk. Most of these defendants have been charged with attacking police or conspiring with far-right extremist groups. And when defendants have argued during their court cases that they are victims of politically motivated prosecution because they support former President Donald Trump, federal judges, including those appointed by Trump, have rejected these arguments.\n\nAs of late 2021, about 40 Capitol riot defendants were being held in jail in Washington, DC in particular. While Vance might have been using the word “prisons” informally, the defendants are being held before trial in a jail facility run by the DC government, not a federal prison; they would be transferred to prison if convicted and sentenced to prison time.\n\nThe website Vance promoted in his false tweet, called the “Patriot Freedom Project,” was created by a relative of one of the defendants who has spent time in the Washington jail – Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, a former Army reservist who was known as a white supremacist and Nazi sympathizer by colleagues at the Navy base where he had worked as a contractor.\n\nA Trump-appointed judge ruled that Hale-Cusanelli had to stay in jail to await trial, saying he was worried Hale-Cusanelli posed a threat of violence to members of the public. An appeals court then upheld Hale-Cusanelli’s detention.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Hannah Rabinowitz", "Daniel Dale", "Hannah Rabinowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/01/08"}]}

Readers can look forward to humorous, insider moments in the spotlight (like hitting Chevy Chase in the groin during a tennis match). But more notably, Perry's memoir is full of vulnerable, raw and painful revelations about an addiction recovery that took decades.\n\nWith candor and compassion, \"Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing\" displays Perry's dedication to continue fighting a near-fatal battle – not only for himself but for those similarly struggling.\n\n\"There is light in the darkness,\" Perry reassures readers in the prologue. \"You just have to look hard enough to find it.\"\n\nFrom the glitz and glamor of early \"Friends\" fame to life-threatening health scares, here are the biggest takeaways from Perry's debut book:\n\nMatthew Perry and Alcoholics Anonymous:Does the anonymity perpetuate a stigma?\n\nJennifer Aniston rejected Matthew Perry before 'Friends,' confronted him about substance use\n\n\"Friends\" chronicles the whirlwind romance of two best friends, Chandler Bing and Monica Geller (played by Courteney Cox). But in real life, the actor was crushing on another Central Perk companion: Jennifer Aniston.\n\nPrior to joining the hit sitcom in 1994, Perry says he met his co-star three years before \"Friends\" through mutual acquaintances. Ambitious and in awe of her beauty, he asked Aniston out on a date, which she respectfully declined – a memory that made their eventual reunion awkward for Perry, at first.\n\n\"Fairly early in the making of Friends I realized that I was still crushing badly on Jennifer Aniston,\" he writes. \"Our hellos and goodbyes became awkward. And then I'd ask myself, 'How long can I look at her? Is three seconds too long?'\"\n\nThrough the years, Perry was able to overcome his fleeting crush to establish a worthwhile (and platonic) friendship, especially after she started dating Brad Pitt. But as the \"Friends\" actor was struggling with alcoholism, which became noticeable on set, he experienced another awkward encounter with Aniston: when she confronted him about his drinking.\n\n\"'We can smell it,' she said, in a kind of weird but loving way, and the plural 'we' hit me like a sledgehammer,\" Perry writes, which prompted him to get a sober companion at work with him to start his road to recovery.\n\nPerry says he kissed Valerie Bertinelli – right next to Eddie Van Halen\n\nAs the title of his book implies, \"Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing\" includes humorous and entertaining anecdotes about Perry's past relationships and flings in Hollywood. But one celebrity crush he fondly remembers is Valerie Bertinelli, with whom he starred in the 1990 CBS sitcom \"Sydney.\"\n\nPerry, who was 19 at the time of the show, called his feelings for Bertinelli, then 30, \"real.\" They were so strong that he even \"harbored elaborate fantasies about her leaving Eddie Van Halen,\" her husband at the time.\n\n\"During filming, I fell madly in love with Valerie,\" Perry writes. \"There was no one more attractive than Valerie. Not only was she stunning and vivacious, but she also had this great, booming, adorable laugh.\"\n\nHis dreams later came true when he and Bertinelli allegedly shared an intimate kiss in her home, while Van Halen \"had enjoyed the fruits of the vine a little too hard … and eventually just passed out.\" However, his hopes of turning her into his girlfriend were thwarted when, the next day at work, she failed to acknowledge their night together.\n\nPerry clarifies that Bertinelli had \"done nothing wrong.\" But \"inside, I was devastated,\" he writes, adding that he was secretly \"grateful\" that the show was canceled four weeks later. \"I didn't have to see Valerie anymore.\"\n\n'Love isn't a big enough word':Valerie Bertinelli on Eddie Van Halen, writing 'cathartic' book\n\n'He knew how to live life': Partying with Bruce Willis proved difficult at times\n\nWhile his relationships with his \"Friends\" co-stars are well-known, Perry dedicates a whole chapter to his \"The Whole Nine Yards\" co-star, Willis, whom he calls a \"wonderful actor\" and more importantly, \"a good-hearted man.\"\n\nTheir bond, according to an initially starstruck Perry, was unexpected yet naturally strong. The two new best friends golfed, laughed and drank together, partying all night and through the early morning when they weren't filming.\n\n\"I was thrilled to be around him because he knew how to live life,\" Perry writes.\n\nBut as their late-night partying progressed, Perry was secretly struggling to catch up to Willis, who was a \"partier (while) I was an addict,\" and consequently relied on Xanax to counteract the alcohol.\n\n\"Bruce has an on-off button. He can party like crazy then get a script like 'The Sixth Sense' and stop partying and nail the movie sober.\"\n\nDespite the fun and spontaneity of their friendship, Perry more fondly remembers the end of their nights, when the sun was coming up and the party was over. They would sit and talk for hours, which opened Perry's eyes to the fact that along with being the life of the party or a memorable actor, Willis was also a \"good guy…and I would be his friend for life.\"\n\n\"I, of course, pray for him every night now,\" Perry writes of Willis, who stepped away from acting after being diagnosed with aphasia.\n\n'A really challenging time':Bruce Willis stepping away from acting after aphasia diagnosis\n\nWhy Perry's relationship with Roberts ended\n\nAs the TV star secretly battled drug and alcohol addictions, Perry acknowledges many loved ones he's unintentionally hurt along the way, including Roberts.\n\nThe two starred together in a 1996 \"Friends\" episode titled \"The One After the Superbowl,\" but their chemistry was just as real off-screen. According to Perry, Roberts would only agree to guest-star on the sitcom if she could be a part of Chandler Bing's plot – a request that surprised Perry.\n\nIn an attempt to woo her, Perry spent months courting the biggest movie star at the time with flower bouquets, flirty faxes and handwritten poems, which eventually captured her interest – both in appearing in the show and pursuing a romantic relationship behind the scenes.\n\nAround this time, however, Perry says he also was preoccupied in expanding his career while in the midst of struggling with drugs and alcohol again. As a result, he broke up with Roberts, which he did by announcing it on Jay Leno's show in April 1996.\n\n“Dating Julia Roberts had been too much for me. I had been constantly certain that she was going to break up with me,” Perry writes. “Why would she not? I was not enough; I could never be enough; I was broken, bent, unloveable. So instead of facing the inevitable agony of losing her, I broke up with the beautiful and brilliant Julia Roberts.”\n\nThe next time he \"saw\" his ex-girlfriend was in 2001, on television at a rehabilitation center. Perry was in the process of detoxing when he saw Roberts had won an Oscar for her performance in \"Erin Brockovich.\"\n\n\"I was incredibly happy for her,\" he recalls. \"As for me, I was just grateful to have made it one more day. When you are at the bottom, the days are long.\"\n\nPerry was 'high as a kite' when he proposed in 2020\n\nFor many, the unprecedented and isolating nature of the pandemic proved difficult, especially for Perry, who says he had a fear of being alone – stemming from low self-esteem and childhood issues. He says he temporarily escaped his insecurities and abandonment fears by spending more time with Molly Hurwitz, whom he started dating in 2018 and proposed to in November 2020.\n\n“I decided to get engaged,\" he told People at the time. \"Luckily, I happened to be dating the greatest woman on the face of the planet at this time.\"\n\nMatthew Perry is engaged!:'I happened to be dating the greatest woman on the face of the planet'\n\nHowever, Perry details why he called it off with his fiancée in June 2021. In his book, Perry reveals he was high on hydrocodone, an opioid used to treat pain, at the time of the proposal.\n\n“I bought her a ring because I was desperate that she would leave me. I didn’t want to be this injured and alone during Covid,” he writes, without naming Hurwitz explicitly. “I was high on 1,800 milligrams of hydrocodone when I asked her to marry me. I had even asked for her family’s blessing. Then I’d proposed, high as a kite. And on one knee. And she knew it too. And she said yes.”\n\nHe added that he decided to call off the engagement during his journey back to sobriety.\n\n\"I think, 'Wait ... how did I get engaged? There are dogs living in my house. How did this happen?” Perry continued. “I had asked her parents, begged for her hand while high, and put up with the dogs. That’s how scared I was of being abandoned.”\n\nThe near-death coma experience that motivated Perry to quit\n\nThroughout the book, Perry details an array of health complications stemming from his substance use, including alcohol-induced erectile dysfunction and pancreatitis at age 30. But one of the most eye-opening experiences in his journey was when he nearly died at age 49 after his colon exploded from opioid use.\n\nAs a result, the actor was in a coma, on life support, for two weeks. What followed was five months in the hospital and nine more with a colostomy bag – a traumatic experience that ultimately \"miraculously remove(d) my desire to take drugs.\"\n\n“My therapist said to me, ‘The next time you think about OxyContin, I want you to think about living out the rest of your days with a colostomy bag,'\" he writes. \"Having had a colostomy bag for nine long months, my therapist’s words hit hard. And when this man’s words hit hard, the prudent thing to do is to get into action immediately.\"\n\nToday, Perry says he is 18 months sober. Still, he is adjusted to \"how my body looks\" with all its scars from the numerous surgeries he's had. However, he is grateful to be alive and to finally share his story – with concerned \"Friends\" fans and addicts who face stigma and judgment.\n\n\"In the end, admitting defeat was winning,\" he concludes. \"Addiction, the big terrible thing, is far too powerful for anyone to defeat alone. But together, one day at a time, we can beat it down.\"\n\nIf your or someone you know is struggling with substance use disorders, you can call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357.

I never worked drunk. ‘I’ve been trying to hide it …’”\n\nElsewhere in the excerpt, Perry mentioned how he “never” worked high or drunk (although he “certainly worked hungover”), and he said he was largely able to function as part of the uber-successful “Friends” ensemble thanks to his castmates and how they would “group around [him] and prop [him] up” like an injured penguin being supported by the other penguins.\n\n“I was the injured penguin, but I was determined to not let these wonderful people, and this show, down,” he wrote.\n\nBut that day in Perry’s trailer, Aniston told him plainly that he wasn’t getting away with anything.\n\n“‘We can smell it,’ she said, in a kind of weird but loving way, and the plural ‘we’ hit me like a sledgehammer,” Perry wrote.\n\n“‘I know I’m drinking too much,’ I said, ‘but I don’t exactly know what to do about it.’”\n\nThe “Whole Nine Yards” star also describes in the new book how his weight fluctuated wildly due to the pills making him sick and alleviating his appetite, or alcohol causing him to be bloated.\n\n“You can track the trajectory of my addiction if you gauge my weight from season to season – when I’m carrying weight, it’s alcohol; when I’m skinny, it’s pills. When I have a goatee, it’s lots of pills.”\n\nPerry even referenced specific points in the hit show’s 10-season run and clued readers in to what was going on with his addiction at that time.\n\n“By the end of season three, I was spending most of my time figuring out how to get 55 Vicodin a day – I had to have 55 every day, otherwise I’d get so sick. It was a full-time job: making calls, seeing doctors, faking migraines, finding crooked nurses who would give me what I needed,” Perry wrote.\n\nThe actor recently said he is finally ready to share his experiences now that he is safely on the other side of addiction.\n\n“I wanted to share when I was safe from going into the dark side of everything again,” Perry told People of the book. “I had to wait until I was pretty safely sober – and away from the active disease of alcoholism and addiction – to write it all down. And the main thing was, I was pretty certain that it would help people.”\n\n“Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing,” by Matthew Perry, will be published by Headline on November 1.", "authors": ["Dan Heching"], "publish_date": "2022/10/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2021/12/30/usa-today-bestselling-book-2021-dav-pilkey-dog-man-the-four-winds-kristin-hannah-american-marxism/8999721002/", "title": "USA TODAY bestselling book of 2021: See the 100 most popular ...", "text": "2021 was a pretty good year for author Dav Pilkey. Not only is his children's book \"Dog Man: Mothering Heights\" USA TODAY's bestselling book of the year, but he also followed up the achievement with four more of his books landing in the Top 100 for 2021, more than any other author.\n\nIn addition to \"Mothering Heights,\" Pilkey earned top spots for \"Dog Man: Grime and Punishment\" at No. 32; \"Dog Man: For Whom the Ball Rolls\" at No. 81; \"Cat Kid Comic Club\" at No. 28; and \"Cat Kid Comic Club: Perspective\" at No. 67.\n\nThough, much like 2021 itself, the year didn't bring all good news for the author. Pilkey's publisher Scholastic pulled one of his books in March because it said the book perpetuated passive racism. \"The Adventures of Ook and Gluk,\" published in 2010, was a spinoff of sorts of his popular \"Captain Underpants\" series that featured a time-traveling caveman who trains at Master Wong's School of Kung Fu. Pilkey publicly apologized and gave his full support to the halting of publication and distribution of the book.\n\n\"It was and is wrong and harmful to my Asian readers, friends and family, and to all Asian people. ... I hope that you, my readers, will forgive me, and learn from my mistake that even unintentional and passive stereotypes and racism is harmful to everyone. I apologize, and I pledge to do better,\" Pilkey wrote in a statement.\n\nMore:USA TODAY staff's 2021 favorite first-time reads: Add these 14 books to your to-be-read pile\n\nKristin Hannah tops this year's adult fiction with \"The Four Winds,\" (No. 2), which USA TODAY rated ★★★½ (out of four) and called \"epic and transporting, a stirring story of hardship and love that is likely to lead to a film adaptation.\" Hannah was followed in the fiction category by Matt Haig's \"The Midnight Library\" (No. 5) and Laura Dave's \"The Last Thing He Told Me\" (No. 6).\n\nUnlike 2020 when titles on politics, former President Donald Trump and race and racism dominated, we did not see as many current affairs or political books in 2021's Top 100. \"American Marxism\" by Mark R. Levin did reach No. 3 and topped the nonfiction category. Only two other current affairs books appeared: \"Peril\" by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa (No. 38) and \"The Real Anthony Fauci\" by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (No. 46).\n\nActors and rock stars also made appearances this year. Among the titles were \"Greenlights\" by Matthew McConaughey (No. 26), which was also the year's top memoir. Foo Fighter frontman Dave Grohl also appeared with \"The Storyteller\" (No. 63), and Will Smith with Mark Manson for \"Will\" came in at No. 97.\n\nUSA TODAY’s Top 100 bestselling books of 2021\n\n1. \" Dog Man: Mothering Heights,\" by Dav Pilkey\n\n2. \"The Four Winds,\" by Kristin Hannah\n\n3. \"American Marxism,\" by Mark R.

As the year nears its close, here is a reminder of some of the well-known people who died in 2021. Larry King – 23 January A legend of US broadcasting and the king of the talk show, Larry King died aged 87 on 23 January. Over five decades, he interviewed some 50,000 people, from presidents and movie stars to death row inmates. Sporting his trademark braces over a shirt with rolled-up sleeves, he presented himself as an old-school news man, said The Times – but he described himself as an “infotainer”. He wanted, he said, to ask the kind of questions a curious member of the public would ask. In 1985, the cable channel CNN offered King his own nightly TV show, Larry King Live. It ran for 25 years. “Every day of my life is a learning experience, and I’m fascinated by everything,” he said in 2014. “My curiosity in all those years has never dimmed since I was a little kid.” Cicely Tyson – 28 January Cicely Tyson was a pioneering black actress whose seven-decade-long career encompassed film, theatre and television. Refusing to take any role that she felt demeaned black people, even if that meant not working, she won three Emmys, a Tony, an honorary Oscar and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and she was cited as an inspiration by countless younger actors. Tyson took the lead role in The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman, a hit TV drama from 1974 about the life of a 100-year-old woman who was born into slavery, and played the mother of Kunta Kinte in the seminal TV miniseries Roots, in 1977. Skip advert Later, she played Sipsey in the film Fried Green Tomatoes (1991), she had a recurring role as a congresswoman in Netflix’s House of Cards and, from 2015, she was Viola Davis’s mother in the TV show How to Get Away with Murder. In 2018, she won an honorary Oscar – the first black woman to do so. Dustin Diamond – 1 February Dustin Diamond, best known for playing Samuel “Screech” Powers in the US sitcom Saved by the Bell, died aged 44, just three weeks after being diagnosed with cancer.\n\nDiamond portrayed Screech for the show’s entire run, from 1989 to 1992, as it developed what Johnny Diaz in The New York Times described as a “cult following among millennials and members of Generation X and grew into an internet obsession for some fans”. When the series ended, Diamond reprised the character for various spin-off shows and appeared on reality TV, but spoke openly about the difficulty he had in finding work. Captain Tom Moore – 2 February Captain Tom Moore received international attention and a knighthood when he raised more than £32m for the NHS by walking 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday. He said he began raising funds to thank the “magnificent” NHS staff who treated him for cancer and a broken hip. Moore died at the age of 100 after testing positive for Covid-19. The Queen and Boris Johnson paid tribute to the Army veteran, with the prime minister describing him as a “hero in the truest sense of the word”. Christopher Plummer – 5 February Christopher Plummer was a “tremendous” Canadian actor, with “an imposing physique, a broad brow, sculpted features and a magnificent voice”, who is “destined, or doomed” to be primarily remembered for his role as Captain von Trapp in The Sound of Music (1965), said Michael Coveney in The Guardian. Appearing on “stage, screen and Alpine meadow” for more than six decades, he played all the great Shakespearean roles, outlived his fellow hellraisers to become a “go-to” actor for senior star roles, and, aged 82, became the oldest actor ever to win an Oscar. Mary Wilson – 8 February As a 15-year-old living in a housing project in Detroit, Mary Wilson co-founded one of the most successful (and glamorous) singing groups of the 1960s. She remained with The Supremes until the Motown hit machine was finally dissolved in 1977 – having weathered numerous feuds, and the departure of both her co-founders, Florence Ballard and Diana Ross. Skip advert In total, The Supremes had 12 Billboard No. 1 hits in the US – a record unsurpassed for a female vocal group – and they rivalled The Beatles for commercial success. Thanks to TV, Wilson said, “people were able to see us all over America and see black people in a different light”. Wilson’s first solo album didn’t sell well, and she was dropped by Motown in 1980. But she continued to perform. She also wrote four memoirs, one of which was a runaway bestseller, and worked as an activist, campaigning successfully for better trademark protection for musicians. Bunny Wailer – 2 March Bunny Wailer, whose real name was Neville Livingston, was the last surviving founder member of The Wailers – the group that propelled Bob Marley to superstardom, and helped popularise reggae worldwide.\n\nThe Wailers were described as the Jamaican Beatles and, like the Fab Four, they had distinct identities and pursued solo careers. Wailer’s debut solo album, Blackheart Man (1976), is “widely felt to be one of reggae’s highest peaks”, said The Guardian. A devout Rastafarian, Wailer, who died aged 73, lived on a farm outside Kingston he’d bought with his settlement from Island Records, where he grew food and smoked herb. Paul Ritter – 5 April Paul Ritter, who died of a brain tumour at the age of 54, is “destined” to be remembered for playing the eccentric yet lovable dad on the Channel 4 series Friday Night Dinner. “And rightly so,” said Stuart Heritage in The Guardian. “That role… brought Ritter a level of fame he had previously never achieved.” Before Friday Night Dinner, Ritter had appeared in big hits including Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Vera and the critically acclaimed Chernobyl. He was also a talented stage actor, nominated for both Tony and Olivier awards. Writing for The Herald, Neil Cooper described Ritter as “a quietly brilliant character actor who had the ability to inhabit each new role to the point of being unrecognisable”. Prince Philip – 9 April Prince Philip, the Queen’s husband and closest confidant for 73 years, died on 9 April aged 99 at Windsor Castle. Described by Queen Elizabeth II in her golden wedding speech as “my strength and stay all these years”, the Duke of Edinburgh retired from public duties in August 2017, having completed 22,219 solo engagements since 1952. Skip advert The death of Prince Philip, just two months short of his 100th birthday, prompted a flood of tributes from world leaders and members of his family. His grandson, Prince William, called him an “extraordinary man” from “an extraordinary generation”, who would want him to “get on with the job”. And Prince Harry described his grandfather as “master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right till the end”. DMX – 9 April The rapper DMX died aged 50 after being hospitalised by a heart attack, with his family calling him “a warrior who fought till the very end”. “He loved his family with all of his heart, and we cherish the times we spent with him,\" they added. DMX, whose real name was Earl Simmons, had five US No. 1 albums, featuring iconic songs such as Party Up (Up in Here), What’s My Name? and X Gon’ Give It to Ya.\n\nHis music was often “menacing and dark”, but it was “infused with Christian spirituality”, said Daniel E. Slotnik in The New York Times. It was also informed by his “long struggle with drugs, his bleak childhood”, with many of his “most swaggering songs” containing “hints of lingering trauma”. Nikki Grahame – 9 April Former Big Brother contestant Nikki Grahame, who was particularly well known for her diary room tantrums, died at the age of 38 after being hospitalised with an eating disorder. Davina McCall, the former presenter of the show, said she was “so desperately sad” to hear of the death of “the funniest, most bubbly sweetest girl”. Speaking to The Guardian last year, Grahame said she had “fond memories” of the show, “even though there were times where it looked like I was having a meltdown”. Big Brother gave her “a lot” financially, she said. “I bought the flat I live in now. I’ve never had to get a ‘normal’ job; I’ve always had something to fall back on… I’ve been very lucky. Overall, it has had a positive effect on my life.” Helen McCrory – 16 April One of Britain’s finest actors, Helen McCrory, who died of breast cancer aged 52, was only 5ft 3in tall yet such was the energy she brought to her performances, she could command London’s biggest stages, said The Daily Telegraph. Skip advert McCrory made her professional debut in 1990 – and thereafter worked more or less continuously. By the 2000s, critics had started referring to her as “the next Judi Dench”. In 2006, she played Cherie Blair in Stephen Frears’s film The Queen, which kick-started her screen career. She was in three of the Harry Potter films and appeared in a huge range of TV roles. She was a scene-stealing presence in all five series of Peaky Blinders, playing Aunt Polly, the terrifying matriarch of the gangster clan. Una Stubbs – 12 August Una Stubbs, who died aged 84, was an enormously versatile actress, and a familiar face on British television for several decades, said The Daily Telegraph. Although best known for her sparkling, mischievous and sometimes kooky performances in comedy roles, she starred in everything from pantomime and musicals to serious theatre. From 1979 she cemented her place in popular television culture with her role as the prim Aunt Sally in the much-loved ITV adaptation of Worzel Gummidge. Around the same time, she began her long stint as captain of the women’s team on the charades-based panel show Give Us a Clue, with Lionel Blair, who also died this year.\n\nMeanwhile, she continued to pop up on TV, ending her career on a high with her role as the “touchingly concerned” Mrs Hudson in Sherlock, with Benedict Cumberbatch (whom she had known since he was four). Sean Lock – 18 August The stand-up comedian, actor and team captain on 8 Out of 10 Cats died from cancer at the age of 58. “Bespectacled, besuited and well-groomed”, Lock “projected a constant air of puzzlement as he imparted his deadpan observational humour”, said Anthony Hayward in The Guardian. Lock won the British Comedy Award for Best Live Comic in 2000, but it wasn’t until 2005 that he found fame in the comedy panel show 8 Out of 10 Cats. He toured widely as a stand-up while recording episodes of the hit Channel 4 show. According to Marcus Williamson in The Independent, when asked by Jimmy Carr what he’d like his obituary to say, he quipped: “I don’t care, I’ll be dead. But ideally I’d like it to say, nooooooo, whyyyyyy, nooooooo, aaaahhh, you can’t write tears, Jimmy…” Charlie Watts – 24 August Perhaps the most reluctant rock star to emerge from the 1960s, drummer Charlie Watts, who died aged 80, was certainly the most “mild-mannered member of the Rolling Stones”, said The Times. However, the paper added, his “phlegmatic presence was a vital ingredient in the Stones’ often volatile chemistry”. Skip advert A dapper, unassuming man whose abiding love was jazz, he was happier in a well-cut suit than in a leather jacket or kaftan. And when Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were being chased by screaming fans, busted for drugs and pilloried by politicians, Watts was quietly getting on with his drumming, maintaining a zen-like focus during their concerts. “Watts was the Stone who never rolled,” said The Daily Telegraph, yet he was the “linchpin” of the band – by far “the most respected by musicians and popular with the fans”. Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry – 29 August Lee “Scratch” Perry was an eccentric Jamaican record producer who “revelled in disorder”, said The Daily Telegraph. In his tiny Black Ark studio in Kingston, he would whirl like a dervish around his mixing desk, dressed in shorts and a singlet, often barefoot – and almost always stoned. Yet the sounds he created, as a pioneer of both roots reggae and dub, reverberated around the world. The success of the two albums he made with The Wailers – Soul Rebels (1970) and Soul Revolution (1971) – brought other acts flocking to him.\n\nFrom his studio, which he built in 1973, he produced a string of classic songs and albums, many of which had political themes, including Max Romeo’s War Ina Babylon, and Junior Murvin’s Police and Thieves. The latter was covered by The Clash, and in 1977 Perry produced their single Complete Control. Sarah Harding – 5 September In 2002, thousands of young hopefuls auditioned for the ITV reality show Popstars: The Rivals. But when Sarah Harding appeared in front of the judges in August that year, it took them no time to see her potential. Four months later, viewers voted the 20-year-old into the newly created girl band Girls Aloud. They superseded the Spice Girls by having “a record-breaking run of 20 consecutive top ten singles”, said The Times, four of which reached No. 1. Six of their albums went platinum. In August 2020, Harding revealed that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. “Nothing is certain any more,” she told The Times. “I’m just grateful to wake up every day and live my best life, because now I know just how precious it is.” Michael K. Williams – 6 September Michael K. Williams, who died aged 54, broke into acting when the rapper Tupac Shakur chose him – on the strength of a Polaroid picture – to play his brother in the 1996 thriller Bullet, said The Guardian. It led to other roles, but it was The Wire, from 2002, that made him famous. Skip advert Appearing as the terrifying, shotgun-wielding stick-up artist Omar Little, he brilliantly conveyed that character’s menacing charisma, as well as his peculiar tenderness. President Obama described The Wire as the best show on television, and Omar as his favourite character in it. Williams also played dapper bootlegger Chalky White in Boardwalk Empire for five years from 2010, and more recently had starred in Lovecraft Country. He also won an Emmy nomination for a documentary he produced on the failings of America’s youth justice system. Willie Garson – 21 September Willie Garson was the actor best known for playing talent agent Stanford Blatch, Carrie Bradshaw’s male best friend, in the iconic TV show Sex and the City. A New York Times obituary written by his loved ones described the 57-year-old’s role over six seasons of the show as “not only hilarious, but also vulnerable at times, as he struggled in his own efforts to navigate sex and the city”. Over the last four decades, Garson appeared in more than 300 television shows and 70 films, the obituary added. His most notable film credits included There’s Something About Mary, Groundhog Day, Being John Malkovich and Freaky Friday. James Michael Tyler – 24 October The actor best known for his role as Gunther, manager of the Central Perk coffee shop in the NBC sitcom Friends, died aged 59. He had started as an extra on the show, given the role because he could work the coffee machine.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2021/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/01/03/phoenix-arizona-concert-announcements-2017/96118504/", "title": "Phoenix concert news: Tony Bennett reschedules Celebrity Theatre ...", "text": "Ed Masley\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nTony Bennett's Celebrity Theatre date has been rescheduled from July 11 to Thursday, Dec. 7, due to \"unforeseen scheduling conflicts.\"\n\nBennett's management regrets any inconvenience this may cause fans of the 19-time Grammy winner who looks forward to performing in Phoenix in December.\n\nAll tickets purchased for the July 11 show will be honored at the 7:30 p.m. show on Dec. 7.

And she scored a second multi-platinum U.S. hit with “Team” from that same debut album. She hasn’t toured since late 2014, but I did just see her at Coachella, where she was amazing.

So yeah, I have a lot of memories there. I remember it always being so extremely hot. But I also lived in Lake Havasu, actually. So I've lived in a couple places in Arizona. But Scottsdale has always been a really beautiful place in my mind. I have hiked Camelback Mountain. You are talking to a Super Bowl performer who has hiked your mountain.

Produced by Justin Meldal-Johnsen and Paramore’s own Taylor York, the album also marks the return of original Paramore member Zac Farro. Billboard declared the song “Hard Times” to be “an addictive, Talking Heads-inspired jam that sounds like it could follow ‘Ain’t It Fun’ as a Hot 100 smash,” while Rolling Stone praising “Told You So” as “polyrhythmic funk-pop.” And Variety raved about the album: “Paramore has never sounded — or looked — more defiantly joyous... ‘After Laughter’ sounds like it’s about when life kicks you in the gonads.

In an interview with Pitchfork, Robin Pecknold talked about the inspiration for the single – his relatoinship with Skyler Skjelset, the childhood friend with whom he formed Fleet Foxes in 2006. The date in the title refers to May 3, 2011, the release date of “Helplessness Blues,” their previous effort, after which they embarked on a lengthy hiatus. It’s also Skjelset’s birthday. “It addresses our distance in the years after touring that album, the feeling of having an unresolved, unrequited relationship that is lingering psychologically,\" Pecknold said. \"Even if some time apart was necessary and progressive for both of us as individuals, I missed our connection, especially the one we had when we were teenagers, and the lyrics for the song grew out of that feeling.”\n\n9/26: Imagine Dragons\n\nImagine Dragons are launching their tour in support of “Evolve” at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Sept. 26 with special guests Grouplove and K.Flay.\n\n“Evolve” is set to be released June 23.

All ages welcome.\n\nNow celebrating more than 50 years of touring, Rush's impact on the American music scene has been profound. He helped shape the folk revival in the '60s and the renaissance of the '80s and '90s, his music having left its stamp on generations of artists. Rush’s early recordings introduced the world to the work of Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne and James Taylor, and in more recent years his Club 47 concerts have brought artists such as Nanci Griffith and Shawn Colvin to wider audiences when they were just beginning to build their own reputations.\n\nRush began his musical career in the early '60s playing the Boston-area clubs while a Harvard student. The Club 47 was the flagship of the coffee house fleet, and he was soon holding down a weekly spot there, learning from the legendary artists who came to play, honing his skills and growing into his talent. He had released two albums by the time he graduated. Rush displayed then, as he does today, an uncanny knack for finding wonderful songs, and writing his own - many of which have become classics re-interpreted by new generations. Signed by Elektra in 1965, Rush made three albums for them, culminating in “The Circle Game,” which, according to Rolling Stone, ushered in the singer-songwriter era.\n\nPepsi Amphitheater season\n\nLooking to beat the Phoenix heat while taking in an outdoor concert?

And that means more seats have been added for the show.\n\nThe additional tickets go on sale at 11 a.m. Monday, May 8 at the Celebrity Theatre, 440 N. 32nd St., in Phoenix, or online at celebritytheatre.com. To charge by phone, call 602-267-1600 ext. 1. All tickets are subject to facility and ticketing surcharges. All ages welcome.\n\nWilson launched the “Pet Sounds” tour last year to honor the 50th anniversary of the Beach Boys’ finest hour with two fellow Beach Boys – Al Jardine and Blondie Chaplin – joining in the celebration (although Matthew Jardine, Al’s son, would go on to be the MVP with those amazing high notes when the tour played Phoenix last year).\n\nReleased on May 16, 1966, “Pet Sounds” is among the most acclaimed recordings in the history of rock and roll, with NME, Uncut and Mojo all declaring it the greatest album of all time. And with good reason.\n\nWilson started working on the \"Pet Sounds\" sessions while the other Beach Boys were off touring on the hits. Inspired by the Beatles’ “Rubber Soul,” he set out to create a masterpiece that marked a huge departure from the classic Beach Boys sound, although he’d hinted at the new direction in the more ambitious moments of “Today.”\n\n“It’s really been a trip to sit here and think about releasing Pet Sounds 50 years ago,” Wilson says. “I love performing this album with my band and look forward to playing it for fans all across the world.”\n\nIn addition to a full performance of the classic album, Wilson will be treating fans to highlights of his 54-year career with the Beach Boys as well as solo cuts.\n\nIn my review of last year’s show, I wrote:\n\nIt’s a magical — at times transcendent — night, an opportunity to witness Wilson reconnect as best he can with “Pet Sounds” in a 50th anniversary celebration of an undisputed masterpiece whose legacy hasn’t endured so much as blossomed with each passing year.\n\nIt’s a beautiful album whose bittersweet charms are heightened, in a way — made more cathartic and more poignant — by those obvious reminders that the man who poured his heart and soul into the making of that masterpiece has never been the same. Could never be the same. Will never be the same.\n\nAnd here he was revisiting “You Still Believe in Me,” “I’m Waiting For the Day,” “God Only Knows,” “I Know There’s an Answer,” “I Just Wasn’t Made for These Times,” the heartache, the longing, the vulnerability he brought to those recordings duly underscored by the realities of Wilson’s life.\n\nThis was especially true of his vocal on “Caroline, No,” the album’s final song, on which a girlfriend’s haircut is the catalyst for a heartbreaking ballad about wishing he could go back to the way things used to be.\n\nHe’s assembled a stellar assortment of backing musicians for the tour, including fellow Beach Boy Al Jardine, who actually appears on “Pet Sounds,” and another former Beach Boy, Blondie Chaplin, who joined in the ‘70s.\n\nThere were 10 or 11 musicians on stage, including several multi-instrumentalists, allowing him to capture every richly textured nuance of the album — French horn, xylophone, saxophone, bass harmonica, electrotheremin, several keyboards, flute and a wide assortment of percussion instruments.\n\nThat also meant a wealth of vocalists on hand to reconstruct those awe-inspiring harmonies, with Matt Jardine emerging as the evening's MVP on that front, nailing every key falsetto part.\n\n7/19: Chris Isaak\n\nChris Isaak returns to the Celebrity Theatre on Wednesday, July 19th, for an 8 p.m. show.\n\nTickets ($60 and $90) go on sale at 10 a.m. this Friday, May 5 at the Celebrity Theatre, 440 N. 32nd St., Phoenix, celebritytheatre.com and 602-267-1600 ext. 1.\n\nThe star has worn his share of hats since \"Wicked Game\" turned up in David Lynch's \"Wild at Heart.” He’s been a talk-show host, a sitcom star, a SWAT commander in \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" No. 68 on of VH1's list of sexiest artists and a singer whose music continues to embody the qualities that made his early records so evocative.\n\n\"First Comes the Night,\" his latest effort, finds Isaak channeling the sound and spirit of the Sun recording artists he saluted on \"Beyond the Sun,\" especially Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley, while sounding more timeless than retro.\n\n“My last release was ‘Beyond The Sun’ — my tribute to Sun Records with a lot of covers,” Isaak says. “So this time around I had a lot of new material that I was thrilled to record.”\n\nThis is the first time album Isaak has written and recorded so much in Nashville, a change in location he explored partly upon the suggestion of his friend Stevie Nicks. For all the firsts, there’s a strong through-line that continues from Isaak’s earlier triumphs like “Silvertone” (1985) and “Heart Shaped World” (1989).\n\n“I guess you can make a drink with many ingredients, but if one is very strong, that’s what you taste,” says Isaak with a laugh. “For better or worse, I have a tendency to dominate because I have a big voice and some twisted ideas.”\n\nAs for the show, expect the usual mixture of pathos and humor from Isaak and his band.\n\nDoors open at 6 p.m All tickets are subject to a surcharge.\n\n10/31: Halsey\n\nSpend Halloween with Halsey when the singer brings her U.S. tour to Talking Stick Resort Arena on Oct. 31 with PartyNextDoor and Charli XCX.\n\nThe eight-week tour is in support of Halsey’s second album, “hopeless fountain kingdom,” out June 2.\n\nPre-sales run May 8 through May 11 at hfktour.com, with general on-sale scheduled for May 12. For every pair of online tickets purchased, fans will have access to redeem one physical copy of the new release.\n\nAT&T is sending customers to the front of the line with AT&T priority pre-sale ticket access beginning at 10 a.m. Tuesday, May 9, through the AT&T THANKS program.

Fans can visit findmeinthekingdom.com for all available pre-order offers, including exclusive bundles, merch, vinyl and more.\n\nNow 22, the singer broke through with a platinum debut titled “Badlands” in 2015. She’s best known for the singles “New Americana” and this year’s “Now or Never” – unless, of course, you count her featured vocal on the Chainsmokers’ seven-times-platinum chart-topper “Closer.” And really, why would you not count that?\n\n8/30: Linkin Park\n\nLinkin Park will bring their One More Light World Tour to Talking Stick Resort Arena on Aug. 30 with Machine Gun Kelly. And fans will get first access to those tickets through a special presale aimed at circumventing bots and other scalpers.\n\nThe Linkin Park Presale – powered by Ticketmaster Verified Fan, will utilize fan-first technology to level the playing field and ensure fans compete against other fans – not software – for tickets. The more you participate, the higher your spot in line and the better your access to tickets. Linkin Park Fan Club (LPU) members will get priority, but anyone can work their way to the top.\n\nPre-sale begins May 9. Fans and LPU members can register for the tour pre-sale right now at presale.linkinpark.com.\n\nGeneral tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. May 12, at ticketmaster.com and livenation.com. Every full-priced ticket purchased for the tour includes a choice of a standard CD or standard digital copy of “One More Light,” their much-anticipated seventh album, which arrives on May 19 on Warner Bros. Records. Their most personal album to date, it’s built on the stories of six voices coming clean about their lives and struggles, as if it were the first time. As the press release says, “OML isn’t bigger, louder, or more avant-garde, it’s more human.”\n\nThe set list will combine their biggest hits and songs from the new album.\n\n“Our fans know how much love we put into our live show,” says guitarist Brad Delson. “They know how much we enjoy the connection when we play a fan favorite on stage. The emotional and sonic content of this new batch of songs is going to bring a whole new dimension to the show.”\n\nOne dollar from every full-priced ticket sold will benefit Music For Relief, the charity foundation Linkin Park founded in 2005 to aid survivors of natural disaster.

Tickets for the newly scheduled dates will go on sale on May 5. Tickets held for previous “Unbreakable” tour events that are now re-scheduled will be honored at the new dates. For more information please visit livenation.com.\n\nThe legendary entertainer began her sold out “Unbreakable” tour in August 2015, but just one year ago reached out directly to fans via Twitter with news of her focusing on starting a family, confirmed months later with the arrival of her first child. Jackson has taken the past year to enjoy pregnancy and motherhood, and is now ready to return to the live stage to give the fans everything they could hope for in one epic concert event. The State of the World Tour is a continuation of the “Unbreakable” tour and will include fan favorites from her chart-topping “Unbreakable” album, an array of the socially conscious music she’s released throughout her career, and other smash hits and soon-to-be released new tracks with a state of the art live production.\n\nJackson has won six Grammys, two Emmys, a Golden Globe Award and a nomination for an Academy Award along with dozens of American Music Awards, MTV Video Music Awards and Billboard Music Awards. She has received accolades as an actress as well, including the NAACP Best Supporting Actor award. With sales of more than 160 million records worldwide, Jackson stands as one of the best-selling artists of all time with a string of hits that have left an indelible impression on pop culture.\n\n7/14: Anthony Hamilton\n\nGrammy-winning neo-soul singer Anthony Hamilton will play the Celebrity Theatre at 8:30 p.m. Friday, July 14.\n\nTickets ($41, $51 and $61) are on sale now at Celebrity Theatre or online at www.celebritytheatre.com. To charge by phone, call 602-267-1600 ext.1.\n\nIt's been 13 years since a slow-burning ballad called \"Charlene” hit the pop charts, positioning North Carolina-born Hamilton as a major player in the soul revival a year after singing the hook on the Nappy Roots' rap track \"Po' Folks\" earned the singer his first Grammy nomination. And although he hasn't had much luck crossing over to the pop charts since that debut single, Hamilton's still making good on the artistic promise of those early records on his latest album, last year’s “What I’m Feelin’.”\n\nOther song of note include “Can’t Let Go,” which topped the Adult R&B charts, and “You Got the Love I Need,” a collaboration with Al Green for which he won a Grammy.\n\n10/14: Harry Styles\n\nHarry Styles of One Direction is playing Comerica Theatre on Oct. 14.\n\nTickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday, May 5 at ticketmaster.com and the Comerica box office. Fan registration for all North American dates has already begun through Ticketmaster’s Verified Fan program. Supplies are limited, further information here.\n\nStyles’ self-titled debut album will be released globally on Friday, May 12. The 10-track album features the lead single “Sign of the Times,” which topped the charts in more than 84 countries the day it was released. The album was executive produced by Jeff Bhasker, with additional production from Alex Salibian, Tyler Johnson and Kid Harpoon.\n\nStyles began to showcase the live show with his debut performance on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” where he premiered the album track “Ever Since New York” and the single “Sign of the Times,” with an additional performance of the single on BBC talk show “The Graham Norton Show.” He is set for upcoming appearances on NBC’s “Today Show Summer Concert Series” May 9, followed by a week-long residency on CBS’ “The Late Late Show with James Corden” May 15-18.\n\n11/18: Fall Out Boy\n\nTalking Stick Resort Arena in downtown Phoenix is the final stop on the “M A N I A” tour for Fall Out Boy on Saturday, Nov. 18.\n\nPre-sale tickets will be available beginning Monday, May 1. General tickets will be available at 10 a.m. Friday, May 5, at ticketmaster.com.\n\nOne dollar of every ticket sold will benefit a number of Chicago-area charities via the newly launched Fall Out Boy Fund.\n\nThe news of the tour was accompanied by the release of “Young and Menace,” the first taste of their seventh album, “M A N I A,” which is set to arrive Sept. 15.\n\nPete Wentz says, “There’s a lyric in the song, ‘trying to send the world a message, I was young and a menace,’ that reminded me of growing up in the suburbs of Chicago. I didn't look like anyone there or feel like anyone – I felt like an outsider in my own town. It wasn't until I discovered punk rock and that community that I realized I did fit in somewhere in this world – with the other people who didn't fit in. It’s hard to rationalize rage – it’s hard to quantify anxiety ... this song does neither, it embraces the wave.\"\n\nThe album is their follow-up album to “American Beauty/American Psycho,” a platinum effort that debuted at No. 1 on Billboard in early 2015.\n\n7/12: Kendrick Lamar\n\nKendrick Lamar is launching The DAMN. Tour at Gila River Arena in Glendale on Wednesday, July 12, with Travis Scott and D.R.A.M.\n\nThe DAMN. Tour follows a spectacular appearance at Coachella, which you can read about in our review here, and the release of his critically acclaimed fourth album, “DAMN.,” his third release to hit the charts at No. 1, selling more than 603,000 album units.\n\nPitchfork hailed “DAMN.” As “a widescreen masterpiece of rap, full of expensive beats, furious rhymes, and peerless storytelling about Kendrick’s destiny in America” while Rolling Stone called it “a dazzling display of showy rhyme skills, consciousness-raising political screeds, self-examination and bass-crazy-kicking.”\n\nTickets go on sale to the general public starting at 10 a.m. Friday, April 28. For complete presale details and ticket information, please visit www.ticketmaster.co\n\n7/18: Earth, Wind & Fire with Chic\n\nEarth, Wind & Fire and CHIC ft. Nile Rodgers will bring 2054 The Tour to Talking Stick Resort Arena on July 18 with a DJ and a specialized seating configuration toward the front of the stage where seats will have additional space between them to encourage fans to dance, dance, dance, dance as Chic would put it (yowzah, yowzah, yowzah)\n\nTickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday, April 28, at www.ticketmaster.com. American Express cardholders will have access to presale tickets in select cities beginning 10 a.m. Monday, April 24.

Get your feet ready for a deluge of hits,\" says Rodgers, who was honored with an Award for Musical Excellence from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Earth, Wind & Fire were inducted in 2000.\n\n11/4: Sebastian Maniscalco reschedules\n\nSebastian Maniscalco has postponed his Celebrity Theatre stop on the Why Would You Do That? tour, originally scheduled for this Friday, April 21, to Saturday, Nov. 4.\n\nWhy would he do that?\n\nManiscalco shared a note with fans on social media.\n\n\"I would do anything for my fans who support me tremendously,\" the comic writes. \"Anything but miss the birth of my first child! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?! Phoenix, I will have to reschedule this weekend’s show because baby Maniscalco is on the way! I’ll see you guys on November 4th instead! Thank you for understanding.\"\n\nAll tickets will be honored on the new date.\n\n10/5 Flaming Lips and Mac DeMarco\n\nThe Flaming Lips and Mac DeMarco are playing Comerica Theatre on Thursday, Oct. 5.\n\nThe Lips last played the Valley last October at the Arizona State Fair, a magical night to which I responded in my review (which you can read in its entirety just by clicking these words):\n\n“It takes a certain breed of entertainer to lead the members of an audience on an emotional journey from the smile-inducing spectacle of ‘Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, Pt. 1,’ with Wayne Coyne surrounded by giant inflatables, including Santa Claus, to the existential majesty of ‘Do You Realize??,’ which brought me to tears.\n\nAnd I’m pretty sure the Flaming Lips would be the only actual entertainers in that certain breed.\n\nCoyne is such a bizarre, enigmatic performer, giving into the silliest aspects of the task at hand, with his bag of confetti, his smoke gun and his crazy jacket with strands of multi-colored lights hanging like extra-long fringe, while gleefully spreading his message of peace and love and making the most of the moment you’re in because ‘you realize that everyone you know someday will die.’”\n\nTickets are on sale at ticketmaster.com, the Comerica Theatre box office and 800-745-3000.\n\nThe Canadian singer-songwriter most likely to perform nude (with apologies to Gordon Lightfoot), DeMarco is touring an album titled “This Old Dog,” his much-anticipated followup to “Another One.”\n\nDeMarco is known for two things – songs that reach inside your soul and force you to reflect on what you’ve done and how you plan to make it right, and being a total goof onstage. A bit Paul Westerberg in that respect. And as Smokey Robinson, who may not have been writing specifically about DeMarco, could tell you, “There’s some sad things known to man / But ain't too much sadder than the tears of a clown.”\n\nI caught his set last Friday at Coachella, writing:\n\n“He mocked his placement on the bill. ... He brought out former bassist Pierce McGarry for an extended bit in which the bassist kept insisting he was actually Orlando Bloom. … He joked about King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, whose set had preceded his own on that stage. And he joked with a fan in the audience about his hat. ... As for the music, it was often as sublime as his behavior was ridiculous, from 'Salad Days' through 'On the Level.' \"\n\n9/10: Florida Georgia Line with Nelly\n\nFlorida Georgia Line will bring Nelly and Chris Lane to Ak-Chin Pavilion on Sunday, Sept. 10.\n\nGet tickets at at ticketmaster.com.\n\nThe country duo and Nelly are touring together, of course, because of their collaboration on the remix of “Cruise,” a bro-country landmark that five years later, remains the biggest-release digital release the country genre has ever produced.\n\nFour subsequent Florida Georgia Line followed “Cruise” to No. 1 on Billboard’s country charts while going multi-platinum -- \"Stay,\" the Luke Bryan-assisted \"This is How We Roll,\" \"Dirt\" and \"H.O.L.Y.\" (from their latest album, \"Dig Your Roots\").\n\n7/25: Buckingham McVie\n\nLindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie of Fleetwood Mac: The Rumours Years are headed to Phoenix in support of their first album as a duo, playing Comerica Theatre on Tuesday, July 25, with the Wallflowers.\n\nThe 10-song album is due to hit the streets June 9, preceded by a single, “In My World,” available now.\n\nThe collaboration began three years ago, when McVie rejoined Fleetwood Mac for their “On With The Show” tour. The duo went in to record new material prior to rehearsals for the tour and their natural creative chemistry was reignited. According to Buckingham, “We were exploring a creative process, and the identity of the project took on a life organically. The body of work felt like it was meant to be a duet album. We acknowledged that to each other on many occasions, and said to ourselves, ‘What took us so long?!!’”\n\nMcVie says, “We’ve always written well together,Lindsey and I, and this has just spiraled into something really amazing that we’ve done between us.”\n\nSessions for the album took place at The Village Studios in Los Angeles, where Fleetwood Mac recorded several of their classic albums, including “Tusk.” Buckingham and McVie were joined in the studio by fellow bandmates Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, who supplied much of the dynamic rhythmic engine.\n\nTickets are on sale at livenation.com.\n\n10/3: The Shins with Spoon\n\nThe Shins and Spoon will be playing four concerts together this year. And one of those concerts is happening right in Phoenix (your reporter is resisting the urge to end that sentence with several exclamation marks).\n\nThe tour hits Comerica Theatre on Tuesday, Oct. 3, in support of two of this year’s most acclaimed releases, the Shins’ “Heartworms” and Spoon’s “Hot Thoughts.” Tickets are $39.50-$50 and available through ticketfly.com.\n\nThe Shins recently headlined the opening night of McDowell Mountain Music Festival, where the songs from that new album, of which there were many, more than held their own against such classics as “Caring is Creepy” and “New Slang.” You can see how that set went, complete with pictures, here.\n\nIn an interview quoted on Pitchfork, James Mercer, the last remaining member of the “Oh, Inverted World” lineup, said the new music is closer to the way they sounded on their first three albums by design.\n\n“I’m really excited about this record,” he said. “I think we’ve got something that Shins fans will really love, and I think there’s some other things on there that are different enough. I made a concerted effort on certain songs to fit the palette, to use the palette that I’ve used historically for the band.”\n\nSpoon’s fourth album in a row to crack the Top 10, “Hot Thoughts,” was released to just the sort of hyperventilating praise you can expect from critics when a new Spoon album hits the streets. And with good reason. They’ve already given us a number of the century’s best rock releases. And this new one more than lives up to the promise of that legacy. I now defer you to the wisdom of the Consequence of Sound reviewed who suggest that Britt Daniel’s “big statement is his Body of Work, of which every fine part adds up to a greater sum. Here comes another one.”\n\n8/25: Yestival\n\nFresh from taking their long-denied place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the members of Yes will be bringing a festival called Yestival to the Celebrity Theatre, with Todd Rundgren and Carl Palmer’s ELP Legacy on Friday, Aug. 25.\n\nTickets ($49.50, $89.50 and $125) are available at Celebrity Theatre, 440 N. 32nd St., Phoenix, www.celebritytheatre.com or 602-267-1600 ext. 1.\n\nYes will play a set of greatest hits from every album up to 1980’s “Drama,” showcasing the storied career of one of the world’s most influential, ground-breaking, and respected progressive rock bands.\n\nThat era produced such Yes staples as “Roundabout,” “I’ve Seen All Good People,” “Yours is No Disgrace,” “Long Distance Runaround,” “Heart of the Sunrise” and “Close to the Edge.”\n\n“We are looking forward to presenting songs from each of the first nine studio albums, including some surprises,” says guitarist Steve Howe.\n\nFor the purpose of this tour, Yes will feature Howe, Alan White (drums), Geoff Downes (keyboard), Jon Davison (vocals) and Billy Sherwood (the late Chris Squire’s chosen successor on bass).\n\n10/4: Father John Misty\n\nFather John Misty is playing the Orpheum Theatre in Phoenix on Wednesday, Oct. 4, in support of “Pure Comedy.\"\n\nTickets are on sale at phoenix.ticketforce.com.\n\nThe singer’s darkly comic narratives, often done in character, have marked Misty as his generation’s Randy Newman – not that I see Pixar work in Misty’s future. “Pure Comedy” is guaranteed to figure prominently on the shortlist of the year’s most celebrated albums, a third straight triumph for the singer-songwriter. Mojo said this album lifts him “to another level altogether,” while the Skinny raved: “He embraces the role, plays up to it, uses it to bend and manipulate the parameters of modern rock music and has managed to create something bitingly acerbic and cynical, yet achingly sincere. Again.”\n\nHe topped our playlist of best February singles with a track from “Pure Comedy” called “Ballad of the Dying Man,” on which he turns his darkly comic eye for detail on a self-important know-it-all who wonders on his deathbed if he’s “successfully beaten back the rising tide of idiots, dilettantes and fools on his watch.”\n\nWeyes Blood opens.\n\n10/8: Scorpions\n\nThe Scorpions Crazy World Tour is bringing Megadeth to Talking Stick Resort Arena on Sunday, Oct. 8.\n\nTickets are $40-$125 at www.dannyzeliskopresents.com.\n\nWhy Crazy World? If you have to ask:\n\n\"When our album 'Crazy World' was released back in '91, right at the end of the Cold War,” Klaus Meine says, “we toured around a world that was pretty crazy back then, but there was so much hope in the air for a more peaceful future. Now, 26 years later, things are getting more crazy every other day. After all these years, Crazy World is still a good motto for our upcoming world tour. We are very much looking forward to seeing all of you out there.\n\nFounded in Hannover, West Germany, in 1965, Scorpions released their debut album, “Lonesome Crow,” released in 1972. They rose to arena status with seminal releases “Lovedrive,” “Virgin Killer” and “Animal Magnetism.” In 1982, they topped the U.S. rock charts with \"No One Like You,\" a soaring power ballad they soon followed with their first Top 40 single, \"Rock You Like a Hurricane.\" Their biggest U.S. hit came later with another ballad, \"Wind of Change.\" They finished 46th on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock, and \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\" was No. 18 on VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs.\n\nThe set will offer a mix of fan favorites and highlights of their 19th studio release, “Return To Forever,” released in 2015 as part of their 50th anniversary festivities.\n\n5/2: New Found Glory\n\nPop-punk veterans New Found Glory are bringing their 20th Anniversary Tour to the Nile Theater in Mesa on May 2. They've been called \"the greatest pop-punk band in history\" by Bad Religion's own Brett Gurewitz, who scooped them up for Epitaph after they walked out on Geffen. Their first album for the label, \"Not without a Fight,\" debuted at no. 12 with Alternative Press declaring it \"a reminder of why we fell in love with NFG in the first place.\" After two albums on Epitaph, they switched to Hopeless for 2014's \"Resurrection,\" which Kerrang! declared \"a powerhouse of a record, the brave onward steps of New Found Glory proving that hope — like pop-punk — is not dead.\"\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Tuesday, May 2. Nile Theater, 105 W. Main St., Mesa. $24-28. www.niletheater.com.\n\n5/4: Zac Brown Band\n\nThe Zac Brown Band will bring their Welcome Home 2017 tour to Gila River Arena in Glendale.

Formed in 1967 and signed four years later, REO Speedwagon topped the album charts for 15 weeks in 1981 with the nine-times-platinum \"Hi Infidelity,\" which spawned the platinum chart-topper \"Keep On Loving You\" and the Top 5 \"Take It On the Run.\" Their other hits include \"In Your Letter,\" \"Keep the Fire Burnin',\" \"One Lonely Night,\" \"That Ain't Love,\" \"In My Dreams,\" \"Here With Me\" and a second chart-topping smash, \"Can't Fight This Feeling.\" Kevin Cronin, who’s been fronting REO since signing on in time to be featured on “R.E.O. T.W.O.,” their second album, is joined by bassist Bruce Hall, keyboardist Neal Doughty, guitarist Dave Amato and drummer Bryan Hitt. Opening the show will be Paul Gurvitz & the New Army.\n\nDetails: Friday, May 5.

Produced by the legendary Bob Ezrin (Pink Floyd, Cooper, Kiss), “Infinite” features 10 tracks they say were recorded “in the spirit of the ’70s.” Finally inducted just last year to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after decades of snubs, the metal pioneers have released five studio albums since 1996, augmented by an abundance of solo work and special projects from members Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Ian Paice, Steve Morse and Don Airey. But they plan to cover decades of fan favorites for this run. At his controversial, taboo-tweaking peak, Alice Cooper kept the generation gap alive while the punks were still getting their chaos together (taking half their cues from Cooper).

Liz Cheney said Trump oversaw a \"7-part plan\" to overturn election.\n\nFormer Attorney General Bill Barr said he resigned rather than challenge election results.\n\nIvanka Trump said she accepted the Justice Department's finding of no election fraud.\n\nA documentarian showed footage of extremists meeting the night before the Jan. 6, 2021, attack.\n\nWASHINGTON – The House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack heard riveting testimony Thursday from a police officer wounded in the attack and broadcast to a prime-time audience video of a meeting between men charged with seditious conspiracy.\n\nThe committee also outlined subjects it will cover in a series of June hearings, including former President Donald Trump's pressure on Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election and his attempt to replace his attorney general.\n\nThe highlights:\n\n• Capitol Police Officer Caroline Edwards described how she suffered a concussion while grappling with rioters over bike racks. “I was slipping in people’s blood,” she said. “I was catching people as they fell. It was carnage.” She also recalled seeing Officer Brian Sicknick, who died the next day, turn ghostly white after being sprayed with chemicals.\n\n• Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., vice chair of the committee, charged that Trump “oversaw and coordinated a sophisticated 7-part plan to overturn the presidential election.\"\n\n• Video from British documentarian Nick Quested showed a meeting between leaders of two far-right groups, Enrique Tarrio of the Proud Boys and Stewart Rhodes of the Oath Keepers, in a parking garage the night before the attack. Tarrio and Rhodes are each charged with seditious conspiracy and each has pleaded not guilty.\n\n• Former Attorney General William Barr told the House panel investigating the Capitol attack he resigned in December 2020 from the Trump administration rather than challenge the election results.\n\n• Ivanka Trump, the former president's daughter and senior adviser, said she accepted the Justice Department’s finding of no fraud sufficient to overturn the 2020 – in contrast to her father.\n\n\"Donald Trump was at the center of this conspiracy,\" said the committee chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. said, which he called \"the culmination of an attempted coup.\"\n\nTrump rebuked Jan. 6 panel as biased after first hearing\n\nFormer President Donald Trump derided the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack as biased in a statement posted to Truth Social shortly after the panel's first hearing concluded.\n\n\"So the Unselect Committee of political HACKS refuses to play any of the many positive witnesses and statements, refuses to talk of the Election Fraud and irregularities that took place on a massive scale, and decided to use a documentary maker from Fake News ABC to spin only negative footage,\" he wrote. \"Our Country is in such trouble!\"\n\nThe former president's claims of election fraud are unfounded.\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nFact check:Joe Biden legally won presidential election, despite persistent contrary claims\n\nWhen is the next Jan. 6 committee hearing?\n\nThe next hearing of the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol will be Monday at 10 a.m.\n\nTwo more have been announced as well: Wednesday, also at 10 a.m and next Thursday (June 16) at 1 p.m.\n\nSeveral more hearings are expected to be announced in the coming days.Thursday's hearing was the first in a series of public hearings over the next few weeks.\n\nWho's watching?:Jan. 6 committee's long-awaited hearings promise revelations.

The America I grew up in, I thought we were more united about good and bad, right and wrong.\"\n\n- Kenneth Tran\n\nNew evidence: Donald Trump didn't mind the idea of hanging Mike Pence\n\nOne new revelation that surfaced in this hearing: Direct quotes from Donald Trump expressing approval of threats by supporters to hang Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nIn previewing future testimony, committee member Liz Cheney said: \"You will hear that President Trump was yelling and, quote, 'really angry at advisors who told him he needed to be doing something more' and aware of the rioters' chants to 'hang Mike Pence'.\"\n\nShe added: \"The President responded with this sentiment: 'Maybe our supporters have the right idea.' Mike Pence, quote, 'deserves it'.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported last month that White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told colleagues that Trump \"had said something to the effect of, maybe Mr. Pence should be hanged.\"\n\nTrump was angry at Pence for his refusal to throw out the electoral votes that elected President Joe Biden; Pence said he lacked the legal authority to do such a thing.\n\n- David Jackson\n\nThe witnesses:Who were the witnesses at the Jan. 6 committee hearing? Here's who testified about the Capitol riot\n\n‘I was slipping in people’s blood,’ Capitol Police officer says\n\nA Capitol Police officer who was injured during the attack on Jan. 6, 2021 described what she saw as a “war scene” that caused her breath to catch into her throat as she saw what was going on.\n\n“It was something like I had seen out of the movies,” said Caroline Edwards. \"I couldn’t believe my eyes. There were officers on the ground. They were bleeding. They were throwing up.”\n\n“I saw friends with blood all over their faces,” Edwards said. “I was slipping in people’s blood. I was catching people as they fell. It was carnage. It was chaos.”\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nGallery:Chilling images from the Capitol riot: Jan. 6 insurrection in photos\n\nFor one attendee, Jan. 6 committee is compelling, but little hopes of change\n\nAt a DC watch party, Zak Sabim from Virginia listened to the hearing \"because I think right is right and wrong is wrong.\" He said he found the committee's evidence compelling.\n\n\"You have to document it. If it's not appreciated now. Hopefully people in the future will appreciate it,\" he said.\n\nBut Sabim also said he sees America as too polarized now for the committee to achieve any outcomes. The Capitol attack has become like a \"soap opera\" for Sabim.\n\n\"I feel like there's been a couple seasons I missed out on,\" he said \"It seems like something if you're a Democratic voter, you probably know all the cast of characters.\"\n\n- Kenneth Tran\n\nThe hearings:Who will be Jan. 6 hearing's most avid viewer? Donald Trump, with a team ready to hit back.\n\nProud Boys membership tripled; then they organized for Jan. 6\n\nMembership in the \"western chauvinist\" group the Proud Boys nearly tripled after then-President Donald Trump told them in a debate to \"stand back and stand by,\" according to testimony.\n\nThen, when Trump urged Twitter followers to show up for a rally on Jan. 6, “Be there, will be wild!” Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio created a social media group to organize its members to show up on Jan. 6.\n\nThe group was called a “Ministry of Self Defense,” according to Department of Justice Documents shared in the hearing.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nWho are the Proud Boys? They joined the Wisconsin Proud Boys looking for brotherhood. They found racism, bullying and antisemitism.\n\nCapitol Police officer describes spraying of colleague who died\n\nCapitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick turned ghostly white after being sprayed with chemicals while grappling with rioters Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol Police Officer Caroline Edwards told the House panel investigating the attack.\n\nSicknick died the next day from strokes ruled by natural causes. But Edwards, who suffered a concussion, said she returned to the police line where she served outside the House clashing with the mob over bicycle racks for more than a half-hour with Sicknick.\n\n“All of a sudden, I see movement to the left of me and I turned and it was Officer Sicknick with his head in this hands,” Edwards testified Thursday. “And he was ghostly pale, which I figured at that point that he had been sprayed and I was concerned.”\n\n“My cop alarm bells went off because if you get sprayed with pepper spray, you're going to turn red,” she added, holding up a sheet of paper. “He turned just about as pale as this sheet of paper.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nEdwards describes blacking out after rioters ripped down first barricade\n\nCapitol Police officer Caroline Edwards described her injuries during the Jan. 6 attacks after rioters ripped down the first barricade moments after she told her sergeant that “we're going to need a few more people down here.”\n\nEdwards said that after the first barricade came down, she and other officers started grappling over the bike racks “to make sure that we can get more people down and get our CPU units time to answer the call.” But she said that she felt a back rack come on top of her head, and her foot caught the stair behind where she was standing.\n\n“My chin hit the handrail and then — I at that point I blacked out — but my back of my head clipped the concrete stairs behind me,” Edwards said.\n\n- Rebecca Morin\n\nLeaders of Proud Boys and Oath Keepers met in a parking garage\n\nLeaders of the ‘western chauvanist’ Proud Boys and the extremist militia group Oath Keepers met in a parking garage the night before the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nNick Quested, a documentary filmmaker, testified that he and his crew went to pick up Enrique Tarrio from jail before meeting with Stewart Rhodes.\n\nThe crew “drove down into the parking garage and filmed the scene of Mr. Tarrio and Mr. Rhodes and certain other individuals in that garage,” Quested said.\n\n— Erin Mansfield\n\nCommittee airs film about Trump's inspiration to Proud Boys, other extremist groups\n\nThe committee produced video clips from a documentary about the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and other white nationalist groups who participated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol – and Trump's incitement of them.\n\nThe film replayed Trump's infamous 2020 presidential debate comment about the Proud Boys – \"stand back and stand by\" – and his tweet encouraging people to travel to Washington on Jan. 6, 2021. Many violent offenders said they believed they were acting at Trump's behest.\n\n\"We have obtained substantial evidence showing that the president's December 19th tweet, calling his followers to D.C. on January 6th, energized individuals from the Proud Boys and other extremist groups,\" said committee chairman Bennie Thompson.\n\nDocumentary filmmaker Nick Quested testified about his filming of the Proud Boys,\n\n- David Jackson\n\nProud Boys:Who are the Proud Boys? Far-right group has concerned experts for years\n\nHouse panel outlines hearing subjects\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., outlined the subjects of other June hearings the House panel investigating the Capitol attack Jan. 6, 2021:\n\n--The hearing Monday at 10 a.m. will explore how former President Donald Trump and his advisers knew he lost the 2020 election, but still spread false and fraudulent information, Cheney said.\n\n--The hearing Wednesday at 10 a.m. will reveal Trump corruptly planning to replace Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, Cheney said.\n\n--The hearing Thursday at 1 p.m. will describe Trump’s pressure on Vice President Mike Pence to reject state electors.\n\nThe fifth June hearing will focus on Trump pressuring officials in states he lost to change their results, particularly in Georgia where he urged them to “find” 11,780 votes he needed to win.\n\nThe final two hearings in June will cover Trump summoning a mob and directing them to march on the Capitol, and then failing to stop the violence, Cheney said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nEdwards says she wondered ‘how we had gotten here’ during Capitol attacks\n\nCaroline Edwards, a U.S. Capitol Police officer injured during the Capitol attack, said that she had never had her “patriotism or duty been called into question” but that she would “gladly sacrifice everything to make sure that the America my grandfather defended is here for many years to come.”\n\nIn her opening statement, Edwards said that she had been called “Nancy Pelosi’s dog” and “a traitor to my country, my oath and my constitution” during the attacks at the Capitol.\n\n“In actuality, I wasn't none of those things,” she said. “I was an American standing face to face with other Americans asking myself…how we had gotten here.”\n\n- Rebecca Morin\n\nPence chief of staff: Veep chose Constitution over Trump\n\nMarc Short, former Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, said he felt proud of much of what was accomplished during the Trump administration, but that his boss split with the president over fighting the election results.\n\nPence refused to single-handedly reject electors, as Trump and his lawyer, John Eastman, repeatedly pressured him to do.\n\n“I think he ultimately knew that his fidelity to the Constitution was his first and foremost oath,” Short told the House panel investigating the Capitol attack in a videotaped deposition. “That's what he articulated publicly. And I think that that's what he felt.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nInvestigation remains ongoing, even as hearings begin\n\nMore information continues to pour into the committee investigation into the Jan. 6 Capitol attack is continuing, even as public hearings are ongoing.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., told the public to expect additional information to be included in the final report disclosed to the public because the committee’s investigation remains ongoing.\n\nCheney also said that the Department of Justice has been working with cooperating witnesses and so far has only disclosed some of the information it has identified.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nAdviser Jason Miller: Donald Trump didn't believe evidence he had lost\n\nA Donald Trump political adviser whose videotaped testimony popped up at the Jan. 6 hearing said the committee did not broadcast his remarks in full.\n\nIn the hearing video, Miller testified that an aide told Trump he simply did not have the votes to win the 2020 election.\n\nOn Twitter, Miller said the video was cut off before his next remarks, which were about how Trump did not believe the analysis.\n\nHe provided a transcript:\n\n\"Q: Okay. And what was the President's reaction then when Matt said to him, 'hey, we've looked at the numbers, you're going to lose'? A: I think it's safe to say he disagreed with Matt's analysis.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHead Oath Keeper:Vegas parking valet, Yale law graduate, unhinged Oath Keepers leader: Who is Stewart Rhodes?\n\nFor some DC watch party attendees, the hearing is personal\n\nTwo attendees, Whitney Williams and Raleigh Lancaster, both DC natives, say the hearing is more personal to them since they were close by when protestors breached the Capitol.\n\n\"This isn't really a place where this happens,\" says Lancaster. \"I've just never seen anything like this before.\"\n\nWilliams is retired, and is barely involved in politics. But because the attack was at her doorstep, \"it's so important,\" for her. She says she never listens to congressional hearings but tonight's hearing is different.\n\n\"It'd be a sad day for America,\" says Lancaster, if nothing comes out of the hearing.\n\n- Kenneth Tran\n\nCheney to Republicans: ‘Your dishonor will remain’\n\nIn the final remarks of her opening statement, Committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney condemned the members of her party who have chosen to look the other way on the events of Jan. 6 and the efforts that led to it.\n\n“Tonight, I say this to my Republican colleagues who are defending the indefensible,” she said. “There will come a day when Donald Trump is gone, but your dishonor will remain.”\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nCommittee shows video detailing timeline of Capitol attack\n\nAfter opening remarks, the hearing turned to a video of the Jan. 6 attack, detailing minute-by-minute how the attack unfolded led by Trump’s speech outside the White House beforehand.\n\n“I hope Mike is going to do the right thing,” Trump is shown saying. ” I hope. Because if Mike does the right thing, we win the election.”\n\nThe video detailed involvement of the far-right organization Proud Boys. It also showed communication from Capitol Police officers as rioters began to breach the building, breaking windows and storming the steps as members of Congress met to certify the 2020 electoral count.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nWidows of officers who died as result of Jan. 6 emotional watching video\n\nCapitol Police officer Harry Dunn stretched his arm out around widows Serena Liebengood and Sandra Garza as the video played of the violence unfolding on Jan. 6.\n\nLiebengood and Garza pulled out tissues and wiped away tears watching the video — their husbands Howie Liebengood and Brian Sicknick died in the aftermath of Jan 6., one by suicide and one after suffering two strokes.\n\n– Dylan Wells\n\nSean Hannity, Kayleigh McEnany wanted Trump to end 'crazy' stuff\n\nThe committee has released notable text messages from major supporters who urged then-President Donald Trump to stop claiming the 2020 election had been stolen – advice Trump has ignored to this day.\n\nA day after the Jan. 6 insurrection, talk show host Sean Hannity texted White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany about what Trump needed: \"No more crazy people\" and \"no more stolen election talk ... Many people will quit.\"\n\nMcEnany texted back: “Love that. Thank you. That is the playbook.”\n\nTrump did not heed that advice.\n\n- David Jackson\n\nMilley recalls Meadows saying ‘need to kill’ narrative that Trump wasn’t in charge\n\nMark Meadows, who served as Trump’s chief of staff, told Gen. Mark Milley, Trump’s chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that they “need to kill the narrative” that Trump was not in charge.\n\nMilley said during a video deposition that Vice President Mike Pence \"issued very explicit, very direct, unambiguous orders” to “get the military down here.\"\n\n“We need to kill the narrative that the Vice President is making all the decisions,” Milley recalled Meadows telling him in a deposition excerpt. “We need to establish the narrative that the President is still in charge and that things are steady or stable.”\n\n- Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump met with Flynn, Powell, Giuliani before tweeting “Be there, will be wild!”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump met with former aide Gen. Michael Flynn, attorney Sidney Powell, and advisor Rudy Giuliani, among others, to discuss “having the military seize voting machines and potentially rerun elections,” according to Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.\n\nThe meeting that ran late into the evening took place on Dec. 18, according to Cheney. The president met with the group alone before “White House lawyers and other staff discovered the group was there and rushed to intervene.”\n\nThe next day, Trump tweeted that there would be a big protest in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6th. “Be there, will be wild!” he told his followers.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nMore:What we don't know about Jan. 6: What Trump's family told the committee, whether attack was organized\n\nIvanka Trump accepted DOJ’s finding of no election fraud\n\nIvanka Trump, former President Donald Trump’s daughter and senior adviser, said she accepted the Justice Department’s finding of no fraud sufficient to overturn the 2020 – in contrast to her father.\n\nIvanka Trump said she trusted the finding because she respected then-Attorney General William Barr, who said he resigned in part rather than fight to overturn the election. Her conclusion contrasted to her father’s continued efforts to overturn election results.\n\n“It affected my perspective,” Ivanka Trump said. “I respect Attorney General Barr, so I accepted what he was saying.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nIvanka's take:House Jan. 6 panel shows Ivanka Trump opposing claims of 2020 election fraud, in contrast to former President Donald Trump\n\nCheney: Trump had 7-part plan to overturn the presidential election\n\nRep. Liz Cheney said former President Donald Trump “oversaw and coordinated a sophisticated 7-part plan to overturn the presidential election.”\n\nCheney said Trump wanted to prevent the transfer of presidential power. She added that evidence of each element of the plan will be laid out during the hearing.\n\n“All Americans should keep and bear in mind that on the morning of Jan. 6, President Donald Trump's intention was to remain President of the United States despite the lawful outcome of the 2020 election,” she said.\n\n- Rebecca Morin\n\nBennie Thompson: Donald Trump was \"the center of this conspiracy\"\n\nIn case there was any doubt, committee chairman Bennie Thompson made clear the night's main theme: President Donald Trump engineered a plot to steal the 2020 election from President-elect Joe Biden.\n\n\"Donald Trump was at the center of this conspiracy,\" Thompson said, describing Jan. 6 as \"the culmination of an attempted coup.\"\n\nThompson pledged to show evidence to back up his claim.\n\n- David Jackson\n\nWhat to know:Here's what you need to know about the Jan. 6 committee and its June hearings\n\nCheney: testimony will show Trump ignored aides' pleas to call off attack\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said testimony from a more than a half-dozen Trump aides that Thursday’s hearing will highlight will show that Trump ignored pleas from his staff to call off the riot because he supported it.\n\n\"In the hearings to come, President Trump believed his supporters at the Capitol, and I quote, “were doing what they should be doing,’ Cheney said. “This is what he told his staff as they pleaded with him to call off the mob.\"\n\nCheney said that evidence will also show Trump was angry at advisor who told him that he needed to be do something more even though he was aware of threats to hang Vice President Mike Pence\n\n\"The attack on our Capitol was not a spontaneous riot,” Cheney said, pointing to intelligence about the attack beforehand.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nBarr opposed Trump’s claims 2020 election was ‘stolen’\n\nFormer Attorney General William Barr told the House panel investigating the Capitol attack he resigned in December 2020 from the Trump administration rather than challenge the election results.\n\nBarr, who has said publicly the Justice Department found no widespread fraud in the 2020 election, said he met with then-President Donald Trump on Nov. 23, Dec. 1 and Dec. 14 to make it clear he didn’t agree with putting out the election was stolen.\n\n“I told the president it was bull----,” Barr said in a videotaped deposition played at the hearing. “I didn’t want to be a part of it and that’s one of the reasons that went into me leaving when I did.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nPolice officers and widows of officers who died are in attendance\n\nU.S. Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, D.C.

Bennie Thompson, will open Thursday’s hearing saying efforts to undermine the Constitution and thwart the will of the American people aren’t over, according to excerpts of his remarks.\n\nThompson, D-Miss., will say \"our democracy remains in danger\" and must be protected through the investigation of the Capitol attack. He said a series of hearings this month won’t just look backward at what happened Jan. 6, 2021, but also forward to protect the rule of law.\n\n“We can’t sweep what happened under the rug,” Thompson will say. “We must confront the truth with candor, resolve and determination.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nWho's on the panel:Meet the members of the January 6 House select committee ahead of first public hearing Thursday\n\nOpen minds but no high expectations at a DC watch party\n\nAt a watch party in the Taft Memorial Carillon hosted by the non-profit progressive consumer group Public Citizen, a couple hundred of attendees are anxiously and excitedly waiting for the long awaited Jan. 6 hearing.\n\nGlenn Daigon, from North Bethesda MD, says he doesn't want to be too excited or disappointed with how the hearing turns out: \"I don't see this as a slam dunk either way.\"\n\nBut he would like to see at least some \"indictments and convictions.\" He says if there's no accountability for the Capitol attack, \"there's no point\" in the hearings.\n\n- Kenneth Tran\n\nWhat is Donald Trump doing during the hearing?\n\nDon't expect former President Donald Trump or Vice President Mike Pence to testify –but Trump is expected to watch, according to people who have spoken with him in recent days.\n\nTrump, a prolific and mercurial watcher of television news during his four years in the White House wants to know what the special House committee, packed with political opponents, will bring out to show to the American people, particularly since he has no allies on the committee to tip him off ahead of time, said two people who have talked with him recently and spoke on condition of anonymity about private conversations.\n\nThe original panel would have included GOP allies of Trump but House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy removed all five of his choices after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected two of them.\n\n- Chelsey Cox\n\nTrump tuned in:Who will be Jan. 6 hearing's most avid viewer?

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, questioned the panel’s legitimacy and again asked its members to share the information amassed on him before he agrees to testify.\n\n“While some courts have recognized the Select Committee’s investigation as having a legitimate legislative purpose, it does not necessarily follow that the Select Committee’s subpoena to me is in furtherance of a legitimate legislative purpose,” Jordan writes in the letter, sent the day of the committee’s first public hearing.\n\nJordan is one of five GOP members subpoenaed by the select committee, alongside Reps. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania; Andy Biggs of Arizona; Mo Brooks of Alabama; and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California. Jordan has until Saturday to comply with the subpoena.\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nGet the latest politics news in your inbox:Sign up for our On Politics newsletter\n\nHouse GOP Leader McCarthy declines to address 2020 election legitimacy\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on Thursday declined to say clearly whether President Joe Biden rightfully won the 2020 election.\n\n“We’ve asked this question a long time,” McCarthy said to reporters during a press conference. “Joe Biden is the president. I think you can look that there’s a lot of problems still with the election process.”\n\nMcCarthy, who said Thursday he has answered the questions many times before, has shifted his views since the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection attempt. He suggested days after the attack that Trump resign, but has refused to cooperate with a subpoena from the committee investigating that day.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nBiden calls Jan. 6 attack a ‘flagrant violation of the Constitution’ ahead of primetime hearing\n\nPresident Joe Biden called the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol “a clear, flagrant violation of the Constitution” Thursday, hours before a House committee investigating the insurrection holds its first public hearing.\n\n“A lot of Americans are going to see for the first time some of the details that occurred,” Biden said, giving unprompted remarks on the hearing at the beginning of a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Los Angeles at the Summit of Americas.\n\n“I think these guys broke the law and tried to turn around the results an of election. There's a lot of questions - who's responsible, who's involved? I'm not going to make a judgment on that.”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nMore:Menendez: Mexico's president tried to ‘blackmail’ Biden to invite ‘dictators’ to Americas summit\n\nBill Barr met with committee about Trump’s election fraud claims\n\nA week before the first public hearing of the House Jan. 6 committee, former attorney general Bill Barr met with the panel about Trump’s claims of election fraud during the 2020 presidential election. Trump’s claims are seen by some as a catalyst for the attack on the Capitol.\n\nBarr’s meeting focused on material in his book, \"One Damn Thing After Another: Memoirs of an Attorney General.\" Though he left the Trump administration weeks before the insurrection, Barr was still the nation’s top law enforcement officer during and after the presidential election.\n\nAfter a Justice Department investigation into the fraud claims, Barr told the Associated Press in December 2020 that the agency hadn’t “seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.”\n\n- Chelsey Cox\n\nFirst 2 witnesses are injured Capitol Police officer, documentarian\n\nTwo witnesses spoke at the first hearing. One was Capitol Police Officer Caroline Edwards, who suffered a traumatic brain injury when the mob pushed her to the ground after breaking through a fence of bicycle racks outside the Capitol.\n\nShe was the first of 140 officers injured that day, according to the committee. Other officers have recalled hearing her pleas for help.\n\nThe other witness was an acclaimed British documentarian, Nick Quested, who filmed around the Capitol during the attack. The day before the riot, Quested also filmed the leaders of two far-right groups – Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, who are each charged with seditious conspiracy – meeting in a parking garage near the Capitol, according to the New York Times.\n\nMore:Who invaded the US Capitol on Jan. 6? Criminal cases shed light on offenses\n\nWhat Republicans are saying: Some blast committee as illegitimate, partisan\n\nHouse Republicans have blasted the committee as illegitimate, partisan and a sham because of how it was set up.\n\nThe heart of the complaint is that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., refused to seat GOP Reps. Jim Banks of Indiana and Jim Jordan of Ohio on the panel. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., then pulled his nominees rather than have her vet them. Pelosi then appointed nine members – including GOP Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois – rather than the 13 authorized.\n\nFederal courts have upheld the panel’s authority repeatedly. But Republicans argue the one-sided appointments mean there will be no meaningful cross-examination of witnesses or alternate views presented during hearings.\n\nWhat we don't know about Jan. 6:What Trump's family told the committee, whether attack was organized\n\nBiden plans to watch hearings\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to watch some of Thursday’s hearing despite hosting the Summit of the Americas in California, according to White House chief of staff Ron Klain.\n\nBiden waived executive privilege to give the committee access to Trump administration documents as part of the investigation.\n\n“These are important hearings,” Klain told MSNBC's \"Deadline: White House\" on Wednesday. “He believes in executive privilege generally, but there is no executive privilege to overthrow the government of the United States. There is no executive privilege to protect plans on an insurrection.”\n\nWhat kind of evidence does the committee have?\n\nThe panel collected more than 100,000 documents and more than 1,000 witnesses cooperated in the inquiry. Pictures and thousands of hours of video from security cameras and body-worn cameras on police officers illustrate how the violent mob smashed its way into the Capitol.\n\n“People have gotten information in snippets over the course of a year plus, but the fact is that we’re going to tell the story in a coherent thread through the hearings,” said a committee member, Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va. “It was a tragic event for our country that there were villains that day, of course.

But in 1987, she also was a local volunteer for the Iowa Film Office, a state government effort to lure Hollywood business to Iowa's prairie. She was deployed to crisscross the dusty gravel roads of northeast Iowa in search of the perfect example of agricultural eye candy for the silver screen.\n\nAs she crested a hill on Lansing Road just a few miles northeast of Dyersville, she spied her holy grail: a white clapboard, two-story farmhouse nestled against the hillside. A red barn tilted nearby. Plenty of cornfields embraced the little scene to frame key camera angles.\n\nSo Hollywood carved 3½ acres out of the fertile cropland into a magical place where the ghosts of baseball legends could materialize from out of the corn. \"Field of Dreams,\" which premiered in Iowa 25 years ago today, has become one of the most beloved movies in a generation and transformed this small patch of Dubuque County into Iowa's most famous farm.\n\nIt also set off a land dispute, echoing the movie's plot, that has become bigger and more bitter as the years passed.\n\nIn the film, an obsessed farmer, Ray Kinsella, played by Kevin Costner, handcrafts his remote ball diamond after a disembodied voice whispers the request inhis ear. The movie transcends sports by tapping the universal emotional resonance of a son's simple yearning to reunite with his late father — a motivation embraced by millions of people worldwide.\n\n\"Men really weep,\" Costner said of \"Field of Dreams\" in an interview earlier this year with Yahoo Movies. \"They don't cry, they weep about things gone unsaid in your life to people you love.\"\n\nSince its inception, the movie site has lingered not only as a cherished symbol but also as the epicenter of continual disputes. The latest: An Illinois couple has pushed a plan to develop the farm around the field into a massive, $74 million baseball and softball complex for traveling youth tournament teams. The proposed All-Star Ballpark Heaven has sparked feuds and lawsuits between neighbors and against the city of Dyersville.\n\nThe company behind Ballpark Heaven, Go the Distance Baseball LLC, now owns the 193 acres, but its zoning remains in dispute.\n\nResidents have shed tears in City Council meetings. They've fought public relations battles on Facebook. The Iowa Legislature stepped into the fray two years ago by offering up to $16.5 million in tax rebates for the proposed Ballpark Heaven. But financing and construction delays have pushed back the projected opening to 2015.\n\nAs debate over the physical field simmers, Costner and some fellow cast members are scheduled to return in June for the 25th anniversary celebration, appropriately enough, on Father's Day weekend.\n\nIt all started in 1987, when Riedel knocked on the door of the farmhouse, home to the family of Joe Lansing and his descendants since 1906.\n\nI took a picture of your farm, Riedel explained to Joe's grandson, bachelor farmer Don Lansing. I sent it to Universal Studios, and they might want to come here to make a movie. Would that be OK?\n\nReminiscent of the reaction of movie townsfolk to Kinsella's quest, \"He looked me in the eye,\" Riedel remembers, \"and said, 'Are you crazy?' \"\n\nLansing, 71, still is found most days on a lawn mower or tractor, tending to the Field of Dreams and his former farmstead, even though he and his wife, Becky (who met him on her own pilgrimage to the field in 1995), sold the land in 2012.\n\n\"I was born and raised here, lived here all my life,\" Lansing said, \"and one day you get a knock on the door, and it changed my life forever.\"\n\nThat knock heralded a steady stream of people in the last quarter century who have lugged their emotional baggage all the way to 28995 Lansing Road. They come to a place where their longings are distilled into indelible quotes that live on as pop culture cliches:\n\n\"Is this heaven? No, it's Iowa.\" (This is uttered twice in the movie, the second time without the \"no.\")\n\n\"Hey, Dad. Wanna have a catch?\"\n\nAnd, of course, \"If you build it, he will come.\" (\"He,\" not \"they.\") The American Film Institute in 2005 ranked the line 39th on its list of the top 100 movie quotations in American cinema. (The AFI's top quote was \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,\" from \"Gone with the Wind.\")\n\nBut as much as \"Field of Dreams\" now seems ingrained in Iowa's cultural identity, it wasn't a sure bet it would be filmed here. The filmmakers' agents scouted farms just across the state line in Nebraska and Illinois to as far away as Canada.\n\nIt was a Canadian, W.P. Kinsella, who dreamed up the tale of \"Shoeless Joe\" while enrolled at the Iowa Writers' Workshop in Iowa City, the university-town setting for his original short story and eventual 1982 novel.\n\nKinsella's love of baseball infuses his ethereal story, in which the ghost of \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson, an early 20th century outfielder and star hitter with the Chicago White Sox, appears in the present day on a fictional Iowa ball field. The real Jackson is one of baseball's tragic figures. He was among eight teammates banned from baseball, censured for accepting bribes to intentionally lose the 1919 World Series — the infamous \"Black Sox\" scandal.\n\nSelf-described \"city boy\" and filmmaker Phil Alden Robinson of Long Island, N.Y., was transfixed by Kinsella's rural fantasy. He spent several years shopping a screenplay, refining his pitch. He heightened the plot's suspense, delaying until the final scenes the ultimate purpose for building the ball diamond: a visit by Ray Kinsella's late father, John (portrayed by Dwier Brown in the movie).\n\nA more practical change also became necessary. Author J.D. Salinger of \"Catcher in the Rye\" fame was a main character in \"Shoeless Joe,\" but his attorneys made it clear, according to the filmmakers, that portraying him on screen might spur litigation. So \"out of duress,\" they invented the character Terence Mann, offered as an iconic figure of the civil rights era, said James Earl Jones, who portrayed Mann. Jones, the booming stage voice famous for Darth Vader and the \"This is CNN\" sound bite, utters the classic \"People will come, Ray\" monologue at the heart of the film.\n\n\"The producers said, 'Well, we can't use a tall white guy who writes novels,' \" Jones recalled. \" 'Let's have a character of a big black guy who's a journalist.' \"\n\nRobinson led what he describes as an \"angst-ridden\" 68-day shoot in the summer of 1988 in and around Dyersville and nearby Dubuque (a stand-in for Boston) and Galena, Ill. (substituting for Chisholm, Minn.).\n\n\"It was hot. It was dry. It was full of flies,\" Robinson said.\n\nFrom his childhood on a farm in Michigan, Jones recognized the \"sweet, acrid smell\" of hog manure.\n\nBetween takes, the cast tossed horseshoes behind Lansing's farmhouse. They went fishing.\n\nKinsella to this day praises the film version of his book but sums up the summer of 1988 in northeast Iowa with two words: \"colossal boredom.\"\n\nHe spent \"two horrible days in the gym\" in nearby Farley as an extra in the scene that shows main characters Ray and Annie in the middle of a raucous PTA meeting. (The author's daughter had a much better time that summer, Kinsella muses, thanks to \"a little romance with Ray Liotta,\" who portrayed Shoeless Joe.)\n\nIt was a drought year. So to ensure lush, green corn beyond the outfield, the crew dammed Hewitt Creek and irrigated the field. At first, the stalks weren't tall enough.\n\n\"To make the corn look as high as an elephant's thigh, they had to dig trenches between the rows so that when Kevin Costner walked down the row of corn, it was over his head,\" Jones said with a chuckle.\n\nYet toward the end of filming, the corn had shot up fast enough that Costner had to be raised on a walkway to be glimpsed among the stalks.\n\nThe crew employed every available trick to turn the corn green.\n\n\"It was the best-looking cornfield in the state that year,\" said Wendol Jarvis, founding director of the Iowa Film Office, who helped lure \"Field of Dreams\" to Iowa and dispatched Riedel to scout for farms. \"But it was all because of paint.\"\n\n\"We had a lot of fake corn on hold, in Asia,\" Robinson added, \"ready to ship it in.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe iconic final shot of the film — orchestrated by Riedel — stands as a testament to the cooperation of locals. Hollywood people told Riedel later that they thought filmmakers used special effects to create the nighttime scene of a stream of car lights. But it was patient Iowans driving 1,500 cars lined up bumper to bumper on the roads leading to the farm.\n\nThe shot illustrated how Ray's vision paid off: The field had worked its magic, and hordes of tourists had come.\n\nThat summer, Robinson, the filmmaker, was dejected, thinking he lacked the cinematographic chops to achieve a \"much more expressionistic use of camera.\" He \"would've reshot every scene\" in the movie.\n\nBut in retrospect, he doesn't regret his camera work: The film's simplicity has been a crucial factor in its charm and durability.\n\nLate Register film critic Joan Bunke lavished \"Field of Dreams\" with four out of five stars upon its release 25 years ago, praising Kevin Costner's \"subtle, superb, Jimmy Stewart-like performance ... in a story that has a true and generous Midwestern heart.\"\n\nBunke also rolled her eyes at Vanity Fair's prediction that the movie \"will probably disappear quickly.\"\n\nThe Iowa cinephile won that debate.\n\n\"Field of Dreams\" opened on just 22 screens in its debut week in April 1989, but expanded to more than 1,000 screens within the month - and stayed there for six weeks, according to the website Box Office Mojo.\n\nHollywood applauded the film from the beginning. It won one of 1989's five coveted best picture nominations from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, but ultimately lost to \"Driving Miss Daisy.\"\n\nBaseball America magazine has ranked \"Field of Dreams\" as the second-best baseball movie ever made, behind only \"Bull Durham.\" And the movie ranks No. 6 of all time on the American Film Institute's list in the fantasy genre.\n\nWhat drives its enduring resonance and its lure of pilgrims to Dyersville?\n\nFans and creators alike tend to echo variations on a theme: The film has seeped into the far corners of pop culture because at heart it's not a baseball film, and not a sports movie.\n\n\"It captures a universal human longing for reconnection,\" said W.P. Kinsella, author of \"Shoeless Joe,\" the short story and later novel that was the basis for the movie.\n\nIt's a \"confluence of spirit forces,\" as actor James Earl Jones puts it, in which you never see an actual game of baseball played.\n\n\"The whole thing was so simplified that it becomes open to eternity,\" he said.\n\nThe mythical Field of Dreams has spawned an ongoing trek of thousands of people a year to Dyersville - their motivation and the movie's meaning as individual as each visitor's heartaches, hopes and dreams.\n\nAidan Curtis of Nibley, Utah, a 22-year-old Mormon missionary who visited the field this spring: \"When (Ray Kinsella) tells the story about his father ... and not really being able to have a last catch with his father and make amends there: My father passed away when I was really young. So at the very end of the movie when they get to have that catch experience, it's really special for me.\"\n\nDyersville Mayor Alvin Haas: \"It took me several years to actually understand what the movie was really about. I thought it was about a baseball game, and I'm not really a baseball lover. But what I realized, it was more of a bonding between a father and his son. And then since I have all sons, all grandsons and no daughters, it means a lot.\"\n\nDenise Stillman, CEO of Go the Distance Baseball LLC, the company working to develop All-Star Ballpark Heaven around the movie site: \"It's about second chances, and it's about capturing a moment that you regret you may have left behind. And I think that's such a core human need, to connect with people, that the movie is all about connecting with something that's very important to you, and something you thought was lost.\"\n\nWendol Jarvis, founding director of the Iowa Film Office: \"It's a platform for reuniting and families coming back together. It allows that to happen in this magical place. And I think in real life we can make our own Field of Dreams, and if you put the effort into family and into relationships and building those and make that a focus of your life, you can do some magical things.\"\n\nSue Riedel of Dubuque, local casting director for \"Field of Dreams\": \"I think people live lives of quiet desperation, and this movie gives them hope that you can undo a wrong, or you can mend a family argument and that things have been made right.\"\n\nSince the movie's opening, Dyersville has felt the pilgrims' embrace.\n\nAnnual tourism claims for the movie site have ballooned as high as 100,000 or more, but the most widely accepted estimates have cited 7,000 visitors the year of the film's opening to a peak of perhaps 65,000. Statistics are understandably fuzzy: There never has been an admission charge, and not every tourist signs the guest book or purchases a souvenir.\n\nThe signature architecture on Dyersville's downtown skyline remains the 126-year-old Basilica of St. Francis Xavier, renovated for $1 million in 2001. Its twin Gothic steeples poke more than 200 feet heavenward, topped by white crosses.\n\nDyersville also has cultivated a reputation as the \"Farm Toy Capital of the World,\" home to Ertl (now Tomy) and other toy manufacturers and the National Farm Toy Museum, built in 1986.\n\nAnd today, a white plume routinely billows at the northwest corner of town from a 110 million-gallon ethanol plant built in 2008.\n\nBut the Field of Dreams is what put Dyersville, population 4,086, on the map.\n\nIt \"transformed the town from just another small town with a big church,\" said Mike English, the longest-serving member of the current City Council and the Irish owner of downtown's English Pub. \"It gave us a lot of visitors.\"\n\nA story this spring in Atlantic magazine observed that it's bizarre for such wholesome sentiment to be attached to a fake field built in the middle of nowhere by a movie studio hungry for profit.\n\nBut if we've learned anything from the Chicago Cubs (winless in World Series since 1908) and their storied Wrigley Field, celebrating its centennial year, it's that the atmosphere and sense of place in baseball and the yearning that fans bring to the ballpark often matter more than what transpires on the field.\n\nAs Councilman English said of baseball landmarks: \"If you're going to go see the shrines, you see the Field of Dreams, Fenway Park (in Boston) and Wrigley Field, right?\"\n\nA Des Moines Register Iowa Poll 20 years ago ranked six of Iowa's staple contributions to American art, literature and music. \"Field of Dreams\" was the clear winner, cited as the favorite by 30 percent of residents, compared to \"The Music Man\" musical and movie (21 percent), Grant Wood's \"American Gothic\" painting (20 percent), the \"Bridges of Madison County\" book (13 percent, the year before the film adaptation was released), \"State Fair\" movie and musical (7 percent) and the \"A Thousand Acres\" book (1 percent).\n\nJarvis, formerly of the Iowa Film Office, remembers a visit one spring morning the year the film was released. Don Lansing, who at the time owned the farm where the field was built, \"had nailed a Folgers coffee can to the bench out there and was accepting donations for people to fund (the field). He had thrown out some baseballs and some bats. And people were just showing up from all over the world. You had people from Tokyo and Chicago and Massachusetts all out there - didn't know each other - playing baseball.\"\n\n\"I knew I was going to keep it after I saw the movie,\" Lansing said. \"I came home and I said to myself, 'I'm going to keep it for my neighbors, friends and relatives just to come out here and play ball and have a great time.'\" It's just that his extended family, he added with a grin, has \"grown tremendously\" since 1989.\n\nDiehard gawkers visit the field even in the depths of winter.\n\nThe site officially opened for the season this spring on a cold April 1 with gale-force winds. The first visitor was a man from Tokyo who drove a car with Texas plates and got out to spend a reflective moment standing on the pitcher's mound.\n\nHis comment in the guest book was succinct: \"Nice!!\"\n\nJason and Jennifer Ostrenga and their three kids from Sun Prairie, Wis., also arrived that blustery opening day. They had planned their spring break vacation around the movie site.\n\n\"Bases loaded. Their No. 3 hitter's up. It comes down to this,\" Jason Ostrenga said as he slapped his baseball glove and crouched down at home plate so that his oldest of three sons, Addison, 10, could wind up for a dramatic pitch.\n\nThe frigid wind howled. There were no other players on the diamond, let alone a batter. But that didn't seem to matter for yet another father and son caught up in their own moment on the fabled field.\n\nIowa may have the corner on America's most revered, perennially watched feel-good films: \"Field of Dreams.\"\n\nYet the past 25 years in Dyersville have roiled with controversy among the corn.\n\nDwier Brown, who portrayed Kevin Costner's ghostly father and has written a new memoir titled \"If You Build It ...,\" points out that the film's plot \"ends conveniently before the people arrive at the field.\"\n\n\"It's one of the great things about movies that they can sort of create this fantasy that doesn't exactly conform to the way people are, and the way laws are, and the way rules are,\" Brown said.\n\nIn other words, the messy aftermath — the dreary practicalities of how to cope with a rural landmark that has drawn waves of tourists for 25 years — have been left to Dyersville.\n\n\"Field of Dreams\" director Phil Alden Robinson said he almost could return to town and shoot a Preston Sturges-style film in which \"we ruin the lives of everybody we come in touch with.\"\n\nThat might be hyperbole. But bitter conflict also is hard-wired into the original script: Ray Kinsella (played by Kevin Costner) follows the urgings of a mysterious voice who commands that he plow up his cornfield to build a baseball diamond. Ray's brother-in-law (played by Timothy Busfield) mocks the idealistic farmer for building the field and tries to force Ray to sell his land.\n\nToday, a pair of driveways still leads from Lansing Road to the field — a remnant of the site's formerly split ownership.\n\nThe field was built on the west side of Don Lansing's farmhouse so that the view from the porch would capture the setting sun. That required encroaching on the farm of neighbors Al and Rita Ameskamp, whose land occupied most of left and center field.\n\nThe Ameskamps initially plowed up their portion in 1989, the year the movie was released, to replant it with corn, a move that inspired so much outcry that the late Al Ameskamp vowed never to repeat his mistake.\n\n\"I goofed it up one time,\" he said in an interview for the 1998 documentary \"Dreamfield.\" \"I made it right. Lord knows if I ever do it again by God, though, I'll have to leave the country.\"\n\nLansing and his wife, Becky, sparred with the Ameskamps in and out of court. But the movie site in the early years also played host to big events, including celebrity games produced by sports trading card company Upper Deck that featured such Major League greats as Reggie Jackson.\n\nA team of \"Ghost Players\" was formed as the \"greatest show on dirt,\" made up of local ball players seen in the film. The team will be back at the movie site this year.\n\nAs the 1990s wore on, the two families ended up with competing souvenir stands on opposite sides of the field. But eventually, in 2007, the Lansings purchased left and center field from the Ameskamps.\n\nIt turns out their rivalry was tame compared to the battle ahead, after the Lansings put the 193 acres up for sale in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, a couple from Oak Lawn, Ill., Mike and Denise Stillman, emerged to buy the farm for $3.4 million and closed on the deal at the end of 2012. They introduced a proposal to develop All-Star Ballpark Heaven, which evolved into plans for a $74 million youth sports complex with 24 fields, team bunkhouses, an Olympic swimming pool and an indoor practice dome for the winter months. The initial $24 million first phase is designed to include just six fields, including a stadium to seat 5,000 people.\n\nFor Dyersville, there's the promise of 90 jobs, 30 of them year-round.\n\nDenise Stillman, president and CEO of Go the Distance Baseball LLC, professes to love the movie and the diamond, and proposed the development as a way to finance preservation of the movie site.\n\n\"Economics what they are, you can't do it just by selling T-shirts,\" Stillman said.\n\n\"I'd rather have more people enjoy it and give younger kids a reason to come,\" she said of baseball and softball tournaments. \"Because to keep it relevant, you need the kids to be here so they grow up and they bring their kids. And they won't in 20, 30 years if there's no other reason for them to come. We've got to keep the movie alive, like 'The Wizard of Oz.'\"\n\nBallpark Heaven would leave the movie site untouched, including a strip of corn from 300 to 500 feet wide around the outfield.\n\nFormer Dyersville Mayor Jim Heavens thought he had \"hit the jackpot\" with the Stillmans — particularly when the couple agreed to pay for the necessary $3 million extension of city utilities to their proposed project.\n\n\"Instead of hitting the jackpot,\" Heavens reflects, \"I hit an iceberg and started to sink and didn't know it.\"\n\nVoters ousted Heavens and three council members in last November's elections. Depending on whom you ask, the Field of Dreams controversy was either significant in the 40 percent voter turnout or was a red herring for other issues.\n\nMany agree, however, that the sale and proposed revamp of the Lansing farm created new fault lines for debate: Would building around the Field of Dreams ensure its survival, or shatter its essential pastoral charm? Is Ballpark Heaven a rare opportunity for rural economic development, or has the city encroached on local farmers?\n\nOpposition has run the gamut from fears over heavy traffic to concern for how water runoff from the ball fields and parking lots will affect Hewitt Creek Watershed.\n\nThe most vocal opposition has been a coalition of Field of Dreams neighbors known as the Residential and Agricultural Advisory Committee, which has sued Dyersville over the site's rezoning. Go the Distance also sued the committee for defamation and interference with the project, and the committee countersued.\n\n\"Here was going to be, in our standards, an amusement park plopped in the middle of what used to be called heaven,\" said Matt Mescher, 49, who lives next door to the Field of Dreams on 6 1/2 acres of what previously was the 100-acre Ameskamp farm. From his backyard, he can hear \"every crack of the bat\" at the movie site.\n\nMescher and his allies emphasize that their primary beef is not with Ballpark Heaven but with the city for what they consider illegal rezoning of the Lansing farm from agricultural to commercial property. They would like to see the ballpark built along U.S. Highway 20.\n\nThe committee's lawsuit against Dyersville over the rezoning awaits a ruling from a judge in Dubuque. Lawsuits that Go the Distance and the committee filed against each other have been dropped.\n\nThe lawsuits, Stillman acknowledges, have \"deterred investors, several high-profile investors who just don't want to deal with small-town politics.\"\n\nYet she still cites 20 equity investors in the project, more than half of them Iowans (per requirements of a $16.5 million state tax rebate granted by the Legislature) and with notable names such as Hall of Famer Wade Boggs and former \"Friends\" star Matthew Perry.\n\nStillman, who has an MBA from Northwestern University, divides her time between Dyersville and the Chicago suburbs, where her two children live. She has persevered with the project for nearly four years despite hurdles that have included a recent divorce.\n\nDyersville's new mayor, Al Haas, does not oppose Ballpark Heaven and doesn't think the rezoning was illegal. If the court rules against the city, Haas said, he would be willing to try to pass rezoning again under new criteria.\n\n\"I don't think I have any choice,\" Haas said. \"I would do that for any other business, to give them every opportunity to realize their full potential whatever they wanted to do.\"\n\n\"I just wish we'd have done more talking and more communication before we got to the lawsuit stage,\" he said. \"Now we're there, now nobody can talk. …\n\n\"Give me a 12-pack of beer and a picnic table and a couple hours of the afternoon, and maybe we could settle some of this.\"\n\nBoth sides acknowledge that a major diplomatic breakthrough is unlikely before the court ruling. Ballpark Heaven, meanwhile, opens its first tournaments this spring on the leased fields of the Dubuque Sports Complex, with additional programming for kids and coaches at the movie site.\n\n\"We've got each other's cellphone (numbers), but there's really no communication at this point,\" Mescher said. \"There's probably lack of trust going both ways between us.\"\n\nW.P. Kinsella, the man who gave birth to what arguably is Iowa's most beloved story, is in the middle of a couple of novels — \"one last kick at the cat,\" as he puts it. He faces his 79th birthday next month with about one-sixth of his kidney function after a lifetime of diabetes.\n\nHe's less reverent of the movie site than many of his disciples.\n\n\"Being a writer who works for a living, I always would have charged admission,\" Kinsella said. \"Ten dollars a carful isn't going to hurt anybody.\"\n\nBut he hasn't paid to attend a baseball game since the 1994-95 Major League strike infuriated him that millionaires had ruined his beloved American pastime. (He has, however, been watching Toronto Blue Jays games on TV this season.)\n\nThe movie's director, Phil Alden Robinson, wishes the field would be plowed up to grow corn again and feed people.\n\n\"I have no feeling about it that it needs to be preserved as a shrine at all,\" he said. \"Movies are ephemeral. I kind of like the idea of sort of nature taking over again.\"\n\nBut it would take a fearless iconoclast to tear into the field. If Al Ameskamp were still here, he would tell you that.\n\nEven before filming was complete in 1988, Universal pitched a plan for the field to Wendol Jarvis, then head of the Iowa Film Office, who had helped entice \"Field of Dreams\" to Iowa. The studio offered to purchase the field and donate it to the state as a public park — an idea that fizzled.\n\nIf the plan had come to fruition, would the last quarter century of turmoil have been avoided, or merely transferred to lawmakers and administrators in Des Moines?\n\nOn a sunny Saturday earlier this month at the Field of Dreams, a young couple from Ohio stood on the edge of the outfield and stared out across stubble that will give way soon to yet another corn crop. A graduate student in chemical engineering, Matt Gallovic, 29, marked his first visit to the site of his favorite childhood film and stood there alongside his girlfriend, Elif Miskioglu.\n\n\"It just kind of felt surreal to be out in that outfield,\" Gallovic said, \"staring out into the unknown.\"\n\nIn both the book and film, the edge of the outfield represents the gateway between our world and the next — the afterlife, heaven, call it what you will.\n\n\"Field of Dreams\" the fictional drama explores how we pine for the people we miss and reflect on our own unrealized hopes.\n\n\"Field of Dreams\" the real-life drama reminds us how we must learn to live with the people and problems we'd rather avoid.\n\nFor the site's pilgrims, though, even after 25 years, a brief escape from the everyday to a ball diamond in rural Iowa is heaven enough.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/04/19"}]}

In an article for The Sun, Hancock argued that reality TV was a “powerful tool to get our message heard by younger generations” and said he wanted to promote support for children with dyslexia, having himself been diagnosed with the learning difficulty.\n\nHis local West Suffolk Conservative Association has described his decision as a “serious error of judgement”. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that MPs should be “working hard for their constituents, whether that is in the House or in their constituency”, while fellow Tory MP Tim Loughton said Hancock was being an “absolute prat”.\n\nWhat is Hancock’s background?\n\nHancock was born in Chester, Cheshire, in 1978, and went to school in the area. He read philosophy, politics and economic at Oxford University’s Exeter College before completing an MPhil in economics at Christ’s College, Cambridge.\n\nAfter working for a Tory bankbencher and at the Bank of England, his first foray into politics was in 2005, when he worked as an advisor for the then shadow chancellor George Osborne. Writing in The Independent, chief political commentator John Rentoul described Hancock as “energetic, clever, and a bit Tiggerish”.\n\nHancock became the member of parliament for West Suffolk in 2010 and worked in numerous ministerial roles under David Cameron and Theresa May before his “big break came in early 2018”, said the BBC. He was made culture, media and sport secretary in May’s cabinet reshuffle in January 2018, but was only in the job for six months before being made health secretary, succeeding Jeremy Hunt.\n\n‘Into the limelight’ before an ‘abrupt exit’\n\nHaving unsuccessfully bid to become Tory leader following May’s resignation in 2019, Hancock backed Boris Johnson as a candidate and was “among a handful of ministers to keep their roles”, said the BBC.", "authors": ["Richard Windsor"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/958401/quiz-of-the-week-29-october-4-november", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 29 October – 4 November | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

Sometimes this can enrage the adviser.\n\nFor instance, said the Daily Mail, Geidt’s predecessor, Sir Alex Allan, “stormed off” after Johnson found that Priti Patel had not breached the code, despite Allan’s conclusion that she had not “consistently met the high standards expected of her”.\n\nWho is Geidt?\n\nChristopher Edward Wollaston MacKenzie Geidt grew up on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides.

The U.S. Department of Justice, in a news release, said the state’s foster care program has illegally placed hundreds of students with disabilities into “segregated and inferior educational programs,” a direct violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. “Students with disabilities in Alabama’s foster care system are among the most vulnerable in the state’s care, and they deserve better than placement in segregated and inferior schools,” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, of the department’s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. “The Civil Rights Division will defend every child’s right to equal educational opportunities in schools where they can be supported and challenged.” The department’s findings follow an investigation into allegations that the state denies children in foster care equal opportunity to basic educational services on the basis of disability. Gina Maiola, communications director for Gov. Kay Ivey, said in a statement that the Alabama State Department of Education and the Department of Human Resources have been “working proactively since 2018 to address the needs of our specialized treatment centers.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy has indicated he will vote in favor of calling a convention to consider amending the state’s constitution. Candidates for governor at an Alaska Resource Development Council forum Tuesday were asked during a “lightning round” if they would be voting for a constitutional convention in next month’s general election. Candidates responded by raising “yes” or “no” signs, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Dunleavy and Republican Charlie Pierce raised “yes” signs. Former Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, and Les Gara, a Democrat, raised “no” signs. Voters are asked every 10 years if there should be a constitutional convention. While the question has in the past been soundly defeated, both sides of the debate have been preparing for a fight this year. Some convention supporters see an opening to push for one amid public frustration with years of political fighting over what size check should be paid to residents from Alaska’s oil-wealth fund. During a convention, delegates typically have free reign to propose revisions – or even entirely new constitutions – that would then go back to voters for ratification. Some of those pursuing a convention would like to restrict abortion or alter the process for selecting judges in a way that critics say could make the process more partisan.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state can move forward with the execution of death row inmate Murray Hooper next month, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled Wednesday. The high court granted the motion for a warrant of execution of the 76-year-old. He will die by lethal injection or gas in an execution scheduled for Nov. 16, according to the warrant signed by four justices. The other three recused themselves. Kelly Culshaw, an assistant federal public defender representing Hooper, reiterated that he has maintained his innocence in the double slayings on New Year’s Eve in 1980. Hooper was convicted and sentenced “based on corrupt police practices and unreliable witness testimony,” Culshaw said in a statement. “No physical evidence links him to the crime and Mr. Hooper’s execution should not be carried out until an analysis of key fingerprint and DNA evidence, which was scientifically unavailable at the time of his trial, has been completed,” she wrote. Hooper’s defense team filed a petition in September in Maricopa County Superior Court requesting post-conviction DNA and other forensic testing. Defense attorneys say a witness’s description of the assailants changed several times before she identified Hooper, who claimed not to be in Arizona at the time. They also allege criminal informants who helped implicate Hooper were influenced by incentives from the police.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The sounds of the DC and Marvel cinematic universes will be on display this weekend as the Fort Smith Symphony offers its “Symphonic Superheroes” concert. “It’s an exciting weekend because we have so much going on,” said John Jeter, symphony conductor. The concert is slated to begin at 7 p.m. Saturday at the ArcBest Performing Arts Center. Music from the movies “Robin Hood,” “X-Men,” “The Amazing Spider-Man,” “Wonder Woman,” “Mission Impossible III,” “Captain America,” “Batman/The Dark Knight,” “Transformers,” “Black Panther” and “Iron Man” will be featured. “It’s all very, very exciting stuff,” Jeter said. “The kids will really love it.” There is prominent brass and percussion parts in the symphony, adding drama to the sound, with African and Japanese percussion instruments in the mix too. The symphony will be followed by an after-party for audience members at the Bakery District with live music by the Kool Cats Jazz Quartet. And on Monday, fifth graders may get to see their first symphony with “Earquake” concerts for schoolchildren at the ArcBest PAC. It will be a busy day for the orchestra Monday, with the Indigenous composer chamber music concert at Propak on Garrison at 7 p.m.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state again pushed back its decision on whether to list the western Joshua tree as threatened after a unanimous vote Wednesday by the Fish and Game Commission. The decision to move back the vote until at least February comes months after the commission deadlocked on whether the native desert plant should be protected under the California Endangered Species Act. Since the tree is still under consideration to be listed as threatened, no one can remove it without authorization from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Before the commission’s split vote in June, the Department of Fish and Wildlife sent letters to Indigenous tribes with traditional ties to the area where the western Joshua trees live. That outreach resulted in six responses from tribal nations, said Director Chuck Bonham. In August, tribal members talked about the cultural and ecological significance of the tree on a Zoom call with Bonham and others. “I actually would love more time to keep the conversation alive with the nations themselves,” Bonham said. In 2019, the Center for Biological Diversity petitioned for the tree to be listed as threatened in order to protect it from hotter temperatures, intensifying drought and development threats. Commissioners said they need more time to hear from tribal leaders and to allow tribal governments to consult again before the commission can make a final decision.\n\nColorado\n\nLeadville: A Utah-based Native American tribe that frequently has sparred with President Joe Biden criticized the White House again for not adequately consulting its leaders ahead of this week’s creation of a national monument on ancestral lands in Colorado. The Ute Indian Tribe is one of three Ute tribes in the West that share ancestral ties but operate independently. Representatives from the other two in Colorado – the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute – were on board with the plan and attended Wednesday’s ceremony with Biden but didn’t speak on stage. Biden and others addressed the significance of the land to tribes at length, and the White House’s official proclamation included a mention of Ute burial sites in the area. But the Ute Indian Tribe, which has nearly 3,000 members on lands in an area known for oil and gas operations in eastern Utah, claimed in a news release late Wednesday that it wasn’t on board with the plan. The tribe’s Business Committee, which serves as its governing body, said in the statement it was made aware of the new monument only a few days ago in a phone call with the White House, given scant details and little time to provide feedback. Melvin J. Baker, chairman of the Southern Ute Indian Tribal Council, noted that for centuries, the Camp Hale area was home to Ute people, and it remains culturally important to the Utes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBristol: Two police officers shot dead Wednesday night were apparently drawn into an ambush by an emergency call about possible domestic violence, authorities said Thursday. A third officer was wounded in the gunfire. State police said in a release that the 911 call the night prior about a dispute between two siblings appears to have been “a deliberate act to lure law enforcement to the scene” in Bristol. Bristol Police Sgt. Dustin Demonte and Officer Alex Hamzy were killed. Officer Alec Iurato was injured. Police said suspect Nicholas Brutcher, 35, was shot dead, and brother Nathan Brutcher was wounded. The surviving brother, 32, was hospitalized, and it wasn’t immediately clear whether he or his family had an attorney or someone else who can speak for them. The deadly encounter came during a week when at least 11 police officers have been shot around the country. Connecticut State Police said they were still working to answer many questions that remained about the confrontation. Neighbors said they heard two or three sets of gunshots, about 30 in all. “I heard a whole war going on behind me,” said Danny Rodriguez, who said he was outside his home across the street when the gunfire rang out. It was so intense that he could smell gunpowder in the air, he said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Anyone planning to drive through the city on Interstate 95 south this weekend will need to find a different route starting Friday morning, the Delaware Department of Transportation said. As part of the ongoing “Restore the Corridor” project, the highway will be closed between the U.S. Route 202 and the Second Street on-ramp from 9 a.m. Friday until 5 a.m. Tuesday. Drivers coming from Pennsylvania should use I-495 south to bypass Wilmington. All local traffic will be directed to exit I-95 onto U.S. Route 202 and then to take Delaware Route 141 south back onto I-95. Delays and heavier traffic are expected around all detours. By closing part of the highway, construction workers can pave and strip the road, install lighting and build guardrails more safely and quickly. And while it may inconvenience drivers, Department of Transportation spokesperson C.R. McLeod said the road closure represents the “final stretch of major work.” Construction on I-95 in Wilmington, which has been ongoing since early 2021, is slated to wrap up by the end of this year, which is earlier than expected. “The end is within sight,” McLeod said. A similar closure of I-95 north is slated for the last weekend of October.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district filed a lawsuit in D.C. Superior Court on Thursday against chemical manufacturer Velsicol Chemical LLC, claiming it violated city environmental laws by polluting a major waterway, the Anacostia River and the surrounding area for decades. In a complaint filed by D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, the city alleges that Velsicol produced a pesticide that contained chlordane and marketed it to low-income homeowners in the city from 1945 to 1988. That was the year the chemical was banned for sale in the U.S. by the Environmental Protection Agency over health effects in humans, including tremors, convulsions and cancer. But Racine claimed at a press conference that Velsicol knew long before that that chlordane could cause cancer, as far back as 1959, yet still sold products that contained the chemical. Velsicol did not immediately return calls for comment. As recently as the 1960s, D.C. residents used the Anacostia River for recreation and food, but years of pollution from a variety of sources – sewage, chemical runoff and litter – made the river unusable. The lawsuit developed out of a decades­long effort to clean up the river, Racine said. Local environmentalists, like Matt Gravatt, chair of the D.C. chapter of the Sierra Club, said the river is almost back to being safe for public use, but not yet.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday issued an executive order expanding voting access for the midterm elections in three counties where Hurricane Ian destroyed polling places and displaced thousands of people. The move, which followed requests from Lee, Charlotte and Sarasota counties and voting rights groups, comes as Florida begins to undertake a massive recovery from the Category 4 hurricane that hit Sept. 28 and leveled parts of the state’s southwest. The order extends the number of early voting days in the three counties and authorizes election supervisors to designate additional early voting locations, steps that allow voters to cast ballots at any polling place in their registered county from Oct. 24 through Nov. 8. Election supervisors can relocate or consolidate polling places if necessary. The order also waives training requirements for poll workers and suspends a signature requirement for voters requesting to have a mail ballot sent to an address different from the one election officials have on file. DeSantis has faced questions over what steps he would take to ensure voting access in the heavily damaged southwest part of the state, which has leaned conservative in recent elections. The Republican governor, who is up for reelection, has made tightening election laws a top priority over the past two years as he and others in the GOP reacted to ex-President Donald Trump’s baseless claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: An Atlanta-area sheriff stands accused of punishing detainees by having them strapped into a restraint chair for hours even though they posed no threat and obeyed instructions. Now a jury must decide whether he violated the men’s civil rights. A federal grand jury in April 2021 indicted Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill, saying he violated the civil rights of four people in his custody. Three more alleged victims were added in subsequent indictments. Prosecutors say placing the seven men in restraint chairs was unnecessary, was improperly used as punishment, and caused pain and bodily injury. Jury selection was set to begin Wednesday, and the trial is expected to last at least two weeks. Hill calls himself “The Crime Fighter” and uses Batman imagery on social media and in campaign ads. He has been a divisive figure – attracting both fans and critics – since he first became sheriff in 2005. This will be his second trial on criminal charges. The voters of Clayton County returned him to office in 2012 while he was under indictment, accused of using his office for personal gain – charges he ultimately beat. Hill and his lawyers have said his prosecution is baseless and politically motivated.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An Oahu project aimed at at-risk youth has won a $20 million grant in a global challenge from the Kellogg Foundation, HawaiiNewsNow reports. Multiple nonprofit agencies running out of the Kawailoa Youth and Family Wellness Center will receive the money over the next eight years, providing services surrounding a juvenile correctional site, according to the outlet.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A nuclear waste treatment plant designed to treat 900,000 gallons of sodium-bearing, radioactive waste that has had numerous setbacks will likely start operating in early December, a U.S. Department of Energy official said Wednesday. Connie Flohr, manager of the Idaho Cleanup Project for the Energy Department’s Office of Environmental Management, told state officials the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit at the department’s 890-square-mile site that includes the Idaho National Laboratory has successfully completed test runs with a simulant material. “We have every confidence that we will be operating in December,” she told members of the Leadership in Nuclear Energy Commission during an online meeting. The commission makes recommendations to the governor regarding policies to support the viability and mission of the Idaho National Laboratory and other nuclear industries in the state. Commission members, appointed by the governor, include state lawmakers, local government elected officials, university officials and others. The lab, one of 17 Energy Department national labs, is the nation’s top advanced nuclear energy research lab and one of the state’s largest employers with about 5,000 workers. It’s a huge economic driver in the state, especially in eastern Idaho, bringing in millions of federal research dollars.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Seven months after it purchased a former Pillsbury Mills plant, the nonprofit group responsible for clearing the property provided a first look at progress made on the site Wednesday prior to a public meeting. Chris Richmond, president of Moving Pillsbury Forward and a former Springfield fire marshal, hosted the tour of the vacant site, showing off a series of buildings deemed safe for showcasing to small groups. Richmond displayed several artifacts found during cleanup of the property conducted over the summer, including tools, a map of the property from 1966, handmade grain scoops and chairs, and an old Pillsbury’s Best flour sack. “The wrenches are the kind you would have seen pre-World War II,” Richmond said. “I’m sure these are 75 years or older.” Richmond and his organization completed their purchase of the property in March, with environmental testing and cleanup of the site being conducted throughout the summer. The property was home to a thriving grain and flour plant that had thousands of employees at its peak in the 1950s before a significant decline. When Pillsbury sold the plant to Cargill in 1991, about 350 workers were there, with 200 of them being transferred to Tennessee as part of a company restructuring.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state Supreme Court issued an order Wednesday that prevents the state from enforcing a Republican-backed abortion ban while it considers whether the ban violates the state constitution. The court said in the order that it was taking over appeals of a judge’s decision last month that blocked the law a week after it took effect. It denied a request from the state attorney general’s office to set aside the preliminary injunction and scheduled a hearing on the lawsuit filed by abortion clinic operators for Jan. 12. Owen County Judge Kelsey Hanlon blocked the law from being enforced, writing that “there is reasonable likelihood that this significant restriction of personal autonomy offends the liberty guarantees of the Indiana Constitution” and that the clinics will prevail in the lawsuit. The ban was approved by the Republican-dominated Legislature on Aug. 5 and signed by GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb. That made Indiana the first state to enact tighter abortion restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated federal abortion protections by overturning Roe v. Wade in June. The five-member Indiana Supreme Court – all the justices were appointed by Republican governors – did not explain its decision. The order, signed by Chief Justice Loretta Rush, said “a majority” of the court agreed with its provisions but gave no further details.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Domestic violence deaths in the state are on the decline this year after spikes in 2020 and 2021. Between January and August, 12 people were killed in domestic violence incidents, the Iowa Attorney General’s Office announced. That compares to 17 deaths over the same period in 2021. Iowa had seen a spike in domestic violence fatalities over the prior two years, according to figures collected by the attorney general’s office. There were 17 deaths in all of 2020 – at that time the most Iowa had seen in a decade. More violent still was 2021, with 20 deaths in total. The deadliest year on record since 1995 was 2006, with 22 killings. State officials have attributed the 2020 and 2021 increases to the stresses on families during the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2021, Sandi Tibbetts Murphy, director of the Attorney General’s Crime Victim Assistance Division, noted that people in unsafe relationships had fewer options to cope with them under lockdown conditions. “Some victims can’t leave their homes, and services haven’t been as accessible,” Tibbetts Murphy said in a news release. “These issues have limited the ability to serve victims. And sadly, research has shown when services are limited, we see a rise in domestic violence homicides.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Alex Red Corn was dining out with his children one day in Salina when a bus full of student-athletes from Liberal High School pulled up and showed his children the kind of discrimination that still exists in dozens of Kansas high schools. “I was sitting at an Applebee’s, and the Liberal Redskins came into town,” he said. “A whole bus full of Liberal Redskins-themed stuff was surrounding us at the restaurant, and my kids were there, and there was a level of discomfort there.” But that’s a daily reality for the estimated 10,000 Kansas students who are Native American and either attend or are in the same athletic leagues of schools with disparaging, racist Native American imagery, said Red Corn, an assistant professor of educational leadership at Kansas State University and a member of the Osage Nation. Months after the Kansas State Board of Education helped organize a committee to address severe deficiencies in the education of and for Native American people, the group returned Tuesday with an initial proposal to have the state board formally recommend all Kansas high schools remove any Native American-themed mascot and imagery. The board had helped create the group after Education Commissioner Randy Watson made disparaging comments toward Native Americans in February.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Startup bourbon producer Jackson Purchase Distillery is boosting its investment. The company will increase its distilling operation investment in Fulton County in western Kentucky to nearly $26 million and create 54 full-time jobs, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Jackson Purchase’s project has grown from an initially planned investment of $8.76 million and 30 jobs. Last year, the company’s management group acquired an unused distilling facility, the governor’s office said in a news release. To bolster the nearly complete distillery, company leaders began an expansion that will involve purchasing additional land, constructing barrel storage and making upgrades throughout the facility. “Kentucky’s bourbon and spirits industry continues to see tremendous growth,” Beshear said. “This is not possible without the support of companies like Jackson Purchase Distillery, which is tripling its original investment in this project and creating nearly double the number of quality jobs.” The distillery will produce in excess of 60,000 barrels annually once fully operational.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Transparency in reporting incidents of violence and other problems at the city’s long-troubled jail has improved recently, but only slightly, a federal judge told sheriff’s office officials Wednesday. U.S. District Magistrate Judge Michael North held a status conference on efforts to bring the Orleans Justice Center into compliance with mandated reforms. Those measures are required under a 2013 court-backed agreement involving the U.S. Justice Department, inmate advocates and the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office. North applauded the improvements, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports, but he warned Sheriff Susan Hutson that her administration still has a way to go in terms of transparency. North said the sheriff’s office has started sending the court weekly reports about jail incidents, including acts of violence, overdoses and suicide attempts. But he said more needs to be done. “We still have no information as to what’s being done to investigate these problems and why they continue to happen,” North said shortly before ordering the sheriff’s office to submit a proposal to the court for how it will share information about its investigations and prevention plans.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A former Navy SEAL who’s seeking to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree apologized for comparing federal fisheries regulators to rapists, saying the statement was “over the top.” Republican Ed Thelander was called out during a debate Wednesday evening for remarks he made earlier in the day attacking the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration during a rally for Maine’s lobster industry. “NOAA wants to rape you and your family, and they are saying pick a child,” he said. “You don’t negotiate with a rapist, and that’s what’s happening.” Pingree said during the debate that Thelander’s comments were not productive and dragged the discussion “down into the gutter.” “My comments were over the top, and I apologize for that,” Thelander said. “I’m very passionate about it. I love those families. I’m seeing the struggles they have, and nothing has been done about it.” Pingree, who lives in an island community on North Haven, disputed Thelander’s claim that nothing was being done as Maine officials fight regulations aimed at protecting right whales that could harm lobstermen. “Don’t say I’m not passionate about it,” she said. The debate in Maine’s 1st Congressional District touched on immigration, the economy, energy, abortion, education and other topics.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: An appeals court refused Wednesday to intervene in a lower court’s decision to free a man who served more than 20 years in prison for the killing of a high school student, a case chronicled by the groundbreaking “Serial” podcast. The state Court of Special Appeals issued its order a day after prosecutors dropped charges against Adnan Syed in the 1999 killing of 18-year-old Hae Min Lee, saying DNA evidence excluded him as a suspect. Circuit Court Judge Melissa Phinn ruled last month that the state had violated its legal obligation to share evidence that could have bolstered Syed’s defense. Phinn ordered Syed’s release from prison and gave prosecutors 30 days to decide whether to retry him or drop the charges. Lee’s family asked the Court of Special Appeals – Maryland’s intermediate appellate court – to halt the case and suspend the deadline that Phinn set for prosecutors to decide whether to drop the charges. They argued they didn’t get adequate notice of the hearing at which Phinn ruled. A lawyer for Lee’s family said they wanted the judge to hold another hearing they could attend and address the court. But a three-judge panel from the appeals court rejected the family’s request in a two-page order. The panel gave Lee’s family 15 days to argue why their appeal isn’t moot given that the case against Syed has been dropped.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Boston Common, America’s oldest public park, is getting a multimillion-dollar makeover that includes an expanded visitors’ center, more restrooms, additional sports facilities, and even a sit-down restaurant at the famed Frog Pond, city officials announced Wednesday. The goal is to make the 50-acre swath of green space in the heart of the city more welcoming, convenient, fun and accessible for both city residents and tourists. “Boston Common’s gorgeous tree-lined paths and open spaces have hosted so many moments marked in history, from shaping our collective conscience to celebrating our communities,” Mayor Michelle Wu said in a statement. “We’re excited to be sharing a plan that honors the Common’s history, reflects the community’s vision, and creates a space that will be more accessible, more resilient, and more inclusive for generations to come.” The Common was founded in 1634 and draws millions of people per year. It has been used as a place for public executions, as a pasture, and as a military training field, according to the nonprofit group Friends of the Public Garden, which helped develop the Boston Common Master Plan. More recently it has hosted civil rights marches, Vietnam War protests and a 1979 Catholic Mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II and attended by an estimated 400,000 people during a soaking rainstorm. It was also the site of huge protests in 2020 against police brutality.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: Prosecutors raised concerns Wednesday about a female juror who apparently has been smiling at one of three men on trial in connection with a plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020. Judge Thomas Wilson said he, too, noticed it and pledged to pay “close attention” to the juror. He said the expressions didn’t appear to be a reaction to testimony. “She is in my direct view,” Wilson said. “So I am often looking right at her while I’m listening to the witness testify. … I’ve seen smiles come out of her face. Not great big smiles but more of a small smirk.” The juror has been looking at Paul Bellar, 24, who was a member of a paramilitary group, the Wolverine Watchmen. Bellar, Joe Morrison and Pete Musico are charged in state court with providing material support for a terrorist act. The trial has lasted eight days so far. “Since the start of the trial – and we’re prepared to offer sworn testimony on this from two different witnesses – there’s been nonverbal communication” between a juror and Bellar, said Assistant Attorney General Bill Rollstin. He suggested that Bellar sent a signal Wednesday by clenching his fists and shaking them in an “affirmative way.” But Bellar’s attorney, Andrew Kirkpatrick, said that was a misinterpretation: Bellar was excited because the lawyer offered him Skittles candy for his birthday.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A man pleaded guilty Tuesday to filing fraudulent insurance claims for a staged arson he attempted to portray as a politically motivated attack. Federal officials said Denis Molla, 30, of Brooklyn Center, falsely reported to law enforcement in September 2020 that someone had lit his camper on fire and that three unknown males were near his home when he heard an explosion. Molla told officials his garage door was vandalized with a spray-painted Antifa symbol and the words “Biden 2020” and “BLM.” He claimed his camper was targeted because it displayed a Trump 2020 flag. Police discovered that Molla started his own property on fire and spray-painted the graffiti on his own garage. He then submitted multiple insurance claims seeking coverage for the damage to his garage, camper, vehicles and residence caused by the fire, court documents show. Molla also created and allowed others to start two GoFundMe accounts to benefit Molla and his family. In total, he submitted more than $300,000 in fraudulent insurance claims, of which he received approximately $61,000 from his insurance company. Molla also received more than $17,000 from individual donors via GoFundMe. He pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Some legislators say they will renew efforts to clarify that people in Mississippi may possess chemical strips to detect traces of the deadly drug fentanyl. A bill to decriminalize the test strips died early this year. But the state House Drug Policy Committee chairman, Rep. Lee Yancy, R-Brandon, now supports the effort, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports. Rep. Sam Creekmore, R-New Albany, said he’ll introduce a bill during the legislative session that begins in January. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid more lethal than heroin, has pushed drug overdoses to new highs across America. Delivering test strips to people is part of a strategy known as “harm reduction” that gives appropriate products to drug users to prevent accidental overdoses. If someone is about to take an illicit drug, they brush part of the substance against a test strip to see if it contains trace amounts of fentanyl. Opponents say the strategy encourages drug users to continue an addiction, but health professionals who testified at a legislative committee meeting Monday said it’s a useful mitigation strategy that can save lives. Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said he wants people who use drugs to seek professional help to end their addiction, but they need “harm reduction” tools in the short term. “The test strips are not going to encourage people to use drugs,” Edney said. “Those who are going to use drugs are going to continue to use drugs, anyway.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri is offering free vasectomies to uninsured patients in Springfield on Nov. 4 and in Joplin on Nov. 5. Vasectomy appointments will be offered from 9 a.m. to noon and from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. To be eligible, patients must complete a pre-screening exam by Nov. 3. After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, leading Missouri to ban abortions, PPSLR saw demand for male sterilization procedures increase. “Since the Dobbs decision, we have seen an increasing number of male-bodied people coming and requesting this service,” Dr. Margaret Baum said. “We performed 142 vasectomies in 2021; already this year we’ve done close to 200 in 2022, and the year’s not out yet.” Baum said patients from across the state have been traveling to the clinic in St. Louis. In May, she began to provide vasectomies at the Springfield Planned Parenthood health center. Baum performs female sterilization procedures as well. “It’s just really important that these services are offered without judgement, without stigma, so that people who are informed about the procedure can make a good decision and decide if it’s the right thing for them, their relationship and their family,” Baum said.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The commission that oversees the Montana State Library voted Wednesday to accept a new logo with colors pulled from the state flag after one commissioner criticized an earlier color scheme as reminding her of a rainbow LGBTQ pride flag. Commissioners voted 4-2 to approve the new logo but also decided to pause spending any additional money on the rebranding rollout until December, when they can consider additional information about how that money would be spent. The commission had voted 4-3 in early July to reject the initial logo after the library paid a company $130,000 in donated library foundation funds to create it as part of a rebranding effort to educate residents about the services the state library provides. Commissioner Tammy Hall said in June that the original colors brought to mind a pride flag, something she argued could set up an unnecessary political battle as the library seeks funding from the likely Republican-controlled Legislature next year. Commissioners agreed last month to consider a new color scheme. The predominantly blue logo is shaped like a hexagon and is meant to look like information is coming in through a prism and being reflected out as knowledge in four colored triangles. The rejected logo had triangles colored an orange-red, yellow, medium green and bright blue. The new logo has triangles colored red, bright yellow, yellow-green and a more muted blue – all pulled from the state seal on the Montana flag.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Average ACT scores for this year’s high school graduates across the state hit their lowest point in decades, the Omaha World-Herald reports. The mean composite score on the college entrance exam for seniors in the class of 2022 was just 19.8, dropping below 20 – the maximum score is 36 – for the first time since 1991, according to the newspaper. Nebraska education officials said a downward trend in scores began five years ago, meaning it can’t be chalked up solely to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on learning.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Less than a month before Election Day, 14 members of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Adam Laxalt’s family sent a letter endorsing his opponent, Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. “We staunchly believe that Catherine is well equipped with her own ‘Nevada grit’ – a quality that she will take forward in representation of our home state for six more years across the halls of Congress,” the letter said. First obtained by The Nevada Independent, the letter does not mention Laxalt by name. Instead, it talks of Cortez Masto’s understanding of “the daily realities of dogged hard work” and mentions her experience in public education as well as her commitment to law enforcement. The family members also wrote that Cortez Masto’s career demonstrates she is “an authentic advocate of Nevada.” It marks the second time that some of Laxalt’s family has endorsed his opponent. During his unsuccessful gubernatorial run in 2018, a dozen family members endorsed Democrat Steve Sisolak in an op-ed to the Reno Gazette-Journal. That letter more explicitly criticized Laxalt, saying he “leveraged and exploited” the family name throughout his campaign.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRye: The state Department of Environmental Services issued an immediate boil-water order Wednesday for customers of the Rye Water District after samples detected E. coli bacteria. The department wrote in its advisory Wednesday: “All consumers are being notified by the system and DES staff is working with the system to resolve the situation.” The Rye Water District was beginning the process of notifying district customers Wednesday afternoon. District superintendent Arik Jones noted that the district had yet to determine ways to assist affected users, such as by providing them with bottled water. Rye residents are distributed water by three purveyors, according to Jones: the Rye Water District, the city of Portsmouth and the Aquarion Water Company. The Department of Environmental Services’ boil order affects Rye Water District customers living in town only, he said. “This does not affect Aquarion customers,” Jones said. “It does not affect anybody served by Portsmouth.” The Rye Water District services roughly 1,600 connections and about 4,000 total customers. Jones said the boil-water advisory does not include Greenland residents, whom the district serves using Portsmouth water.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Lawmakers unveiled new legislation Thursday to rewrite the state’s firearm carry laws after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June expanding gun rights. Democratic Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin and Senate President Nicholas Scutari, surrounded by other lawmakers and red T-shirt-clad Moms Demand Action supporters, said the new measure will bar permit holders from carrying in schools, polling places, bars, restaurants, theaters, sports arenas, airports, casinos and child care facilities. It also sets up a new requirement that permit holders carry insurance to protect against accidental discharge, coverage that Scutari said is already available in insurance marketplaces. The bill increases permitting, though the exact amount wasn’t immediately clear. The funds will be put toward compensation for crime victims under the legislation. The measure also calls for permit holders to undergo gun safety training and would set up a vetting process that requires non-family references to vouch for applicants. It would disqualify applicants with past violations of restraining orders and other “character of temperament” concerns, though just how those issues would be defined wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: An expert in the field of Indigenous art has been named as the executive director of the Museum of Indian Arts & Culture. Pollyanna “Polly” Nordstrand, who is Hopi, will take on her new role next month. She will oversee a team of curators, anthropologists and archaeologists who are responsible for the preservation and interpretation of objects and works of art that represent Native people from the American Southwest and northern Mexico. “It is an exciting time to step into this leadership position as MIAC envisions its place as a 21st century museum with new exhibitions and expanded partnerships with tribal communities,” she said in a statement. Nordstrand, selected following a national search, is coming from Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas, where she was its first curator of Native American art. In New Mexico, she’ll manage an anthropology library and archives as well as the Center for New Mexico Archaeology, the state’s archaeological repository. Nordstrand began working in the museum world around 1990 as the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act came into effect. She said her approach to museums has been shaped by the increasing collaboration between tribes and institutions, and she has advocated for more equity and inclusion in museums.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A federal appeals court on Wednesday allowed the state to continue enforcing its new gun law as it considers a lower court ruling that would block key provisions. The decision from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came six days after a federal district judge in Syracuse declared multiple portions of the law unconstitutional and placed a temporary hold on them. The state promptly appealed the order. The decision puts a hold on U.S. District Judge Glenn Suddaby’s order until a three-judge appeals panel can make a decision on the state’s motion. Suddaby on Thursday put a hold on several of the state’s new licensing rules for carrying handguns in public, including one that made applicants turn over information about their social media accounts. The judge also chipped away at the list of “sensitive” locations where people cannot carry guns. He said the state couldn’t ban people from carrying guns in New York City’s subway system or Times Square. Attorney General Letitia James said she was pleased the law would stay in effect. “My office will continue our efforts to protect the safety of everyday New Yorkers and defend our common-sense gun laws,” she said in a release.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Two history-making Black politicians and country music star Eric Church were among the six latest recipients of the state’s highest civilian honor announced Thursday. On Nov. 15, Gov. Roy Cooper will present the North Carolina Awards, which were created over 60 years ago to recognize significant contributions to the state and the country in several fields. Church, a native of Granite Falls, has received many Grammy nominations, among other industry awards. Other new recipients include U.S. Rep. Eva Clayton, of Warren County, who was the first African American woman to represent North Carolina in Congress when she took office in 1992. She was also the state’s first Black representative since 1901. Former lawmaker Mickey Michaux of Durham served in the Legislature for more than 45 years, almost all of that time in the House, where he served as the chief budget writer in the late 2000s. He was appointed a U.S. attorney in 1977, becoming the first African American in such a role in the South since Reconstruction, according to the state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources. Other recipients are Dr. Priya S. Kishnani, a professor and researcher at the Duke University School of Medicine; Stanley Riggs, a longtime East Carolina University marine geologist and expert on the coast and climate change; and journalist David Zucchino, a graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill who received a Pulitzer Prize in 2021 for his book on the 1898 overthrow of Wilmington’s government by white supremacists.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWilliston: More than 1,000 pounds of homemade explosive materials have been recovered in a residence in northwestern North Dakota, authorities said Wednesday. Police said multiple chemicals and powders were also found in the apartment in Williston, located in the North Dakota oil patch near the Montana border. No arrests have been made, although police say they have identified a person of interest. Bomb squads from Williston, Minot and Bismarck were disposing of the explosive materials at the Williston landfill. The process was suspended Wednesday afternoon due to high winds and fire danger. Police said explosions could be heard in some parts of the city as the devices were detonated.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case in which a probate judge rejected a transgender woman’s request to correct her birth certificate, leading to a split in court rulings and guidance on the issue. Attorneys for the Clark County woman argue the judge’s ruling, upheld by the 2nd Ohio District Court of Appeals, runs counter to a federal court decision, an Ohio Department of Health certificate change process, a Supreme Court probate form allowing for gender corrections, and procedures in more than a dozen other Ohio probate courts. The Clark County judge improperly ruled that nothing in state law gives probate judges authority to correct gender on a birth certificate unless it was originally made in error, according to an Aug. 1 court filing by the woman’s attorneys asking the high court to hear the case. The attorneys also noted that the state Health Department updated its process to allow for birth certificate corrections after a federal court in 2020 found unconstitutional Ohio’s rule prohibiting changes to gender on birth certificates. In addition, the state Supreme Court issued a form in August 2021 allowing probate courts to correct gender under state law, the attorneys said. The Supreme Court ruled 4-3 Tuesday to accept the Clark County case.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A district attorney debate took a bizarre turn Tuesday when the Republican candidate accused his Democratic opponent of being complicit in the disappearance and possible murder of two people. Kevin Calvey, an Oklahoma County commissioner, made the accusation toward the end of the hourlong livestreamed event. “Two Oklahomans are missing and may have been murdered because Vicki Behenna was willing to submit fake documents to a federal court to get her crooked client out of prison,” Calvey said to audible gasps in the auditorium. Behenna, a former federal prosecutor who is now a defense attorney, denied the accusation. “It doesn’t surprise me that Mr. Calvey would make these statements,” Behenna said. “He is a career politician who has created a false narrative for his own political gain. This is something politicians do. This is not something a district attorney does.” Earlier in the debate, the two clashed over who is to blame for the problems at the aging Oklahoma County jail and the prosecution of police officers for fatal shootings. Both questioned each other’s integrity and fitness for the job throughout what was their only scheduled debate. They agreed that the death penalty should be rarely sought and that possession of small amounts of marijuana should be decriminalized.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Voters in at least four counties – Douglas, Klamath, Lane and Columbia – have complained to local election officials about people knocking on their doors, questioning residents and looking for evidence of 2020 voter fraud. Klamath County Clerk Rochelle Long issued a statement last month after residents called her office asking if the group was from the elections office, KGW reports. “I wanted to make it clear they were not from our office,” Long said. “We don’t go door to door. We don’t ask you how you voted.” Long warned that people may seem official and identify as from an integrity group. Long couldn’t point to any one person or group responsible for the effort. Election officials across the country have received similar complaints about people going door to door hunting for proof the 2020 election was fraudulent. While ex-President Donald Trump continues to argue the election was stolen, a mountain of evidence shows otherwise. “What these folks are doing is simply out trying to gather data in an unofficial way, and then unfortunately we’re seeing people misusing that data to try and spread the big lie,” Oregon Secretary of State Shemia Fagan said. “The election in 2020 was safe and secure in all 50 states.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Two supporters of then-President Donald Trump arrested after driving a Hummer with guns and ammunition to a site where votes were being counted in November 2020 were convicted of weapons charges Wednesday but acquitted of election interference. Prosecutors argued that Vets for Trump co-founder Joshua Macias and co-defendant Antonio LaMotta, both of Virginia, planned a mass shooting in Philadelphia as the outcome of the presidential election remained uncertain. However, Common Pleas Court Judge Lucretia Clemons rejected that theory, finding the men guilty only of bringing weapons to the city without a permit Nov. 5, 2020. LaMotta is separately charged with federal misdemeanor offenses stemming from his alleged illegal entry of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Both men remain free on bail pending a scheduled sentencing in December, when they face a possible sentence of probation to 18 months in jail, defense lawyer William J. Brennan said. “The commonwealth has presented no evidence to show that they came here to interfere with an election,” Brennan, who represents Macias, said after the one-day nonjury trial. “They came, they stared at a building, they talked to some police officers, and they didn’t bother anybody.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island police departments are poised to spend $16million in state and federal grants to equip police officers with body cameras and cover the costs of managing and operating the equipment. The architects of the Statewide Body-Worn Camera Program announced the grant awards to 42 police organizations Wednesday as Rhode Island moved closer to a deployment of 1,773 cameras – roughly a camera for every front-line police officer, according to Attorney General Peter Neronha. “That is a lot of law-enforcement officers (who) will now have the tools to bring us into the century in which we are operating,” Neronha said. State police Col. Darnell Weaver described the grant announcements as a culminating moment after months of coordination and planning work by police leaders and their agencies. “Cameras will add transparency, provide accountability and give a point of view, of perspective, to every police contact,” he said. The grant money was apportioned to finance the program for five years. The awarding of the money carries significance beyond finances. Police organizations that receive the money must comply with a detailed set of regulations on the use and operation of body cameras.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A pregnant Black activist serving four years in prison over comments she made to police during racial justice protests in the summer of 2020 will not receive a lesser sentence, a judge has ruled. A jury this spring found Brittany Martin, 34, of Sumter, guilty of breaching the peace in a high and aggravated manner. Martin’s attorneys pushed for the sentence to be reconsidered and expressed concern about her pregnancy and health. Racial justice groups also got involved. In an Oct. 5 order, Judge R. Kirk Griffin pointed to Martin’s prior criminal convictions that he said contributed to her original sentence. In November 2020, an Iowa judge sentenced Martin to probation for leaving the scene of an injury and willfully causing bodily harm after her teenage son accused her of purposely hitting him with her SUV and driving away. Griffin also noted previous convictions across multiple states for shoplifting, public disorderly conduct and possession of a short-barreled shotgun. Sumter County Assistant Solicitor Bronwyn McElveen said in a September filing that Martin has been on probation at least six times. “Probation has not been a deterrent to further criminal activities for the Defendant,” Griffin wrote in his order. “An active prison sentence was appropriate in this instance.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday authorized its staff to begin reviewing an application for a pipeline designed to transport carbon dioxide from ethanol refineries to an underground site in Illinois, assessing a filing fee of up to $400,000. The pipeline is the second proposed in the state. Both projects would pump carbon dioxide to sequestration sites where it would be buried thousands of feet underground. The one before the Public Utilities Commission – proposed by Navigator CO2 – would connect ethanol refineries across the Great Plains to a site in Illinois. The commission’s staff found that it could cost over $270,000 to review Navigator CO2’s application, which was submitted last month. Navigator CO2 agreed to covering a filing fee of up to $400,000. “It needs to be a quality evaluation and not have that cost fall back on the taxpayers,” said Kristen Edwards, a staff attorney for the commission. The pipeline projects, spurred by federal tax credits, promise to help in the fight against climate change by storing carbon dioxide rather than letting it be emitted into the atmosphere. But environmental activists have also pointed out the technology has struggled to get off the ground and allows emission-heavy industries to avoid taking drastic steps to cut greenhouse gases.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett has taken a plea deal after he was charged with driving under the influence after leaving a bar in June. In a statement, Hargett said he offered a best interest plea in the case Thursday, which amounts to pleading guilty while maintaining innocence. The Republican said his attorney believes he had a “strong case” to argue, but Hargett said he wanted to “accept responsibility for my actions and move forward and to focus on how God can use me to make something positive from this difficult time.” “It is wrong to drive any vehicle under the influence of alcohol, and rest assured this is a mistake I will never make again,” he said. The plea deal includes a $350 fine, a DUI school requirement, and having his driver’s license restricted for a year, news outlets reports. According to a report by a Tullahoma Police Department officer, an officer on June 18 pulled over the car Hargett was driving after watching it leave a bar and swerve over lane markings several times. The officer wrote that Hargett smelled like an “intoxicant,” had glassy eyes and kept saying, “Yes, sir,” at inappropriate times when he had not been asked a question. Hargett performed poorly on a field sobriety test, and a passenger in the car – who was not named – said the two had been drinking four hours earlier, the report said. Hargett agreed to a blood sample. Hargett has said he had been at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: Prosecutors asked a jury Wednesday to sentence a woman to death for killing a pregnant woman and stealing her unborn daughter from her womb. The appeal came as the penalty phase of Taylor Parker’s capital murder trial began for the October 2020 murder of Reagan Simmons-Hancock and theft of her unborn baby. The Bowie County jury previously found Parker guilty of capital murder. Prosecutor Kelley Crisp told jurors that the evidence would show Parker, 29, faked a pregnancy and repeatedly lied before killing Simmons-Hancock, 21, at the woman’s New Boston home Oct. 9, 2020, to get the infant she claimed to have been carrying. The baby also died. Parker’s attorneys hope to persuade the jury to spare Parker’s life and let her serve life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Defense attorney Jeff Harrelson said they would show that Parker was mentally ill.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The two candidates challenging U.S. Rep. Burgess Owens in a suburban congressional race laid into the first-term Republican on Wednesday evening for announcing at the eleventh hour that he wouldn’t participate in the sole general election debate. Democrat Darlene McDonald and United Utah Party’s January Walker both accused Owens of being a coward for skipping it and cast doubt on his reasoning – that he took issue with the moderator. Owens’ absence reflects a trend emerging in politics nationwide: While running attack ads and speaking to friendly media outlets, candidates and their consultants are deciding to minimize debate appearances or shirk them altogether. Owens said Wednesday afternoon that he wouldn’t participate because the commission had chosen Salt Lake Tribune editor Lauren Gustus as moderator. He was outraged in April 2021 when the newspaper published an editorial cartoon satirizing remarks he made about immigration and people crossing the border illegally. The sketch likened his remarks about immigrants entering people’s neighborhoods after crossing the border to Ku Klux Klan rhetoric. The cartoon garnered pushback from Utah’s entire congressional delegation. “I will not, in good conscience, have anything to do with the racist Salt Lake Tribune,” he said in a statement published on Facebook and YouTube.\n\nVermont\n\nWaterbury: A drop of blood that was subjected to modern DNA testing enabled Vermont State Police detectives to make an arrest in the 1989 murder of a Danby couple found stabbed to death in their home, police said. Michael Anthony Louise, 79, was arrested Thursday in Syracuse, New York, on two counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of George Peacock, 76, and Catherine Peacock, 73, police said. The Peacocks were found dead Sept. 17, 1989. There were no signs of forced entry or items of significance having been removed from the house. Louise, who was married to one of the Peacocks’ daughters, was identified as a suspect about two weeks later. Investigators at the time developed circumstantial evidence tying Louise to the killings, police said. Detectives were unable to establish a conclusive link until forensic testing in May 2020 confirmed a DNA match to George Peacock in a spot of blood found inside Louise’s car in October 1989. The blood sample had been tested previously, but earlier tests were inconclusive. Authorities did not say why it took two years to make the arrest following the DNA match but said more information would be released when Louise is arraigned.\n\nVirginia\n\nDinwiddie: Three students and a teacher were taken to hospitals Wednesday after a fire broke out during a demonstration in a high school chemistry classroom, officials said. When the fire broke out in the classroom at Dinwiddie High School, the fire alarm was pulled, and all students were evacuated from the building, Dinwiddie County Public Schools officials said in a statement. A teacher was taken to a local hospital, and three students were taken to VCU Medical Center, officials said. Officials didn’t release details of their conditions. One student was treated at the scene and released. The cause of the fire is under investigation, officials said. Students were dismissed early, and Thursday was designated an asynchronous learning day, officials said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Poor communication, deception, bad judgment and a lack of leadership contributed to tension, violence and killings in Seattle in 2020, according to a review of the city’s response to racial injustice demonstrations that year. Seattle’s inspector general, Lisa Judge, released the 81-page review Tuesday. It focuses on 23 days in June, shortly after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis led to protests across the U.S., The Seattle Times reports. Earlier reports by her office looked at the Seattle Police Department’s crowd control policies and on rebuilding community trust. On June 8, 2020, police abandoned the East Precinct building in Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood in an attempt to defuse tension with protesters. The demonstrators used the opportunity to declare an eight-block “cop-free” zone known as the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. The inspector general’s office concluded the occupation revealed a dysfunctional relationship between the city administration, led by then-Mayor Jenny Durkan, and police department, led by then-Police Chief Carmen Best. It also found police brass misled the public, exaggerated dangers posed by protesters to justify leaving the precinct, and employed a racist ruse in an apparent attempt to frighten and intimidate thousands of Black Lives Matter protesters.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Students in kindergarten through 12th grade across the state have been invited to enter the First Lady Student Ornament Competition this fall. First lady Cathy Justice is asking all students to participate in the 18th annual event. It is open to students in public and private schools as well as those who are home-schooled. Students are asked to create a “Nutcracker”-themed ornament for a tree to be displayed at the Culture Center in Charleston during the holidays, according to a news release from Gov. Jim Justice’s office. There will be four divisions according to grade, and a winning class will be chosen from each division. The winning ornaments will be donated in January to the West Virginia State Museum. The four winning classes will receive a gift card to help buy supplies for their class. The ornaments and Christmas tree will be unveiled in early December in conjunction with Joyful Night. Entries may be mailed to Elizabeth Yeager, Department of Arts, Culture and History, The Culture Center, 1900 Kanawha Blvd. East, Charleston, WV 25305. Include phone number, email, mailing address, teacher name, school and class. The ornaments must be received by Nov. 18.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Wildlife officials estimate the state’s wolf population currently stands at about 970 animals, demonstrating that a much-maligned February 2021 hunting season had little impact on the population as a whole. Wisconsin Public Radio reports Department of Natural Resources officials released their latest population estimates at a board meeting last month and said they estimate between 812 and 1,193 wolves currently roam the state, with 972 likely the best estimate. Conservationists feared that a February 2021 hunting season would devastate the population after hunters killed 218 wolves in just three days, about 100 more wolves than the DNR allowed. Conservationists and wolf lovers called the hunt a slaughter. But the new numbers indicate the season had little effect on the population, which stood at roughly 1,100 wolves before the hunt began. The DNR planned to hold another hunt in November 2021, but a Dane County judge placed that season on hold in October 2021. A federal judge this past February restored protections for gray wolves across most of the country, preventing states from holding wolf hunts. Wisconsin’s current wolf management plan, which dates back to 1999, calls for capping the population at 350 wolves. The DNR is working to update the plan but hasn’t released anything yet.\n\nWyoming\n\nGreen River: A new soda ash mining operation is planned near an existing site outside the city, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. A subsidiary of the Ciner Group, based in Turkey, plans its new Project West development not far from the Pacific Soda mine and said it expected to bring in up to 2,000 temporary jobs during construction, with 300 permanent positions once the mine is operational, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/14"}]}

Le Pen’s “potentially explosive social and economic reforms” had triggered alarm, with analysts and diplomats warning of “huge implications for the stability of the EU” if the “deeply eurosceptic” far-right leader became president.\n\nBut while Macron held on to the top job, his centrist Ensemble coalition “suffered a massive political defeat” in legislative elections earlier this month, said the i news site’s Leo Cendrowicz. A “surge in support for hard left and extreme right” left Macron “well short of the absolute majority needed to control parliament”.\n\nLe Pen’s National Rally “scored a historic success” by increasing its number of deputies in the National Assembly's lower house from eight to 89, “cementing the party’s rise from fringe status to mainstream opposition”, said Reuters’ Paris-based correspondent John Irish. The result sent “shockwaves” through France – and could have significant implications across the EU too.\n\nFrance, the EU and the far-right\n\nFrance was a founding member of the EU, and with the second-largest economy in the bloc, “French leadership matters hugely to the future of the European project”, said Susi Dennison and Tara Varma of the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nFrance is “half of the vital Franco-German engine” that has “powered” the EU “since its creation”, said The Guardian. In fact, Macron is arguably “succeeding” Germany’s former chancellor Angela Merkel “as the European Union’s de-facto leader”, said Voa News.\n\nLe Pen, by contrast,has “flirted with the idea” of leaving the EU since being elected to take over from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, as National Rally’s leader in 2011, said Reuters.\n\nDuring her second presidential bid, in 2017, she campaigned for “Frexit”, but was hobbled by voters’ “fear of the economic consequences of that policy”, said The Guardian.\n\nLe Pen subsequently softened her anti-EU stance, telling voters on the campaign trail this year that Frexit was no longer her “objective”. Yet many of her plans for the French economy, social policy and immigration implied “breaking the EU’s rules”, the paper added.\n\nMutjaba Rahman, a former economist at the UK Treasury and European Commission, tweeted ahead of the April election that Le Pen was essentially offering “a policy of Frexit which does not speak its name”.\n\nStill a risk?\n\nDespite the “sighs of relief” following Macron’s recent presidency victory, “more than half of French voters supported candidates in the first round of the election who are critical of the EU”, said Reuters.\n\nSo should the bloc be worried by the rise in support for the National Rally? Could the election results bolster nationalist parties across the EU? And what are the chances of a future Frexit?\n\nIn this episode of The Overview, The Week shares insights from guest experts Dr Andrew Smith, reader in contemporary history and politics at the University of Chichester, Georgina Wright, senior fellow and director of the Institut Montaigne think-tank’s Europe programme, and Ivan Krastev, political scientist at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna.", "authors": ["Julia O"], "publish_date": "2022/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/africa/957964/what-president-william-rutos-win-means-for-kenya", "title": "What President Ruto's win means for Kenya | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

It’s also unclear if some verified users may be exempt from paying the fee; many international organizations and charities, for example are verified on Twitter.\n\nThe changes would update an existing paid Twitter feature known as “Twitter Blue, which currently costs $4.99 a month and is available in four countries including the United States, to include the verification feature. According to internal Twitter planning documents viewed by CNN, it appears the pay-for-verification feature would only be rolled out in those four countries to start and would be priced at $19.99 a month.\n\nThe Verge first reported the proposed pricing plan on Sunday. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n“The whole verification process is being revamped right now,” Musk tweeted on Sunday. Later that day, Musk engaged with a poll tweeted out by Jason Calcanis, a member of the billionaire’s inner circle, asking how much they would pay to be verified on the platform. A large majority of responders selected the “wouldn’t pay” option.\n\n“Interesting,” Musk tweeted in response to the poll.\n\nMusk has moved quickly to shake up Twitter, including by firing its top execs. In tweets over the weekend, Musk polled his followers about whether to bring back Vine, Twitter’s defunct short-form video service, and said “absolutely” in response to a user’s suggestion to rethink the platform’s character limits. It’s unclear how committed Musk is to pursuing any or all of these changes.\n\nEven before the deal was completed, Musk suggested the possibility of tying verification to a paid subscription service. In April, Musk said Twitter’s paid subscribers “should get an authentication checkmark.” In another tweet, he said: “Price should probably be ~$2/month, but paid 12 months up front & account doesn’t get checkmark for 60 days (watch for CC chargebacks) & suspended with no refund if used for scam/spam.”\n\nWhile the blue check mark has emerged as a status symbol for users, it’s also designed to ensure users can determine which accounts are authentic and which are not, particularly for celebrities, brands and other influential accounts.

Blue for $8/month.”\n\nCNN previously reported Twitter was working to update its existing subscription product, which currently costs $4.99 a month, to include the verification feature, According to internal Twitter planning documents viewed by CNN, Twitter could also take away the blue check marks of currently verified users if they don’t start paying the higher $19.99 price for the subscription product within 90 days.\n\nThe news quickly prompted outrage and disbelief among some longtime Twitter users, including author Stephen King, who has nearly seven million followers on the platform.\n\n“$20 a month to keep my blue check?” he tweeted on Monday, followed by an expletive. “They should pay me. If that gets instituted, I’m gone like Enron.” Following up later in a reply, King wrote, “[i]t ain’t the money, it’s the principle of the thing.”\n\nMusk replied to King early Tuesday morning with his most explicit acknowledgment yet of the proposal to charge for account verification. “[W]e need to pay the bills somehow! Twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers,” he said. “How about $8?”\n\nOn Tuesday, Musk reiterated the $8 price point and shared more details for his new plan. He said subscribers would get priority in replies, mentions and search, as well as the ability to post longer video and audio content while getting half as many ads as free users. Publishers that work with the platform will also get to bypass the paywall, according to Musk.\n\n“This will also give Twitter a revenue stream to reward content creators,” he added.\n\nThe remarks highlight both how tenuous some of Musk’s initial plans for Twitter may be and also the urgency he faces to boost the revenue and profit for a company that lost money for most of its history. Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion, an amount that he admitted is “obviously overpaying” for the company. He also lined up a substantial amount of debt financing to pay for the deal.\n\nSince completing the acquisition of the social media platform on last week, the billionaire has moved quickly to shake up Twitter, including disbanding the board and firing its top execs.

It could create a ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nIn 2009, after Twitter was sued by then-St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa for being impersonated on the platform, the young company introduced a new feature: a blue and white check mark.\n\nThe check indicated that Twitter had verified the accounts of artists, athletes, government officials and agencies and other public figures. The option, which kicked off with plans to verify the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was presented as protection for individuals at risk of having their accounts fraudulently imitated and as a benefit to all users — a means of letting people know they could trust information being shared by prominent figures.\n\nIt soon became one of the platform’s signature features, copied by rivals like Facebook, and created a new kind of cultural cachet for those who received it. Now Twitter’s new owner, Elon Musk, is looking to overhaul the way verification works, with the potential not only to change who gets a coveted blue check mark, but also to create new headaches for users in spotting fake and fraudulent activity on the platform.\n\nMusk confirmed this week he’s working to launch an updated version of the company’s Twitter Blue subscription service in which any user can pay $8 per month to get or remain verified. The world’s richest man has also used populist language, framing the move as a way to break “Twitter’s current lords & peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark.”\n\nIf users buy in, the plan could be a new revenue driver for Twitter, something Musk needs following his $44 billion acquisition of the company, which was partly funded with debt. He has also suggested that verifying more actual, human users could help address the prevalence of fake and spam accounts that he purported to be concerned about during his months-long effort to get out of the acquisition deal.\n\nThe logic appears to go something like this: By requiring users to pay for verification, using a bank account or credit card, it would create a higher barrier to entry for inauthentic accounts. Musk said in a tweet Wednesday that if accounts verified under his new system engage in “spam/scam/impersonation, they’ll be suspended, but Twitter will keep their money!” And he said he would create a separate tag that would show up under the name of public figures, similar to how Twitter already identifies government officials and representatives of state media organizations.\n\nBut the move could disincentivize certain prominent accounts from being verified, making it harder for users to determine which are authentic. And it’s not clear that it will prevent inauthentic and bot activity either.\n\n“In fact, this is making Twitter a pay-for-play system, and we know that propagandists, people working to spread disinformation and other forms of manipulation via Twitter, are very much willing and able to finance their operations,” said Samuel Woolley, assistant professor at the University of Texas’ School of Information and author of the book “Bots.”\n\n“Most of the propagandists that social media companies are most worried about, like the Russian government, the Chinese government, extremist groups, have a lot of resources,” he said.\n\nCurrently, Woolley said, to get past the Twitter verification requirement that users link a cell phone number to their account, bad actors will “buy thousands of smartphones and put them on racks … and that’s a much more costly endeavor than paying an $8 verification fee.” In theory, a person could also pay to verify an account and then allow a computer to run it, thus effectively creating an automated (or “bot”) verified account.\n\nThere may be other complicating factors. Users might have concerns about handing over their bank or credit card information to a company that allegedly has major security vulnerabilities, according to a company whistleblower complaint from just months ago. In many parts of the world, people don’t readily have access to banking services. And many regular Twitter users who aren’t worried about being impersonated and don’t care about Twitter “clout” may also simply not care to shell out for a blue check.\n\nIt’s also not clear what would stop someone from creating and paying to verify an account fraudulently impersonating someone else, thus undermining the original purpose of the feature. It’s not hard to imagine someone paying to verify themselves as a customer support agent for a particular company and then using the credibility that comes from having a blue check mark to scam unsuspecting customers.\n\nTwitter did not immediately respond to questions about the plan, including how it would prevent such imitation.\n\nMusk has said his goal in buying Twitter is to bolster “free speech,” but some worry that the new subscription option could create a two-tiered speech system, based on who can and can’t afford to pay. With the new plan, for example, subscribers would get priority in replies, mentions and search, as well as the ability to post longer video and audio content while getting half as many ads as free users, according to Musk.\n\n“You’re really saying that the free speech of people who pay is more important than the free speech of people who can’t,” said Jessica González, co-CEO of media accountability Free Press, who was part of a group of civil society leaders who met with Musk earlier this week to discuss content moderation and a recent surge of hateful rhetoric on the platform. “I actually told him … that I think that $8 a month is highly problematic.”\n\nThe proposed subscription update has been panned by several high-profile Twitter users, including author Stephen King and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. “Lmao at a billionaire earnestly trying to sell people on the idea that ‘free speech’ is actually a $8/mo subscription plan,” Ocasio Cortez said in a tweet Wednesday.\n\nMusk on Wednesday hit back at critics of the plan, saying in a tweet: “To all the complainers, please continue complaining, but it will cost $8.”\n\n–CNN’s Jennifer Korn contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/technology/958370/elon-musks-overhaul-of-twitter", "title": "Elon Musk's charges for Twitter blue tick | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

A fresh Twitter account created by CNN that signed up for the paid feature did not show the checkmark on its public profile. Twitter also still appeared to be charging $4.99, an outdated price.\n\nEsther Crawford, a director of product management at Twitter, confirmed the service was not yet live, writing in a tweet: “The new Blue isn’t live yet — the sprint to our launch continues but some folks may see us making updates because we are testing and pushing changes in real-time.”\n\nThe feature, Twitter’s App Store page said, is available to iOS users in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The feature was not mentioned on Twitter’s page on the Google Play Store for Android devices as of early Saturday afternoon.\n\nMusk has argued that allowing all users to pay to be verified on Twitter will raise the costs of producing spam and misinformation. Some platform moderation experts and civil rights leaders have been more wary, suggesting it could allow malicious actors to impersonate government officials or allow well-resourced, state-backed disinformation actors to continue to game the platform.\n\nThe new verification feature could have an array of unintended consequences, Color of Change CEO Rashad Robinson told reporters on a call Friday, warning of “unprecedented impacts on election chaos.”\n\n“Any right-wing troll can pay $8… get a blue check mark and then change their name to CNN or Georgia’s secretary of state,” he said.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/28/tech/elon-musk-authenticate-all-real-humans/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk wants to 'authenticate all real humans' on Twitter. Here's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs the public combs through Elon Musk’s Twitter (TWTR) feed for clues on how the billionaire entrepreneur intends to run the social media platform he’s buying for $44 billion, one mysterious line stands out: “authenticate all real humans.”\n\nThat cryptic proposal is vague enough to keep people guessing about what Musk has in mind but specific enough that it offers several possible paths as he looks to shape Twitter more to his liking.\n\nFor example, Musk could seek to require real names on accounts. Or perhaps he may continue to allow pseudonyms but require photo identification, or integration with third-party services where users are already known.\n\nDepending on the outcome, the plan could have big ramifications for Twitter’s hundreds of millions of users.\n\nMusk’s drive to “authenticate” Twitter users stems from one of his biggest pet peeves with the platform: spam accounts, particularly those that push cryptocurrency scams. It’s often not hard to find these accounts lurking in the replies to Musk’s tweets; many even attempt to trade on his celebrity and lure the unsuspecting by impersonating him.\n\nIt didn’t help that in the summer of 2020, Musk’s verified account was affected by a widespread Twitter hack that led to users including former President Barack Obama and Kanye West unwittingly spreading a bitcoin scam. Cryptocurrency spam bots, Musk has said, represent Twitter’s “single most annoying problem.”\n\nMusk’s diagnosis may reflect the experiences of a very particular type of user, but it so happens that this user will soon control the design of the platform. As part of his solution for battling cryptocurrency bots, Musk wants to make it easier to separate real from fake accounts under his proposal to “authenticate all real humans.”\n\nIf the goal is to ensure that every account is tied to a flesh-and-blood person, the platform will need some way to verify they are real. One possibility is an expansion of Twitter’s existing verification program. Currently, to receive a blue check on their accounts, users have to supply a link to an official website that they’re affiliated with, an official email address or a government-issued form of identification. Musk could stop short of requiring identification but require that users use their real names.\n\nHe could explore other methods too, such as linking accounts to credit cards or relying more on CAPTCHAs to defeat bots, said Jillian York, director for international freedom of expression at the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation. (CAPTCHAs aren’t a cure-all, however; as bots have grown more sophisticated, CAPTCHAs have had to become more and more difficult for humans to solve in what could be described as a technological arms race.)\n\nWhatever method he chooses, York and other experts said Musk is likely to run into challenges that fall into two main categories: access and privacy.\n\nAccess is about ensuring that all people who wish to use Twitter can get on the platform. With a system that ties accounts to credit cards, for example, York said Twitter would risk excluding all those who don’t have them. Maybe they’re too young to have a credit card or they have poor credit and can’t get approved. Maybe they don’t like having their credit card transactions traded to data brokers or they just prefer using cash for cultural reasons. Tying authentication to consumer credit would “exclude millions of people,” said York.\n\nThen there’s the issue of privacy. While many users may feel they have nothing to hide, a system that forces users to submit their personally identifiable information creates a single point of failure. Not only would more users have to trust Twitter not to abuse their personal information, but Twitter itself would become a much larger target for repressive governments (who could use legal demands to compel Twitter to hand over the information) or cybercriminals motivated by identity theft. Cybercriminals have even reportedly posed as real law enforcement agents to serve fraudulent government requests for tech company data. Twitter could promise to delete the records, but it would merely be mitigating a risk it created for itself.\n\nThe privacy issue is particularly worrisome to human rights groups, said Natalia Krapiva, an attorney at the digital rights group Access Now, “especially for people in countries like Russia and others where individuals get severely persecuted for criticizing the government or covering important political events like the protests, corruption, or the war in Ukraine.”\n\nEven a real-names policy could prove challenging. Facebook has some experience with this; the company was forced to make changes to its names policy in 2015 after critics pointed out that abuse victims and other vulnerable groups had good reasons to use pseudonyms. The changes at Facebook raised the bar for reporting a fake name and allowed users to provide reasons to the company why they avoid using their real names.\n\nThis points to how complex it can be to translate a simple-sounding principle such as “authenticate all real humans” into a functional product feature. The issue isn’t the goal or the motivation; it’s that humans are complicated creatures with personal circumstances that rarely fit neatly into boxes.\n\nAfter years of trial and error, tech platforms have already developed important lessons about user authentication that could benefit Musk, said York.\n\n“If he merely means things like CAPTCHAs, I think he’s in for a surprise,” said York. “He’s talked a lot about how he’ll get rid of bots, but Twitter’s been trying to do that for years and I think he’ll soon realize it’s not an easy problem to solve.”", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/11/04/twitter-revenue-drop-elon-musk-blames-activists/8267141001/", "title": "Elon Musk initiates Twitter layoffs, blames activists for revenue drop", "text": "Layoffs have started at Twitter a week after Musk bought the company.\n\nActivist groups expressed concern that the mass layoffs would impede Twitter's ability to moderate content.\n\nTwitter employees tweeted Friday that they had been affected by the layoffs using the hashtag #LoveWhereYouWorked.\n\nElon Musk said Friday Twitter has seen \"a massive drop in revenue\" from civil rights groups calls on brands to pull ads as concern spread that mass layoffs will make it impossible to keep hate speech and misinformation off the platform ahead of Tuesday's midterm elections.\n\nMusk, who blamed the cutback on advertising on \"activist groups pressuring advertisers,\" said the platform hasn't yet made any changes to how content is moderated.\n\n\"Extremely messed up!\" Musk tweeted Friday morning. \"They’re trying to destroy free speech in America.\"\n\nMusk met with leading civil rights group in a 45-minute Zoom meeting Tuesday. He said he would not allow banned accounts back on the platform until he’s established a clear process to vet them.\n\nHe also said he would enforce the platform’s election integrity policies ahead of the midterms and include civil rights groups on a content moderation council that he is setting up.

It is continuing to evolve and we saw that in many ways.”\n\nThe site offers two definitions for allyship: The role of a person who advocates for inclusion of a “marginalized or politicized group” in solidarity but not as a member, and the more traditional relationship of “persons, groups or nations associating and cooperating with one another for a common cause or purpose.”\n\nThe word is set apart from “alliance,” which Dictionary.com defines in one sense as a “merging of efforts or interests by persons, families, states or organizations.”\n\nIt's the first definition that took off most recently in the mid-2000s and has continued to churn. Following the summer of 2020 and the death of George Floyd, white allies — and the word allyship — proliferated as racial justice demonstrations spread. Before that, straight allies joined the causes of LGBTQ oppression, discrimination and marginalization.\n\n“This year, we saw a lot of businesses and organizations very prominently, publicly, beginning efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion. Allyship is tied to that. In the classroom, there is a flashpoint around the term critical race theory. Allyship connects with this as well,” Kelly said.\n\nIn addition, teachers, frontline workers and mothers who juggled jobs, home duties and child care in lockdown gained allies as the pandemic took hold last year.\n\nWithout an entry for “allyship,” Kelly said the site saw a steep rise in lookups for “ally” in 2020 and large spikes in 2021. It was in the top 850 searches out of thousands and thousands of words this year. Dictionary.com broadened the definition of “ally” to include the more nuanced meaning. The terms “DEI” and “critical race theory” made their debuts as entries on the site with “allyship” this year.\n\nWhat it means to be an authentic ally has taken on fresh significance as buzz around the word has grown louder. One of the aspects of allyship, as it has emerged, is how badly it can go.\n\nAmong the example's of how to use the word in a sentence cited by Merriam-Webster is this one written by Native activist Hallie Sebastian: “Poor allyship is speaking over marginalized people by taking credit and receiving recognition for arguments that the unprivileged have been making for their entire lives.”\n\nAs global diversity, equity and inclusion executive Sheree Atcheson wrote in Forbes, allyship is a “lifelong process of building relationships based on trust, consistency and accountability with marginalized individuals and/or groups of people.” It's not, she said, “self-defined — work and efforts must be recognized by those you are seeking to ally with.”\n\nAllyship should be an “opportunity to grow and learn about ourselves, whilst building confidence in others,” Atcheson added.\n\nAmong the earliest evidence of the word “allyship,” in its original sense of “alliance,” is the 1849, two-volume work, “The Lord of the Manor, or, Lights and Shades of Country Life” by British novelist Thomas Hall: “Under these considerations, it is possible, he might have heard of Miss Clough’s allyship with the Lady Bourgoin.”\n\nKelly did some additional digging into the history of allyship in its social justice sense. While the Oxford English Dictionary dates that use of the word to the 1970s, Kelly found a text, “Allies of the Negro” by Albert W. Hamilton, published in 1943. It discusses extensively the potential allies of Black people in the struggle for racial equality:\n\n“What some white liberals are beginning to realize is that they better begin to seek the Negro as an ally,” he wrote. “The new way of life sought by the liberal will be a sham without the racial equality the Negro seeks. And the inclusion of the Negro in the day-to-day work, in the organization, the leadership and the rallying of the support necessary to win a better world, can only be done on the basis of equality.”\n\nOn the other side of allyship, Kelly said, \"is a feeling of division, of polarization. That was Jan. 6.” Allyship, he said, became a powerful prism in terms of the dichotomy at a chaotic cultural time during the last two years.\n\nOther dictionary companies in the word of the year game focused on the pandemic and its fallout for their picks. Oxford Languages, which oversees the Oxford English Dictionary, went for “vax” and Merriam-Webster chose “vaccine.” The Glasgow, Scotland-based Collins Dictionary, meanwhile, plucked “NFT,” the digital tokens that sell for millions.\n\nWhile Merriam-Webster relies solely on site search data to choose a word of the year, Dictionary.com takes a broader approach.

It’s a term that wasn’t part of the popular lexicon even 18 short months ago, but fake news has spread like a deadly infection.\n\nOne of the runners-up for word of the year was “echo chamber,” referring to a sort of bubble where people live with exposure only to their own opinions and those who subscribe to the same ideas. Fake news often bounces around echo chambers with no one to dispute its veracity.\n\nWe all have a few people in our social media networks who share ridiculous things, such as a crazy aunt who genuinely believes the government covers up extraterrestrial contacts or a distant cousin who claims Sandy Hook victims were actually paid actors. But most of us have also encountered well-informed, sane people who share articles that are blatantly incorrect propaganda.\n\nWhy does this happen? After all, a quick Google search often verifies whether something is real or a hoax. The answer lies in our brains and a little-known phenomenon called “confirmation bias.” It works like this: When we see new information, we try to decide whether or not to believe it. Generally, if the new information confirms existing beliefs that we hold, we buy into it automatically (and hence retweet and share). But if the new information is contrary to what we already know, we’re most likely to discard it in order to maintain cognitive consistency. When information agrees with your beliefs, it takes no time to confirm it; when information disagrees, it takes many, many contrary facts before we even consider changing our minds.\n\nConfirmation bias is evolutionarily efficient and generally helpful to us. Reinforcing what we already know helps us make good decisions quickly. And affirmation is critical to our survival; it keeps us on the right path. It is for this reason that scientists have demonstrated time and again that we prefer familiar words, paintings, shapes, even sounds — the more we are exposed to something, the more we like it.\n\nIf you’ve ever disliked a song you heard on the radio but then found yourself enjoying it after it plays a few more times, you’ve experienced what psychologists call an exposure effect. This effect explains why test subjects rate a familiar face as happier and better looking than a stranger’s face (even if both are showing the same expression). The more time we spend with people, the more attractive they become to us. This effect works especially well in love: Forget Cupid, just be present and over the long run, you will look more attractive to a potential mate. From an evolutionary perspective, there is little downside to enjoying, seeking out and reinforcing the value of what’s familiar, as the familiar is often the safest. So, by and large, it’s a good thing when an exposure effect creates confirmation bias.\n\nMore:Can you spot fake news? Study says you probably can't\n\nMore:How Facebook fired workers who blocked 'fake news' — 'After the Fact' book excerpt\n\nMore:Oprah Winfrey condemns fake news in commencement speech, urges graduates to 'be the truth'\n\nBut when problems get more complex, confirmation bias wreaks havoc. It impedes our ability to process information that goes against what we already think is true and makes it all but impossible to change our own minds. It contributes to racism, sexism and bigotry.\n\nConfirmation bias makes us vulnerable to false claims that confirm what is familiar but may be wrong. It also makes us suspicious of other people promoting falsehoods that don’t mesh with what we believe. So we believe our own side’s fake news but see the other side and their fake news as ridiculous. The result is intense polarization, with all of us living in echo chambers that reverberate confirming information and mute everything else.\n\nWith confirmation bias influencing our news, there are really only two options. You can try to be hyper-vigilant with fact-checking and genuinely listen to those who disagree (i.e., go against human nature), or you can shut it out entirely.

But Nihar missed his follow-up words, which put Jairam back in contention.\n\nThe spellers will take home $40,000 in cash and other prizes.\n\nThe bee changed the rules this year to avoid what exactly what happened — a marathon championship round. Words given to finalists didn't come from a 25-word list predetermined by spelling officials, Paige Kimble, the bee's executive director, said. Instead, organizers had the option of using an expanded list of words from anywhere in Webster’s Third New International Dictionary. Kimble called it “raising the standard.” But it didn't work.\n\nBoth Jairam and Nihar said they knew some of the words they were given and figured out the spelling of the rest.\n\nJairam is the younger brother of 2014 co-champion, Sriram Hathwar. He said the best advice he got from his brother was not to get too agitated if he was given a word he didn’t know. He plans on saving his winnings to pay for college.\n\nTen contestants made it to the finals and competed for the title of national champion before a live television audience. The finals were broadcast on ESPN.\n\nThe bee began Tuesday with 284 contestants but was pared to 45 Wednesday evening, after a written test and two rounds of onstage spelling.\n\nCan you spell these often misspelled words?\n\nBy Thursday afternoon, the field had been further narrowed to the 10 finalists, who came from California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts, New York and Texas.\n\nFive finalists made a return trip to the bee, which took place at Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center, just outside of Washington.\n\nMitchell Robson had a simple request as he nervously walked to the microphone Round 8 Thursday night.\n\n“You need to give me a word I know — please,” the 14-year-old from Marblehead, Mass. Pleaded.\n\n“I’ll try to work with you,” pronouncer Jacques Bailly joked.\n\nMaybe it was karma, or maybe his plea actually worked. Whatever the explanation, Mitchell had no trouble spelling “esquisse,” which refers to a first, usually rough sketch. The crowd cheered as he returned to his seat.\n\nRanking the 8 best Spelling Bee moments of all time\n\nThese spellers have S-W-A-G on stage\n\nBut Robson’s victory was short-lived. A few minutes later, in Round 9, he misspelled “Wehrmacht” – which referred to the unified forces of Nazi Germany – and was eliminated from the competition.\n\nCooper Komatsu of Los Angeles was clearly nervous when it came his time to spell. He fidgeted. He stalled. But he conquered. He easily spelled “myoclonus,” which means an irregular, involuntary muscle contraction.\n\nFrom “bailliage,” which refers to the authority of a medieval officer, to “kakiemon,” which is a Japanese decorated porcelain, spellers easily mastered a number of foreign tongue-twisters.\n\nBut Jashun Paluru, 11, of West Lafayette, Ind., was eliminated after stumbling over “vasopressin,” a hormone that increases blood pressure.\n\nJashun asked if there were any alternate pronunciations. There were four. He asked for the part of speech: noun. He asked for all the pronunciations and the definition again before giving it his best shot: “v-a-s-o-p-r-e-s-i-n.”\n\nThe dreaded sound of the bell signaled his error.\n\nThe problem was that the word comes from a trademark, meaning Jashun couldn’t get help from rules that apply to other languages from which many English words are derived.\n\n“It doesn’t follow any patterns,” Jashun explained after receiving a standing ovation from the crowd.\n\nThe original 284 spellers ranged in age from 6 to 14 and were almost evenly divided among boys (143) and girls (141). They hailed from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the Bahamas, Canada, Europe, Ghana, Guam, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, South Korea and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nFor the first time, competitors included a first-grader — 6-year-old Akash Vukoti of San Angelo, Texas.\n\n7 things you didn't know about the National Spelling Bee\n\nAkash aced the spelling of \"inviscate\" in Round 2 on Wednesday — the word means to encase in a sticky substance. But he stumbled in Round 3 on \"bacteriolytic,\" which refers to the destruction or dissolution of bacteria.\n\nLast year’s winners were Vanya Shivashankar of Olathe, Kansas, and Gokul Venkatachalam of Chesterfield, Mo. The two battled through 20 tense, error-free rounds.\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe, Brian Tumulty, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2021/09/27/banned-books-week-the-bluest-eye-harry-potter-1984-handmaids-tale-goosebumps-golden-compass/5758877001/", "title": "Why you should read these 31 banned books now", "text": "USA TODAY staff\n\nAs journalists, it's our job to seek out the truth even when it's uncomfortable. We value diverse perspectives, are open to new ideas and respect intellectual freedom. So it should come as no surprise that the thought of banning a book would make us riled.\n\nNow, book banners are coming for \"Maus,\" a classic of holocaust literature. The serialized comic, completed and published in collected volumes in 1991, made literary history when in 1992 it became the first (and to date only) graphic novel to win a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nIt was an honor wholly deserved by American cartoonist Art Spiegelman, who channeled his Polish-Jewish, Holocaust-surviving parents' experiences into the semi-autobiographical masterpiece in which Jews are represented as mice and Germans as cats.\n\n'It's embarrassing': 'Reading Rainbow' host LeVar Burton fires back at rise in banned books\n\nThe McMinn County School Board in eastern Tennessee voted 10-0 earlier this year to ban the book, citing concerns over \"rough\" language and a nude drawing of a woman, according to the Jan. 10 meeting minutes posted to the district website. The book was part of its eighth grade English and language arts curriculum.\n\nAs news spread about the school board's decision, Spiegelman called the decision \"absurd\" and the U.S. Holocaust Museum said, \"Maus has played a vital role in educating students about the Holocaust through sharing detailed and personal experiences of victims and survivors.\"\n\nThey're right.\n\nFor last September's Banned Books Week, USA TODAY staffers banded together to defend some of the most challenged books in America as compiled by the American Library Association's Office of Intellectual Freedom. \"Maus\" belongs at the top of that list.\n\nWhat happens when a book is challenged in school boards and public libraries? Titles can be removed from school curriculum or library shelves. Most public schools and libraries have boards comprised of elected officials or members appointed by elected officials. It is by the power of these officials, that a book can go from challenged to banned in a particular school district or public library. Even if it happens only once, it is one time too many.\n\nSure, there is the argument that we can bypass places such as public libraries and purchase a book. But that is only true for those with the financial resources to do that. For many, particularly children and young adults, school and public libraries are their only means to access literature.\n\nWith that in mind, USA TODAY staff looked at challenged and banned books and chose those that are meaningful to them. In the books' defense, we've written why they deserve a place in our schools, libraries and society:\n\n'Maus,' by Art Spiegelman\n\nSpiegelman's semi-autobiographical novel about his Holocaust-surviving parents' experiences in Auschwitz and his family's subsequent, lifelong traumas is a masterpiece of Holocaust literature and should be essential to all school-age readers. While \"Maus\" is not a children's book, its graphic medium and depiction of Jews and Germans as mice and cats makes the topic more approachable for younger readers still trying to get their heads around the unfathomable historical horror. The only way to avoid a second Holocaust is to teach the first. – Barbara VanDenburgh\n\n'Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry,' by Mildred D. Taylor\n\nAmerican public school reading curriculum is heavily white. I can attest to that with my own experience: In my 12 years as a student in American public schools, I was only assigned one novel by an African American writer, and that was Taylor’s Newbery Medal-winning story of the Logan family, sharecroppers in rural Mississippi whose love for each other helps them survive the cruelties of the Jim Crow South. I grew up a pretty privileged white kid with no personal experience of racism, and I can keenly recall how hot I burned with the unfairness of it reading “Roll of Thunder” for the first time in the second grade. If we want to create more anti-racists, we need to assign more diverse books in schools, and “Roll of Thunder” is still a great place for young readers to start. – VanDenburgh\n\n'Animal Farm,' by George Orwell\n\nI first read it in middle school in Phoenix, only a few years after my family had escaped communist Vietnam in 1975. I checked it out of my school library because of the title and was ready for enchanted spiders and pigs like in “Charlotte's Web” by E.B. White. Instead, in Orwell’s attack on the Soviet Union, I recognized all too well what my family was hearing from relatives who hadn’t been able to flee the fall of Saigon. Daily indoctrination classes, South Vietnamese officers sent to reeducation camps and their homes confiscated and given to communist officers. Those who could still afford radios risked imprisonment to listen to Voice of America because you couldn’t believe the state-run media. Orwell wrote “Animal Farm” because he wanted to tell the story of the Russian Revolution in a way anyone could understand. And children everywhere need to. – Thuan Le Elston\n\n'Beyond Magenta: Transgender Teens Speak Out,' by Susan Kuklin\n\nA 2019 study revealed that approximately 3% of American teens (ages 13 to 17) identify as transgender or gender nonconforming. In this book, Kuklin interviews six trans teens about their childhoods, their coming out experiences and where they are today. It brings hope to trans teens that there is a future for them, and also provides a clear look into their minds for loved ones to truly understand their points of view. Despite this book receiving many awards, it was in the top 10 Most Challenged Books lists for 2015 and 2019 for “its effect on any young people who would read it.” To the contrary, this book provides a unique perspective on gender and sexuality to help teens learn about themselves from other people their age. I believe this book does a great service to the young LGBTQ community. – Melissa Rorech\n\n'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian,' by Sherman Alexie\n\nI first read the story of Junior as he leaves his school on the Spokane Indian Reservation in Washington for an all-white school during Banned Books Week in middle school. As Junior struggles to find his place in a school where the only other Indian is the mascot, he grapples with generational poverty and discrimination. While I cannot fully understand Junior’s experience, I, as a person of color at an extremely white school, saw myself in his battle to explore identity in an environment that seeks to erase it. While the classroom offered a whitewashed, sanitized reality of Native Americans’ experiences, this book offered me a glimpse into the systemic oppression Native communities have faced since colonization. It shows tribes as part of the current fabric of our nation rather than merely part of history. And it examines a dimension of diversity that’s often forgotten – disability. In the hands of a trusted teacher who can guide students through difficult conversations, this story has the power to push readers into uncomfortable but important spaces and allow students whose experiences are often ignored in classrooms to be seen – all through the lens of an uproariously funny teen. – Christine Fernando\n\n'Goosebumps' (series), by R.L. Stine\n\nIt’s fun to be scared. Granted, in controlled environments – movie theaters, haunted houses, or between the covers of a book, for instance. Or in the case of Stine’s beloved horror series, dozens of books starring a bevy of spooky frights: werewolves, ghosts, haunted Halloween masks and even an evil ventriloquist's dummy. These books have long been challenged in school libraries for being too scary, but those who object clearly don’t remember what it was like to be a kid with a vivid imagination. In a world so full of real horrors, the pretend ones offer escape and catharsis. Besides, if my generation could survive the “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark” illustrations, what possible danger could a few “Goosebumps” books be? – VanDenburgh\n\n'Bridge to Terabithia,' by Katherine Paterson\n\nFarm boy Jess Aarons and imaginative, bright-eyed new girl Leslie Burke become friends and create Terabithia, a fantasy kingdom in the woods. Inspired by the magic they brought to that wooded glade, I once made my own Terabithia in a circle of tall trees in my backyard while playing outside with my friends. But (spoiler alert) after Leslie fell to her death when the rope they used to swing to Terabithia snapped, I was shocked. I didn’t know then that Leslie’s death and Jess’ experience of it would feel much like how my own loss would feel in the many years to come – random and senseless. Seeing Jess in the aftermath of Leslie’s death prepared many of us for what loss would feel like, the unsparing pendulum swinging between the good days and the bad. Their story also taught me the power of joyful imagination and creativity, that people are complicated (even the bullies) and that, despite the devastating reality of death, there is hope for life after loss. – Fernando\n\n'Brave New World,' by Aldous Huxley\n\nFew classic sci-fi novels bear a more direct resemblance to modern times than \"Brave New World.\" Huxley explores a future in which the government’s obsessive need for economic growth creates an endless consumerist cycle and a society divided into a rigid caste system that separates people by jobs, intelligence and appearance. The world is painted as a utopia but only because its citizens are kept complacent by entertainment and mood-altering drugs. They believe they receive everything they want, but their places in society have been carefully curated by the government (and cloning technology). There’s no room to be an individual in Huxley’s futuristic England, and anyone who tries is punished. Consumerism. Prejudice. Happiness above truth. These are all things we continue to grapple with as a modern, global society. It’s as if Huxley traveled through time to 2021 before writing his novel. – Joanna Nelius\n\n'Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret,' by Judy Blume\n\n“Why would anyone want to ban ‘Are You There God’?” my sixth grade daughter asked. “It’s my favorite book.” Grace is 11, the same age I was when I read Blume’s classic novel – only it was too new to be called a “classic” back then –— about preteen girls grappling with puberty (breasts and periods, anyone?), religion and sexuality. As with Grace today, it was my favorite book then. I found comfort and familiarity in Margaret, her friends and her conversations with God. Their world was my world, and Blume paints an unvarnished picture of what life is like for maturing girls. Those frank discussions of sensitive topics – often challenging for tweens and adults alike – are why girls love the book and adults challenge it. And why this mom is thrilled that it’s still one sixthgraders reach for and cherish, a generation later. – Kristen DelGuzzi\n\n'The Catcher in the Rye,' by J.D. Salinger\n\nTwenty years ago, a school board member in small-town South Carolina checked out Salinger's work from the high school libraries in his district. He planned to pay for the copies instead of returning them, he told the local paper. He didn't want students to read the “filthy, filthy\" book and said the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, was a poor role model. He’d already tried once to ban it. His second attempt failed as well – though it wasn’t part of any curriculum. When I agreed to write about \"The Catcher in the Rye\" as part of this year’s Banned Book Week, I had no idea that the most infamous protest against it happened at my high school. Or that it played out when I was a sophomore, only a few years younger than the fictional Caulfield, in the throws of the kind of angst and ennui that defined Salinger’s prose. I didn’t read it until my mid-20s. Afterward, I realized I’d missed the moment. My rebellious years were behind me and I’d forgotten how isolating they could be. How much I could have used a book like that at the time. Finally, learning why it’d been kept from me has reignited some of that disquiet. It’s not lost on me that old men who think they know best and stand in the way of students reading great literature are exactly the sort of people Caulfield railed against. So let me now be the proverbial catcher for the next generation: Kids, read it all. Especially the ones the man tells you not to. – Cara Kelly\n\n'Persepolis,' by Marjane Satrapi\n\nWhen I first read “Persepolis” in college, I was immediately enchanted with the punk-rock protagonist of the graphic memoir. I never lived through the Islamic Revolution in Iran but to see Satrapi depict how the revolution disrupted individuals, families and communities has always stuck with me. I’m very much a supporter of women and girls who like to talk back, as Beyoncé once sang, and who challenge the status quo. I’m not sure how anyone can read “Persepolis” and not be touched by how loving Satrapi’s family is even when they are fearful for her safety. Satrapi showed us what life was like as a young, rebellious woman growing up in Iran during the 1980s. For those who found a way to survive, they lived life as best they could. And like so many other young women coming-of-age Satrapi had sex (gasp!) and cursed and used drugs. Experimenting is what young people do. It’s an insult to her vulnerability that some have tried to ban her book. – Mabinty Quarshie\n\n'The Glass Castle,' by Jeannette Walls\n\nI first read \"The Glass Castle\" on assignment as a rookie reporter in my college town. The memoir had been selected by the university and county library as a summer book. It was an appropriate choice for two institutions little more than 100 miles from Welch, West Virginia, the closest thing the author has to a hometown. Many of the issues Walls faced as a kid are endemic to the area: poverty, substance abuse, violence. She tackled them head-on – so much so that her detailed descriptions have been used as fodder to ban the book from school curriculums. That short-sightedness misses how masterfully Walls infuses the truth about her problematic childhood with a sense of pride and perseverance. As a reporter in the Appalachian mountains, I knew kids there and across America were suffering the same social ills (and still do, made worse by the opioid epidemic, COVID-19 and financial downturns). Walls' writing tells them they shouldn’t be ashamed of their circumstances and the decisions of adults around them, and that they don’t have to carry the stigma of poverty or abuse. I can think of few more meaningful messages. Save, maybe, the one she inscribed in my copy: “Just tell the truth!” – Kelly\n\n'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,' by Mark Haddon\n\nThis was among the first books I read with a neurodiverse character at its core. Instead of letting Christopher sit on the periphery, Haddon brings the reader into Christopher’s perception of the world by writing the text in ways that make it more representative of his lived experience. The novel directly shows how Christopher perceives things, including how signs at a busy airport become overwhelming walls of text. This allows Haddon to bring into question whether what most people think of as “normal” is actually better. Christopher’s world is more compassionate and empathetic toward animals, including his pet rat, Toby, and the dog whose mysterious death he sets out to solve. Aside from being a phenomenal bildungsroman, the novel stands the test of time. I read it first as a teenager, and again in my senior year of college. Both times I walked away feeling as though I’d learned more than you’d think a fictional book could ever teach. – Lindsey Vickers\n\n'The Things They Carried,' by Tim O'Brien\n\nThe Vietnam War may have started more than 60 years ago, but that doesn't make the war stories of \"The Things They Carried\" any less relevant for young readers today. It's not an easy read – but that's the point. Learning about the day-to-day struggles soldiers have to endure is not supposed to be easy. It's supposed to be uncomfortable. It's supposed to be vulgar, explicit, and confusing because that's exactly what soldiers face. The novel provides an unfiltered view of war that vastly contrasted the way people felt about World War II. It represents a pivotal point in history and mirrors the public sentiment of the ’70s when people stopped romanticizing war and started critically examining why we go to war and how it affected those who fought. This book presents a much-needed glimpse into the real lives of soldiers, and while it may not be a feel-good read, it’s a necessary one. – Kate Ellsworth\n\n'The Golden Compass,' by Philip Pullman\n\nThe same reason as to why “The Golden Compass” was banned is the reason it should be a must-read. The novel is often described as the antithesis of “The Chronicles of Narnia,” which is known for its Christian allegories, because of its supposed message of atheism. Pullman’s first book in \"His Dark Materials\" fantasy trilogy pushes the boundaries with young characters seeing through the lies of organized religion (in this case the Magisterium) and eventually killing “God” himself. Regardless of the readers’ religion, it’s important for children to learn to question any and all institutions.Through a more contemporary lens readers will surely appreciate Pullman’s themes even if they don’t agree with his conclusions. – Josh Rivera\n\n'Beloved,' by Toni Morrison\n\nMotherhood in the U.S. has never been easy. We are a nation that reveres motherhood without providing the resources moms need to thrive. Just look at how many mothers suffered during the coronavirus pandemic. Now imagine the trauma of being an enslaved Black mother who doesn’t even control her own body much less her children's. “Beloved” shows us the impossible choices Black mothers were forced to make during slavery. Who could blame Sethe, the protagonist, for doing anything to prevent her children from being enslaved – even to the point of death? I certainly can’t. Slavery has never been pretty, and it never will be. There are moments of incredible pain and violence inflicted upon Black men and women in “Beloved.” We can’t look away from these horrors because a few people refuse to accept that racism was a fundamental part of U.S. history. Holding up the nation’s sins to our faces was a heroic choice Morrison made in her writing. And we were all the better for it. – Quarshie\n\n'To Kill a Mockingbird,' by Harper Lee\n\nWhen the school board in Biloxi, Mississippi, argued \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" should be kept out of the classroom in 2017 because it makes people \"uncomfortable,” they actually nailed the best reason to keep it on the shelves. Everything in the book is uncomfortable, and not because it accurately describes overt racism in sometimes noxious language. It’s uncomfortable because it holds up a mirror to our present: the ease with which neighbors will embrace lies and willingly fall in with a mob; a legal system working overtime to send a Black man to prison; how fear informs our uninformed view of the mentally ill; and the brutal dividing line between the poor and the privileged. This is a provocative book, not a perfect one. But the shortcomings of 1930s race, society and language it depicts which so distress critics – and made the Biloxi school board so uncomfortable – are not failings of the author’s words. They are the continued failings of our world. Now is not the time to look away. – Patricia Beall\n\n'The God of Small Things,' by Arundhati Roy\n\nWinner of the Man Booker Prize, \"The God of Small Things\" focuses on twins and their family in Kerala, India. Roy explores how her characters’ lives – both past and present – are shaped by their social, political, religious and environmental surroundings. She provides readers with an insightful look into India’s colonial history, discriminatory caste system and the rise of the Communist Party in the nation in the late ’60s while challenging notions of forbidden love to present a complex portrait of an era and its societal consequences years later. It's an important read for students to understand the legacy of colonialism and the devastating impacts of discrimination. – Grace Hauck\n\n'The Outsiders,' by S.E. Hinton\n\nWhen Johnny Cade implores Ponyboy Curtis to “stay gold,” it’s more than a wish from a dying friend. It’s a prayer of sorts to be carried throughout life, an adage to turn to when we need to offer encouragement or uplift ourselves. That line, taken from Robert Frost’s poem “Nothing Gold Can Stay,” is the moral centerpiece of Hinton’s “The Outsiders” and its study of innocence lost. Pitting the blue-collar “Greasers” against the wealthy “Socs” is a frequently employed trope, but the melancholy that pervades Hinton’s debut novel (which she wrote in high school!) resonates beyond a seemingly simplistic setup of contrasting socioeconomic status. Some find the murder in the book – Johnny and Ponyboy get jumped by the Socs and Johnny knifes one in self-defense – unsuitable for teen readers. But when Johnny later attempts to rescue some schoolchildren from a burning church (and dies from his injuries) the point is made. Golden is eternal. – Melissa Ruggieri\n\n'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,' by Mark Twain\n\nBecause of needed context, I wouldn’t read it before “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.” But “Tom” was a fling; “Huck” still holds my hand when I write. I can’t remember when I first read them, but English is my second language, and both helped me learn not only how English has changed but also how America has changed. When I met Huck, I heard only the boy’s voice and saw only what he understood. Upon rereading and realizing what Jim had been saying all along, I entered another universe through the eyes of a Black enslaved man, ripped from his family and fighting through his fear to survive. I never forgot how Twain gave depth to such different voices in “Huck.” He helped me write and rewrite my own novel. Keep “Huck,” for its teaching mechanics as well as its wise heart. – Elston\n\n'50 Shades of Grey,' by E.L. James\n\nIn a time in which we consider ourselves forward thinkers, it is shocking to still consider any conversation revolving around sex taboo. \"50 Shades\" is one of the most well-known and controversial erotica novels, but there are a vast number of authors trying to broach the subject, many worrying their writing is only good behind closed doors. In writing \"50 Shades,\" James gives those writers a voice – those that have been waiting for the right moment to share their deepest, darkest desires with the world. It is necessary to normalize thoughts about sex and not slap tape across our lips to keep from expressing our tastes in the bedroom. – Nishka Dhawan\n\n'The Color Purple,' by Alice Walker\n\nThe world would be a poorer place without Walker’s “The Color Purple.” Taking inspiration from her literary foremother Zora Neale Hurston, Walker centers on Southern Black women, who are all too often misrepresented in American culture. I was a little girl when I first picked up “The Color Purple” but it would take until I was an adult to fully comprehend the courage it took for Celie to let go of all the oppressive teachings she internalized and find her own freedom. Oftentimes, what people call “controversial” in literature is simply an author refusing to ignore the truth. Walker gave a gift to Black women and everyone else with “The Color Purple.” Celie’s relationship with Shug Avery may be a relationship that makes some people uncomfortable. But for Black LGBTQ individuals, it’s a necessary and affirming literary coupling. Don’t we all deserve to see our lives and truths reflected in the literature we read? – Quarshie\n\n'The Giver,' by Lois Lowry\n\nA must-read dystopian novel for any teen, I first read this book in middle school, and then I reread it in high school and college. The main character, a tween named Jonas, is given the important role as ‘Receiver of Memory,’ where he is supposed to retain the beautiful and dark moments others in his community can't see. He can see color in a black-and-white world as well as the environment, animals, human emotions and past experiences. The book sheds light on the importance of freedom and living life as one chooses to, but the message goes deeper than that. Valuing our relationships with our friends, family, and colleagues in the real world is a gift. Oftentimes, we lose sight of what makes our life beautiful, even though it is right in front of us. And those lessons are conveyed elegantly in this book, from start to finish. Life is spontaneous and crazy, and there shouldn’t be someone telling us how to live our life when we have the ability to carve our own destiny. Banning this book would be a loss for children, not a gain – Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'A Separate Peace,' by John Knowles\n\nI first read Knowles’ 1959 novel “A Separate Peace” at 14 as a closeted gay teenager. I next read “A Separate Peace” at 29 as an out gay adult. I provide this context because it absolutely shaped the way I read the story about wealthy teens at a New England boarding school at the start of WWII, and understood the relationship between Gene and Finny – one of platonic love bordering on romantic, one of pride bordering on envy and one of playing around bordering on violence. As clarified in David Levithan's afterword included in my edition, Knowles did not intend on homoeroticism between the characters. But Levithan gets to the heart of how I felt: “Knowles did not write about two boys who know they are gay or have conscious gay feelings, but he certainly created a compelling resonance for boys who do.” Thank you, Knowles, either way. – David Oliver\n\n'The Bluest Eye,' by Toni Morrison\n\nSetting aside every major literary award bestowed upon her, Morrison’s oeuvre is too important to American literature to ever be cast aside or banned. I was a teenager the first time I read “The Bluest Eye,” too young to truly grasp the horror of what Morrison was writing about. Now, as a dark-skinned Black woman rereading it, I understand the suffering that Pecola Breedlove was subjected to. Little Black girls deserve literature that doesn’t shy away from the pain that white supremacy and patriarchy inflicts upon them. If we can’t read and contemplate the horrors that are inflicted upon our children, how will we ever make the world a better place? Yes, “The Bluest Eye” takes an unflinchingly look at sexual violence and incest. But in a nation still reeling from the #MeToo movement, we cannot afford to look away. Black women, like Native American women, are at a disproportionate risk for sexual violence. The literature written about African American women shouldn’t ignore these horrifying statistics either. – Quarshie\n\n'The Handmaid's Tale,' by Margaret Atwood\n\nAtwood said she didn’t include any events in the book that hadn’t already happened in history or any technology not already available. “No imaginary gizmos, no imaginary laws, no imaginary atrocities,” she wrote in the New York Times in 2017. The result is a book about a theocratic dictatorship that takes over the United States after climate change and declining birth rates threaten to cripple the nation’s economy. Fertile women are reproductive slaves, forced to bear children for the elite. In the 1980s, when it was published, the book read as a response to the political rise of Christian fundamentalists, the bombing of abortion clinics and the control of those behind the Iron Curtain. As we sit in 2021 with climate change threatening our coastlines and crops, a rising threat of nationalism and attempts to chip away at the hard-fought rights of women, minorities and the LGBTQ community, the plot seems evermore an apt prediction. What could be more important now than a book that explores the dangers of totalitarianism as we watch democracy challenged on the very steps of Congress? A book that explores the power of women as the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements push the next wave of feminism forward? A book with dire warnings about what can happen when resources get scarce, as drought and wildfires have become the new norm for a swath of our country? Because of its plausibility, \"The Handmaid’s Tale\" is timeless and relevant. It was a necessary book in the 1980s and it's still a necessary book in 2021. – Katie Wedell\n\n'1984,' by George Orwell\n\nOne of the most thought-provoking and interesting dystopian books I have come across, I read \"1984\" back in high school when it was assigned reading for my English class. There is simply no other book that can quite frankly show readers what it would be like to live in a society where the freedom to think and make choices for oneself is not allowed. This book sheds light on why it is important for people to express themselves and make choices, and why freedom of expression is important in society. Another important theme that struck my attention was misinformation and disinformation being spread by the ruling party. . As an early career reporter, I strive to make sure that the public knows the truth and the facts. This book is a must-read for any high schooler because it teaches lessons that you wouldn’t get from any other book – Kochi\n\n'The Hunger Games,' (series) by Suzanne Collins\n\nI fell down the \"Hunger Games\" rabbit hole during the pandemic. What started as something to pass time turned into a deep dive into Collins' post-apocalyptic world of Panem, a society deeply divided by wealth disparity, where the elite are more concerned with pageantry than basic human rights. I couldn’t help but notice some striking parallels between the dystopia and our pandemic-riddled nation. The rich got richer. The poor got poorer. And although we don’t send a young boy and girl from each district to their televised demise, the constant loop of the trauma of Black and brown bodies being killed by police felt similar in the summer of 2020. The tale may have been outrageously dystopian when Collins originally published her first installment in 2008, but it is not as outrageous in the lens of 2021. Some Twitter users even compared the 2021 Met Gala in New York to a lavish party in District 1 as many communities grapple with the lasting effects of COVID-19. That’s exactly why this book shouldn’t be banned. – Cydney Henderson\n\n'A Wrinkle in Time,' by Madeleine L’Engle\n\nThe first time I read “A Wrinkle in Time,” I was even younger than the sci-fi classic’s 13-year-old heroine, Margaret (Meg) Murray. At the time, I didn’t know how much I needed a heroine like her in my life. As I’ve reread the book (and read it to my own kids) many years later, I’ve sent up a brief word of thanks that I was introduced to Meg. She is thrust into impossible peril with unfathomable stakes, and she overcomes it. Resentfully, even angrily, she saves her family, not despite her flaws but because of them. A wild, strange, sprawling tale, “A Wrinkle in Time” let me know, just as it has for generations of young readers, that there’s immense power in being yourself; that the galaxy is weird, wide and wonderful; that love is the answer no matter the question; and that you can be terrified and do brave things anyway – in fact, you must. – Jennifer Ernst Beaudry\n\n'Born a Crime,' by Trevor Noah\n\nNoah’s 2016 memoir, \"Born A Crime\" is at its core a love letter to his mother, whose romantic relationship with a Swiss man was a punishable offense in South Africa’s apartheid state. She rears Trevor through apartheid and its chaotic collapse, and eventually through her own abusive relationship with his stepfather by a mix of tough love, gallows humor and religion. Yet \"Born A Crime\" forces the reader – particularly American-born consumers – to look critically into corners where we too easily looked away. Certainly, apartheid was touched on in our history or government classes. Too often, though, its abstract presentation – brutal colonization, minority rule, a worthy martyr named Nelson Mandela – never encouraged us to get too close, lest we recognize our own pathologies. \"Born A Crime\" is breezy and sweet and often hilarious, a dubious target for censure, it would seem. Yet it does not equivocate in recounting a brutal chapter of history. – Gabe Lacques\n\n'Harry Potter,' (series) by J.K. Rowling\n\nIt's a shame that Rowling tarnished her own legacy in recent years by attacking transgender people – for fans, her hate speech felt like a betrayal of the very values her books espoused. \"The Harry Potter\" novels have been frequently challenged by religious groups for supposedly promoting witchcraft. But snatching these books out of the hands of children because of that supernatural bogeyman would be doing them an awful disservice. The series taught a generation of readers about empathy, friendship and courage in the face of political danger: Themes that Rowling would do well to apply to her own recent rhetoric. Harry Potter is a powerful example of fiction's ability to make us more thoughtful and discerning people, and for that, it should not be banned. The books should continue to be shared and obsessed over like they've been by readers of all ages for the past two decades. – Jason Lalljee", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2015/12/05/origin-who-dey-murky-its-message-not/76617696/", "title": "Where did Who Dey come from?", "text": "Carol Motsinger\n\ncmotsinger@enquirer.com\n\nWe know this for sure: It’s a riddle.\n\nIn practice, it’s an adjective. Noun. Pronoun. Verb. Adverb. Because it's Cincinnati, it's also a beer.\n\nIt’s still not really real words. Definitively not a phrase that can be looked up in a dictionary. But it’s something we scream. So it's only everything – and nothing.\n\nIt’s Who Dey.\n\nAnd the truncated Bengals battle cry is everywhere this season. Technically, it’s a big part – more than 50 percent big – of a boastful question of who could defeat the Cincinnati squad, now sitting atop the AFC North. The full chant? \"Who dey, who dey, who dey think gonna beat dem Bengals?”\n\nFollow every game: Live NFL Scores\n\nWell, this year, not many. OK, the Cardinals and the Texans. The Browns hoped to in the Battle of Ohio Sunday afternoon. But nobody else.\n\nSo this isn’t about that question. It's about how Who Dey came to be, you know, a shorthand for a million things said and felt in this city. Where does it come from? What are we truly saying when we say it? And what does it say about us, about Cincinnati?\n\nTrue story: A man gets up from his seat at Paul Brown Stadium during the first time the Bengals and the Browns clashed this season. Woman behind his row in the nosebleeds taps him on the shoulder. Asks for a refill for her Pepsi. His only response as he grabs her cup?\n\n\"Who Dey.\"\n\nSo it sounds like Who Dey can encapsulate a whole conversation too.\n\nLet's start by breaking it down, by asking the part of the chant we can definitely define: Dem Bengals themselves.\n\nOffensive tackle Andrew Whitworth doesn't know who coined it. But he recognizes its currency.\n\nIt's the victory yell, the team's rich refrain of celebration. The unofficial social media insignia too, the hashtag players use to label social media musings they dish out 140 characters at a time. They even label themselves with it: Three players, including quarterback Andy Dalton, sported Who Dey shirts in the locker room Wednesday.\n\nBut it's Cincinnati code that goes beyond the locker room. Who Dey is the secret password to prove you are one of us, accepted by both athlete and admirer. A greeting with more significance than a two-syllable grunt suggests.\n\nWhitworth explains it.\n\n\"Everywhere you go in town, instead of saying your name or saying anything to you about something, (fans) just walk by you and say 'Who Dey,'\" he said. \"I say 'Who Dey' back or a heads up or something acknowledging that I heard them. Some will say it under their breath because they don't want to cause a scene.\"\n\nDefensive end Carlos Dunlap sees it as the calling card of the Cincinnati's 12th player. Thousands and thousands and thousands of Who Deys accumulate and crush as an avalanche, burying the opposing offense in disorienting bellows. The 12th player at Paul Brown Stadium has been suiting up more often in the last four seasons of success, he said. And has been a star at the stadium during home games in this 9-2 season.\n\nOutside the gridiron, we can find Who Dey Bud Light signage draped on bars lining either side of the river. On shirts. Scrawled on poster boards and painted on faces.\n\nBut pinpointing exactly where Who Dey comes from? We can't stay in Cincinnati for that. Or just simply ask the Bengals organization.\n\nJust look for the genealogy of Who Dey under the site's frequently asked questions. Their answer goes to a fan forum discussion on the topic.\n\nOr at least it did: The link is dead. Even if the link lived, this isn't an answer that's just one click away. We have to travel some 700 miles away from Paul Brown Stadium. And to a time decades before the Jungle took root along the banks of the Ohio River.\n\nAccording to one well-circulated theory, the source comes from nearby another American waterway, the Mississippi River. Of course, this also means we are getting close to the biggest rivalry in NFL chants: Who Dat versus Who Dey.\n\nMore on that later.\n\nNo matter if you're hoarse on Monday from yelling \"Who Dey\" or \"Who Dat,\" everyone can agree on a few things here. In this which-came-first, chicken-and-egg game, these yolks are pretty scrambled. But it may be a key ingredient to getting a fix on Who Dey's beginnings.\n\nEven one of the earliest references to Who Dey in The Enquirer's archives – March 1983 – brings up the brouhaha in coverage of a Xavier University basketball game.\n\nAfter defeating the Musketeers, the Alcorn State University head coach gives his Mississippi school credit for inventing Who Dey during its 1979 NIT appearance. Or at least the fan formula that yields it (Their version: \"Who dat talkin' bout beating dhem Braves.\")\n\nThe Enquirer's own Paul Daugherty agrees Who Dey's forefather was born in 1979. But in neighboring Louisiana. And from the stands of the Patterson High football field, the home of the Lumberjacks. And yes, you guessed it, this cheer: \"Who dat? Who dat? Who dat said they gon' beat 'dem 'Jacks?\"\n\nIn a 2010 story, Daugherty says the 5,000-person town 75 miles southwest of New Orleans ultimately inspired both the big time Bengals and the Saints (only after the Who Dat cheer graduated to LSU's Tiger Stadium in the early 1980s).\n\nSo can there be no victor in the battle between which \"Who\" came first?\n\nOutside the sidelines, both phrases have roots that trace as far back as 18th century Southern Appalachia. It would have been commonly used by northern British and Northern Irish settlers then. Now, we call these colonists the ancestors of Cincinnati.\n\nOn the football field, there are, at least, some ways to tally points on who is the copycat.\n\nCincinnati scores the most points in the 1981-82 season, edging out a spike in the New Orleans Who Dat craze by a mere couple years: The voice of the Big Easy, Aaron Neville, crooned “Who Dat” for the Saints in 1984.\n\nThe Bengals’ 12th season with the NFL emerged as the moment of maturity. Cincinnati’s team grew into its body, securing its first AFC Championship in 1981 before falling to San Francisco in Super Bowl XVI.\n\nDave Lapham was there. An offensive lineman for the Bengals from 1974-1983, the color commentator for the Bengals remembers that was \"really when (Who Dey) took full hold,\" he said. He's doesn't know how exactly it started.\n\n\"There are a million stories out there,\" he said.\n\nIf he has to pick just one of the legends, he'll likely go with another major theory. Who Dey was born of beer.\n\nNot just any beer. The Queen City's own Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Company.\n\nGreg Hardman, owner of Christian Moerlein Brewing Co., agrees with Lapham (Hudepohl is now a subsidiary of Moerlein).\n\nThe genesis he hears the most is that \"... beer vendors and bartenders selling Hudepohl at Riverfront Stadium and at bars across Cincinnati began shouting, Hudy or HuDey for the beer name as that bears a phonetic similarity to who they,\" he said.\n\nThere was also something brewing at home in 1980. A popular television commercial for Red Frazier Ford of Cincinnati, which was going out of business at the time, featured a similar boast: ”Who's going to give you a better deal than Red Frazier?...Nobody!\"\n\nHuDey beer label back on the shelves\n\nRecognize that \"Nobody\"? That's the only response a Bengals devotee will submit at the end of the Who Dey chant. It’s the final word of the “Bengals Growl,” which fills the stadium after every Bengals touchdown.\n\nHardman thinks the HuDey beer vendors' efforts coupled with that commercial seems \"to be the most plausible explanation as to its origins.\"\n\n“I can see rabid fans, which I am one of them, coming up with this in bars and the stadium,\" he said. \"I personally do not believe it originated in New Orleans with Who Dat, as no righteous Cincinnati football fan would claim something from another city.\"\n\nHudepohl also was the first company to turn the Who Dey commercial. The chant appeared on the 1981 HuDey beer can. The Bengals-themed beer returned when the Bengals returned to the Super Bowl in 1988.\n\n\"My friends that are collectors tell me this story about when they sold a $500 can of the original HuDey can from 1981,\" he said. \"Every time it’s brought up, the dollar amount gets higher and higher, seems like an old fish tale to me!\"\n\nTwenty-seven years later, Hardman is still asked about HuDey beer. On a daily basis. Every fan of Hudepohl has also asked him at least once, probably twice, if the company will revive the HuDey beer.\n\nIn a way, it's back.\n\nThe company just released its Hudepohl Pure Lager with HuDey packaging.\n\nNot that Who Dey doesn't show up in all kinds of Cincinnati places already. And it's on the move.\n\nThere is an actual Who Dey on the field. That's the mascot.\n\nWhat does this Who Dey wrapped in black and orange striped fabric mean? \"It personifies the team spirit,\" said Jack Brennan, Bengals public relations director. Who Dey is a mischievous character, one who tries to bedevil the rival team's mascot. In a funny, playful way, of course.\n\nIn 2012, Cincinnati welcomed another tiger named Who Dey. This time, one that walks on four legs. More than 1,000 Bengals season ticket holders named a Malayan tiger Who Dey at Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. He was recently traded to a zoo in Kansas, which is extremely disappointing.\n\nEspecially if you're a Chiefs fan.\n\nHowever, the exact history of Who Dey is really not a factor. And that's coming from a historian.\n\nKevin Grace is the head of the archives and rare books library at University of Cincinnati. He's also a sports historian.\n\n\"I think what matters is that people discuss it,\" he said.\n\nHe does know why people say Who Dey, why it's been part of the fabric of the franchise for more than a generation.\n\nLook at it: It's a prime sports chant specimen.\n\n\"It's got to be a simple phrase,\" he said. \"It's got to be repeatable.\" Oh, and it helps if it's kid-friendly, non-offensive.\n\nWho Dey is an inheritance.\n\n\"If it's something they can easily grasp, it's enfranchising young kids into being sports fans,\" Grace said.\n\nShouting about anything is a natural impulse at a sporting event, Grace said. \"It promotes a sense of camaraderie,\" he said. \"And that's what sports fans love. They want to be part of a movement.\"\n\nWitnessing sports also breaks down some inhibitions. Alcohol can help fuel that, he said. But mostly these expression run on emotions.\n\n\"It brings different people together,\" he said. \"You become emotionally involved. It's important for your own validation and validation of your own community ... they are watching something pleasurable and participating vicariously.\"\n\nIn that way, Who Dey would fit right into the pews of a church. It's call-and-response. \"You can say a prayer for the Bengals or say the chant,\" he said.\n\nThe full chant is also musical. Rhythmic. Like a hit song. Actually, it's been one. More than once.\n\nSportscaster Zip Rzeppa recorded \"The Who Dey Song\" in 1982. In 1989, Cincinnati native and musician Greg Jackson produced the \"Who Dey Rap\" (below) with members of the Bengals team. Who Dey is also the backbone of Bootsy Collins' 2005 \"Fear da Tiger\" Bengals theme song.\n\n\"Every time the Bengals are winning, I get my phone call,\" the now Dayton-based Jackson said. So his phone's been ringing a lot this year.\n\nOnce screened at the stadium and on ESPN, the “Who Dey Rap” YouTube video now pops up in Facebook feeds on game day.\n\nHe's not sure who penned that Who Dey chorus of his song. He just knows how it was it used and how it still makes him feel.\n\n\"It's about morale,\" he said \"It's about lifting morale and the spirit.\"\n\nJackson's \"Who Dey Rap\" was a gift to Cincinnati. He didn't sell it then. He might have it on cassette.\n\nIn some box somewhere.\n\nNow, Who Dey is a part of Cincinnati. \"It’s become entrenched,\" Grace said. \"It's been an identifier.\"\n\nIt's to speech what Carew Tower is to architecture. It's even been part of the skyline: During the Bengals season, the windows of The Great American Tower have lit up to spell the phrase.\n\nWhen we say Who Dey we are also saying something about the Queen City. It reveals a bit about where we come from, a holler echoing from down in the hollers of Southern Appalachia.\n\nBut also who we are today. A working class town that's not trying to ace any grammar tests during a freaking football game. And its wrongness makes it even more right, according to Mickey Mentzer, a contributor to popular fan site, cincyjungle.com.\n\n\"It grates on the nerves of the (opposing team's) fans,\" he said.\n\nSee, our Queen's collar is blue. She's got rust under her nails. And she welcomes the kind of football fans who aren't at the game just to be seen, Grace said.\n\nWe aren't riding in on a high horse. We are cheering for a monkey that's riding a herding dog during halftime of Monday Night Football. Hell, we are so gritty we tailgate in a cement company’s parking lot, next to mixers, behind massive piles of gravel.\n\nGrace reads Who Dey this way. \"We are a fairly close-knit community,\" he said.\n\n\"There are so many things in our life that isolate (us),\" he said. \"We've become alienated. When you have something like Who Dey or a chant, it tends to break down some social and class barriers because you are all cheering for the same thing. ... It's a building block in terms of getting the city excited for something.\"\n\nThe Bengals do. They registered trademarks for it in 2003 and 2005.\n\nThese registrations coincide with the revival of Who Dey once head coach Marvin Lewis took the helm. Lapham said Lewis aimed to align his team with its historic heyday.\n\nSure, Who Dey didn't go away during the 1990s. It was a bit dormant though. A yawn more than a roar. Remember there were a lot of teams beating dem Bengals in those seasons.\n\nIn 2015, Who Dey is a legend with a life of its own, regardless of its parents.\n\nIt was born in the stands. Raised in the checkout line.\n\nThen, Who Dey turned 30 and became a company man. An ambassador for the city in its free time.\n\nBut you better believe Who Dey is getting a lot more invitations to the party if the Bengals keep winning.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/12/28/definitive-guide-reflecting-horrific-and-hopeful-2017/987241001/", "title": "Your definitive guide to 2017: A year of hope and horror", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWhat we did\n\nWe started the year by inaugurating Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States. A day later, millions gathered to denounce the new commander-in-chief and marched in the largest single-day protest in U.S. history. The rest of 2017 was no less dramatic. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn got the boot over his Russian contacts. NFL players knelt. Tragedy struck when a catastrophic hurricane season devastated parts of the U.S. and a Las Vegas gunman brought us the worst mass shooting in American history. A captivated nation witnessed the first Pacific-to-Atlantic solar eclipse in nearly 100 years and lit up with the news that biracial American actress Meghan Markle would indeed wed Prince Harry this spring. In the end, 2017 encouraged us to hope. Women punctuated the year with the powerful rallying cry #MeToo, prompting a national reckoning on sexual violence. Need more? Here are 50 stories from 50 states that moved us in 2017.\n\nWhat we read\n\nPresident Trump's remarkable rise to the White House kicked off the year, but believe it or not, he did not remain the most attention-grabbing news. The storyline of Trump's first year in office was eclipsed by a kiss cam, a diet trend, a dead elk and, well, an actual eclipse. We took a look at the 10 most-read stories this year, and found that while Trump's whirlwind presidency did crack our list of top-read stories twice, an assortment of coverage parts tragic, heartwarming and practical rounded out the rest.\n\nWhat we said\n\nAccording to your favorite dictionaries: 1. \"Feminism\" was Merriam-Webster's word of the year. You can thank the women's march, Kellyanne Conway and #MeToo for that. 2. Dictionary.com chose \"complicit,\" which it said first began trending when Ivanka Trump said she didn't know what it meant \"to be complicit\" in her father's presidency (Merriam-Webster filled her in). 3. Collins Dictionary's pick was \"fake news,\" an obvious nod towards the president. 4. And Oxford Dictionaries gave its crown to \"youthquake,\" which it defines as \"a significant cultural, political, or social change arising from the actions or influence of young people.\" (Not everyone was convinced.)\n\nWho we lost\n\nWe said goodbye to many remarkable people in 2017, though this year’s PASSAGES — USA TODAY's annual tribute to them — is more than a list of notable remembrances. In many ways, it's a final salute to a century gone by. The archaic-sounding “1900s,” that included the Great Depression, two world wars, the civil rights movement, the fall of Communism and the dawn of the Internet, are fast fading in our collective memory. The names of the 20th-century giants we lost — among them, Fats Domino, Tom Petty, Hugh Hefner, Mary Tyler Moore, David Cassidy, Dick Gregory and Jerry Lewis — may survive, but Millennials now outnumber the Baby Boomers, and their generation has begun their own stream of history. Beyond the big names, lives were lost that are no less notable: among them, victims at a concert in Las Vegas, at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and along a bike path in Manhattan. Let's remember them all.\n\nWhat you thought\n\nThis December, we asked you to submit your 2017 year-end review. The highlights are here, but we'll give Ken Derow from Swarthmore, Pa., the last word: \"Whether you see 2017 as a good year depends, as always, on your personal perspective and your priorities. What remains clear is that the outcome for 2018 is not yet cast in stone. It will depend on the collective actions of millions of American citizens and on the singular actions of one man: Donald J. Trump. My hope for the new year is that we all strive to be better informed and more engaged in the political process so that, in the end, our resolve will make it a better year for all.\"\n\nThis is a compilation of stories from across USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/28"}]}

Similar marches took place in other cities across the UK.\n\nLabour MP for Walthamstow Stella Creasy joined the “March of the Mummies”, which was organised by the charity Pregnant Then Screwed. Writing in The Guardian, she called for Rishi Sunak to “take note” of the campaign and “invest in childcare” if he’s “serious about fixing the British economy”.\n\nCost calculations\n\nData indicates that for many women, deciding whether to return to work after having a baby – or even whether to have a child at all – has become a question of cost calculations.\n\nResearch published by Pregnant Then Screwed in July found that of 1,630 women who had had an abortion in the last five years, 60.5% said that the cost of childcare had influenced their decision. The charity also found that 62% of 28,000 mothers surveyed said that childcare costs were among the reasons that they had decided not to have any more children.\n\nCompared to other countries, the UK’s childcare costs are among the highest. According to data gathered by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the net costs in the UK amount to around 29% of the average wage, compared to Germany’s 1% and France’s 14%.\n\n“We’re a global joke, and mothers are the punchline,” said Joeli Brearley, the charity’s founder, writing in The Independent.\n\nAs a result, women in the UK “are leaving the workforce in their droves – meaning their taxes and their talent both go untapped”, said Creasy. “The system fails fathers too,” she continued; parental leave “may as well be called ‘parental lump it’ because so few can actually afford to take it”.\n\nStarting from scratch\n\n“The system is rigged against women,” said Holly Mead in The Times. “There should be no situation where going to work leaves you out of pocket.”\n\n“Nurseries closing, lack of staff and the nonsensical child benefit system” are among the “many” problems, said Mead. Data published by Ofsted in June found that in the year to March, around 4,000 childcare providers had stopped offering their services – the biggest drop since 2015-16.\n\n“The obvious solution is to provide a level of free childcare from whatever time a woman chooses to go back to work,” said Mead. The system “needs ripping up entirely and restarting from scratch”.\n\n“Women’s economic empowerment hinges on a system that works for us,” said Brearley, and the country’s economy “won’t thrive if we don’t end the motherhood penalty that is keeping women stuck in a nightmare”, said Creasy.\n\nSunak’s “track record does not bode well”, the MP continued. The former chancellor was accused of sexism last year after telling MPs that “mums everywhere” were “owed a debt of thanks for ‘juggling childcare and work’ during lockdown”, said The New European.\n\nPregnant Then Screwed had taken the then chancellor to court several months earlier for allegedly discriminating against women through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, which didn’t account for periods of maternity leave when calculating an individual’s average earnings.\n\n“While mothers may be surviving on a diet of Pom-Bears and strong coffee, we also have a voice and a vote, and we’re not afraid to use either,” said Creasy.", "authors": ["Julia O"], "publish_date": "2022/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/07/asia/john-lee-hong-kong-chief-executive-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "title": "John Lee, Hong Kong's next leader, is a hardline former police ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nAs night fell, chaos erupted when crowds of protesters outside Hong Kong’s legislative building hurled bottles at police, who fired pepper spray and swung batons, dragging some people to the ground.\n\nIt was a shocking descent into violence from what began as a peaceful march, attended by more than a million people by some estimates – roughly one in seven of the city’s population -- to oppose a bill that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China.\n\nIt was June 9, 2019 – and Hong Kong was about to change forever, as it plunged into months of mass protests, bloody street battles and an unprecedented crackdown by authorities that saw Beijing tighten its grip on the city with a sweeping national security law.\n\nLast week, the man who led the crackdown stepped onto a stage to lay out his vision for Hong Kong – this time not as the city’s security chief, but its next leader.\n\nJohn Lee speaking at an interview in Hong Kong on September 17, 2021. Chen Yongnuo/China News Service/Getty Images\n\nJohn Lee, who became the face of the national security law and who oversaw the arrests of dozens of activists and raids on newsrooms, is set to replace outgoing Chief Executive Carrie Lam when she finishes her five-year term at the end of June.\n\nIn what the government billed as an “open, just and honest” election, a largely government-appointed, pro-Beijing committee of 1,461 people appointed the next leader for the city’s 7.5 million residents on Sunday.

Lee has already indicated that he will look to introduce further national security legislation and possibly a law against fake news.\n\nTo Nathan Law, a human rights activist and former local lawmaker now in self-exile in Britain, it seems “very obvious” why Lee is tipped for the role.\n\n“It really signals (authorities) are intensifying that heavy-handed approach to Hong Kong, and putting the so-called national security as their policy for governing the city,” Law said.\n\nA rise years in the making\n\nThe forces behind Lee’s rise to the city’s top job can be traced back nearly half a century.\n\nLee joined the Hong Kong police force as a 19-year-old recruit in 1977 as the city – then a British colony – underwent an economic transformation into a modern financial center.\n\nHe rose through the ranks and was promoted to chief superintendent in 1997 – the same year Britain handed the city to China in a pomp-filled ceremony watched around the world.\n\nSince that watershed year, activists like Law say they have watched Hong Kong’s freedoms be squeezed ever tighter. All the while, Lee continued gaining prominence, becoming deputy commissioner, the second-highest position in the police force, by 2010.\n\nA woman reacts to pepper spray as police were clearing protesters in Hong Kong on Wednesday, July 1.

Roy Liu/Bloomberg/Getty Images Prev Next\n\nJust two years after that, he joined the city’s Security Bureau as under-secretary. To some, the appointment of a high-ranking police officer to a key government office was a statement of intent.\n\n“We were already really nervous about that, because that really signaled a change in Hong Kong’s policy, changing it in a seemingly more suppressive way,” Law said.\n\nBy 2016, when Law was elected into the legislature, Lee “was already notoriously difficult to deal with” and seemed hostile to any journalists or opposition lawmakers who raised questions or challenges, Law said.\n\nLee’s supporters have disputed this characterization, maintaining his time in the police force helped prepare him for a public office.\n\nOne pro-Beijing lawmaker, Ma Fung-kwok, said Lee had demonstrated “leadership skills” in his handling of the protests and the pandemic, according to public broadcaster RTHK. Another, Jeffrey Lam, said Lee had “solved many cases” in the police force and can cooperate with “other sectors in the society.”\n\nAt a brief political rally on Friday, Lee, whose slogan is “We and us – a new chapter together,” stressed the importance of community and promised to “make Hong Kong a place of hope” once appointed.\n\nCNN has reached out to Lee’s campaign team for comment.\n\nThe 2019 protests\n\nLee’s rise continued when he was appointed security chief in 2017 – the “beginning of a changing trend,” said Joseph Cheng, a retired Hong Kong academic and pro-democracy activist now based in New Zealand.\n\n“Beijing seems to be emphasizing loyalty more, or the capability of implementing a hard line – therefore, senior officials from the disciplinary forces appear to occupy a more advantageous position,” Cheng said.\n\nIt was under Lee’s tenure that the Security Bureau introduced the controversial extradition bill that led to the protests in 2019.\n\nCritics worried Beijing could use the bill to prosecute Hong Kong residents for political reasons under China’s opaque legal system.\n\nProtesters march against a proposed extradition bill on June 16, 2019 in Hong Kong. Carl Court/Getty Images\n\nWith the Hong Kong government standing firm on the bill despite public objections, the protests quickly expanded into a broader pro-democracy, anti-government movement. Fears were underpinned by widespread anxiety about Beijing’s growing influence and the perceived erosion of Hong Kong’s cherished semi-autonomous status, which allowed it the freedoms of press, speech and assembly that had long been central to its international appeal.\n\nWithdrawing the bill was just one of five popular demands by protesters; others included universal suffrage and accountability from police, who faced accusations of brutality they have denied.\n\nAt the height of the crisis, protesters and police clashed nearly every week, with demonstrators lobbing bricks and Molotov cocktails and officers responding with tear gas, rubber bullets, and at times live ammunition. The violence polarized the city, cementing the breakdown in trust between the public and the authorities.\n\nA protester throws back a tear gas canister fired by police in Hong Kong on October 1, 2019. ISAAC LAWRENCE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThrough it all, Lee praised his officers as “courageous” and condemned protesters as “radicals” who were sowing “terror.” When hundreds of protesters – many high school students – occupied a university for more than a week, police laid siege to the campus with Lee declaring: “We will arrest them all.”\n\nLee has repeatedly defended the force’s actions, insisting critics need to “think about the (preceding events), otherwise it will not be fair.”\n\n“I am proud of the Hong Kong police force. They remain Asia’s finest … Compared to what they do with law enforcement agencies overseas, I think they have exercised restraint. They have minimized the harm and injuries to everybody,” he said in September 2019.\n\nLong arm of the national security law\n\nLee gained local prominence for his role in combating the protests – but his implementation of the national security law cemented his reputation as a hardline enforcer and Beijing loyalist.\n\nThe security law was promulgated by Beijing in June 2020, during a lull in the protests brought by the Covid-19 pandemic. Described by the Hong Kong government at the time as “a crucial step to ending chaos,” the law criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces – and allows for maximum sentences of life imprisonment.\n\nIn an instant, Hong Kong’s social and political landscape was transformed, and within months, many of the city’s leading pro-democracy figures were either in jail or exile.\n\nPolice officers raid the Apple Daily headquarters in Hong Kong on August 10, 2020. Apple Daily/AP\n\nUnder the security law, Lee oversaw the mass arrest of opposition figures in 2021, accusing them of trying to “paralyze the Hong Kong government” by organizing a pro-democracy primary election.\n\nHe ordered a police raid on Hong Kong’s biggest pro-democracy newspaper, Apple Daily, which was subsequently forced to shut after its assets were frozen and several employees arrested under the security law.\n\nA week after the raid, Lee was promoted to chief secretary – the second-highest position in government – and the first time a security official has taken the role.\n\nExperts say Lee’s suppression of the protests and support for national security is precisely why he now finds himself the city’s next leader.\n\n“(This is) the reward for loyalty,” said Cheng, the activist and former academic.\n\nSupporters of the security law insist it has helped establish stability in the wake of the violence and political unrest of 2019. “People’s lives and property are protected, and they can once again enjoy their legitimate rights and freedoms,” a government spokesperson said in April in response to a question on the law.\n\nBut Lee’s association with the law has been met with increasing scrutiny abroad. He was among nearly a dozen people sanctioned by the US in 2020 for undermining the city’s autonomy and democratic processes – which Lee has scoffed at, recently calling the sanctions “unreasonable” and “acts of bullying.”\n\nHe has also continued to defend the law, as well as recent electoral changes that placed him at the head of a vetting committee to screen all candidates, ensuring only “patriots” would be allowed to run for office.\n\nThe national security law “has restored peace,” Lee told the United Nations Human Rights Council in March, decrying the 2019 protests as “evil” and lauding “the improved electoral system.”\n\n“No country has a monopoly on the model of democracy,” he added.\n\nWhat this means for Hong Kong\n\nLee has already made clear the kind of government he will shape: one with increasingly close ties to mainland China.\n\nAt the unveiling of his policy manifesto on April 29, Lee emphasized the need to integrate Hong Kong with other economically important Chinese cities. There was no English translation provided, despite English being one of Hong Kong’s two official languages – in striking contrast to most government events to date.\n\nHe also vowed to bolster security legislation and introduce “national identity” education. Both proposals have long been controversial, with previous attempts to introduce legislation foiled by protests and pushback – much to Beijing’s frustration.\n\nLee has also previously voiced support for a “fake news” law – prompting fears the reins will only tighten on what remains of the city’s media and civil groups. Last week, the city’s press freedom ranking plunged to a record low of 148 among 180 locations, compared to its ranking of 73rd in 2019.\n\nDespite this, the outgoing Chief Executive Lam continues to claim that Hong Kong’s media sphere is “as vibrant as ever,” though she warned last week that “media organizations are not above the law … including the national security law.”\n\nLee will also have to navigate the Covid-19 pandemic, with patience fraying among many in Hong Kong after more than two years of stringent restrictions in accordance with China’s unbending zero-Covid policy.\n\nAt his policy manifesto event, Lee asserted that “at some point (the virus) will be under control,” and that he would design measures to allow businesses to operate.\n\nCheng, the pro-democracy activist who moved to New Zealand, sees the future as being “the continuation of the hard line of the past two years.”\n\n“There is no toleration of political opposition … there will be very little tolerance of an independent media, and very little tolerance for the operation of civil society organizations,” Cheng said.\n\nWhen asked by CNN about accusations of diminished political freedoms, a government spokesperson responded that the rights of Hong Kong residents are “protected in accordance with the law” – but that “many freedoms and rights are not absolute, and can be restricted for reasons including protection of national security and public safety.”\n\nDisillusionment and emigration\n\nAmong former activists and pro-democracy supporters, there’s a sense of despair as Lee prepares to take office.\n\nThe circumstances of his selection, with Lee as the sole contender showered with praise by pro-Beijing lawmakers, cut particularly deep for many of those who once marched to demand greater democratic freedoms.\n\n“It’s definitely not, by any means or any parameters, a democratic (process),” said Law, the former lawmaker. “It’s really just an appointment. I don’t really call it an election.”\n\nLee has dodged questions about whether he was handpicked by the central Chinese government, saying in April he welcomed anybody else who wished to run.\n\nHe has since received endorsements from leading establishment figures, including two former police commissioners and two former security chiefs, RTHK reported.\n\nAfter the turmoil of the past three years, even a new administration is unlikely to bridge the broken relationship between the government and its people, said John Burns, emeritus professor at the University of Hong Kong.\n\n“There is a huge percentage of the population that is alienated and angry,” he said, pointing to mass emigration as “evidence of alienation … of a sick society.”\n\nLocals, expatriates and foreign companies are leaving the city in droves. More than 100,000 Hong Kongers applied for a new visa offering a path to citizenship in Britain last year; and in February and March alone this year, more than 180,000 people left the city while only about 39,000 entered, according to immigration data.\n\nWhile Hong Kong’s harsh Covid restrictions are helping drive this exodus, Lee’s critics say that so too is the crackdown on civil liberties he enforced.\n\nAsked about this on April 29, Lee brushed it off. He claimed Hong Kong had always seen high levels of mobility, and that its proximity to the mainland market would continue to attract businesses.\n\n“We are an inclusive city,” he told reporters. “Together, we start a new chapter for Hong Kong.”", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/05/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/11/05/london-police-clamp-down-million-mask-protest/93341660/", "title": "Donald Trump effigy burned during U.K. Bonfire Night", "text": "Doug Stanglin\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nEngland's Guy Fawkes Night, an annual event that includes protest marches, bonfires and fireworks, acknowledged its former American colonies this year by burning Donald Trump in effigy.\n\nA rendering of the Republican presidential candidate standing more than 30 feet high went up in flames Saturday in Edenbridge as part of the annual event, which also is called Bonfire Night, according to an ITV news report.\n\nTrump effigies also were scheduled to be torched in Lewes, another English town, The (London) Daily Mailreported.\n\nIn London, thousands of protesters flooded the central part of the city for the annual \"Million Mask March,\" which is held on Guy Fawkes Night.\n\nMan near White House with firearm prompts lockdown\n\nLondon police imposed tighter restrictions this year, including a three-hour time limit, after the 2015 event led to violent confrontations and resulted in more than 50 arrests.\n\nBy late evening, police had reported 53 arrests in connection with the march, The (London) Telegraph reported. Scotland Yard told The Telegraph that the arrests included three for possession of an offensive weapon, 14 for drugs and two for the non-removal of a face mask.

She works at Tesco (TSCDF), a supermarket chain, where she has seen “every single product” rise in price.\n\n“Milk was 80p ($1.05). The smallest one, that’s gone to £1 ($1.31),” she said. “The bread — the cheapest bread that we used to do for £1 — has gone to £1.20 ($1.57).”\n\nAnnual consumer price inflation hit 5.5% in January in the United Kingdom — its highest level since 1992 — fueled by product shortages and a sharp spike in demand as pandemic lockdowns were lifted. Wages aren’t keeping pace.\n\nAverage worker pay suffered its biggest drop in more than seven years in the three months to January, falling by 1% over the same period a year ago once inflation is taken into account, the UK Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday. And the war in Ukraine has driven energy costs even higher — gasoline and diesel prices have soared to new record highs in recent days.\n\nThe Boiler House has multiple sites, including the Northwold Youth & Community Hub in east London. Keisha Hollands\n\nThe Boiler House Youth and Community Space started its food pantry during the coronavirus pandemic. Unlike a traditional food bank, guests browse and shop for their own items, paying a £6.50 ($8.50) fee to receive about £35 ($46) worth of food and toiletries.\n\nBut the charity’s services have expanded to provide members with shoes and help paying their energy bills as many struggle with the most severe knock to their purchasing power in years.\n\nDavina Mathurin, project officer for The Boiler House, summarized the dilemma many are facing.\n\n“Do you either keep the house warm so [your] children don’t get ill?” she said. “Or do [you] buy food so they can eat and they’re not hungry?”\n\nMillions of people’s fuel bills rose in October when Britain’s energy regulator increased its consumer price cap — the maximum suppliers can charge per unit of energy — by 12% after a global natural gas supply crunch pushed wholesale prices up to record levels.\n\nA shopper carries his purchases in Walthamstow, east London, on February 13. Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn the day CNN Business visited in February, Mathurin had started referring some members to fuel voucher programs organized by charities that offer up to £49 ($64) to help with bills. Demand was high, she said.\n\nMonique John, another regular visitor to the Boiler House, told CNN Business that she owns a smart meter. The device helps her conserve energy, but her money does not stretch nearly as far as it used to.\n\n“You just literally watch [the meter] go down and down and down and down and down,” she said.\n\n‘There’s just nothing left to give’\n\nThe worst is yet to come.\n\nIn April, the energy price cap will soar by 54% — its largest ever rise — burdening 22 million people with an annual bill of roughly £2,000 ($2,618). Inflation is also expected to peak above 7% and a new payroll tax to help fund health and social care will take effect.\n\nSteam and smoke is seen rising from the chimneys and central heating vents of houses in January in London. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nThe higher costs could push the number of “destitute” households — defined as those unable to afford basic necessities — up by a third to hit 1 million, according to analysis by The National Institute of Economic and Social Research.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine last month pushed wholesale gas prices up even further as global markets panicked over whether sanctions would hit Russian exports. Analysts at investment bank Investec said Britons’ annual energy bills after October — the next time the price cap is adjusted — could rocket past £3,000 ($3,927) as a result.\n\n“Now there’s just nothing left to give from people’s budgets. There’s no way the numbers add up now,” Lucy Bannister, policy campaigns manager at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an anti-poverty charity, told CNN Business.\n\n“Children are feeling too scared to ask for the heating to be put on,” she added. “They’re really kind of taking on that stress that they’re seeing their parents go through. Feeling hungry and not asking for a snack.”\n\nThe government will try to ease the pain by cutting local taxes and allowing millions of Britons to spread the cost of their energy bills over the next few years.\n\nA government spokesperson told CNN Business that it was “providing support worth around £12 billion ($16 billion) this financial year and next, to help households with the cost of living.”\n\nThe spokesperson added that the government would raise the minimum wage by more than £1,000 ($1,309) a year and hike a benefit claimed by people on low incomes by the same amount. Both will start in April.\n\nCritics say the government’s response is inadequate and fails to target those who need it most.\n\nIan Allinson, a member of the executive committee at Manchester Trades Union Council, which organized a protest against higher costs in February, said the situation is “alarming.” He said the government’s plan to delay energy payments won’t help vulnerable people.\n\n“We’re appalled when the main measure the government has announced [to bring down energy bills] is that we have to give ourselves a loan,” he told CNN Business.\n\n“A lot of people are struggling with debt already. The idea that there’s then enforced further debt rather than any genuine help is just shocking.”\n\nPeople march through Manchester on February 12, as protests were held nationally against rising energy bills and the cost of living. Ryan Jenkinson/Story Picture Agency/Shutterstock\n\nAngry Britons are taking to the streets. Protesters, and the opposition Labour Party, have called for a windfall tax on energy companies like BP (BP) and Shell (RDSA), which made billions in profit last year.\n\n“It’s just scandalous that the government is choosing to not do something effective to support ordinary people but is happy to leave those mega profits for the companies that are inflicting this on us,” Allinson said.\n\nPaychecks can’t keep up\n\nAt a north London church, piles of groceries are laid out in a grid on the floor of a small side building. Volunteers are packing the donated items into bags before driving them to people’s doors.\n\nCooking Champions, an organization which caters for charitable groups and local businesses, started its delivery service in April 2020 after the pandemic hit.\n\nAnnalisa Moseley is one of the first to receive her shopping. The mother-of-two said that without Cooking Champions, some weeks she would have no food. Thinking about what will happen after April is stressful, she said.\n\nVolunteers at Cooking Champions in London create food parcels using donated and redistributed food. Clare Donovan\n\n“It’s all on my shoulders sort of thing to make sure the kids are warm and fed and everything,” Moseley said. “It has been getting me down a little bit, but just got to carry on. Keep trying.”\n\nMoseley receives Universal Credit — a benefit for people who are out of work or on low incomes. The government hiked payments by £20 ($26) a week during the pandemic, but that ended in October 2021. The benefit will increase by 3.1% in April, but that’s less than half the expected rate of inflation.\n\nRising wages can’t keep up either.\n\nThe Spring Community Hub, a food and clothes bank 15 miles to the south across London, runs another door-to-door delivery service. Lately, volunteers have helped increasing numbers of younger and more affluent people.\n\n“We’re seeing more working people and people on those precarious hours particularly,” CEO Felicia Boshorin told CNN Business.\n\n“When the actual money comes, it’s not enough,” she added.\n\nParents are ‘dreading’ September\n\nSeptember looms large for parents worried about the cost of school uniforms. Shirts, sweaters and jackets emblazoned with school logos — mandatory in the United Kingdom — can run into the hundreds of pounds for a single child.\n\nOne in 10 British families have fallen into debt buying items needed for school, according to a 2020 survey by The Children’s Society, a charity. That figure could grow in 2022 — clothes and footwear were the biggest contributors to inflation in the month to January, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nCaroline Rice, who lives in Northern Ireland, is “dreading” the new school year. She is a member of Covid Realities, a research project documenting the experiences of low income families during the pandemic.\n\n“I can’t afford £100 ($131) for oil, so why would I pay £50 ($65), £60 ($79) for a school blazer?” she said.\n\nBack at The Boiler House, parents are turning up with their children to browse shelves of colorful sneakers, donations provided by charity Sal’s Shoes. Begum’s daughter rushes over to a pair of white and pink sparkly Converse and tries them on.\n\n“With poverty there is that loss of dignity if you’re just effectively being handed handouts,” said CJ Bowry, the founder of Sal’s Shoes.\n\nSal's Shoes' St Paul's Centre in Crewe, on February 16. Courtesy Sal's Shoes St Paul's Centre\n\nIts three pop-up stores around the country aim to give “families a shopping experience,” she said. “So they can visit these shops and try on shoes and choose shoes and see a selection of shoes — but they don’t have to pay.”\n\nSal’s Shoes has sent nearly 3 million pairs to 54 countries in its eight years, though more and more are being sent closer to home. The charity distributed 48,000 pairs around the United Kingdom in 2021, its highest number ever.\n\nBowry said she receives calls every day from school principals asking for support.\n\n“We have headteachers who’ve done playground duty and then ring us because they’ve literally noticed children in their playground with the soles flapping off their shoes,” she said.\n\n‘Hardship is harder’\n\nThe Bank of England expects inflation to cool after peaking in April, but high prices will stick around.\n\nFor people who have taken on new debts and fallen behind on their bills, there will be a scarring effect that could last for years.\n\nResearch by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation last year found that 4.4 million low income households began borrowing or added to existing debts during the pandemic. Of that number, more than two thirds are behind on their repayments.\n\nJoseph De-Ville, another member of Covid Realities, lives in Cornwall with his wife and three children. He got into debt a couple of years ago to pay for his mother’s funeral, and told CNN Business about the constant struggle to provide for his family.\n\n“This is the parts of life that people aren’t seeing,” he said. “We’re locking it up into credit cards so we can cope, and then we’re struggling to pay the debts because [of] the interest rates — because we’re having to take high interest rate credit cards just so we can get by.”\n\nFor over a decade, real incomes and living standards for millions of Britons have dropped. For De-Ville, the rising cost of living is just the latest chapter of an extended crisis.\n\n“Hardship is harder,” he said.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/society/957918/the-issue-with-anti-monarchists-and-free-speech", "title": "'A fundamental right': free speech and anti-monarchists | The Week UK", "text": "The arrests of anti-monarchist protesters has sparked furious debate between free speech campaigners and commentators from across the political spectrum.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has stressed that people “absolutely have a right to protest” against the monarchy following the death of the Queen.

Powlesland tweeted footage of an exchange “that he appeared to have had with the officer, who could be heard telling him that someone might be offended if the lawyer were to write ‘not my king’ on the piece of paper he was carrying”, The Guardian reported.\n\nPowlesland told the paper that “I speak in a certain way, was dressed in a certain way and understood the law, but someone else might have been in a different situation”.\n\nIn a separate incident, history tutor Symon Hill was detained on suspicion of a public order offence after shouting “who elected him?” during the proclamation in Oxford on Sunday of Charles III as the new king. In a blog post, Hill said he was later “de-arrested” and taken home in a police van, but was told that he would be asked to attend a further interview and might be charged.\n\nPolice officers’ seemingly heavy-handed approaches have been criticised by many commentators from across the political divide, although others are “supporting these arrests”, said the Daily Express.\n\nRuth Smeeth, chief executive of Index on Censorship, told Politics Home that “we must guard against this event being used, by accident or design, to erode in any way the freedom of expression that citizens of this country enjoy”. Jodie Beck, policy and campaigns officer at Liberty, said: “Protest is not a gift from the state, it is a fundamental right.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/10/29/halloween-2020-im-black-person-who-loves-halloween-please-stop-ruining-me/3743364001/", "title": "Halloween 2020: I'm a Black person who loves Halloween. Please ...", "text": "Hello! Welcome to the \"This is America\" newsletter centered on race, identity and how they shape our lives. I’m N’dea Yancey-Bragg, a trending news reporter who focuses on (you guessed it) race and identity.\n\nI love Halloween. I love eating ridiculous amounts of fun-size candy. I love coming up with \"punny\" costumes and trying to persuade my cat to wear them. I think \"Monster Mash\" slaps.\n\nAs much as I love this holiday, the racist undercurrents in the way some people celebrate it make my skin crawl for all the wrong reasons.\n\nIt feels like a silly thing to complain about given the very pressing threats people of color disproportionately face, including police violence, a global pandemic and voter suppression. But it's just another item in a long list of exhausting reminders that racism creeps into every part of your life.\n\nBut first: Race and justice news we're watching\n\nImportant stories of the past week, from USA TODAY and other news sources.\n\nI shouldn’t have to say this, but could everyone stop doing racist costumes?\n\nNot long after I graduated college and moved to Virginia, politicians in my new home state made headlines for wearing blackface when they were in school. One might have thought, as they joked on Saturday Night Live that week, that it was the '80s! They didn’t know it was wrong then, and things surely must be different now! You’d be wrong!\n\nAlthough a slight majority of Americans (53%) think it is generally unacceptable for a white person to use makeup to darken their skin to appear to be a different race as part of a Halloween costume, about one-in-three said this is always or sometimes acceptable, according to a Pew Research Center survey from 2019.\n\nBlackface in Virginia:This and other incidents show how deeply rooted anti-Black racism is in America\n\nThat same survey found that nearly 60% of Americans believed it is always or sometimes acceptable for someone to wear traditional dress from a country or culture other than their own as part of a Halloween costume.\n\nThat is called cultural appropriation and it perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\n\n'We are better than this':Idaho teachers get paid leave after dressing as border wall, Latinos for Halloween\n\nThe idea that blackface and other racially insensitive costumes are wrong is still relatively new, according to “Susan Scafidi, author of \"Who Owns Culture: Appropriation and Authenticity in American Law.\"\n\nScafidi said the conversation became mainstream five years ago when Yale University found itself embroiled in controversy for asking its students not to wear racially insensitive costumes.\n\nDressing up as someone of another race or ethnicity reduces an entire culture to a certain set of stereotypes, Scafidi explained. \"It diminishes the culture from which the caricature is drawn,\" Scafidi said. \"There’s economic harm and there is psychological or emotional harm.\"\n\nFeatures that a white person might exaggerate as part of a costume are the same very permanent physical attributes that can put a person of color in physical jeopardy on a daily basis.\n\nMore:Comedian's 'racist' Kim Jong Un costume sparks outrage\n\nIt’s frustrating for people of color still have to explain that their culture is not costume, but Scafidi said she believes the younger generation is less accepting of these kinds of costumes. Let's hope so.\n\nLynchings are a terrifying part of Black history, not Halloween decoration inspiration\n\nIn the fall of 2018, after I started working at USA TODAY full-time, I was assigned to write a story on how police in Illinois removed a Halloween decoration that looked a lot like a lynched Black man. I remember an editor telling me that unfortunately this kind of story pops up every year.\n\nAlthough they removed the decoration, the Illinois police said there was \"no malicious intent\" behind the display.\n\n\"Those kind of images can't help but bring up the image of actual Black people hanging in this country,\" Koritha Mitchell, the author of \"Living with Lynching: African-American Lynching Plays, Performance, and Citizenship, 1890-1930,\" told me. \"That's disingenuous pretending that 'oh, it's just scary in general' in a country that has a very specific history of terrorizing very specific people with that kind of violence.\"\n\nDocumenting the brutal mob violence:America's lynching history is now online\n\nMore than 4,300 people were lynched in 20 states, according to a groundbreaking study published by the Equal Justice Initiative in 2017. Mitchell explained that lynching was a tactic used to terrorize Black people – particularly those who were successful, outspoken or exercised their right to vote – as \"a reminder that you have to be worried about staying your proper place.\"\n\nShe pointed out that even if the people displaying nooses aren't consciously aware of America's history with lynching, they can still cause harm.\n\nThere are many possibilities for Halloween decorations like this $300 12-foot skeleton from Home Depot or this lawn sign that literally just says 2020. Can we all just agree to stick with decorations that don't bring up centuries of racial trauma?\n\nThe Black horror renaissance is here to save Halloween 2020\n\nAs you might've guessed, horror is my favorite movie genre. Don't get me wrong, I'm always here for more wholesome fare like \"Halloweentown\" or \"Hocus Pocus,\" but what's Halloween without a good scare?\n\nBut it’s hard not to notice that scary movies films rarely if ever do right by their character(s) of color — if they exist at all.\n\n\"Black people have always loved horror but horror didn’t always love us,\" Tananarive Due, the executive producer of the documentary \"Horror Noire: A History of Black Horror\" said.\n\nThe horrors of 'Get Out' are real:Jordan Peele's deconstruction of racism is even scarier now\n\n\"Black characters were disregarded or very, very thin characters, very trope-y, based on stereotypes,\" said Due, who also teaches a class on Black horror at University of California, Los Angeles. \"Like the sassy friend over and over again, who’s going to die early.\"\n\nI was surprised to learn the trope that Black characters die first might not be all that common: A 2013 analysis of 50 popular horror films from Complex found that while one or all of the Black characters die at some point in 70% of the films, they only die first in .1% of the films. So that’s nice I guess.\n\nStudy:Two in three Black Americans don't see themselves represented in movies and TV\n\nSomething I found encouraging that Due and my colleague Rasha Ali pointed out is that we are slowly but surely seeing more Black stories come to the forefront especially in the horror genre. It felt like a personal gift to me when Jordan Peele made “Get Out,” which he quickly followed with “Us,” and a “Twilight Zone” reboot.\n\nDue said that stories like \"Get Out\" and \"Lovecraft Country,\" which features racism as the monster, work so well because Black people have long been prevented from sharing the trauma that marks our history.\n\nIn a year that has felt more challenging than most, Due said horror can offer powerful survival lessons. Horror isn't always about guts and gore, it can be about finding the courage to face the worst trial of your life and sometimes you even get to beat the monster.\n\nI'm not usually an optimist, but I hope that someday all the Black girls who love spooky movies won't think it's unusual to see themselves actually survive one.\n\n--\n\nNext week: Mabinty Quarshie and Fatima Farha talk about the 2020 election.\n\nThis is America is a weekly take on current events from a rotating panel of USA TODAY journalists with diverse backgrounds and viewpoints.

Here’s a look at how the conflict started:\n\nWhat’s the recent history in Donbas?\n\nWar broke out in 2014 after Russian-backed rebels seized government buildings in towns and cities across eastern Ukraine. Intense fighting left portions of Luhansk and Donetsk, in the Donbas region, in the hands of Russian-backed separatists. Russia also annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 in a move that sparked global condemnation.\n\nRussian-backed rebels seized a government building in Donetsk, Ukraine on April 11, 2014. Efrem Lukatsky/AP/FILE\n\nThe separatist-controlled areas in Donbas became known as the Luhansk and the Donetsk People’s Republics. The Ukrainian government in Kyiv asserts the two regions are, in effect, Russian-occupied. The self-declared republics are not recognized by any governments, other than Russia and its close ally Syria. The Ukrainian government refuses to talk directly with either separatist republic.\n\nThe Minsk II agreement of 2015 led to a shaky ceasefire agreement, and the conflict settled into static warfare along the Line of Contact that separates the Ukrainian government and separatist-controlled areas. The Minsk Agreements (named after the capital of Belarus where they were concluded) ban heavy weapons near the Line of Contact.\n\nLanguage around the conflict is heavily politicized. The Ukrainian government calls separatist forces “invaders” and “occupiers.” Russian media calls separatist forces “militias” and maintains that they are locals defending themselves against the Kyiv government.\n\nMore than 14,000 people have died in the conflict in Donbas since 2014. Ukraine says 1.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes, with most staying in the areas of Donbas that remain under Ukrainian control and about 200,000 resettling in the wider Kyiv region.\n\nHow has Putin stoked the conflict?\n\nThe separatists in Donbas have had substantial backing from Moscow. Russia has long maintained that it has no soldiers on the ground there, but US, NATO and Ukrainian officials say the Russian government supplies the separatists, provides them with advisory support and intelligence, and embeds its own officers in their ranks.\n\nMoscow has also distributed hundreds of thousands of Russian passports to people in Donbas in recent years. Western officials and observers have accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of attempting to establish facts on the ground by naturalizing Ukrainians as Russian citizens, a de facto way of recognizing the breakaway states. It also gives him a reason to intervene in Ukraine.\n\nLast week, the Russian parliament recommended that the Kremlin formally recognize parts of the LPR and DPR as an independent states, another escalation in rhetoric that US officials said at the time demonstrated that Putin has no intention of abiding by the Minsk agreement.\n\nUkraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Ukraine would “not stop until we free our territories in Donbas, Crimea, until Russia pays for all the damage it caused in Ukraine.”\n\nPutin has long accused Ukraine of violating the rights of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in Ukraine, and has said it was within Russia’s rights to militarily intervene to protect them.\n\nIn recent weeks, Putin has alleged that “genocide” was being committed in Donbas. His allegations aren’t new, but the timing is of concern to Western policy-makers, who fear a repeat of a 2008 conflict in Georgia.\n\nBy invoking genocide, Putin was echoing Russia’s false claim that Georgia committed genocide against civilians in the breakaway republic of South Ossetia in August 2008. During that brief conflict, Russia launched a massive military incursion that pushed deep into Georgian territory.\n\nAs it was in 2014, the Donbas region is now the crucible of the conflict between east and west, between Putin’s drive to reassert control – weakening the Ukrainian state – and the growing aspiration of Ukrainians to join the fold of European democracies.", "authors": ["Tamara Qiblawi Nathan Hodge Tim Lister Ivana Kottasová", "Tamara Qiblawi", "Nathan Hodge", "Tim Lister", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/957667/in-pictures-a-year-of-taliban-rule", "title": "In pictures: A year of Taliban rule | The Week UK", "text": "This week marks a year since the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan’s capital city, prompting thousands of citizens to rush for evacuation flights before international troops withdrew.\n\nThe group declared a national holiday in celebration of the anniversary yesterday. “Taliban fighters chanted victory slogans next to the now-closed US embassy in Kabul”, said The Times, and officials made speeches to make the occasion.\n\nA year after the withdrawal of international troops and aid, Afghanistan is still “a nation in anguish”, said Axios. “The Afghan people have borne the brunt of a collapsed economy, deepening humanitarian crisis and deteriorating human rights situation”.\n\nInternational charities and officials have expressed particular concern about the restrictions imposed on women and girls in the past 12 months.

Wojtek Laski/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nDa Silva officially launched his presidential bid at a campaign rally in Sao Paulo. “The country is going through one of the most serious moments in our history, requiring us to build an alternative path despite any differences in order to overcome the incompetence and authoritarianism that govern us,” he said, referring to Bolsonaro’s presidency.\n\nOfficial campaigning legally begins on August 16, and up until now, da Silva has not released many detailed policy proposals. However, many Brazilians seem to be behind the former leader, with the latest polling from Ipespe indicating that more than 45% of Brazilians intend to vote for him in the first round.\n\nDa Silva’s 2022 presidential run marks the latest twist in his remarkable story as one of Brazil’s most charismatic politicians, one who didn’t learn to read until he was 10 and who left school after fifth grade to work full-time.\n\nHis background is unusual for a politician in Brazil, where the working class struggled for representation in the decades following his birth in 1945.\n\nDa Silva (left) pictured on the campaign trail in September 2002. Jefferson Bernardes/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn 1975, he was elected president of the metalworker’s union, founding the Workers’ Party in 1980. By 1986, he was a member of congress.\n\nIt took three failed bids for the presidency before da Silva won the 2002 presidential runoff with 61.3% of the vote share.\n\nReelected in 2006, he eventually left office in January 2011 with an approval rating of 90% after millions of Brazilians were lifted out of poverty during his time in office. However his good fortune did not last long.\n\nAfter surviving throat cancer in 2011, da Silva was convicted for corruption and money laundering in 2017, charges stemming from a wide-ranging investigation into the state-run oil company Petrobras, dubbed “Operation Car Wash.”\n\nHis legal troubles rumbled on until April 2018, when he surrendered to federal authorities and began serving a 12-year prison sentence.\n\nHowever, in March 2021, a court threw out his conviction, clearing the way for his political rebound.\n\nDa Silva is seen with his wife Marisa Leticia after his inauguration ceremony in 2003. Orlando Kissner/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAt a bar dedicated to da Silva in Rio de Janeiro, entrepreneur Jaciana Melquiades told CNN: “I’m very hopeful about Lula’s victory, I think we have a great chance of getting Brazil back on track.”\n\nBolsonaro has done nothing for Brazil, said Omar Monteiro, 32, who manages the bar.\n\n“Living under this government is worse than I imagined it would be because, in addition to the curse of having Bolsonaro as president, we are going through a pandemic,” said Monteiro. “And I never, not even in my worst nightmares, imagined that we would have a president who is a denialist, anti-vaccines, anti-isolation.”\n\nBrazil’s economy is suffering rampant inflation and soaring unemployment, with hunger an increasing concern.\n\n“I think a lot has to change, we have to generate a lot of jobs and income because people are starving, in real need, and we have to improve Brazil’s relations with the world, which deteriorated under Bolsonaro’s government,” said lawyer Andre Pessoa.\n\nStill, Bolsonaro’s deficit in the opinion polls is narrowing and the President retains a committed base of ultra-conservative supporters that he has mobilized by maintaining what his opponents call radical positions on abortion access, gun rights and Brazilian sovereignty over the Amazon rainforest.\n\nAnd he has shown he is willing to incite his supporters against perceived opponents, calling for mass demonstrations outside the Supreme Court during a dispute with the judiciary in September 2021.\n\nChristopher Sabatini, senior fellow for Latin America at Chatham House, said that even if da Silva wins the election, his biggest challenge will be to unite a fractured country and hold off Bolsonarismo, as the ideology of the current president is known.\n\n“It’s not going to be like his first two terms in power,” said Sabatini. “Bolsonarismo, it’s not just any garden variety conservative party, it draws from evangelicals, it draws from very vitriolic, almost anti-democratic elements, and part of Brazilian society that’s called the Bibles, bullets and beef constituency.”\n\nStill, in da Silva strongholds, hopes are high for his return to power.\n\n“May he make Brazil move again, may he make Brazil flow again, may he make people smile, may he make the GDP flow, may he make the economy flow, jobs come back,” Monteiro said.\n\n“May he make everything go back to normal.”", "authors": ["Jack Guy Isa Soares Madalena Araujo", "Jack Guy", "Isa Soares", "Madalena Araujo"], "publish_date": "2022/05/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/americas/brazil-elections-analysis-intl-latam/index.html", "title": "Brazil election: With Bolsonaro and Lula facing off, anything could ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBrazilians head to the polls Sunday to select their next president in what has been one of the country’s most contested and polarizing elections in recent history.\n\nAlthough there are nearly a dozen candidates on the ballot – and several other seats up for grabs – the October 2 race is dominated by two frontrunners: right wing incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro and leftist former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, leader of the Workers’ Party.\n\nThe race is extremely heated. Bolsonaro and Lula, as he is popularly known, have used Twitter, YouTube, televised debates and massive political rallies to present their positions and attack each other at every turn. And violent rhetoric among their supporters has left many voters feeling fearful of what is yet to come.\n\nAccording to a Datafolha poll conducted in August, more than 67% of voters in Brazil are afraid of being “physically attacked” due to their political affiliations. And the country’s Supreme Electoral Tribunal has issued a ban on firearms within 100 meters (330 feet) of any polling station on election day.\n\nBoth candidates have been seen on the campaign trail flanked by security and police, even wearing bullet proof vests at times. Bolsonaro wore his as he kicked off his reelection bid last month in the city of Juiz de Fora, at the exact location where he was stabbed in the stomach during the 2018 presidential campaign. Lula was seen also wearing a vest during an event in Rio de Janeiro, the same city where a homemade stink bomb was launched into a large crowd of his supporters back in July.\n\nLula and Bolsonaro: Ideological opposites\n\nThe race pits two titans of contemporary Brazilian politics – and polar opposites – against each other.\n\n“These are two well-known figures, two of the largest and most unique populist leaders in Brazilian politics from the past 20 years,” Antonio Lavareda, director of Brazilian polling group Ipespe, told CNN affiliate CNN Brasil.\n\n“For the first time, we have a president who is being evaluated based on his nearly four years in office and a former president who already has a consolidated image.”\n\nBolsonaro, 67, who is often referred to as the “Trump of the Tropics,” is running for reelection under the conservative Liberal Party. At the center of his campaign and his reelection plan is what he says is the right for freedom: freedom of expression, freedom to live and freedom to use the country’s natural resources for future development and growth, including in mining and other agricultural businesses. Bolsonaro’s job creation strategy is based on investing in industry to promote job growth, especially in tech. The former paratrooper also supports expanding access to gun ownership for self defense.\n\nBolsonaro’s record from his first term could be a liability. He was widely criticized in Brazil and abroad for his mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil, which killed more than 685,000 people, and for a spike in deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon under his presidency, among other things.\n\nLula, 76, was president of Brazil for two consecutive terms from 2003 to 2011. On the campaign trail, he has mostly focused on getting Bolsonaro out of office and has leaned heavily on the achievements of his previous presidential terms. He left office with a 90% approval rating and is largely credited for lifting millions of Brazilians from extreme poverty through “Bolsa Familia” welfare program.\n\n“I don’t need to make any promises to you,” Lula said during a recent campaign stop in Sao Paulo. “My policies are endorsed by the legacy of my previous eight years in power, which were very successful for this country and all sectors of society.”\n\nLula was convicted for corruption and money laundering in 2017, on charges stemming from the wide-ranging “Operation Car Wash” investigation into the state-run oil company Petrobras. But after serving less than two years, a Supreme Court Justice annulled Lula’s conviction in March 2021, clearing the way for him to run for president for a sixth time.\n\n“I didn’t need to be president again. I could keep my title as the ‘best president in history’ and go live the last few years of my life in peace. But I saw this country destroyed. I saw education run by a guy who didn’t like education. So, I decided to go back,” Lula said in July, when he officially accepted his party’s nomination.\n\nSowing doubt about the vote\n\nSeveral polls show Lula in the lead. The latest poll, released on Thursday by respected research group Datafolha, showed him ahead of Bolsonaro by 14 points, just three days before the Sunday vote.\n\nAfter Datafolha ruled out blank and undecided voters, its model found Lula at 50% among valid voters, versus the 36% who said they would support Bolsonaro. This margin increased in the hypothetical scenario of a second round, showing Lula with 54% of the vote versus Bolsonaro’s 39%, according to Datafolha. Other national pollsters, such as Ipec and Ipespe, has increasingly undermined supporters’ faith in the vote itself.\n\nWithout presenting proof, Bolsonaro has claimed that the country’s electronic voting system could be rigged and even said it had been tampered with in the past. There is no record of fraud in Brazilian electronic ballots since they began in 1996.\n\nHe has also cast doubt on his country’s election authorities. During his recent trip to London for Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral, Bolsonaro told Brazilian broadcaster SBT, “If we don’t win during the first round of voting, something abnormal happened within the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.”\n\nCritics have warned that such talk could lead to outbreaks of violence or even refusal to accept the election result among some Brazilians – pointing to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot incited by then-US President Donald Trump after he lost the vote.\n\nThere have already been several reports of political discourse among Lula and Bolsonaro supporters turning violent, even deadly.\n\nOver the weekend, police registered two fatal incidents in states on opposite ends of the country. In the northeastern state of Ceara, a man was stabbed to death in a bar after identifying himself as a Lula supporter, according to police. And authorities in southern Santa Catarina state say a man wearing a Bolsonaro T-shirt was also fatally stabbed during a violent discussion with a man whom witnesses identified as a Workers’ Party supporter.\n\nPolice say they are investigating both incidents and that arrests have been made.\n\nThe hostility is attracting global concern. UN human rights experts issued a statement earlier this month urging Brazilian authorities, candidates and political parties to ensure a peaceful vote.\n\n“We are concerned that this hostile environment represents a threat to political participation and democracy and urge the State to protect candidates from any threats, acts of intimidation or attacks online and offline,” the experts said.\n\n“All those involved in the electoral process must commit themselves to peaceful conduct prior, during and after elections. Candidates and political parties must refrain from using offensive language which may lead to violence and human rights abuses.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback ¿Lula o Bolsonaro?

If neither candidate reaches that amount, a runoff is scheduled to take place on Sunday, October 30th.\n\nBut the fear factor among voters could lead to a large number of abstentions this Sunday.\n\n“This election, unlike any other election since 1989, has a high number of voters who are afraid to talk politics, to talk about the election.

Voters are comparing it ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBrazil’s upcoming presidential election has been shrouded by an unprecedented climate of tension and violence. As the Oct. 2 vote approaches, episodes of harassment and attacks have intensified, with even neutral players like poll institutes turning into targets.\n\nFar-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who aims to be reelected, is currently lagging in the main polls behind leftwing former President Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva. And the battle between these two very different household names has divided the nation – with experts saying the level of political anger is different this year.\n\n“The polarization we’re facing this year is different from just a political polarization,” says Felipe Nunes, CEO of Quaest Research Institute, which conducts polls in Brazil.\n\n“This year we are seeing affective polarization — where different political groups see each other as enemies, not as adversaries.”\n\nSeveral of his group’s researchers have been harassed while conducting polling this year, Nunes added.\n\nAnother well-known research institute, Datafolha said that one of its researchers’ lives was threatened, after they refused to interview a self-identified Bolsonaro supporter in the city of Ariranha, outside of Sao Paulo.\n\nThe disgruntled man accused the researcher of bias, and accused him of only interviewing “Lula’s supporters” and “tramps”. He then beat and threatened him with a knife, says Datafolha, which filed a police report.\n\n“One of the polling guidelines is to not interview someone who offers himself. It has to be random for statistical purposes,” said Jean Estevao de Souza, electoral researcher project coordinator at Datafolha, to CNN.\n\n“The most typical cases (of attacks) are of people who offer themselves and when the researcher explains that he cannot be interviewed under that circumstance, the person starts filming, offending and cursing.”\n\nAccording to Datafolha, 42 other cases of harassment and violence against its employees have been reported since September 7 this year.\n\nCritics accuse Bolsonaro of fueling fire\n\nWhile violence has been seen on both sides of the political spectrum, critics accuse Bolsonaro of deliberately fostering distrust and frustration among supporters toward the Brazilian electoral system. And increasingly, as his performance flags in the polls, Bolsonaro’s ire has turned toward research organizations like Datafolha.\n\nDatafolha has been repeatedly named – and the accuracy of its polls questioned — by Bolsonaro. In a speech in Brasília during the celebrations of Brazil´s 200-year Independence Anniversary on September 7, Bolsonaro discredited Datafolha projections, a common theme in his speeches.\n\n“I’ve never seen such a big sea here with these green and yellow colors. There is no lying Datafolha here,” he said. “Here is the truth, here is the will of an honest, free and hardworking people.”\n\nDuring a campaign event on Sept. 23, Bolsonaro kept the tone in a speech to his supporters in Divinópolis, Minas Gerais state. “We are the majority. We will win in the first round. There is no election without people in the streets. We don’t see any of the other candidates holding a rally that comes close to 10% of the people here,” he said.\n\nRecent polls have shown Lula leading Bolsonaro in recent weeks.\n\nAttempts by politicians to discredit polling institutes are not new in Brazil, says Datafolha’s Estevao de Souza. “But we never faced harassment and attacks on the researchers on the streets until this year.”\n\n“The rhetoric of attack on the institutes by the president’s campaign, which tries to discredit the polls, ends up circulating among the most radicalized supporters and it is reflected in the streets,” he said.\n\nVerbal sparring between the two leading candidates — though not uncommon in Brazil — has also added to the poisoned atmosphere, with Bolsonaro repeatedly calling Lula a “thief,” and Lula recently describing Bolsonaro as vermin.\n\nGiven the charged national dialogue, some Brazilian voters have chosen to refrain from discussing their electoral preferences in public, according to a Quaest poll.\n\n“We recently asked voters if they feel it’s more dangerous to say their opinions or whoever they want to vote for. And around 80% of respondents claimed it’s more dangerous to talk about politics right now than it used to be in the past,” continued Nunes.\n\n‘Repeat with me: I swear to give my life for freedom’\n\nAttacks on polling researchers are just one example of the political hostility seen in Brazil as the nation prepares for the vote.\n\nDuring a speech accepting his party’s nomination for reelection on July 23, the Brazilian president called on supporters to give their lives “for freedom.”\n\n“Repeat with me: I swear to give my life for freedom. Once again,” said Bolsonaro to the crowd who repeated his words.\n\nThere have been repeated clashes between Bolsonaro and Lula supporters – the most emblematic episode being perhaps the shooting death of Workers Party member Marcelo Arruda on July 9 by the Bolsonaro supporter José da Rocha Guaranho, who was later charged with aggravated murder.\n\nGuaranho, who was also shot and subsequently hospitalized, has said he doesn’t not remember what happened.\n\nSuch high profile incidents have caused fear among some potential voters – and could risk deterring people from voting at all. On the streets of Sao Paulo’s iconic Paulista avenue, voters interviewed by CNN expressed frustration over the bitter atmosphere around the coming elections.\n\n“There is too much tension, it’s almost turning into a war. It seems that Lula and Bolsonaro are like football teams. People are angry at each other,” said 33-year-old Erika de Paula, who said she was still undecided but would not vote for Bolsonaro.\n\nFelipe Araujo, who considers himself a moderate supporter of Bolsonaro, wished the elections would end soon. “(The elections) are very polarized between the two main candidates. And there is a lot of fighting between people. I sincerely hope this ends soon. It has contaminated all of the environments, work, family, friends,” he said.\n\nVoter turnout will be crucial at this historic juncture for the country – which could see Brazil’s leadership double down on Bolsonaro’s agenda or else take a left turn under Lula.\n\nBut four in ten Brazilians believe that there is a high chance of political violence on election day and – although voting is compulsory in Brazil – 9% said they were are considering not voting at all for fear of violence, according to a Datafolha poll earlier this month.\n\n“These tensions and attacks are very bad for the research work, but also for the election, for the political environment in general, and for democracy itself,” said Estevao de Souza from Datafolha.", "authors": ["Rodrigo Pedroso Marcia Reverdosa Camilo Rocha", "Rodrigo Pedroso", "Marcia Reverdosa", "Camilo Rocha"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/958401/quiz-of-the-week-29-october-4-november", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 29 October – 4 November | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

But as Brazil heads toward presidential elections next month, President Jair Bolsonaro appears to be twisting the national holiday toward partisan ends.\n\nAlong with first lady Michelle Bolsonaro, the president attended a military parade in the capital Brasilia on Wednesday morning, greeting large crowds of supporters as the pair rode in a vintage Rolls-Royce convertible before the beginning of the event.\n\n“The Brazilian people today are taking to the streets to celebrate 200 years of independence and eternity freedom. What is at stake is our freedom and our future. The population knows that it is the one that guides our decisions,” Bolsonaro said in an interview with a Brazilian state television channel ahead of the parade.\n\nThough Independence Day is supposed to be a nonpartisan national holiday, the president has often referred to it as a key milestone in his re-election campaign, telling supporters to prepare to “give their lives” on that day – an escalation in rhetoric even for the outspoken populist leader.\n\n“I call on all of you, on September 7, to take to the streets for the last time … All of you here have sworn to give your life for your freedom. Repeat with me: I swear to give my life for freedom,” Bolsonaro said, as he accepted the Liberal Party’s presidential nomination on July 23.\n\nBolsonaro supporters gather along Copacabana Beach on Independence Day last year in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Renato Spyrro/AP/FILE\n\nMore recently, Bolsonaro told fans to show up to Independence Day celebrations in Rio, where he will be speaking, to “make a stand” and “fight for your freedom” – vague injunctions that critics warn could be interpreted as incitement to unruly behavior.\n\n“(September 7) is the time to fight for your freedom.. let’s go make a stand,” the president told viewers during the live address on social media Thursday.\n\n“If someone is accused of an undemocratic act, I want to pay myself for their (legal) defense,” he added, using the same term for attacks on Brazilian institutions and democratic norms of which he himself has often been accused.\n\nBolsonaro’s campaign team organized hundreds of political rallies to coincide with Independence Day and the president was expected to give a speech later on Wednesday at a political rally in Brasilia, and then join a military celebration and a rally in Rio de Janeiro in the afternoon.\n\nBolsonaro supporter Paulo Roseno, a former military sergeant who is helping to organize one such rally in Sao Paulo, told CNN he is expecting millions of people to be gathered on the city’s Paulista Avenue in support of Bolsonaro’s candidacy.\n\nThe president’s calls to action have been widely interpreted as echoing the election-denying rhetoric of former US President Donald Trump, whose convocation of supporters in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, preceded a riot on Capitol Hill.\n\n“Bolsonaro and Trump share the same authoritarian populist playbook,” says Guilherme Casarões, professor of political science at Getulio Vargas University and coordinator of Brazil’s Far Right Observatory.\n\n“Both indicated they would refuse to accept an electoral result negative to them, both talk about fraud in the ballots. They both also keep a permanent incitement of their radicalized base.”\n\nHe told CNN that that he foresees a “real risk” of a Jan. 6-type event in Brazil if Bolsonaro’s leftwing rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, eventually claims victory at the polls.\n\n“I don’t think we’re going to have a coup in the classic sense with the military on the street, like what happened in 1964,” he said, referring to the historic overthrow that led to two decades of military dictatorship in Brazil.\n\n“What I think is more likely to happen is an attempted coup, some kind of subversion of democracy … or any attempt to delay the electoral process by introducing doubts about the legitimacy of the process.”\n\nCNN has reached out to Bolsonaro’s office for comment.\n\nElection paranoia and fears of unrest\n\nWaldir Ferraz, a close friend of Bolsonaro who is also organizing the president’s motorcade through Rio, downplays the possibility that the president’s statements could incite unrest or produce chaos.\n\nThe Independence Day festivities in Rio will simply demonstrate the breadth of Bolsonaro’s support, he told CNN, with “a sea of green and yellow.”\n\nBut he admits that this show of support is in part motivated by fans’ anger at an electoral system that they have been led to believe is tainted – despite the lack of evidence.\n\n“There will be more than 1 million on the streets in Rio, because people now are angry with [Supreme Electoral Court chief] Alexandre de Moraes,” Ferraz says.\n\nDe Moraes, a longtime thorn in Bolsonaro’s side, this month greenlit search and seizure operations against several businessmen accused of participating in WhatsApp text conversations advocating a coup if Bolsonaro loses the presidential election, CNN Brasil reported.\n\nBolsonaro at the Independence Day ceremony in Brasilia last year. Adriano Machado/Reuters/FILE\n\nAs the race heats up between Bolsonaro and Lula, the incumbent president has frequently made statements undermining the legitimacy of the electoral process among his fans – in what critics fear could set the stage for unrest if Bolsonaro doesn’t win re-election.\n\nThe president has called for some voters to be filmed at the ballot box (an idea squashed by the Electoral Court) and claimed that the country’s electronic voting system has been compromised in the past and is at risk of fraud now, though there is no record of fraud in Brazilian electronic ballots since they began in 1996. He has also suggested that the Armed Forces should perform a parallel ballot count to verify the result.\n\nThe military has previously served as observers during elections, along with representatives of political parties and universities. But as Lula pulls ahead in the polls, discussion among supporters of an even more active role by the Brazilian Armed Forces – including calls for a military intervention if Bolsonaro loses – has intensified on social media.\n\n“We will not trust the results [if Bolsonaro loses] and will demand the president to call the Armed Forces to intervene. But note that this is not a coup, it is a counter coup,” says Roseno.\n\nBrazil’s military leadership\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the potential for overlap between military events and pro-Bolsonaro campaign events on Independence Day could offer cause for concern. If the president turns his speech in Rio into a campaign opportunity, the military’s planned display of ships, parachutists and hourly rifle salutes could instantly take on ominous political significance.\n\n“We should not have such overlap of a national event with a large military participation with a campaign event,” said Casarões.\n\n“The military that should be a state force that serves the interests of a government. [The Independence Day events] will allow Bolsonaro to use the military’s symbol … to lend credibility to his presidential candidacy,” he added.\n\nConcerned about the possible politicization of Wednesday’s military maneuvers, the Federal Attorney’s office of Rio sent an official letter to the local Military, Naval and Air command publicized on Sept. 2 asking how it would ensure that official Independence Day celebrations would not be confused with partisan political demonstrations.\n\nAsked if it had received a response, the Attorney’s office told CNN that the Armed Forces has until Wednesday morning to reply. The military did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nA poster of the Brazilian president's face with the phrase \"Bolsonaro in jail\" on Paulista Avenue in Sao Paulo. CArla Carniel/Reuters\n\nEver since Bolsonaro’s decree last year allowing active-duty military to hold public office , the border between his government and Brazil’s military leadership has been increasingly blurred.\n\nThe president, himself a former Army captain, has made no secret of his admiration of the Armed Forces. He frequently invokes the military on the campaign trail and has done little to avoid the appearance of politicizing the country’s military.\n\nHis vice presidential candidate is an active general, General Walter Braga Netto. In 2020, over 6000 members of his government were members of the military, according to a report published by the Federal Audit Court (TCU).\n\nThe sympathy appears to run both ways. The Armed Forces’ leadership has echoed Bolsonaro’s election fraud claims, raising its own doubts about voting security to the Electoral Court.\n\nDefense Minister Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira last July said the military leadership did not necessarily doubt the electoral system, but said he believed it needed improvement.\n\n“We know very well that this electronic system always needs improvement. There is no program immune to an attack, immune to being invaded,” said Nogueira during a hearing at the Commission on Foreign Relations and National Defense.\n\n“We are not doubting, or thinking this or that. It is simply a collaborative spirit,” added the minister.\n\nBolsonaro has said that he will accept the results of the upcoming Brazil presidential election “as long they are fair and clean,” in an interview with TV Globo´s Jornal Nacional this month.\n\nHis campaign and political allies have also dismissed fans’ calls for military intervention. To Ferraz, chatter online and among extremist Bolsonaro supporters of a military intervention in the upcoming election has no basis in reality. “This can’t happen,” he says.\n\nNevertheless, Roseno, the rally organizer, insists that he expects the worst. Falsely convinced that the deck is loaded against his candidate, he predicts that if the Armed Forces don’t intervene to ensure Bolsonaro’s re-election, “the people will” – conjuring exactly the vision of violent insurrection that experts warn the president risks inciting.", "authors": ["Marcia Reverdosa Rodrigo Pedroso With Reporting Camilo Rocha", "Marcia Reverdosa", "Rodrigo Pedroso", "With Reporting Camilo Rocha"], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/10/31/brazil-south-korea-supreme-court-georgia/10650159002/", "title": "Brazil, Seoul, Supreme Court, Georgia, grain deal: Daily Briefing", "text": "Leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has defeated incumbent Jair Bolsonaro in the Brazilian presidential runoff.

No one does anything about it,” says Marcelo Horta, a sociologist who works with indigenous peoples in Labrea, a town in Amazonas state.\n\nLuciana Gatti, a leading researcher at Brazil’s Space Research Institute (INPE), a government agency that tracks fires in the Amazon, theorizes that the country’s political calendar could be the reason.\n\n“If you are an environmental criminal, and you see there is a big chance that the one who is giving you the green light will leave, what would you think? Let me make the most out of this as it might be the last year of lawlessness”, said Gatti.\n\nA truck drives past a pile of illegally cut down logs in the forest in Humaita, southern Amazonas State, Brazil, on September 17, 2022. Michael Dantas/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA perceived ally to land grabbers\n\nSince his 2018 electoral campaign, Bolsonaro has advocated against what he sees as excessive environmental legislation and protections that supposedly hinder activities such as agriculture and mining, including in indigenous protected territories.\n\nAlthough Bolsonaro has passed some laws to protect the environment, his administration has seen both Brazil’s Environment Ministry and environmental protection agency Ibama subjected to budget and staff cuts. Ibama’s practice of destroying confiscated equipment used in illegal mining and tree-chopping has also been publicly condemned by the president.\n\nThe President is also a keen supporter of a set of five draft bills going through Congress known by activists as the “destruction package.” These laws include proposals to give property titles to land grabbers, allow mining in indigenous lands and loosen environmental licensing. Although they have not been approved, Bolsonaro’s continuous defense of such issues is seen by NGOs and opposition politicians as an incentive to those on the ground.\n\nAs a result, the world´s largest rainforest has been registering record after record of deforestation. Between 2019 - when Bolsonaro took office - and 2021, Brazil lost over 33,800 square kilometers of rainforest in the Amazon according to INPE. That’s an area larger than Belgium, with an average of 11,000 square kilometers lost per year.\n\nIn this year to date, over 7,555 square kilometers have been deforested.\n\nBolsonaro will face leftist former President Luis Inácio Lula da Silva at the polls in October. Lula, as he is widely known, recently told CNN Brasil that in his government “there will be no Amazon deforestation.”\n\nDuring Lula’s presidency (2002-2010), deforestation shrank 65% in Brazil, according to INPE.\n\nA new culture\n\nIn the town of Labrea, it is increasingly common to see cowboy hats and Brazilian country music (sertanejo), symbols of the agribusiness culture in the country, says Horta.\n\n“It’s a whole culture taking over,” Horta told CNN. “This year we see more people voicing their support for president Bolsonaro, supporting the opening of roads and the extraction of wood.”\n\nLabrea is located in Amacro, an area defined by the Brazilian government in 2021 as a “special zone of sustainable development”. But on the ground, the Amazon forest is being pushed back by agriculture, cattle and logging activities, many of them illegal, say experts and federal workers who spoke to CNN.\n\nAccording to MapBiomas, an independent monitoring initiative, the Amacro region accounted for 12% of deforestation in the country in 2021.\n\nLabrea, which has a population of less than 50,000 in an area larger than West Virginia, has been on fire in recent weeks – literally. In the first 12 days of September, INPE satellites recorded 1,570 fires in the municipality – the second highest number in Brazil for the period.\n\nThe figure represented a 3,040% leap in comparison to the first 12 days of August, when only 50 fires spots had been detected.\n\nIt’s part of a wider trend being observed in the Amazon of late. Between August 2021 and July 2022, an area of 8,590 km2 – larger than the state of Delaware – was deforested in the Amazon, according to Inpe data.\n\nINPE data also shows that in August the Amazon biome recorded its worst number of fires for the month since 2010: 33,116 hotspots registered, an increase of nearly 30% compared to the same month in 2021. This year alone, over 96,000 hotspots were registered.\n\nFires are one of the stages in the illegal chain of occupation and exploitation of the Amazon region.\n\n“What we normally see in these areas is the use of fire before or, mostly, after trees have been brought down, so deforestation is completed”, says Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of NGO Observatorio do Clima, to CNN.\n\n“A mass of forest lays on the floor, it dries up, and then fire is set to it. Sometimes two or three fires are needed in the same area so it gets properly cleared”.\n\nAerial view of a burning area in Lábrea, southern Amazonas State, Brazil, on September 17, 2022. Michael Dantas/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBolsonaro is quick to downplay the phenomena of fire events. During an interview with Globo TV in August 22, he suggested the fires were caused by natural events or by traditional communities.\n\n“When we talk about the Amazon, why don’t we also talk about France, which is on fire?,” he said, referring to the wildfires that ravaged France this summer.\n\n“In Brazil, it is no different, it happens. Much of it is criminal, some are not criminal. It’s the riverside man who sets fire to his small property,” Bolsonaro said.\n\nFernando Oliveira, director of operations at the Justice and Public Security Ministry, oversees Guardiões do Bioma (Guardians of the Biome), a government task force in which security forces, environmental agencies and local firefighter teams cooperate to combat deforestation and fires in the Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal biomes, among other duties.\n\n“Our focus is the fight of environmental crimes in an area that covers approximately 60% of national territory,” said Oliveira to CNN.\n\nTo monitor deforestation, the Guardiões operation has created just six bases spread across in this vast Amazon territory. In the state of Amazonas, which is as big as Mongolia, the operation relies on a single base.\n\nOliveira dismisses cattle farmers’ use of fire to clear land or any other human activity as causes of the hotspots in the rainforest.\n\n“Most fires happen in a natural way, you have high temperatures, low humidity, dry foliage, so any trigger such as cigarette butt can get the fire going,” he says.\n\nBut most experts disagree.\n\n“Decades of studies show that the Amazon doesn’t catch fire naturally. In 99% of the cases, the fires are provoked, there is someone who lit the match,” says Astrini.\n\n“Fires caused by natural events in the Amazon, a tropical forest, are a very rare event that may occur every 500 years. Practically all the fire we have in the Amazon is anthropic (manmade), and it is usually associated with deforestation and the clearing of pasture areas,” said Tasso Azevedo, coordinator of map analysis project MapBiomas, to CNN in August.\n\nA threat to the world’s climate\n\nDestruction of the Amazon poses a direct threat to the global climate.\n\n“When we deforest we are transforming [the Amazon[ into an accelerator of climate change because it starts releasing more carbon into the atmosphere, reducing rain and increasing temperatures in Brazil and the world,” Gatti, the INPE researcher, told CNN.\n\n“It is a calamity,” she added.\n\nBoth Gatti and Astrini believe that external pressure is key to deter the march of deforestation.\n\n“International trade is a driver of deforestation. If other countries stopped buying the fruits of this activity, destruction would halt,” says Gatti, who adds that there should be a global movement to stop buying wood from Brazil.\n\nIt has started to happen. The European Union has advanced a plan to require that products sold in the bloc must not come from deforested or degraded land. The new legislation establishes that companies selling in the EU have to verify items such as cattle, cocoa, coffee, palm-oil, soya and wood have not originated from such areas.\n\nBut on the ground, a cultural shift has already taken hold. Daniel Cangussu, a Brazil´s Indigenous Agency staffer who lives in Labrea, told CNN that on the ground there is no sign of a change in the “intense landgrabbing and deforestation” that he has witnessed under Bolsonaro’s presidency\n\n“It’s notorious (in the region), people talk openly about it. It has become something normal.”", "authors": ["Cnn'S Camilo Rocha Marcia Reverdosa Rodrigo Pedroso", "Cnn'S Camilo Rocha", "Marcia Reverdosa", "Rodrigo Pedroso"], "publish_date": "2022/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/18/opinions/castaeda-latin-americas-new-pink-tide-op-ed/index.html", "title": "China and Russia want to surf Latin America's 'pink tide.'

The views expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nRight wing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Moscow Wednesday in the thick of the Ukrainian crisis. Given his disastrous handling of Covid-19 and his standing in polls forecasting next October’s elections, it may be Bolsonaro’s last trip to Russia, or anywhere, as president. If what many observers have called a “new pink tide” of support for left-leaning politicians continues to sweep through Latin America, former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva may banish an increasingly isolated Bolsonaro from office.\n\nJorge Castañeda. Televisa\n\nConversely, China and Russia seem to be attempting to make new inroads in Latin America, perhaps seeking to surf on this new tide.\n\nLast week Argentine President Alberto Fernandez traveled to Moscow and Beijing. In the Russian capital, he declared that Argentina should be Russia’s entry door to Latin America. In China, he joined the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative and announced Chinese investments to the tune of more than $23 billion over the coming years.\n\nAfter insinuations from Putin’s government that Moscow may station troops or weapons in Cuba and Venezuela, a threat made in conjunction with the Ukraine crisis, many are wondering if Latin America is not veering away from the United States and the West and moving in a different geopolitical direction.\n\nThe region does look different from a few years ago, and at first glance there may be reasons for thinking that incursions from Moscow and Beijing are not entirely far-fetched. The “new pink tide” is the expression used to describe the presumed wave of new left-wing governments in Latin America, starting in 2018 with Andrés Manuel López Obrador in Mexico and continuing in 2019 with Fernández himself and in 2021 with Luis Arce in Bolivia, Pedro Castillo in Peru and Gabriel Boric in Chile. This coming May, Gustavo Petro could win Colombia’s presidency. A victory for Lula in Brazil would be the icing on the cake.\n\nThese electoral victories repeat the ones that took place 20 years ago, starting with Hugo Chávez’ election in Venezuela in 1998, Ricardo Lagos’ victory in Chile in 2000, Lula’s in Brazil in 2002 and Evo Morales’ election in Bolivia in 2005, among other examples. It is easy to detect an ominous bent in this electoral trend, particularly when viewed in the context of the geopolitical movements described above.\n\nIn fact, matters regarding the new pink tide are more complicated. It is true that all of its leaders define themselves as left-of-center or progressive and have much in common, even if Mexico’s López Obrador stands out from the rest by displaying some authoritarian tendencies.\n\nAll of these movements and leaders are largely responses to the relatively poor management of the Covid-19 pandemic that centrist or right-of-center incumbents in Latin America incurred in. They all have a strong social content, and a populist one also, in that they revive ancestral grievances against Latin American and foreign oligarchies; insist on putting the poor first; and adopt many anti-extractive stances on natural resources, the environment, original people’s rights and cultural autonomy. And inevitably, if not in the minds of the new or soon-to-be elected leaders, at least in those of their followers, a clearly anti-American stance is discernible.\n\nSince many of the demands put forth by these new governments involve mining, energy, land and foreign investments, there may be friction with American interests and policies in the months and years to come.\n\nBut there are also significant differences between many of these governments and movements, as well as with the first pink wave and with the traditional autocratic, dictatorial left in Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela.\n\nSome of these new leftist leaders and candidates share a clear democratic inclination, because they spring from anti-dictatorial struggles in the past. Boric, whom former Chilean economy minister and Senator Carlos Ominami has called the “New Chilean way,” is one of them, as is Lula in Brazil and even Fernández in Argentina.\n\nSeveral of them are sharply critical of the Cuban, Venezuelan and Nicaraguan dictatorships. Boric, Lula and Petro are all tacking to the center, since their electoral systems include run-offs that cannot be won without alliances beyond their core electoral bases. Significantly, anti-free-trade rhetoric aside, countries like Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico have all signed free-trade agreements with the US and show no signs of wanting to withdraw from them.\n\nDespite their best intentions and enthusiasm of their followers, their victories do not guarantee sweeping social change. Every Latin American economy has been battered by the 2020 recession; poverty and inequality have increased as a result; fiscal revenues have dropped as economic recovery is taking longer than expected. It will not be easy to satisfy the demands of the streets and the polling booths.\n\nNonetheless, Latin America, with the exception of Cuba and Venezuela, will not be fertile hunting ground for China and Russia. And despite occasional anti-American rhetoric, most of these new leaders have either been friendly to the US in the past or have promised to be so in the future.\n\nIndeed, at least in regard to US President Joe Biden’s economic, social and environmental agenda, if not his actual accomplishments, there is a great deal of affinity between the current administration in Washington and the perhaps-misnamed new pink wave in Latin America.\n\nThey are all facing the challenge of (re)building their welfare states, which were proven to be defective in the face of the pandemic and the ensuing economic contraction. The upcoming Summit of the Americas, scheduled for early June in Los Angeles, will provide an excellent opportunity to emphasize that affinity, and put to rest the temptation to see a new Cold War in Latin America, with the US on one side, China and Russia on the other, and the region’s nations caught in between.\n\nIf the Biden administration emphasizes this affinity and seeks common ground instead of re-fighting the war on drugs and declaring a new war on migration, this sea change in Latin America can become a great opportunity for the US.\n\nThat would be a more constructive way to view trends in Latin America, rather than overinterpreting state visits, speeches and announcements that may never come true.", "authors": ["Jorge G.

It was the best way to kick off the Halloween season.\"\n\nThe video was a family effort, though it was Klum who \"immediately\" thought of the toilet paper mummies and \"knew my kids would love it.\"\n\n\"I was thinking about how we, like so many families, would be stuck at home and what we had around the house that we could make into costumes,\" she says. \"To me, Halloween means creativity!

The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.\"\n\nEarlier Saturday, videos from eyewitnesses showed explosions taking place in an area north-west of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. There is a military base in the area.\n\nCNN teams in the capital also reported hearing loud explosions to the west and south of the city Saturday. Shortly afterward, Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications said clashes are underway in an eastern suburb as well -- as Russian forces close in on the capital from multiple sides.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian armed forces reported heavy fighting around the city of Vasylkiv, some 30 kilometers southwest of Kyiv.\n\n\"Heavy fighting is currently underway in the town of Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region, where the occupiers are trying to land a landing party,\" the armed forces said.\n\nRussian forces are close to Kyiv, Zelensky confirmed in his message Friday, advancing on the capital from the north and east after seizing control Thursday of an airbase just north of the city. But \"Ukrainians resist the Russian aggression heroically,\" he said.\n\nRussia's military claimed earlier Friday its forces had staged a \"successful landing operation\" to capture Hostomel airfield, viewed as strategically important, on Kyiv's outskirts.\n\nZelensky's comments came hours after a video was posted on his Facebook page, showing him with a group of men, saying, \"We are here. We are in Kyiv. We are defending Ukraine.\"\n\nBefore dawn Friday, explosions lit up the sky above the capital as Russia targeted the city with missile strikes, according to a Ukrainian government adviser. A CNN team reported hearing two large blasts in central Kyiv and a third loud explosion in the distance, followed by at least three more explosions to the south-west of the city a few hours later.\n\n\"Strikes on Kyiv with cruise or ballistic missiles continued,\" Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine told reporters via text message Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Russian reconnaissance troops had entered the Obolon district of northern Kyiv, just a few miles from the city center. Videos from the area showed chaotic scenes as civilians tried to hide from small arms fire.\n\nUkrainian military vehicles move past Independence Square in central Kyiv on February 24, 2022.\n\nA tweet from the ministry asked citizens of the district to report any suspicious movements, adding: \"Make Molotov cocktails and take down the occupier.\"\n\nCNN witnessed a group of Ukrainian security forces leave the city police headquarters with weapons and ammunition -- apparently heading towards Obolon.\n\nMeanwhile, 92 people working at the Chernobyl power plant, the site of the world's worst-ever nuclear disaster, have been taken hostage, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US said Friday. Russian forces took control of the site on Thursday, sparking fears that the fighting could interfere with the operation of nuclear waste facilities.\n\nAs Russian troops advance, US intelligence officials are concerned that Kyiv could fall under Russian control within days, according to two sources familiar with the latest intelligence.\n\nHowever, the latest British defense intelligence assessment said Russia had made \"limited progress\" Friday in its attack.\n\n\"Fighting continues in key locations. Russia has made limited progress so far today and Ukraine retains control of key cities. Ukrainian MOD reports that Russian forces have arrived in the suburbs of Kyiv,\" the UK Ministry of Defence tweeted\n\nA senior US defense official told reporters that the Russians have \"about a third of their combat power\" in Ukraine out of the total combat power they have amassed on the country's borders right now, but \"that does not mean that they will not commit more.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry earlier said that airborne assault troops blew up a bridge over the Teteriv River at Ivankiv, about 30 miles north of Kyiv, successfully preventing a Russian column of forces from advancing towards the capital, which has a population of close to 3 million.\n\nA Ukrainian firefighter walks between fragments of a downed aircraft in Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, February 25, 2022. It was unclear what aircraft crashed and what brought it down.\n\nFor now, Ukraine's democratically elected government remains intact but President Volodymr Zelensky warned in a video address late Thursday that \"enemy sabotage groups\" had entered this city and he is their No. 1 target. \"They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,\" he said.\n\n\"Russian forces continued to launch missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine. They say that they are only targeting military facilities, but these are lies. In fact, they do not distinguish in which areas they operate,\" he said. \"Such attacks on our capital haven't occurred since 1941.\"\n\nIn an address Friday morning, Zelensky said Ukrainians were \"showing their true heroism\" but that they were defending their country \"alone.\" The sanctions imposed on Russia by Western powers are \"not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil,\" he said.\n\nA few hours later, Zelensky released a message in which he again called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold direct talks. \"There is fighting all over Ukraine now. Let's sit down at the negotiation table to stop the people's deaths,\" he said, speaking in Russian.\n\nShortly afterward, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ready to send a delegation to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, for talks with Ukraine, Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported.\n\n\"As you know, today the President of Ukraine Zelensky announced his readiness to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine,\" Peskov said, according to RIA. The talks would concern \"neutral status,\" he suggested. Peskov said later Friday that the Ukrainian side had countered with a proposal to meet in Warsaw and then dropped contact.\n\nZelensky has not directly proposed neutral status but has signaled a willingness to discuss it, while insisting his country be provided security guarantees.\n\n\"Ukraine has been and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace. This is our constant position,\" Sergii Nykyforov, a spokesperson for Zelensky, said late Friday. He also denied what he called \"claims that we have refused to negotiate.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Putin called on Ukraine's armed forces to overthrow their government in remarks to his security council Friday.\n\n\"Do not let Banderites (Ukrainian nationalists) and neo-Nazis use your children, wives and old people as human shields,\" Putin said in remarks aired on Russian state television. \"Take power into your own hands, it looks like it will be easier for us to come to an agreement than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that has settled in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.\"\n\nPutin frequently repeats the baseless and inaccurate claim that the democratically elected Ukrainian government is a \"Nazi\" or \"fascist\" regime. The language has been roundly condemned internationally, especially considering that Zelensky is Jewish.\n\nAsked by CNN at a news conference Friday what Moscow's plans were for the leadership of Ukraine as Russian forces advance on Kyiv, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov replied: \"Nobody is going to attack the people of Ukraine.\"\n\nIn an interview with CNN on the streets of Kyiv, former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko accused Putin of being \"simply crazy\" in wanting to \"come here to kill Ukrainians\" -- and vowed they would resist. \"We demonstrate a unique quality that we can stand against Russian aggression,\" he said.\n\nA photograph taken on February 24, 2022 shows an Ukrainian infantry combat vehicle standing guard on the outskirts of Kyiv.\n\nHomes damaged\n\nThe advance on Kyiv comes only a day after Russian forces entered Ukraine from three sides, by land, sea and air, prompting a barrage of international condemnation and sanctions -- and questions about Putin's wider ambitions for the country and its capital.\n\nIt's unclear how long Ukrainian forces can resist the advance of Russian forces who are much better equipped and have superior air power.\n\nTwo residential buildings in Kyiv suffered damage in the early hours of Friday, but it's not clear if they were intentionally struck or hit by debris, or if anyone was injured.\n\nUkrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv. Photos tweeted by the emergency forces appear to show a fire at a two-story private house with debris from what looks to be a plane nearby. It is unclear if the house was hit by remnants of the jet.\n\nSeparately, images showed firefighters working to put out a blaze at an apartment building on the left bank of the city.\n\nAs they approach, many Ukrainians are preparing to fight back. Some 18,000 guns with ammunition have been distributed to reservists in the Kyiv region alone since the Russian invasion began early Thursday, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said, with more weapons on their way.\n\nOutside the Kyiv region, fighting continued in cities including Sumy, in the northeast, Chernihiv in the north and Kherson to the south.\n\nA CNN team that visited a bridge crossing from Russian-held areas into the southern city of Kherson saw four large shell craters, 10 discarded Ukrainian armored vehicles and several bodies, but the Ukrainians appeared to have been able to push Russian forces back.\n\nLow-flying jets could be seen overhead and air raid sirens wailed across the city.\n\nA Russian defense ministry spokesperson said in a statement that a \"counter-offensive\" was underway in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, and that Ukrainian service members had surrendered to Russian troops and pro-Russian separatists. CNN could not immediately check the veracity of those claims.\n\nMakeshift bunkers\n\nOfficials in the country believe Russia's plan is to overthrow the Ukrainian leadership and install a pro-Russian government.\n\nThose fears were shared with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Thursday that he's \"convinced\" Moscow is going to try to overthrow the Ukrainian government.\n\nIf that happens, Blinken said he believes \"Moscow has developed plans to inflict widespread human rights abuses -- and potentially worse -- on the Ukrainian people.\"\n\nThe fighting in Ukraine appears to be some of the worst conventional warfare Europe has seen since World War II and the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. Preliminary figures indicate 137 Ukrainian solders have been killed, including every soldier defending an island in the Black Sea that was taken over by Russian troops, according to President Zelensky.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy makes a statement in Kyiv, Ukraine, February 25.\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry said its armed forces had caused around 800 casualties among Russian forces since the attacks started early on Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether the ministry was referring solely to the number killed and CNN is not able to independently verify Ukraine's figures.\n\nBy the end of Thursday, Putin's forces had launched \"in total more than 160 missiles for airstrikes,\" a senior US defense official said, prompting a response reminiscent of the late 1930s, with vulnerable children evacuated by train from eastern Ukraine and packed subway stations turned into makeshift bunkers as air raid sirens wailed.\n\nA family takes shelter along with other Kyiv residents in an underground parking garage on Friday. Some areas of the Ukrainian capital were hit by aerial attacks.\n\nIn an ominous sign a ground war could escalate, Zelensky barred male citizens between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving the country, according to the State Border Guard Service.\n\nZelensky also ordered a general military mobilization \"in order to ensure the defense of the state, maintaining combat and mobilization readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations, in a declaration signed late Thursday.\n\nMore than 100,000 people have already fled areas most at risk of attack within Ukraine, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The mass movement followed warnings from the US Ambassador to the UN, who said Russia's actions in Ukraine could create one of the largest refugee crises facing the world today, displacing as many as five million people.\n\nPolish officials reported an increase in the number of people crossing into the country from Ukraine in the hours after the Russian invasion began.\n\nPeople hide in a bomb shelter in Kyiv in the early hours of February 25.\n\nSanctioning Putin\n\nThe United States will impose sanctions on Putin and Lavrov, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday, hours after the European Union and United Kingdom said they would do the same.\n\nThe EU also announced a slew of other new sanctions on Russia, designed to have \"maximum impact on the Russian economy and political elite.\"\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the sanctions would hit Russia's financial, energy and transport sectors, visa policy, and include export controls and export financing bans.\n\n\"We want to financially isolate Russia, we want to cut all the ties between Russia and the international financial system,\" said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.\n\nSpeaking in Brussels on Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described Russia's attack on Ukraine as a \"brutal act of war.\"\n\nThe alliance activated the NATO Response Force (NRF) for the first time ever in response to the invasion. The NRF is made up of land, air, sea and special operations forces from the allies that can deploy quickly in support of the NATO alliance.\n\n\"We have over 100 jets at high alert, operating in over 30 different locations, and over 120 ships from the high north, to the Mediterranean. We activated the defense plans yesterday, and now elements of this force are being deployed,\" Stoltenberg said during a press briefing on Friday, following an extraordinary meeting of NATO Heads of State and Government in Brussels. He also clarified that while the United States, Canada and European allies have \"deployed thousands more troops\" to the eastern part of the alliance, NATO is not deploying the entire Response Force.\n\nA big concern for NATO is whether Putin's intentions lie beyond Ukraine, a prospect that risks drawing all 30 members -- including the US, the United Kingdom, Canada, France and Germany -- into a wider conflict on European soil.\n\n\"You don't need intelligence to tell you that that's exactly what President Putin wants. He has made clear he'd like to reconstitute the Soviet Empire, short of that he'd like to reassert a sphere of influence around the neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc,\" said Blinken on CBS Evening News.\n\nBlinken said NATO would stand in the way if those were Putin's ultimate goals.\n\n\"Now, when it comes to a threat beyond Ukraine's borders. There's something very powerful standing in his way. That's article five of NATO, an attack on one is an attack on all,\" the top diplomat said.\n\nOn Thursday, the US Secretary of Defense ordered the deployment of 7,000 US service members to Europe. The deployment brings the number of US troops moved towards eastern Europe at more than 14,000.", "authors": ["Nathan Hodge", "Matthew Chance", "Tim Lister", "Laura Smith-Spark", "Helen Regan"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/world/coronavirus-newsletter-intl-01-19-22/index.html", "title": "Covid pandemic 'nowhere near over,' WHO says | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nHow will the pandemic end? Nearly two years since it was officially declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), we’re still no closer to knowing the answer.\n\nThe highly transmissible Omicron variant has swept the globe since it was first detected in South Africa in November. But the fact that it is less likely to cause severe disease than previous coronavirus variants has led to heavy speculation over whether it might mark a turning point, or a conclusion, to the pandemic.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus poured cold water on that theory on Tuesday, saying: “This pandemic is nowhere near over.”\n\nOmicron is continuing to infect the world at a startling speed, with more than 18 million cases reported last week alone, according to WHO. The number of Covid patients in the United States is at a record high and continues to climb, overwhelming hospitals. From Australia to Germany, infections are leaping to never-before-seen levels, putting a significant strain on health care systems.\n\n“Omicron may be less severe – on average, of course – but the narrative that it is mild disease is misleading, hurts the overall response, and costs more lives,” Tedros said. “Make no mistake, Omicron is causing hospitalizations and deaths and even the less severe cases are inundating health facilities. The virus is circulating far too intensely with many still vulnerable.”\n\nThe same message was echoed a day earlier by Dr. Anthony Fauci, US President Joe Biden’s top medical adviser. Fauci was asked at the online World Economic Forum if the coronavirus may this year transition from pandemic to endemic level, when a disease has a constant presence in a population but is not affecting an alarmingly large number of people. He replied: “I would hope that that’s the case, but that would only be the case if we don’t get another variant that eludes the immune response.”\n\nFauci added that the world is still in the first of what he described as five pandemic phases: “the truly pandemic phase,” where the world is “very negatively impacted,” which is followed by deceleration, control, elimination and eradication.\n\nAnd yet some governments seem to be ignoring such phased steps, resigning themselves to the virus ripping through their populations indefinitely. According to their logic, “We need to learn to live with this virus.” But what exactly does that look like, and how long will it last?\n\nIn some European countries, pandemic strategy continues to down-shift toward fewer mitigation measures, reduced quarantine periods and fewer restrictions on travel. In fact, in places such as Spain, the thinking is to treat Omicron more like the flu — despite public health officials, including WHO, cautioning against that approach. “I think we have to evaluate the evolution of Covid to an endemic illness, from the pandemic we have faced up until now,” Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said last week.\n\nIn Britain, which flirted with a controversial “herd immunity” strategy at the start of the pandemic and has continued to raise eyebrows with its “keep calm and carry on” attitude to the virus, an Omicron spike threatened to put the country’s health service on a “war footing.” But now that the wave seems to have crested — 93,890 new cases were reported on Tuesday compared to 129,544 on the same day last week — the limited “Plan B” restrictions imposed in December, which included masks on public transport, will be eased next week.\n\n“Decisions on the next steps remain finely balanced,” Downing Street said in a statement, which emphasized that “the Omicron variant continues to pose a significant threat and the pandemic is not over.”\n\nGovernment workers investigate a pet shop that closed after some pet hamsters tested positive for the coronavirus in Hong Kong on January 18.

Roughly 60% of the KN95 respirators evaluated during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a US federal agency that evaluates safety equipment, didn’t meet the requirements.\n\nProperly fitted KN95 and N95 respirators are designed to filter up to 95% of particles in the air, but only the latter are approved for health-care use in the US. KN95s are certified in China, which makes them trickier to vet, and it’s a good idea to check whether the manufacturer has a valid lab report.\n\nHere are a few signs that a respirator could be counterfeit, according to NIOSH:\n\nNo markings at all on the filtering facepiece respirator\n\nNo approval (TC) number on filtering facepiece respirator or headband\n\nNo NIOSH markings, or NIOSH spelled incorrectly\n\nPresence of decorative fabric or other decorative add-ons (e.g. sequins)\n\nFiltering facepiece respirator has ear loops instead of headbands\n\nYou can look for further NIOSH approved products on the CDC website, as well as guidelines and example images detailing how to spot counterfeit masks.\n\nSend your questions here.

This is before any publication, but we’re giving it out since we understand the urgency of the public to get any information possible about the fourth dose,” Dr. Gili Regev-Yochay, director of the Infection Prevention and Control Unit at Sheba Medical Center, told reporters during a virtual news conference Monday about the data. She added that she supported giving fourth shots to vulnerable people who may see some benefit from it, but that the research probably was not enough to support a decision to dole it out to the wider population.\n\nIn December, Sheba Medical Center started trialing a fourth dose of the vaccines for healthy people ahead of the rollout of the additional booster shot to at-risk people, making it the first study of its kind. The research in Israel, an early leader in Covid vaccines, was being closely watched around the world as governments grapple with surging cases driven by Omicron.\n\nA protester wears a mask depicting syringes during a rally against coronavirus measures in Geneva on October 9, 2021. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEurope’s rule-breaking unvaccinated are falling out of society\n\nBefore Covid-19, Nicolas Rimoldi had never attended a protest. But somewhere along the pandemic’s long and tortuous road, which saw his native Switzerland imposing first one lockdown, then another, and finally introducing vaccination certificates, Rimoldi decided he had had enough. Now he leads Mass-Voll, one of Europe’s largest youth-orientated anti-vaccine passport groups.\n\nBecause he has chosen not to get vaccinated, student and part-time supermarket cashier Rimoldi is – for now, at least – locked out of much of public life. Without a vaccine certificate, he can no longer complete his degree or work in a grocery store. He is barred from eating in restaurants, attending concerts or going to the gym. “People without a certificate like me, we’re not a part of society anymore,” he said.\n\nFaced with lingering pockets of vaccine hesitancy, or outright refusal, many nations are imposing ever stricter rules and restrictions on unvaccinated people, effectively making their lives more difficult in an effort to convince them to get their shots. In doing so, they are testing the boundary between public health and civil liberties – and heightening tensions between those who are vaccinated and those who are not, Rob Picheta reports.\n\nChina is risking its economy with zero-Omicron approach\n\nThe Chinese government’s unwavering insistence on stamping out any trace of the coronavirus is facing its biggest test yet as authorities grapple with Omicron’s quickening spread. And it could cost the world’s second-largest economy dearly this year, Laura He reports.\n\nCovid-19 cases have been cropping up across China in recent days, including in major port cities like Dalian and Tianjin, prompting restrictions that could upend business operations in those places. In Beijing, a single Omicron case led to a snap lockdown and mass testing just weeks before the 2022 Winter Olympics. The rest of the world is also dealing with Omicron, but China is different because of how intent authorities are to prevent any widespread outbreak with their zero-Covid approach.\n\nThe strict strategy has so far been effective: China has recorded far fewer Covid-19 cases than many other nations during the pandemic, and its economy was the only major one to grow in 2020. But in the face of a more transmissible variant that is far more difficult to contain, and as the rest of the world learns to live with the virus, economists say China’s zero-tolerance strategy is likely to do more harm than good in 2022.\n\nTOP TIP\n\nSchool closures are affecting children worldwide, according to research published Tuesday in JAMA Pediatrics that looked at children and adolescents from 11 countries, including Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Italy, Japan, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the US.\n\nThe research found kids experienced both mental and physical health problems – anxiety, depression, lower physical activity, food insecurity and school disengagement – linked to school closures and social lockdowns. Madeline Holcombe spoke with experts who had these tips for families trying to protect their children’s mental and physical health amid the turmoil:\n\nFind ways to get children out into the world safely, keep them busy and help build skills with them.

But did you know that changing your expectations can have a tangible effect on your wellbeing?

So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” Zelensky said.\n\nUkraine has said its air force shot down a cruise missile launched at Kyiv on Sunday from Belarus. Belarus is an ally of Russia and has played an important role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZelensky’s office said Lukashenko had called his Ukrainian counterpart on Sunday. “The politicians have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,” Zelensky’s office said.\n\n“Aleksander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on the Belarusian territory will remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation’s travel, meeting and return.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country’s deterrence forces – which include nuclear arms – onto their highest state of alert on Sunday.\n\n“Top officials in leading NATO countries have allowed themselves to make aggressive comments about our country, therefore I hereby order the Minister of Defense and the chief of the General Staff to place the Russian Army Deterrence Force on combat alert,” Putin said in a televised meeting with top Russian defense officials.\n\nPutin also said the Western sanctions placed on Russia were unlawful.\n\nA senior US official told CNN that the new development is Putin’s latest attempt to manufacture threats to justify aggression.\n\n“The only reason his forces face a threat today is because they invaded a sovereign country, and one without nuclear weapons,” said the official. “This is yet another escalatory and totally unnecessary step.”\n\nAs the fighting continues, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled their homes and dozens of civilians have been killed, according to UN figures.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a briefing that Putin’s order to put Russian deterrent forces on alert was a “direct threat to us” and an effort to raise pressure on the Ukrainian delegation at Monday’s scheduled talks.\n\nKuleba indicated that Ukrainian officials are willing to “listen to what Russia has to say” but will not give in to pressure. “We will tell them what we think of this,” he said. “And what we are ready to discuss is how to stop the war and the occupation of our territories. Full stop.”\n\nKuleba said that, according to Ukrainian intelligence, even people within Putin’s inner circle do not agree with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, “because they understand the detrimental, the damaging, the devastating consequences this conflict will have for Russia itself.”\n\nFighting in Kharkiv, missiles in Kyiv\n\nEarlier Sunday, residents of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, awoke to find the city still firmly under Ukrainian control, despite two massive explosions some 30 kilometers, or about 18 miles, south of the city lighting up the sky overnight.\n\nAnd fighting broke out on the streets of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, after Russian forces entered the city, Oleh Synehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said Sunday. “Do not leave your shelters!” he posted on Facebook, warning civilians not to go out on the streets.\n\n“Intensive exchanges of rocket artillery overnight have been followed by heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv,” an assessment by the UK’s Ministry of Defence said.\n\nUkrainian forces had managed to deter the Russians from entering the northeastern city – home to about 1.4 million people – for the past three days. The city, which sits less than 20 miles south of the Russian border, was approached by Russian forces shortly after the invasion began.\n\nBut despite being far better equipped, Russia has failed to take control of key cities, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their homes and families.\n\nOthers are fleeing the conflict. The United Nations estimates as many as 368,000 Ukrainians are now refugees.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Saturday that the United Nations “reports at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed” in the fighting in Ukraine. Damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, the statement added.\n\nIn a video message Sunday, Zelensky accused Russian troops of targeting civilians, including children, and called for an international investigation into the conflict.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure, saying in a statement: “The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation do not strike cities and towns, they take all measures to save the lives of civilians.”\n\nBut Zelensky rejected this, saying: “They lied when they said they would not target civilian population. Since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.”\n\nUkraine is “documenting their crimes,” he said, adding: “This is terror.”\n\nRussian offensive failing, Ukrainian PM says\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Saturday that Russia’s offensive was failing and it was now deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, including kindergartens, residential blocks and “buses with children” – actions he labeled as “war crimes.”\n\n“The Russian government doesn’t understand they are not fighting only with the government, in fact they are fighting against the entire Ukrainian people,” he added.\n\nRussian troops are facing a determined and highly-motivated Ukrainian resistance, resulting in significantly slower progress than Kremlin military planners had first anticipated, according to an assessment issued by Britain’s Ministry of Defence late Saturday. After encountering strong resistance in Chernihiv, Russian forces were now bypassing the area to prioritize “the encirclement and isolation of Kyiv,” another British assessment said Sunday.\n\nRussia is facing unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, and is experiencing heavier losses in personnel, armor and aircraft than expected, two senior United States officials with direct knowledge told CNN.\n\nThe US continues to see Russian forces facing “stiff resistance” and their momentum has slowed in the northern part of Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters Sunday, citing fuel shortages and logistical issues.\n\nThe official noted that the Russians are having a “little bit more success” in the south, and would learn from their logistical issues and find ways to overcome them.\n\nUkrainian Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetsky told reporters Saturday that Ukraine had captured around 200 Russian soldiers, some of whom were just 19 years old. They were not trained at all and were badly equipped, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nOn Sunday, Russian authorities acknowledged a number of deaths and injuries in Ukraine for the first time since the beginning of the invasion.\n\n“Russian servicemen are displaying courage and heroism in fulfilling combat tasks in the special military operation,” Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. “Unfortunately, there have been deaths and injuries among our comrades.”\n\nWithout providing precise numbers, Konashenkov also noted that the losses suffered by Russian troops were “considerably lower” than those by Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussia has yet to establish air supremacy over Ukraine, one US official said, as the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense systems fight for control of the airspace. Without uncontested control of the skies, it becomes more difficult for an army on the move to see and strike targets from the air.\n\nSo far these challenges have prevented the quick overthrow of major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, which US officials were concerned could play out in a matter of days. The city of Kharkiv near Ukraine’s border with Russia also has not fallen to invading forces – despite officials worrying that could happen on the first night of an invasion.\n\nA NATO official agreed that Russian forces were having problems.\n\n“They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue,” said the official.\n\nAsked whether Russians are likely to intensify their efforts, the official said they have no choice. “They are way behind schedule,” the official said. “This is getting out of hand for them, every additional day is very painful.”\n\nBut the Russians on Sunday countered reports of its military stalling, claiming the cities of Kherson and Berdyansk “were completely blocked” by Russian forces, and the city of Henichesk and the Chornobayivka airfield near Kherson, also known as Chernobayevka, had both been brought under control.\n\nMaj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, said a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile regiment surrendered in the Kharkiv region and 471 Ukrainian servicemen were captured.\n\nCNN could not immediately verify those claims.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Sunday that checkpoints would be set up across the country to detect Russian troops and make their movements more difficult.\n\nAccusations of war crimes\n\nConcerns are now growing that Russia may look to deploy indiscriminate battlefield weaponry in civilian areas in an attempt to decisively crush Ukrainian forces.\n\nA CNN team spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, near the Ukrainian border early Saturday afternoon.\n\nThermobaric weapons have been used in Chechnya, with horrifying consequences, according to Human Rights Watch, and their use has been condemned by number of non-governmental organizations.\n\nThere is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russia moves in heavy flamethrower weapon 01:02 - Source: CNN\n\nAlthough Russia has claimed it is not targeting civilian infrastructure, an increasing body of evidence on the ground suggests otherwise.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said Sunday that nine civilians, including one child, had been killed in Kyiv since the invasion began, as well as 18 military and territorial defense personnel. There are currently no Russian troops in the capital, he added. The mayor extended a strict curfew across the city until Monday morning.\n\nAccording to a local hospital, a six-year-old boy died in heavy gunfire in a western district of Kyiv on Saturday evening.\n\nA woman was killed after a nine-story residential building in the eastern city of Kharkiv was hit by “enemy artillery” on Saturday night, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.\n\nPolish officials said Sunday that 187,000 people had entered Poland from Ukraine since the invasion began on Thursday.\n\nA defiant Ukraine\n\nAs the battle continues, a defiant Zelensky has released a series of videos from the streets of Kyiv urging citizens to defend their country.\n\nOfficials armed reservists with 18,000 guns and ammunition in Kyiv alone, and Ukrainian TV has broadcast instructions for making Molotov cocktails. Ukrainian males ages 18 to 60 are banned from leaving the country.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Molotov cocktails and personal arms. See how Ukrainians are fighting back 02:26 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Zelensky called on citizens of the world also to join the fight against the “Russian war criminals.”\n\n“This is not just Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,” he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian military on Sunday claimed successful attacks by its Turkish-made force of drones against Russian forces. The Armed Forces of Ukraine released footage showing the destruction of armor by a drone and said that it was carried out against a Russian Buk surface-to-air missile system.\n\nValerii Zaluzhnyi, the Armed Forces commander-in-chief, said the drone attack took place near the town of Malyn, about 100 kilometers (or 62 miles) northwest of Kyiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian government began receiving the Bayraktar TB2 drones from Turkey last year.\n\nWestern powers have imposed several rounds of sanctions against Russia since Thursday, with more under consideration. On Saturday, the United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada said they would expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global financial messaging service, and “paralyze” the assets of Russia’s central bank.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russian state TV is covering the war very differently 02:24 - Source: CNN\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz vowed Sunday that “very soon the Russian leadership will feel what a high price they will have to pay” for the invasion of Ukraine, as he announced he would raise German military funding during a special session with lawmakers.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed Sunday that the European Union is shutting down its airspace to Russia.\n\n“We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian-registered and Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the European Union. This will apply to any plane,” von der Leyen said.\n\n“Our airspace will be closed to every Russian plane. And that includes the private jets of oligarchs too,” she added.\n\nOn Sunday, the EU also announced a ban on Russian news outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, according to the EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell.\n\n“Today we are taking a crucial step to turn off the tap for the Russian’s information manipulation in Europe by banning Russia Today and Sputnik from broadcasting in the European Union,” Borrell said at a joint press conference in Brussels.\n\nAt home, the Kremlin appears to be in damage control, attempting to limit information about the difficulties its forces are facing in Ukraine.\n\nSocial media platform Twitter said Saturday it is being restricted inside Russia and is working to address the issue.\n\nRussia’s media regulator told 10 news outlets that it would restrict access to their publications unless they stopped spreading “false information” – including the shelling of Ukrainian cities and the death of civilians caused by the Russian armed forces.\n\nNonetheless, Russians continued to turn out for anti-war protests over the weekend. Russian authorities have detained a total of 4,862 people for participating in unsanctioned anti-war protests across the country since the invasion of Ukraine was ordered independent monitoring site OVD-Info said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Tim Lister Ivana Kottasová Laura Smith-Spark Julia Hollingsworth", "Tim Lister", "Ivana Kottasová", "Laura Smith-Spark", "Julia Hollingsworth"], "publish_date": "2022/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/china/china-reaction-ukraine-russia-intl-hnk-mic/index.html", "title": "China blames the US as Russia's war breaks out in Europe - CNN", "text": "(CNN) As Russian missiles flew through the Ukrainian sky Thursday and world leaders decried an invasion spreading across the country, China refused to condemn Russia's move outright, while appearing to levy blame on the United States and its allies.\n\nBeijing finds itself in a complex position as Russia's invasion of its neighbor intensifies, needing to balance a close strategic partnership with Moscow with its seemingly contradictory policy of supporting state sovereignty.\n\nA Chinese government official Thursday sidestepped questions over whether it would condemn Russia's actions or consider it an \"invasion.\"\n\nInstead, China's Assistant Foreign Minister Hua Chunying -- who repeated staid lines about seeking peace through dialogue and said the situation was \"not what we would hope to see\" -- was quick to point the finger at the US, implying that Washington was a \"culprit\" for \"fanning up flames,\" referring to US warnings in recent weeks of an imminent invasion.\n\n\"China has taken a responsible attitude and persuaded all parties not to escalate tensions or incite war...Those who follow the US' lead in fanning up flames and then shifting the blame onto others are truly irresponsible,\" she said.\n\nThe comments echoed those made a day earlier, prior to the invasion, when Hua blamed the crisis on \"NATO expansion eastward all the way to Russia's doorstep.\"\n\n\"Did it ever think about the consequences of pushing a big country to the wall?\" she said.\n\nThe presence of Hua at the briefing both days was itself unusual, as the veteran spokeswoman had not been at the podium in such briefings since she was promoted to assistant minister for foreign affairs in October.\n\nHer comments were widely disseminated across China's official state media and social media platforms, where talk of Ukraine dominated coverage and conversation.\n\n'War is not funny'\n\nBut while state media reflected the official government line, top trending topics on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform, included a speech by Russian President Vladimir Putin with more than 360 million views, as well as others looking at how Ukrainian citizens were reacting, such as a post on people lining up to donate blood with 62 million views.\n\nThe topic \"Ukraine President says Western countries completely give up on Ukraine,\" topped the list in the morning, raking up over 1 billion views throughout the day and tens of thousands of comments.\n\nMany of those comments on the highly moderated platform mocked Ukraine and its President Volodymyr Zelensky for being \"pro-West\" and cheered for Russia and Putin.\n\nBut others pushed back: \"War is not funny at all,\" wrote one user, whose post was liked over 60,000 times. \"It makes me feel physically sick to see all the jokes about war.\"\n\nElsewhere online, homepages of China's major state media outlets took a measured approach, citing statements and news from both the Ukrainian and Russian side, while putting focus on sanctions leveraged by other countries against Russia.\n\nCommunist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily highlighted comments from China's Foreign Ministry pointing to how the US had been \"increasing tensions and hyping up war.\"\n\nA glimpse of the kind of guidance that state media may be under emerged Tuesday, when what appeared to be an internal memo from Chinese state media Beijing News directing its employees not to publish news reports \"negative to Russia or pro-West\" was mistakenly published on the outlet's official social media account.\n\nThe post, which was swiftly deleted, also directed employees to \"filter and release proper comments.\" Beijing government-controlled Beijing News declined CNN's request for comment on the incident.\n\nA relationship with 'no limits'\n\nThe Russian invasion comes on the heels of a meeting earlier this month between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Putin, who made a show of their strong bond with a highly publicized meeting ahead of the Beijing Olympics and declared \"no limits\" to their relationship.\n\nBut an outright backing of Russian moves would put China at odds with the West. It would also contradict China's usual vocal support for state sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nIn a phone conversation between Xi and Putin on Friday, Xi said China \"decides its position based on the merits of the Ukraine issue itself,\" and that China supports Russia and Ukraine resolving their issue through negotiation, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.\n\n\"China is willing to work with all parties in the international community to advocate a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept,\" Xi reportedly added.\n\nThe high-level call follows talks between China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov Thursday, in which Wang expressed understanding for Russia's \"legitimate concerns\" on security issues, but said \"China always respects all countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" according to a statement by China's Foreign Ministry.\n\nChina has denied that it was complicit in Russia's moves, but Western leaders are paying close attention to the Moscow-Beijing relationship as events in Ukraine unfold.\n\nAs Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison unveiled new sanctions against Russia Friday, he said he was \"concerned at the lack of a strong response from China.\"\n\nMorrison said China's move to begin importing Russian wheat -- based on an agreement made earlier this month -- was \"unacceptable\" as Australia, the US, Europe, the United Kingdom and Japan acted \"to cut off\" Russia.\n\nChina hit back at the West's decision to slap a swath of economic sanctions on Russia in recent days.

Nowhere is that more true than in Russia, where the Kremlin has engaged in a campaign of false advertising to sell its invasion of Ukraine to the public.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin cast the campaign as a “special military operation” – not a war – and told citizens that they could, essentially, forget about the conflict in Ukraine. Draftees, he promised falsely, would not fight, and military operations would be left to the professionals. And Putin’s Ministry of Defense delivered platitudes about progress on the battlefield, talking points quickly parroted by Russian state television.\n\nBut a curious shift is underway in Russia’s tightly controlled information space. Ukraine’s military has been making dramatic advances in a counteroffensive, making it increasingly difficult to conceal the Russian military’s losses. And Putin last month declared a partial military mobilization, sending a message to the general population that their leader was going all in Ukraine, and that sacrifices are now in order.\n\nAgainst that background, Russia has seen some unusual public criticism of the top brass running Putin’s war. Within limits, of course: Criticizing the war itself or Russia’s commander-in-chief is off limits, but those responsible for carrying out the President’s orders are fair game.\n\nIn a recent interview with Russian arch-propagandist Vladimir Solovyov, the head of the defense committee in Russia’s State Duma demanded that officials cease lying and level with the Russian public.\n\n“First of all, we need to stop lying,” said Andrei Kartopolov, a former colonel-general in the Russian military and a member of the pro-Kremlin United Russia party. “We brought this up many times before … But somehow it’s apparently not getting through to individual senior figures.”\n\nKartapolov complained that the Ministry of Defense was evading the truth about incidents such as Ukrainian cross-border strikes in Russian regions neighboring Ukraine.\n\n“Our Russian city of Valuyki… is under constant fire,” he said. “We learn about this from all sorts of folks, from governors, Telegram channels, our war correspondents. But no one else. The reports from the Ministry of Defense do not change in substance. They say they destroyed 300 rockets, killed Nazis and so on. But people know. Our people are not stupid. But they don’t want to even tell part of the truth. This can lead to a loss of credibility.”\n\nValuyki is in Russia’s Belgorod region, near the border with Ukraine. Kyiv has generally adopted a neither-confirm-nor-deny stance when it comes to striking Russian targets across the border.\n\nSome criticism has also come from Russian-appointed quislings who have been installed by Moscow to run occupied regions of Ukraine. In a recent four-minute rant on the messaging app Telegram, the Russian-appointed deputy leader of Ukraine’s occupied Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, lambasted Russian military commanders for allowing “gaps” on the battlefield that had allowed the Ukrainian military to make advances in the region, which is illegally claimed by Russia.\n\n“There is no need to somehow cast a shadow over the entire Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation because of some, I do not say traitors, but incompetent commanders, who did not bother, and were not accountable, for the processes and gaps that exist today,” Stremousov said. “Indeed, many say that the Minister of Defense [Sergei Shoigu], who allowed this situation to happen, could, as an officer, shoot himself. But, you know, the word officer is an unfamiliar word for many.”\n\nA provocative statement, perhaps – Stremousov might perhaps be mindful of the fact that troublesome leaders of Russian-backed separatist entities have a habit of dying violently – but some of this criticism is not new. Just weeks after Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, one of his key domestic enforcers, Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, urged the Russian military to expand its campaign, implying that Moscow’s approach had not been brutal enough.\n\nBut after Russia’s retreat from the strategic Ukrainian city of Lyman, Kadyrov has been a lot less shy about naming names when it comes to blaming Russian commanders.\n\nWriting on Telegram, Kadyrov personally blamed Colonel-General Aleksandr Lapin, the commander of Russia’s Central Military District, for the debacle, accusing him of moving his headquarters away from his subordinates and failing to adequately provide for his troops.\n\n“It’s not a shame that Lapin is mediocre, but the fact that he is covered at the top by the leaders in the General Staff,” said Kadyrov.\n\nThe US-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War noted that Russian battlefield setbacks, coupled with the unease in Russian society over mobilization, “was fundamentally changing the Russian information space.” That has included robust criticism not just from hawkish men of power such as Kadyrov, but from pro-war milbloggers who have often provided a granular picture of battlefield realities for Russian forces.\n\n“The Russian information space has significantly deviated from the narratives preferred by the Kremlin and the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) that things are generally under control,” ISW noted in its recent analysis.\n\n“The current onslaught of criticism and reporting of operational military details by the Kremlin’s propagandists has come to resemble the milblogger discourse over the past week. The Kremlin narrative had focused on general statements of progress and avoided detailed discussions of current military operations. The Kremlin had never openly recognized a major failure in the war prior to its devastating loss in Kharkiv Oblast, which prompted the partial reserve mobilization.”\n\nOne of the central features of Putinism is a fetish for World War II, known in Russia as the Great Patriotic War. And those in Russia’s party of war often speak admiringly of the brutal tactics employed by the Red Army to fight Hitler’s Wehrmacht, including the use of punishment battalions – sending soldiers accused of desertion, cowardice or wavering against German positions as cannon fodder – and the use of summary execution to halt unauthorized retreats.\n\nKadyrov – who recently announced that he had been promoted by Putin to the rank of colonel general – has been one of the most prominent voices arguing for the draconian methods of the past. He recently said in another Telegram post that, if he had his way, he would give the government extraordinary wartime powers in Russia.\n\n“Yes, if it were my will, I would declare martial law throughout the country and use any weapon, because today we are at war with the whole NATO bloc,” Kadyrov said in a post that also seemed to echo Putin’s not-so-subtle threats that Russia might contemplate the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nAnd that’s the worrying thing. In Russia’s bellicose information space, the talk isn’t about ending a horrific and wasteful war: It’s about correcting the mistakes that forced a Russian retreat, reinforcing discipline, and doubling down in Ukraine.", "authors": ["Nathan Hodge"], "publish_date": "2022/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/04/europe/ukraine-foreign-fighters-russia-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Ukraine: The foreign fighters and ukrainian expats taking up arms to ...", "text": "Shehyni, Ukraine (CNN) The gray asphalt road that leads to Ukraine's Shehyni border crossing with Poland has for the past week seen 30-mile tailbacks as people try to flee the country, often saying tearful goodbyes to the family members and friends staying behind to fight the Russian invasion.\n\nWednesday brought a different sight: groups of young men, laden with heavy bags and military kit, entered Ukraine from Poland as they answered President Volodymyr Zelensky's call for \"citizens of the world\" to fight \"Russian war criminals.\"\n\nAmong them, New York resident Vasyk Didyk, a 26-year-old carpenter wearing a fluorescent Carhartt beanie who is originally from Ukraine.\n\n\"This is our motherland,\" he told CNN in Shehyni. \"We couldn't stay in our comfortable lives in America and watch what is happening here.\"\n\nI haven't been back to Ukraine in four years -- but it wasn't even a choice.\n\nDidyk, accompanied by his friend Igor Harmaii, had spent 24 hours traveling from New York to Poland before crossing back into his homeland carrying a canvas backpack and pulling a suitcase on wheels.\n\nHe has no military training and came despite his parents, who do not live in Ukraine, weeping on the phone when they heard he was joining the fight.\n\n\"I haven't been back to Ukraine in four years -- but it wasn't even a choice,\" he said. \"I had to come and help my country.\"\n\nThe world has watched in horror since Russia invaded Ukraine late last week, triggering what could be the largest land war in Europe since World War II. And Zelensky's defiance has not only united Western opposition to Russia, but also inspired foreign volunteers and Ukrainians abroad to fight for the cause.\n\n\"This is not just Russia's invasion of Ukraine,\" Zelensky said on Sunday. \"This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules, and peaceful coexistence.\"\n\nUkrainian embassies have been helping recruit foreign fighters, while at least one senior politician from a Western government that has previously prosecuted those who joined foreign wars indicated support for citizens taking up arms in Ukraine.\n\n\"If people want to support that struggle, I will support them doing that,\" UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told the BBC on Sunday\n\nAsked by CNN whether it consented to French foreign fighters in Ukraine, the French government said: \"Ukraine is a war zone, classified as a red zone in the travel advice, updated on a permanent basis and available under the following link (Travel advice). As a result, we formally advise against any travel to Ukraine.\"\n\nThe question was not directly answered by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a press briefing on Wednesday\n\nWhen asked about American foreign fighters he said the US has been \"clear for some time\" in telling \"Americans who may be thinking of traveling there not to go.\"\n\nVasyk Didyk (left) and Igor Shehyni (right) arrive in Ukraine on Wednesday after more than 24 hours of travel from New York.\n\nIf Americans want to help Ukraine, \"there are many ways to do that, including by supporting and helping the many NGOs that are working to provide humanitarian assistance; providing resources themselves to groups that are trying to help Ukraine by being advocates for Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nOn Thursday, Zelensky said the first of 16,000 foreign fighters were making their way to Ukraine \"to protect freedom and life for us, and for all,\" he said. CNN has not been able to confirm those numbers.\n\n\"An attack on Europe\"\n\nIn the English city of Milton Keynes, more than 1,200 miles west from Shehyni, British builder Jake Dale said the call for foreigners to join Ukraine's International Legion inspired him to book a flight to Poland on Friday. He aims to cross into Ukraine by Saturday afternoon.\n\n\"As soon as I heard his [Zelensky's] call -- it made me think he needs help,\" the 29-year-old said from his home he shares with his girlfriend and two children. \"I think it is a worthy cause to risk my life, and my girlfriend feels the same. Obviously, she gets upset, as anyone would, but she supports it as she can see I want to help.\"\n\nBack in 2015, Dale wanted to join a Kurdish militia group, the People's Protection Units, or YPG, which was leading the fight against ISIS in Syria, but decided against it due to warnings by the British government.\n\nThis time, he is not worried about the potential legal trouble he could face on his return from Ukraine. \"I'm willing to deal with it,\" he said after the British government distanced itself from Truss's comments.\n\nDuring a trip to Poland, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK was not \"actively\" supporting volunteers going to fight. \"I can understand why people feel as they do, but we have laws in our country about international conflicts and how they must be conducted,\" Johnson told reporters.\n\nDale is heading to Ukraine with Peter Hurst, a 36-year-old former infantry soldier with the British Army, who did a tour of Afghanistan before leaving the military in 2011.\n\nThe father of five, who lives in the northern English town of Pontefract, spoke to CNN on a video call while he picked out kit from an army supplies store in a nearby town. He said wanted to fight to protect democratic values and freedoms.\n\nBritish citizen Jake Dale (left) is pictured with his family. Peter Hurst (right) is pictured with his wife on their wedding day. Both men plan to be in Ukraine by Saturday.\n\n\"It feels like an attack on Europe. If you don't help stop war there [in Ukraine], it will probably spread,\" he said.\n\nBoth Hurst and Dale met this week on a Facebook group -- created to help supply British medical and military aid to Ukraine. They have been working with a liaison -- whose name is listed on an information pack sent by the Ukrainian embassy -- who will provide them with body armor and vests in Poland.\n\nDale has spent £300 ($400) buying kit and plane tickets and worries about the financial impact of him not working. \"It will be a strain on my family when I leave,\" he said. \"But I am sure we will be fine.\"\n\nNot everyone is supportive of the idea of foreign fighters in Ukraine.\n\nUS-based extremist tracking organization SITE Intelligence Group has warned of the involvement of outfits such as Azov, a paramilitary group whose logo is the Wolfsangel, a symbol appropriated by Nazi Germany\n\n\"Following Russia's recent invasion of Ukraine, far-right communities online have rallied to the side of groups like Azov, both in terms of fundraising and stating their intent to fight alongside them,\" a SITE report says.\n\nThe British government has told those without military training to avoid the fight.\n\nOn the Facebook group Hurst and Dale met on, one user warns : \"That is absolutely no place to be for someone with no weapon handling skills and doesn't speak the language. Apart from being a danger to others it's not fair on the lads themselves.\"\n\nDale says he is aware of such warnings but insists his skills as a qualified mechanic could be useful.\n\n\"People can say it is wrong to go in without a military background, but I believe by fighting alongside Ukrainians, I am answering their call for help,\" he said. \"Putin's regime is ruthless -- it is not just Ukraine we are protecting.\"\n\n\"As long as we have to\"\n\nUkrainian citizen Valery, who asked for his last name not to be published, lives in eastern France, but felt compelled to return to visit his elderly parents as Russia massed troops on Ukraine's border.\n\nThe February 24 invasion began soon after he arrived in Kyiv, where it was heralded with pre-dawn warning sirens.\n\n\"I woke up around five o'clock in the morning with the very strange sound,\" he said. \"I thought I was still dreaming. I couldn't believe my ears. But the sound was so persistent I couldn't fall asleep any further.\"\n\nHow useful can I be to my country? The first thought was to join the army and check how useful I can be. Valery\n\nValery said his mind then turned to one thing: \"How useful can I be to my country? The first thought was to join the army and check how useful I can be.\"\n\nAfter enlisting at a conscription center, the 45-year-old said he \"felt this sense of nausea\" when he received his weapon, realizing normality had been shattered. \"Kyiv has been a very peaceful town since 1943,\" he said.\n\nValery is serving with five others in a military unit. \"Many of them have families, have children. Nonetheless, they joined,\" he said, adding that morale is high within the forces. \"There is a lot of determination to defeat the enemy.\"\n\nAll foreign fighters share that determination -- but the people crossing into Ukraine vary wildly in terms of their organization and experience.\n\nCNN spoke to a group of six volunteers, made up of Americans and one Briton, with military equipment in a packed train station in Pzsemysl, Poland. \"If more people would have joined the fight in 1936 we wouldn't be dealing with fascism now,\" the British man said. Most said they are veterans; one said he is not and has never fought in a war.\n\nNone speaks Ukrainian, Russian or Polish, and they did not have a translator or a plan to get to the conflict.\n\n\"We've tried to get in touch with (the) embassy but (traffic) crashed all the websites,\" one said. \"There's women and children dying indiscriminately and you know -- we gotta be here,\" said another.\n\nElsewhere, CNN spoke with a band of Brits and Canadians who had met each other in a Polish airport, all determined to cross the border and join the Ukrainians in battle.\n\nWali, who is French Canadian, said he had served as a sniper in Afghanistan and volunteered previously to fight against ISIS in 2015. He added that he has contacts in Ukraine who can supply him with weapons. \"My friend ... called me and said, OK, we really need you,\" he said.\n\nBack at the border crossing in Shehyni, New Yorkers Didyk and Harmaii wrangle with their canvas backpacks and wheeled suitcases.\n\nWhen asked how long they plan on staying in Ukraine, they both pause and say almost at the same time: \"As long as we have to.\"", "authors": ["Tara John", "Anneclaire Stapleton", "Joseph Ataman", "Vasyk Didyk"], "publish_date": "2022/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/04/opinions/bergen-repass-ukraine-interview/index.html", "title": "Retired US major general: What it will take for the Ukrainians to win ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Peter Bergen is CNN’s national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. His forthcoming paperback is “The Cost of Chaos: The Trump Administration and the World.” View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe former commander of the US Special Operations Command in Europe, retired US Army Maj. Gen. Mike Repass, says the international community has to greatly increase its support for Ukraine if the embattled nation is ever going to be able to drive the Russians out.\n\nRepass has advised the Ukrainian military for the past six years on a US government contract. Last month he visited Poland and western Ukraine to get a better feel for the trajectory of the war in Ukraine. I spoke to him Friday and Monday.\n\nHe says the Ukrainian supply chain for military equipment is inefficient and that additional military forces are required to drive the Russians out of Ukraine.\n\nTo win the war in Ukraine, Repass advocates that the US and its allies build up a Ukrainian strategic force amounting to five brigades of up to 40,000 soldiers capable of mounting offensive operations to force the Russians out of their country.\n\nDisclosure: Repass is on the advisory council of the Global Special Operations Foundation, where I am the chairman of the board. Our conversation was edited for clarity and length.\n\nBERGEN: What did you learn on your trip?\n\nREPASS: One, that Ukraine still needs a lot of help. Two, NATO is moving too slow. Three, we don’t have visibility on what happens to military equipment when it gets into Ukraine.\n\nThe military equipment supply business is personalized as opposed to professionalized: The senior leadership establishes the distribution priorities and, from what I could observe, those priorities are not based on an understanding of consumption rates, or of future operations or objective data. It’s based on commander of brigade X or sector Y calling and saying, “Hey, I need 27 Javelin missiles.” So, it’s highly personalized, and that is not how to run wartime logistics. What should be going on is there should be an understanding of what the consumption rates are on important things like fuel, ammunition, batteries.\n\nBERGEN: Is the likely outcome in Ukraine a bloody conflict that just goes on and on and on?\n\nREPASS: The three obvious future scenarios are: Russia has a battlefield decision in their favor, the Ukrainians have a battlefield decision in their favor, or there’s a stalemate. Two out of three of those outcomes give Russia a victory.\n\nIn the stalemate scenario, Russia would simply claim victory based on facts on the ground and continue its occupation over expanded terrain in Ukraine into the indeterminate future. This would give Russia a less than total victory over Ukraine, but a victory with significantly expanded terrain under Russian control nonetheless.\n\nSo, what are we, the West, collectively doing to ensure that two out of those three possibilities don’t happen? Everybody is thinking about the immediate fight right now, which means we’re running supplies to the Ukrainians. The problem is that the Ukraine’s army needs additional capabilities to be able to drive Russia out of Ukraine.\n\nBERGEN: Why?\n\nREPASS: Because they don’t have enough combat power to do that, meaning enough equipment, firepower and trained soldiers at the moment.\n\nRussia is always going to have more forces, not necessarily better forces, but more of them. As Stalin once said, “quantity has a quality all its own.” Most people recognize that this is going to be a battle of attrition and, at some point in time, it will start to tip in Russia’s favor unless additional Ukrainian forces are generated.\n\nI think there’s a growing realization among NATO countries and the international community that we’re going to have to do something besides resource Ukraine’s current fight. So, there are four things that the US and its allies need to do. First, we need to weaken Russia by strengthening Ukrainian capabilities. Second, we need to further deter Russia by increasing our own and NATO’s capabilities. Third, is degrading Russia’s armed forces and capabilities. Finally, we need to ensure Russia’s defeat in Ukraine, and that is done by building a strategic and operational reserve force for Ukraine that can do offensive operations to kick the Russians out of Ukraine and secure its borders.\n\nBERGEN: What does that look like in practice?\n\nREPASS: You need to have the US, French, Poles, UK and the Germans each build a brigade’s worth of Ukrainian combat power. Those nations have significant military capacity and could generate forces by equipping Ukrainian units and then training them in their own nations. So, that would be five brigades, in five operational sectors. And you would need probably six to eight months to implement that. These five brigades would have Western equipment fighting in Western ways, an integrated air-land battle approach where you have all the means available to you, to include NATO-interoperable tanks, close-air support and air defense.\n\nBERGEN: Five brigades is not a huge number, right?\n\nREPASS: No, it’s not. I think it’s doable in the near term. There are up to 8,000 soldiers or so in a brigade, so that’s up to 40,000 people in five brigades. I believe the Ukrainians are capable of finding that many soldiers given the current national emergency.\n\nHistorically, when a Western military has come up against an army that has been supplied by the Russians, the Russian-backed army has been totally annihilated by an inferior number of forces, as was the case, for instance, during the first Gulf War when the US military destroyed much of Saddam Hussein’s army in Kuwait. We know that the Western armaments have a significant qualitative edge over Russian equipment, so numbers and force ratios are skewed when it is Western military equipment up against Russian-made equipment.\n\nBERGEN: Why do the Russians stick to a model that doesn’t really work well?\n\nREPASS: They are hidebound in their ways. Specifically, what they tried to do at the beginning of the war in Ukraine was a coup de main, taking out Kyiv with a rapid strike. That didn’t work. Russian troops got their asses handed to them. So, they brought all their firepower around to the east and to the south by employing massive artillery fires on the objective or along their avenues of approach. Once they have destroyed almost everything in front of them, then they advance their troops methodically. So, it’s not maneuver warfare. It’s attrition warfare by fire. It’s a fire-based army as opposed to what we have in the West, which is a maneuver-based army.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See how small town fought off group of Russian tanks 05:03 - Source: CNN\n\nBERGEN: What do you make of the new Russian commander in Ukraine, Gen. Aleksandr Dvornikov?\n\nREPASS: He is a dyed-in-the-wool, fire-based, attrition warfare guy. He’s not a maneuver warfare guy. He’s going to do everything that he’s done all his life, which is blow up and destroy everything in his path, and then send the troops in. Those troops will forcefully evacuate Ukrainian citizens to ensure there is no potential for a resistance movement in the land bridge from Russia through Donbas to Crimea.\n\nBERGEN: How would you characterize the state of the war in the east and the south right now? Are the Russians, in their own minds, winning?\n\nREPASS: The state of play today is Russia is making methodical advances both in the north and the south. It’s trying to fix forces defending in the east and envelop the Ukrainian defenders, then defeat them in the south. The Russians also want to encircle Mykolaiv, reduce the defense and destroy the defenders, and then have a free run at Odesa. They can’t get to Odesa until they either envelop or destroy the forces around Mikolaiv.\n\nBERGEN: And Odesa is the prize because?\n\nREPASS: Because that completes the cutoff of Ukraine from the Black Sea, and it’s also the gateway to Transnistria and Moldova.\n\nBERGEN: What did you make of the comments by the Russian general about going on to Moldova? Do you take them at face value?\n\nREPASS: I do take it as a serious threat, and I do think they have their eyes on Moldova. If they can take it, they will. To be specific, they talk about going to Transnistria. If they can build a southern land bridge to Transnistria, they will do it. That will put Russia on Moldova’s doorstep and Moldova won’t be able to effectively defend against a Russian invasion.\n\nBERGEN: Is the Ukraine war widening?\n\nREPASS: It’s a fact that Belarus has been a haven for Russia since the start of the war on February 24. It’s an article of faith with the Europeans that I’ve talked to that Belarus is a client state and is controlled and essentially ruled by Moscow. Belarus has not contributed military units to the fight, but they’ve housed, based and supported Russia forces. They’ve allowed them to launch operations from their territory – both ground, air, and precision strike missiles have been launched from there.\n\nPutin’s officials have also said that the Baltic have no historical basis and they’re illegitimate states – the same thing they said about Ukraine before the war. The three Baltic states, and Poland, firmly believe that after Ukraine that they’re next on Russia’s hit list. They see Russia as an existential threat. And there’s no evidence that Putin is willing to stop at Ukraine.\n\nBERGEN: What about all this nuclear saber-rattling? Do you think it’s just mostly posturing?\n\nREPASS: Yes, I think it’s mostly posturing. It would be one thing if Putin said it. To have Foreign Minister Lavrov say it is another thing. I think it’s posturing if it comes from Lavrov. On their nuclear doctrine, they will use so-called tactical nuclear weapons if they feel that there’s a significant threat to the Russian homeland. Those are the kind of circumstances that Russia has communicated to the West where they would use their nuclear weapons.\n\nBERGEN: So, it’s a high threshold.\n\nREPASS: Right.\n\nBERGEN: As a result of the sinking in mid-April of the Moskva, the Russian missile cruiser serving as the Black Sea Fleet flagship, do you think that the Chinese are looking at this and doing a little bit of soul-searching about whether attacking Taiwan would be wise?\n\nREPASS: Yes, I do. Not only the sinking of the Moskva, but also the ability of a well-trained solid opposition to halt an invasion. Russia is getting very heavily degraded by a numerically inferior force, and they don’t have a water bridge to cross. They’re crossing Ukraine by land, while the Chinese would have to cross 100 miles of water to get to Taiwan. So, they must be thinking that this is going to be a lot harder than expected.\n\nBERGEN: If you’re Putin today, how are you feeling?\n\nREPASS: Probably better than the day after the Moskva was sunk. I think he’s probably feeling conflicted and confused but realizes that he has to press forward to get a victory here. And he’s held captive by a beast of his own creation in that he rarely uses the internet himself. You’ve never seen him at a computer, and, at least as of late 2020, he reportedly didn’t have an iPhone.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.

So he’s in a North Korean-like echo chamber and he is not getting accurate information.\n\nBERGEN: Starting a war, that’s often the easy part. Wars have their own logic. Unfortunately, this war might go on for a year or even two years.\n\nREPASS: I fear that you’re right. This will be a grinding, agonizing war if it lasts more than a year, and I think it’s going to last at least two years. But we can’t let it get into a stalemate. If it gets into a stalemate, Putin’s going to claim success followed by a brutal occupation of the Ukrainian territory that he controls.", "authors": ["Peter Bergen"], "publish_date": "2022/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/18/asia/wang-jixian-chinese-vlogger-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "A Chinese vlogger shared videos of war-torn Ukraine.

The 36-year-old resident of Odesa, a key target in Russia’s invasion of the country, simply wanted to show his parents he was fine.\n\n“I’m coming back from buying groceries,” he said in a video posted to Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, on February 24, the first day of the invasion. Wang, a programmer originally from Beijing, described buying meat and fruit in the video, remarking that some food stores were still open.\n\nBut his mood darkened as the days passed and the Russian assault escalated. When he logged onto Douyin, he said he would see Chinese videos praising Russian troops or supporting the invasion.\n\n“I was very angry, then I thought I would record videos for them, and I’ll tell them what the real battlefield is,” he told CNN.\n\nHis daily videos, posted across various platforms including YouTube and the Chinese messaging app WeChat, quickly gained traction as a rare voice offering Chinese audiences a glimpse into war-torn Ukraine – a stark contrast from Chinese state media, which has promoted Russian disinformation such as unfounded claims Ukrainian soldiers are using “Nazi” tactics.\n\nWang Jixian holding his Chinese passport in a video posted to Douyin, China's version of TikTok. Courtesy Wang Jixian\n\nIn one widely-watched video, Wang held up his Chinese passport and said, “These Ukrainian guards are not Nazis, they are IT programmers, common people, barbers – these are the people.”\n\nBut in doing so, he had waded into the middle of a messy controversy, with China facing international pressure as it refuses to condemn Russia’s invasion, and an outpouring of pro-Russia sentiment on China’s highly restricted and censored social media – something Wang is hoping to change.\n\nBacklash of critics\n\nWang had studied art in college, and enjoyed dance, music and painting – so when he moved to Odesa four years ago for work, the city’s “artistic atmosphere” immediately appealed to him. One video on his Douyin account last year showed a man playing piano in a colorful room filled with books and paintings.\n\nHis videos look very different now. Several are filmed late at night, with the sound of explosions and air raid sirens in the background. Other clips show snapshots of daily life – quiet streets, Ukrainian flags hung outside buildings and painted onto walls.\n\n“Are those air raid alarms? Those bastards are coming again,” he said in one video. “People are doing their own business, my neighbor is out walking his dog again. This is our Odesa.”\n\nOther times, he’s more impassioned. “Someone told me nowadays, society has the laws of the jungle, where power comes from the barrel of a gun,” he said, referencing a famous quote by Communist leader Mao Zedong. “Where is the sense in that?”\n\nAs these videos began garnering attention, sometimes racking up more than 140,000 views, the number of critics rose too, with comments calling him a national traitor.\n\n“You don’t need this Chinese passport anymore, you have already forgotten which country you are from,” one popular comment on Douyin read. “The official position of the country should be the position of all Chinese people.”\n\nChina has tried to stake out a neutral position, choosing not to condemn Russia or even call it an invasion while frequently saying “all countries’ legitimate security concerns” should be addressed.\n\nIn a call with US President Joe Biden on Friday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said both countries have a responsibility for ensuring peace. But the White House said afterward it was still concerned China could provide Russia assistance.\n\n“I don’t understand how I ‘betrayed’ the country,” Wang told CNN. With limited access to news broadcasts and widespread online misinformation, he said he doesn’t understand China’s or Russia’s position – all he knew was that “every day the city is under fire, many were killed.”\n\nThe comments of anonymous online strangers don’t bother him – but they do when it’s from people he cares about, such as a Chinese Embassy staff member he knew from his previous residence in North Macedonia.\n\nHe said the staffer reached out to him recently, insinuating Wang was being paid to post his videos, and asking: “Who sent you?” When Wang insisted he wasn’t doing it for money, the staffer replied: “Your current behavior is not in line with national interests. I want to cut off relations with you, let’s block each other.”\n\nThat “really hurt my heart,” Wang said.\n\nDetermined to stay\n\nChinese censors have also cracked down on his videos online, he said. While all his videos have stayed up on YouTube, which is blocked in China except for those with VPNs, only about 80% of his videos have been left on WeChat, and fewer than 20% on Douyin.\n\nHe doesn’t know what rules he has broken. He got so frustrated that in one video on March 7, he stuck black tape in an X over his mouth, silently gesturing to the camera to convey that he was safe and still in Odesa.\n\nAfter speaking with CNN, his Chinese social media accounts were banned, leaving him unable to contact his family back home.\n\nHe has received “countless” messages from contacts, placing pressure on him to stop posting, he said. But he has no intention of doing so.\n\n“I want to (provide) some voice for the people in Ukraine, for the heroes, for my neighbors. Because in my eyes they are all heroes,” he said. “I see people being calm, I see people brave … I want to remind you to see who is dying, who has been killed.”\n\nThere are signs his message may be landing. Under his videos, hate comments are interspersed with well wishes from viewers, urging him to stay safe and evacuate. A handful of comments express support for Ukraine.\n\nBut for now, Wang has no intention of leaving – not until “Odesa is too destroyed for humans to stay,” he said.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nIt’s been little more than a week since Chinese leader Xi Jinping began his norm-breaking third term in power with a ringing endorsement of his relentless zero-Covid policy.\n\nBut the commitment to stick with it is already fueling scenes of chaos and misery across the country.\n\nIn the northwestern city of Xining, residents spent last week pleading desperately for food as they suffered through the latest of the country’s stringent lockdowns; to the west, in Lhasa, the regional capital of Tibet, angry crowds have been protesting in the streets after more than 70 days of stay-home orders.\n\nIn the central province of Henan, migrant workers have abandoned a locked-down Foxconn factory en masse, walking for miles to escape an outbreak at China’s largest iPhone assembling site. And, in the eastern financial hub of Shanghai, things are gloomy even at Disneyland – the park abruptly shut its gates on Monday to comply with Covid prevention measures, trapping visitors inside for compulsory testing.\n\nIn many other parts of the country, lockdowns, mandatory quarantines, incessant mass testing edicts and travel restrictions continue to cripple businesses and daily life, even as the rest of the world moves on from the pandemic.\n\nA woman wearing a face mask walks past a mural depicting epidemic control workers in protective suits in Beijing, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022. Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\nRenewed zeal\n\nRather than relax Covid restrictions – as some had hoped for in the lead-up to the Communist Party’s five-yearly leadership reshuffle, Chinese authorities have ramped them up after Xi’s sweeping endorsement of the strategy.\n\n“The 20th Party Congress didn’t provide a timetable for moving away from zero-Covid. Instead it highlighted the importance of sticking to the existing approach,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.\n\nThe congress reinforced Xi as an unrivaled supreme leader, and saw him stack the Communist Party’s top ranks with staunch allies – including those who had loyally carried out his Covid policies.\n\n“The new political ecology also provided more incentive for local governments to impose more draconian Covid control measures,” Huang said.\n\nA renewed zeal for the policy can be seen most clearly in smaller cities. While metropolises like Beijing and Shanghai can draw on their experiences of major flareups to implement more targeted lockdown measures, smaller cities with no such know-how tend to pursue zero-Covid goals in a more aggressive and extensive manner, Huang said.\n\n‘It’s simply not working’\n\nThe repeating cycle of lockdowns, quarantines and mass testing is taking a heavy toll on the economy and society. Public patience is wearing thin, and frustrations are building.\n\nOn Monday in Baoding city, Hebei province, a father wielding a knife drove through a Covid checkpoint in a desperate bid to buy milk powder for his son. Video footage of the scene and his subsequent arrest sparked uproar online; the following day local police tried to soothe tempers by saying the man had been fined only 100 yuan ($13.75) and that his child’s “milk powder problem” had been “properly resolved.”\n\nOn Tuesday, the death of a 3-year-old in Lanzhou, Gansu province, sparked another outcry, after the child’s family said lockdown measures had delayed emergency responders. Police said later the child had stopped breathing by the time officers arrived, but did not address the family’s accusations that an ambulance had been delayed. CNN has reached out to Lanzhou authorities for comment.\n\nIn another sign of how sensitive the issue has become, Chinese stocks rallied on Wednesday following unverified social media rumors that China was forming a committee to prepare an exit from the zero-Covid policy.\n\nThose rumors were quashed, however, when the Foreign Ministry said it was “unaware” of any such plan.\n\nMeanwhile, experts say they see no signs of the Chinese government taking steps that would suggest it is rethinking its approach.\n\nChinese health officials maintain that changing tack now would risk a huge surge in infections and deaths that could overwhelm the country’s fragile health care system.\n\nBeijing has so far refused to approve for use the mRNA vaccines developed in Western countries, which have been shown to be more potent than those made and used in China. Experts say China also lacks an emergency response plan to cope with surging infections.\n\nBut Jin Dongyan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, said such catastrophic scenarios could be avoided with proper preparation.\n\nInstead of spending vast amounts of time and resources on testing, contact tracing, quarantining and imposing lockdowns, authorities should introduce more effective vaccines and antiviral therapies and boost the vaccination rate among the elderly, Jin said.\n\nWith boosted immunity, asymptomatic or mild cases could be allowed to recover at home – freeing up space at hospitals to treat more severe cases, he said.\n\n“Using lockdown and containment measures to deal with an infectious disease with such a low mortality rate and high transmissibility is no longer appropriate. The whole world has abandoned this approach – nobody can stand the cost, it’s simply not working,” he said.\n\nFear of the virus\n\nAnother hurdle to pivoting from zero-Covid is a pervasive fear of the virus among large swaths of the public, instilled by the Chinese government to justify its harsh control measures, experts say.\n\n“Authorities have demonized Covid, exaggerating its severity and mortality rate and talking up long-Covid symptoms. Many ordinary people are still very afraid of the virus, with recovered Covid patients suffering from severe discrimination and stigmatization,” Jin said.\n\nIt was partly such fears that drove thousands of migrant workers to flee in panic from the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou, he said.\n\nVideos of people traveling on foot, dragging their luggage on roads and across fields, went viral on Chinese social media over the weekend. Zhengzhou, a city of 12 million, imposed sweeping lockdown measures last month after identifying dozens of Covid-19 cases.\n\nThe Foxconn facility has been racing to control an outbreak since mid-October, though the company has not disclosed the number of infections among its workers. On Wednesday, the Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone, where the Foxconn plant is located, announced new lockdown measures.\n\nAs the Foxconn exodus thrust the Zhengzhou outbreak into the spotlight, the city’s health authorities have tried to allay public fears. On Monday, the Zhengzhou municipal health commission published a WeChat article with the headline: “Covid is not that horrible, but preventable and treatable.”\n\nHuang, the expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said misconceptions about the virus would complicate matters if China did at some point decide to move away from zero Covid.\n\n“Even if in the future, China wants to change the narrative and play down the seriousness of the disease, some people might not buy into the new narrative,” he said.\n\nAs the winter approaches, experts warn that China could be hit by a new wave of infections – and a new cycle of draconian lockdowns.\n\nChina reported 2,755 local infections for Tuesday, the highest daily tally since August.\n\n“Judging from the situation in China, there will be a major outbreak sooner or later. China has deployed tremendous efforts and paid a heavy cost to prevent that from happening, but in the end, it won’t be able to stop such a highly infectious disease from spreading,” Jin said.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/business/covid-china-iphone-shanghai-disneyland-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "From Apple to Disney, China's Covid curbs are again hurting business", "text": "New Delhi CNN Business —\n\nIt has been almost three years since Covid-19 first hit China, but the country’s relentless adherence to lockdowns continues to hobble business and the economy.\n\nTop global and Chinese companies, from carmakers to tech giants, have experienced huge disruptions to their business in recent days as the world’s second-largest economy doubles down on its zero-Covid approach after Xi Jinping began his third term in power with a ringing endorsement of the policy.\n\nOn Wednesday, authorities imposed a seven-day lockdown of the area that houses China’s biggest iPhone assembly factory, in the central city of Zhengzhou.\n\nRun by Foxconn, one of Apple’s (AAPL) largest suppliers, the facility has been grappling since mid-October with a Covid outbreak that has caused panic among its migrant workers.\n\nVideos of people leaving Zhengzhou on foot have gone viral on Chinese social media in recent days.

While the video did not identify the company, it said that 75 workers were living in 3,230 square feet of space.\n\nIn the footage, posted on Chinese social platform Weixin earlier this month, employees slept on air mattresses scattered around the office. One man washed his face in the bathroom sink.\n\nShowers were “a problem,” one worker said in the video, adding that the team initially had to boil hot water to wash up before a shower facility was eventually installed.\n\n“It feels like going back to the dorms at university.”\n\nWhen it came time to sleep, they faced other problems. The employee in the video complained that the marble floor was hard and uncomfortable, even with sleeping bags.\n\nThey bring daily necessities and call the company home.

We couldn’t sleep until 2 to 3 a.m.,” she said.\n\nSome colleagues also snored, so “we decided to send them to a meeting room,” she added. “So they sleep together in that room.”\n\nThe video did not specify why the workers were in lockdown prior to the citywide restrictions.\n\nA folding bed set up between desks at a firm in Shanghai. Foresight Fund\n\nBut China has a practice of imposing “snap” lockdowns across the country, sometimes shutting down entire office buildings with people still inside, even if just a single Covid-19 case is detected. Those workers are often also provided bedding and other necessities.\n\nLast year, Shanghai Disneyland became a prominent example of such stringent measures, with tens of thousands of visitors and staff forced to undergo coronavirus testing after authorities said that one visitor had tested positive.\n\nDespite the latest clampdown, businesses in Shanghai are not deterred.\n\nThis week, the Shanghai Stock Exchange said it would offer online services for companies to continue to hold listing ceremonies, roadshows and shareholder meetings.

Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi CNN —\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu is set to resurrect his political career and make an astonishing comeback as prime minister of Israel.\n\nPartial election results on Wednesday showed that the Likud party leader’s bloc was set to win a comfortable majority of 65 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament, in an election that saw a seven-year high turnout.\n\nHaving been sidelined by much of the country’s political mainstream, Netanyahu was given a lifeline by the rise of a far-right party, some of whose leaders are arguably extremists.\n\nNetanyahu is now likely to lead an ever-polarized country and possibly one of the most right-wing governments in Israel’s history.\n\nAnd after five elections in four years, this government might just stick, says Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute.\n\nCNN spoke to Plesner about what a Netanyahu return could mean for the country.\n\nWhat do you make of the exit polls and partial election results? Could Netanyahu make a comeback in Israel?\n\nJudging by the actual results and all the exit polls, Netanyahu is undoubtedly Israel’s next prime minister. He single-handedly brought out his base on election day at higher percentages than we saw in previous rounds, and while in the end many of them ended up voting for his allies on the right and not for his Likud party, this is what made the difference and was able to break the stalemate of the past four years.\n\nIf the numbers we are seeing hold true, Netanyahu will have a governing coalition of between 62 and 65 seats, depending on whether some of the smaller parties pass the minimal threshold, consisting of his Likud party and its ultra-Orthodox and extreme-right allies.\n\nHow likely would a Netanyahu-led government be to include far-right parties, and what would the implications of their inclusion be?\n\nIt is very unlikely that Netanyahu will renege on his central campaign promise to include all members of his bloc in his government – including [Jewish Power leader Itamar] Ben Gvir and his partner from the Religious Zionist Party Bezalel Smotrich.\n\nOver his 15 years as prime minister, Netanyahu has proven to be a cautious leader on diplomatic and security matters. While some in the international community have criticized his refusal to make significant concessions to the Palestinians to advance a peace process, he has traditionally also been reluctant to change the status quo in the West Bank in favor of his allies in the settlement movement and often hesitated before committing the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to major military operations.\n\nThis cautious approach is not expected to change. The question will be if Ben Gvir – who has a history of provocative actions against Arab Israelis and Palestinians – can be trusted to moderate now that he will be in office and not ignite fires that Netanyahu will be forced to put out.\n\nOne particular area to focus on is the Temple Mount complex [Al Haram Al Sharif] in Jerusalem which is holy to both Muslims and Jews. Since Israel took control of the area from Jordan in 1967 an uneasy status quo has ensured that Jews are allowed to visit but not pray at this site. Ben Gvir and his allies have been advocating for years to change this policy. A conflict ignited there could quickly spread throughout Israel and even further in the region.\n\nWhat would Netanyahu’s return mean for his trial, and what would it mean for Israel’s judicial system?\n\nDuring the campaign, Netanyahu’s allies in the Religious Zionist Party, as well as key members of his Likud party, explicitly ran on the platform of overhauling the judicial system. Motivated by ideology, they proposed to politicize the judiciary by ensuring that judges and legal advisers are appointed by and beholden to political leaders, as well as weaken the checks and balances that exist between the branches of government by instituting an “override clause” that would allow the Knesset to overrule Supreme Court decisions. For Netanyahu, such reforms could serve as an escape hatch from his ongoing criminal trials, where he is facing corruption charges, but more importantly, it would also fundamentally alter the existing constitutional order that serves as the foundation for Israeli democracy.\n\nThis election registered the highest voter turnout since 2015. What does that say?\n\nDespite its many challenges, Israelis have proven how committed they are to their democracy. While we do not yet have all the data about turnout, it appears that in this election both Arab Israelis and members of the ultra-Orthodox community were particularly motived to vote.\n\nAhead of the election there were concerns that low turnout in Arab Israeli localities could lead to only one of their three parties crossing the electoral threshold. This seemed to have led to an increase in their turnout. Nevertheless, due to overall high turnout, their representation in the Knesset will probably remain at around 10 seats – the same as in the outgoing parliament.\n\nFor the ultra-Orthodox, the fact that this [the outgoing government] was the first governing coalition they were excluded from since 2015 seems to have motivated their voters to turn out at much higher rates than expected. If the results we are seeing hold true, the ultra-Orthodox parties will play an outsized role in Netanyahu’s coalition.\n\nIf Netanyahu does form a government, how likely is Israel to return to elections in the near future?\n\nWhile instability has plagued the Israeli political system for decades, Netanyahu’s significant victory and the homogeneous nature of what is likely to be the next government, could ensure that it serves close to a full term.\n\nWhen the final results are tabulated, if the Netanyahu bloc stands at more than 62 seats, it will take more than one or two disgruntled members of parliament to dismantle it. This means that only in the case of a significant policy disagreement between the coalition partners can we expect this new government to fall. Thus, these elections seem to mark the end of the current crisis that has characterized Israel over the past four years.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIran protests\n\nIran indicted about 1,000 people in Tehran province for their alleged involvement in nationwide protests sparked by Mahsa Amini’s death in police custody, state-news IRNA said on Monday.\n\nPeople who “have serious accusations, including assaulting or martyring security guards, and setting fire to public property… have been scheduled in Revolutionary Court” Ali Al-Qasi Mehr, chief justice of Tehran province said, according to IRNA.\n\nThe trials of those accused will be heard in public this week, IRNA said, citing Mehr.\n\nHere’s the latest:\n\nDissident Iranian rapper Toomaj Salehi, known for anti-regime lyrics, was arrested on Sunday, according to state-run IRNA. He was charged with “propagandistic activity against the government, cooperation with hostile governments and forming illegal groups with the intention of creating insecurity in the country.”\n\nThe European Union is considering “further steps” against Iran, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday, after the bloc announced sanctions on Iran’s morality police earlier in October.\n\nIranian police said Tuesday they will investigate an incident caught on camera showing security forces attacking a man, Fars News Agency said. In the video, security personnel are seen beating a man lying on the ground in front of a residential building. One officer points his gun at him and shoots.\n\nThe digest\n\nIran prepares to send additional weapons including ballistic missiles to Russia, western officials say\n\nIran is preparing to send approximately 1,000 additional weapons, including surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missiles and more attack drones, to Russia to use in its war against Ukraine, officials from a Western country that closely monitors Iran’s weapons program told CNN. While the precise timing of when the shipment will arrive in Russia is unclear, officials believe the weapons will definitely be delivered before the end of the year.\n\nBackground: Russia’s use of drones in Ukraine increased in the summer, when the United States and Kyiv say Moscow acquired the aircraft from Iran. In recent weeks Iranian drones have targeted critical energy infrastructure in Ukraine. The last shipment of weapons from Iran to Russia included about 450 drones, officials said.\n\nWhy it matters: The shipment would mark a significant increase in Iranian support to Russia’s war effort. It would be the first instance of Iran sending advanced precision-guided missiles to Russia, which could give the Kremlin a substantial boost on the battlefield.\n\nUS, Saudi Arabia concerned Iran may be planning an attack on Middle East energy infrastructure\n\nThe US and Saudi Arabia have shared intelligence with each other that indicates that Iran may be planning an imminent attack on energy infrastructure in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia, a US official told CNN. A Saudi official told CNN that Riyadh shared intelligence of a possible attack with the US but the source did not give any specifics. A second US official said US F-22 fighter jets are already in Saudi Arabia and available to counter any threats.\n\nBackground: Iran is facing over a month of unrest that started after the death of Amini, a 22-year-old woman, in police custody. The Islamic Republic has repeatedly accused Saudi Arabia of supporting the protesters through its media channels, warning it of consequences.\n\nWhy it matters: Saudi Arabia faced a major attack on its oil facilities in 2019 that cut half the country’s oil production and jolted the global crude market. The US blamed Iran for that attack. The Iran-allied Houthi group in Yemen has also threatened to strike Saudi Arabia of late.\n\nClimate activist Greta Thunberg not attending ‘greenwashing’ COP27 summit in Egypt\n\nTeenage climate activist Greta Thunberg said she will not be attending the COP27 climate summit in Egypt, criticizing the event as “greenwashing.” “The COPs are mainly being used as an opportunity for leaders and people in power to get attention when they say ‘were going to change’ and using many different kinds of greenwashing, lying and cheating and so on,” Thunberg said at an event launching her new book titled ‘The Climate Book’ at London’s Southbank Centre on Sunday.\n\nBackground: The COP27 United Nations climate talks will be held in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh from November 6 to 18. Egypt’s COP27 presidency has said protests will be allowed in designated areas in Sharm el-Sheikh during the summit, but campaigners have expressed concern that their voices will be curbed.\n\nWhy it matters: Egypt has come under criticism for its climate record as well as its crackdown on protesters. Security forces in the country arrested nearly 70 people in connection with calls for protests to coincide with COP27, a rights group said on Tuesday, Reuters reported. They also briefly detained an Indian activist after he set off on a protest march from Cairo.\n\nWhat to watch\n\nThe United Arab Emirates and the US have signed a partnership to spur $100 billion of investments in clean energy projects and add 100 gigawatts of clean energy globally by 2035, state news agency WAM reported on Tuesday. The two countries would provide technical, project management and funding assistance for commercially and environmentally sustainable energy projects in other countries.\n\nThe agreement comes as the Biden administration tries to transition the US away from fossil fuels and towards cleaner energy amid an oil price rise that has seen inflation soaring.\n\nCNN’s Becky Anderson spoke to Robin Mills, CEO of Qamar Energy, about the deal. Watch the interview here:\n\nThe U.S. and the UAE have signed an agreement worth $100 billion into clean energy globally. I caught up with @qamarenergy CEO @robinenergy to break down what this deal means for the region and its global significance: pic.twitter.com/1YsJycDTNK — Becky Anderson (@BeckyCNN) November 1, 2022\n\nWhat’s trending\n\nSaudi Arabia: #Artificial_Stupidity\n\nSaudi Twitter users have been ridiculing an artificial intelligence prediction that Qatar and Saudi Arabia will face off in the final football World Cup match in Qatar. Users mocked the prediction as “artificial stupidity,” noting that Saudi Arabia hasn’t even reached the quarterfinals previously. Qatar has never qualified for the World Cup before but will be participating this year as the host nation for the tournament.\n\nJordan: #Jordan_is_not_okay\n\nJordanians on social media reacted with anger at the government’s plans to raise the price of diesel and kerosene for November as the price of crude on international markets rose. Jordanians took to Twitter to complain about the rise at the onset of winter. Temperatures in winter can drop to low single digits in cities in Celsius.\n\nKuwait: #Postponement_of_pardon\n\nTwitter users in Kuwait were reacting to reports that members of parliament had postponed the proposal of a general amnesty law for those charged with defying restrictions on freedom of expression and lese majeste in the country. Kuwaiti activists have been demanding that the government turn the page and pardon people in cases going as far back as 2012 that have landed them in jail or had them go into exile.\n\n$42.4 billion\n\nThe third quarter profit of Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s oil company. The company posted a 39% rise in profit compared to the same period last year, driven by high oil prices. Aramco said its long-term view is that oil demand will continue to grow for the rest of the decade “given the world’s need for more affordable and reliable energy,” Reuters reported.\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Abbas Al Lawati"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/05/middleeast/egypt-protests-crackdown-cop27-intl/index.html", "title": "Egypt faces criticism over crackdown on activists ahead of COP27 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nEgypt is facing a barrage of criticism over what rights groups say is a crackdown on protests and activists, as it prepares to host the COP27 climate summit starting Sunday.\n\nRights groups have accused the Egyptian government of arbitrarily detaining activists after Egyptian dissidents abroad called for protests to be held against President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on November 11, during the United Nations climate talks.\n\nAccording to rights groups, security forces have been setting up checkpoints on Cairo streets, stopping people and searching their phones to find any content related to the planned protests.\n\nThe Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF), an NGO, said Wednesday that 93 people had been arrested in Egypt in recent days. It said that according to national security prosecution investigations, some of those arrested have allegedly sent videos calling for protests over social messaging apps. Some were also charged with abuse of social media, spreading false news and joining terrorist organizations – a repressive charge commonly used by the security apparatus against activists.\n\nIndian climate activist Ajit Rajagopal was detained in Cairo last Sunday after setting off on a protest walk from the Egyptian capital to Sharm el-Sheikh, the Red Sea resort where the COP27 conference will be held from November 6 to 18. Rajagopal was released after a brief detention in Cairo along with his friend, lawyer Makarios Lahzy, a Facebook post by Lahzy said. Reuters, which spoke to Rajagopal following his release Monday, cited the Indian activist as saying he was still trying to get accredited for COP27 but did not plan to resume his march.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Egyptian authorities for comment.\n\nEgypt went through two mass uprisings in 2011 and 2013 which eventually paved the way for then-military chief Sisi to take power. Thousands of activists have since been jailed, spaces for public expression have been quashed and press freedom diminished.\n\nWhile protests are rare – and mostly illegal – in Egypt, a looming economic crisis and a brutal security regime have spurred renewed calls for demonstrations by dissidents seeking to exploit a rare window of opportunity presented by the climate summit.\n\nOne jailed activist, British-Egyptian citizen Alaa Abdelfattah, escalated his hunger strike in an Egyptian prison this week, amid warnings by relatives over his deteriorating health. “Alaa has been on hunger strike for 200 days, he’s been surviving on only 100 calories of liquid a day,” said Sanaa Seif, Abdelfattah’s sister, who is staging a sit-in outside the UK Foreign Office in London.\n\nA place for dialogue\n\nCOP, the annual UN-sponsored climate summit that brings together the signatories of the Paris Agreement on combating climate change, is traditionally a place where representatives of civil society have an opportunity to mingle with experts and policy makers and observe negotiations firsthand.\n\nIt is not uncommon to see a young activist approaching a national delegation walking down the corridor to their next meeting or an indigenous leader chatting to a minister on the sidelines of a debate.\n\nAnd while security is always strict – this is, after all, a gathering attended by dozens of heads of states and governments – peaceful protests have always been part of COP. Tens of thousands of people marched through the streets of last year’s host city of Glasgow, Scotland, during the summit.\n\nYet Egypt has tightened the rules on who can access the talks.\n\nAs in the past, this year’s COP conference will take place across two different sites. The official part of the summit is run by the UN and is only accessible to accredited people, including the official delegations, representatives of NGOs and other civil society groups, experts, journalists and other observers.\n\nThen there is a separate public venue where climate exhibitions and events take place throughout the two weeks of the summit. But while this public part of the summit was in the past open to anyone, people wishing to attend this year will need to register ahead of time.\n\nThe chance to protest will also be restricted.\n\nWhile the Egyptian government has pledged to allow demonstrations, it has said protests will have to take place in a special “protest zone,” a dedicated space away from the main conference site, and will have to be announced in advance. Guidelines published on the official COP website say that any other marches would need to be specially approved.\n\nAnyone wanting to organize a protest will need to be registered for the public part of the conference – a requirement that may scare off activists fearing surveillance. Among the rules imposed by the Egyptian authorities on the protests is a ban on the use of “impersonated objects, such as satirical drawings of Heads of States, negotiators, individuals.”\n\nRights groups sound alarm\n\nThe UN has urged Egypt to ensure the public has a say at the conference.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said it was “essential that everyone – including civil society representatives – is able to participate meaningfully at the COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh” and that decisions about climate change need to be “transparent, inclusive and accountable.”\n\nSeparately, a group of five independent human rights experts, all of them UN special rapporteurs, published a statement last month expressing alarm over restrictions ahead of the summit. They said the Egyptian government had placed strict limits on who can participate in the talks and how, and said that “a wave of government restrictions on participation raised fears of reprisals against activists.”\n\n“This new wave follows years of persistent and sustained crackdowns on civil society and human rights defenders using security as a pretext to undermine the legitimate rights of civil society to participate in public affairs in Egypt,” the group said in a statement.\n\nA group of Egyptian civil rights groups has launched a petition calling for the Egyptian authorities to end the prosecutions of civil society activists and organizations and end restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.\n\n“The Egyptian authorities have for years employed draconian laws, including laws on counter terrorism, cyber crimes, and civil society, to stifle all forms of peaceful dissent and shut down civic space,” the groups said in the petition.\n\nHuman Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Friends of the Earth and scores of other groups have also spoken up, demanding the release of detained activists.\n\nIn the lead-up to the climate conference, the Egyptian government presented an initiative pardoning prisoners jailed for their political activity. Authorities also pointed to a new prison, Badr-3, 70 kilometers (43 miles) northeast of Cairo, where other prisoners were moved to purportedly better conditions.\n\nBut rights groups said the government’s initiatives amounted to little change.\n\n“Ahead of COP27, Egypt’s PR machine is operating on all cylinders to conceal the awful reality in the country’s jails, where prisoners held for political reasons are languishing in horrific conditions violating the absolute prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general.\n\n“Prisoners are facing the same human rights violations that have repeatedly blighted older institutions, exposing the lack of a political will from the Egyptian authorities to bring an end to the human rights crisis in the country.”", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/17/politics/biden-major-economies-forum-climate/index.html", "title": "Biden announces new initiatives to curb methane during ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Friday convened a meeting of more than 20 of the world’s largest economies to discuss steps to curb methane emissions to address the climate crisis as well as efforts to stabilize global energy markets amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAt the US-hosted Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate, the President argued Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war has “sharpened the need to achieve long-term reliable energy security and stability,” and fueled a “global energy crisis.”\n\nBiden on Friday announced the US and European Union have launched the next step of their global methane pledge to reduce emissions of the planet-warming gas by 30% by 2030. The so-called energy pathway will focus on eliminating routine flaring in fossil fuel operations – the burning of natural gas that happens in oil extractions – and focus on ways to cut methane pollution in the oil and gas sector.\n\n“Each year our existing energy system leaks enough methane to meet the needs for the entire European power sector. We flare enough gas to offset nearly all of the EU’s gas imports from Russia. So by stopping the leaking and flaring of the super potent greenhouse gas and capturing this resource for countries that need it, we’re addressing two problems at once,” Biden said, speaking virtually with the other leaders from the White House.\n\nBiden on Friday also announced a new global initiative focused on raising $90 billion to develop and scale new clean technologies to decarbonize. The US will devote $21.5 billion to this effort, with funds already passed in Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law.\n\nThe President said the new initiatives – which do not require congressional approval – were part of the US’ overall efforts to bolster energy security, reduce dependence on Russian gas, bring down gas and energy prices and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n“A critical point is that these actions are part of our transition to a clean and secure long-term energy future. And the good news is climate security and energy security go hand in hand,” Biden said.\n\nThe meeting comes as the bulk of President’s sweeping climate agenda remains stalled in Congress, leaving Biden without any major domestic climate policies to present to other world leaders. It also comes as the President acknowledges there is little he can do to immediately bring down the price of gas in the US, which recently hit $5 a gallon on average nationwide for the first time ever.\n\nFriday’s meeting was the largest climate meeting of world leaders in the run-up to the United Nations climate summit, COP27, in November. Twenty-three of the world’s largest economies were represented at the virtual meeting, as well as other countries participating in climate pledges. Several foreign nations were also expected to announce strengthened climate targets in line with the Paris agreement.\n\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gas that’s around 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in the short term. Climate scientists say reducing methane emissions is a necessary but easy way to begin turning down the dial on the climate crisis.\n\nThe President invited other countries to join his previously announced domestic goal that by 2030, half of vehicles sold in the US will be battery electric, fuel-cell electric or plug-in hybrid. Biden’s zero-emissions vehicles target is not binding and some other countries are moving more aggressively on it. For instance, the European Union is considering its own more stringent standards to ban the sale of new combustion engine cars by 2035.\n\nCountries participating in Friday’s meeting include China, Australia, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Egypt – which will host COP27 in November.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping did not attend the meeting; China instead was represented by its climate envoy Xie Zhenhua, officials said.\n\nA senior administration official said Zhenhua and US Climate Envoy John Kerry have met multiple times in the last month and continued work on the agreement the two countries announced at COP26 in Glasgow last year is “intensifying” and a “top priority.”\n\n“We are committed to working with them on topics like their plan to address methane emissions in China for the first time,” that official said. “We’re also of course engaging on other topics including the energy transition and illegal deforestation in China.”\n\nThe US faces a steep path to hitting its own emissions target\n\nAs promising as Biden’s early goals on reducing US greenhouse gas emissions were, progress on achieving them has been mixed, independent analysis shows.\n\nAfter rejoining the Paris accord after taking office, Biden announced a goal to slash US emissions in half from 2005 levels – a record-high year for planet-warming emissions – by 2030.\n\nIn order to do that, the nonpartisan research firm Rhodium Group found that three major things would have to happen: Biden would have to pass massive investments in clean energy through Congress, enact several ambitious federal regulations cutting emissions from things like vehicles, power plants and industry, and states would have to make significant progress.\n\nOn Thursday, Rhodium released a progress report showing little progress has been made, and the window to act is rapidly closing.\n\nRhodium Group partner John Larsen told CNN that the things Biden has able to get done so far – including passing his bipartisan infrastructure bill and getting through some government regulations – is still nibbling around the edges of his Paris commitment.\n\n“The big-ticket items are all either in a holding pattern or at very early stages,” Larsen told CNN.\n\nThe biggest item left undone is a climate and clean energy package passing through Congress. Talks between West Virgina Sen. Joe Manchin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on a limited spending package that likely will include clean energy tax credits are continuing – but so far it’s unclear if they will produce a deal.\n\nThe timeline to pass any such legislation is extremely narrow, as Democrats risk losing their majority in November.\n\nLarsen said Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency has several regulations either in the works or yet to start that could make a dent. But even that has roadblocks.\n\nAnother barrier to progress has been the looming Supreme Court decision on EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, which could limit the tools the administration has to cut down planet-warming gases in the electricity sector.\n\n“When [White House national climate adviser] Gina McCarthy says the federal government has all the tools to get to the target, it’s almost certainly the case that they do,” Larsen said. “But how they use these tools and how ambitious they choose to be will almost certainly be influenced by whether there’s legislation in place.”", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen Kate Sullivan", "Ella Nilsen", "Kate Sullivan"], "publish_date": "2022/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/954501/glasgow-cop26-gold-rush-where-will-delegates-stay", "title": "Glasgow's Cop26 'gold rush': where will all the delegates stay? | The ...", "text": "More than 25,000 people will descend on Glasgow when the Scottish city hosts the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (Cop26).

But for other visitors to Glasgow, the city is facing an “accommodation crisis” with “rocketing” rental costs and hotels being booked out, the Daily Record reported.\n\nLandlords in Glasgow are looking to take advantage of the influx of visitors with some asking for as much as £36,000 to rent a flat for the Cop26 fortnight, the FT said. “A single room at Smiths Hotel in Finnieston, a 15-minute walk from the venue, is being offered at £14,000 for the two weeks of the event, before dropping to just £903 for the subsequent two weeks.”\n\nThe “squeeze” on available accommodation has sent prices soaring in Glasgow, BBC Scotland reported. On Monday one room in the city was advertised for £42 per night, but during the summit it would cost £1,400 per night.\n\nFiona Hooker, of the Stop Climate Chaos Scotland campaign, said the cost and availability of accommodation was “a huge concern” for activists attending the summit. “It’s incredible that they can charge so much,” she told the BBC. “What people are looking for is a place to stay with a local person and the chance to feel part of the event.”\n\nCop26 fever spreads to Edinburgh\n\nGlasgow’s “gold rush” has now spread to Edinburgh, 40 miles east of the Cop26 host city, The Telegraph reported.

Past scandals, their own legal nightmares and treacherous politics aren’t stopping them from recreating that dream of a past glory. Trump would love to plow a similar furrow.\n\nBoth former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva and ex-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have shown that time out of power could be a springboard for unlikely political rebounds.\n\nThis may be a hopeful sign for Trump, who has leveraged the midterm elections next week as a show of his own power within the Republican Party, anointing a crop of nominees who promote his 2020 election fraud falsehoods.\n\nTrump has left no doubt that he’s itching to mount another presidential campaign – not just because he misses the spotlight. He possibly sees a new White House bid as a shield against possible indictment in several criminal probes.\n\n“I will probably have to do it again,” Trump told supporters at a rally in Texas last month, referring to the possibility of his third presidential campaign, which would be rooted in his still-high popularity in the Republican Party but could founder on his far more uncertain standing among a broader general electorate.\n\nAmerican presidents defeated after only one term have generally faded pretty fast into history. Trump would need to emulate a feat achieved only once before, by President Grover Cleveland, who lost the election of 1888 only to return to the White House after exacting revenge on President Benjamin Harrison after his victory four years later.\n\nThe art of the political comeback\n\nIsrael’s Netanyahu, one of Trump’s closest friends on the international stage, would love to get the band back together with Trump.\n\nOn Tuesday, the former prime minister, first elected in 1996 and who has dominated Israeli politics for much of the last quarter century, was on the verge of a stunning second comeback, as initial exit polls suggested he may have won a narrow majority in yet another election in a nation politically split down the middle.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback The born survivor who molded modern Israel 04:35 - Source: CNN\n\nAnd on Sunday in Brazil, Lula da Silva, who’s known as “Lula,” narrowly defeated President Jair Bolsonaro in a runoff election. While Trump probably would have preferred the opposite result since Bolsonaro is something of a protégé, the leftist former leader’s win showed that former presidents can have second acts.\n\nLula da Silva, a former two-term president of Brazil, has, like Trump, had his run-ins with legal authorities. In fact, his long and winding road to a political return detoured through a partial jail term for alleged corruption. The Supreme Court’s annulment of his sentences cleared him to run again.\n\nThere had been fears that Bolsonaro would emulate his US alter ego and fellow Covid-19 mask rejectionist by refusing to accept the result of an election that tipped him out of power after only a single term. But while he hasn’t conceded, the man known as “The Trump of the Tropics” says he’ll respect the constitution and hasn’t so far resorted to inciting an insurrection to try to keep his job. But he’s unlikely to go away: He lost the election by the narrowest of margins, his political movement is still strong – and, like Trump, he may be looking to the future.\n\nBolsonaro and Lula da Silva aren’t the only blasts from the past who’ve tried to pave a way back to power. In Italy, three-time former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is back in parliament after a tax fraud scandal, though his attempt to play kingmaker in coalition talks dissolved after he boasted about his ties with old friend Russian President Vladimir Putin, who just happens to be a hero to Trump as well.\n\nLike Lula da Silva and Bolsonaro, Trump enjoys fervent support from loyalist supporters who aren’t dissuaded by their run-ins with the law.\n\nLula da Silva emerged from jail as a hero to his followers, one-and-a-half years into a 12-year sentence for corruption and money laundering imposed in 2018.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear what Lula said after narrowly beating Bolsonaro 02:16 - Source: CNN\n\nNetanyahu, however, is still embroiled in his corruption trial and faces one charge of bribery and three charges of fraud and breach of trust in three separate investigations. He has adopted a distinctly Trumpian approach to his plight – slamming the investigations as a “witch hunt” and an “attempted coup” and, like the former US president, has raised doubts about the legitimacy of the judiciary.\n\nAs he travels the world, President Joe Biden has been telling allies that “America is back” or, in other words, that the disruptive Trump administration that alienated allies and saw the American president cozy up to dictators, is over.\n\nYet many foreign diplomats – as they observe the vitriol and division in the United States and Trump’s strength with his base, not to mention the state-level candidates he’s elevated this year who could oversee the 2024 election – wonder how long they can bank on the more traditional, multilateral brand of stable US leadership Biden is trying to restore. Even if Trump doesn’t run in 2024, the power of his movement is so strong in the GOP that a possible future Republican president would likely share his populist, nationalist, “America First” instincts.\n\nThe comeback that failed\n\nStill, the comeback trail is not always kind to populist leaders who have fallen from power. Ex-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson just saw his attempt to win back 10 Downing Street foiled after the short, but disastrous premiership of his successor Liz Truss.\n\nJohnson – once referred to as “Britain Trump” by the former US president – last month failed to persuade sufficient Conservative MPs to reelect him as their leader and, therefore under the British system, as prime minister.\n\nThe chaos, scandals and mismanagement of Johnson’s premiership featured partying in Downing Street when the rest of the country was being told to observe strict Covid-19 protocols. Conservative MPs opted instead for former Finance Minister Rishi Sunak, who has only been in power for a week but is already finding out what many observers believe to be the case – that the Conservative Party is ungovernable.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Who is Britain's next prime minister? 03:02 - Source: CNN\n\nJohnson, like Trump, isn’t ready to cede the limelight. On Tuesday, he told Sky News that he planned to attend the COP27 climate summit in Egypt later this month. He made the announcement after Sunak said he wouldn’t attend owing to the demands of salvaging the British economy. But on Wednesday, the sitting prime minister tweeted that he would indeed go to the conference – amid suggestions he didn’t want to be overshadowed by one of his predecessors.\n\nJohnson, unlike Trump, did not get defeated in a general election. Instead, his colleagues decided he was an electoral liability, which is very different from how the GOP has treated Trump.\n\nJohnson still believes he has a mandate to rule, given the landslide election win he masterminded in December 2019 – and it’s a safe bet he’d be ready to pounce if Sunak founders.\n\nJohnson’s hero is Winston Churchill, the original political comeback kid who endured years in the political wilderness before his country turned to him for leadership in its darkest hour in World War II.\n\nAfter his shock defeat in the 1945 election, the great Briton didn’t go away either: He returned to 10 Downing Street as prime minister six years later.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/957484/what-liz-truss-and-rishi-sunak-are-saying-about-climate-change", "title": "Rishi Sunak's plans to tackle climate change | The Week UK", "text": "Rishi Sunak will consider attending the Cop27 summit next month “if he has time”, according to the UK’s farming minister.\n\nThe new prime minister attracted criticism for his initial decision to reject an invitation to the gathering in Egypt “despite the UK’s role in handing over its presidency and the urgent need to combat the climate emergency”, said The Independent.\n\nBut in what would be “the first big U-turn of his premiership”, farming minister Mark Spencer said that Sunak would attend the summit, which starts on Sunday, if “he’s able to get through” his other work, the paper added.\n\nSpencer told Sky News that Sunak will go “if he has the time”, adding: “He’ll make that call and I’m sure it’ll be the right one.”\n\nThe initial rejection of the summit had “angered and upset countries around the world”, said The Guardian, as well as “raising concerns over his government’s commitment to tackling the climate crisis”.\n\nOutgoing Cop President Alok Sharma, who was recently demoted from Sunak’s Cabinet, told The Times he was “dismayed” Sunak was not planning to attend, and that it was a “missed opportunity” to show off the UK’s commitment to solving climate change.\n\nWhat has Sunak said about the climate crisis?\n\nAs chancellor, Sunak took what Politico described as a “cautious approach” to green policies.\n\nHowever, his premiership began with two significant environmental interventions. He upheld the ban on fracking, which the Financial Times said would be “welcomed by environment groups, who had accused Truss’s administration of being pro-fossil fuels”. Sunak also doubled-down on his commitment to extend the prevalence of off-shore wind farms.\n\nHe told The Telegraph in July that wind energy would be “an important part of our strategy”, but that “as prime minister, I would scrap plans to relax the ban on onshore wind in England, instead focusing on building more turbines offshore”.\n\nAt the time, Sunak said he was “committed to net zero by 2050, but that can’t mean neglecting our energy security”. His priority would be to beat the 2045 target for energy sovereignty to ensure “we’re no longer reliant on the volatility of the global energy supply”, he said.\n\nWhat else does he plan to do?\n\nThe PM has long vouched for technology in the fight against environmental catastrophe. During the summer leadership contest, Sunak outlined plans to make the UK “energy independent” by “investing in vital new technologies”.

Both sides appear to be using prisoners of war (POWs) in ways that break international law.\n\nIn May, Russia claimed to have captured almost 2,500 Ukrainian soldiers from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol who were defending the area for as long as they could. Denis Pushilin, a rebel leader in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, was quoted by Tass, Russia’s state news service, saying that Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered after fighting to defend Azovstal would face an international tribunal.\n\nBefore the surrender of Ukrainian forces in Mariupol, a Russian defence spokesperson, Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, said in an interview with The Guardian: “It was these Azov battalion Nazis who had been exterminating civilian population in Donetsk and Luhansk republics, deliberately and with exceptional cruelty, for eight years.”\n\nThe chair of the state parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, referred to the captured Mariupol fighters as “Nazis” and “war criminals” who should stand trial. The ministry of justice also petitioned the supreme court to declare the Azov regiment a “terrorist organisation”. This raises the possibility that large numbers of Ukrainian soldiers would be tried and executed.\n\nUkrainian responses\n\nUkrainian authorities have suggested that they will not tolerate abuse of Russian POWs and that they will treat prisoners humanely. According to some reports, Russian POWs have been permitted to call their families, to talk about their experiences and their actions. Ukrainian authorities have also installed a hotline for Russian families to enquire about their missing sons.\n\nThis might suggest that Ukrainians are playing by the rules when it comes to POW treatment. But there have also been violations. In particular, Ukrainian authorities have held press conferences where Russian prisoners of war were told to discuss their actions during the military invasion. Ukrainian authorities have also posted videos on social media and messaging apps showing captured Russian soldiers being humiliated and compelled to state their names and other information including their home addresses, and the names of their parents.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/middleeast/saudi-iran-media-protests-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Iran protests: London-based TV channel sparks Iranian leaders' ire ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi CNN —\n\nA top Iranian military official issued a warning to Saudi Arabia last week as his government continued to face off against protesters at home. “You are involved in this matter and know that you are vulnerable, it is better to be careful,” he said at the sidelines of a military drill.\n\nMajor General Hossein Salami, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was referring to what state news outlets called a “media war” that they say is being waged against “the Iranian youth and nation” by foreign conspirators seeking to create unrest in the country by supporting protesters there.\n\nThen, on Thursday Iran again warned Saudi Arabia, as well as the United States and the United Kingdom, to “stop interfering in the country’s internal affairs.”\n\nIran last week said it sanctioned a number of media outlets in the UK for “supporting terrorism” and “inciting violence”, reported Tasnim news agency The sanctioned entities include, among others, Volant Media, Global Media, and DMA Media, as well as the “anti-Iranian TV channels” that the companies support, such as Iran International, reported Tasnim agency.\n\nNow in their sixth week, protests have swept through the Islamic Republic following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died on September 16 after being detained by “morality police” and taken to a “re-education center,” allegedly for not abiding by the country’s conservative dress code.\n\nAs the protests rage, Iran is turning up the heat on its adversaries, mainly the United States and Israel. But last week, Saudi Arabia found itself in the line of fire, which risks further complicating attempts by the two regional rivals to mend ties.\n\nRiyadh hasn’t publicly commented on the protests. The kingdom’s foreign minister refused to give his view when asked to during an interview with Al Arabiya news channel on October 12.\n\n“Saudi Arabia has a fixed policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of states,” he said. “Surely, we are following [the situation] and we wish Iran and its people the best.”\n\nIran and Saudi Arabia severed ties in 2016 and both parties have backed opposite sides in proxy conflicts across the Middle East. Last year, they began direct talks in an attempt to improve relations. Baghdad has hosted five rounds of talks so far, the last of which was held in April.\n\nAt the heart of Iran’s most recent accusations against Saudi Arabia may be Iran International, a Persian-language news channel that broadcasts from London. The channel has become one of the go-to sources for many Persian speakers looking for news on the protests. It has been at the forefront of covering the demonstrations, getting breaking news and exclusive footage of the events on the ground. Its Twitter account has over a million followers.\n\nFounded in 2017, Iran International has previously come under scrutiny by the Iranian government. Some say it is due to their coverage of the protests at home, which in recent weeks have rocked the Islamic Republic.\n\nSalami didn’t name the channel in his warning, but government-backed Iranian media last week accused Saudi Arabia of funding it. Saudi Arabia has not addressed the allegations. Karim Sa djadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank in Washington DC, said on Twitter that Iran has demanded the shuttering of the channel in talks with Saudi Arabia, citing a senior Gulf official.\n\nIn 2018, Iran International released a statement denying connections to any government, including Saudi Arabia or Iran after The Guardian reported that it was funded by a firm whose director has ties to Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nSaudi Arabia did not comment on the Guardian report. The Saudi government did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\n“We have heard these accusations before most often promoted by those in whose interests it is to deny a free press,” a spokesperson for Volant Media told CNN.\n\n“Iran International and its sister channel, Afghanistan International, are editorially independent television channels owned by Volant Media, a company based in London owned by a Saudi Arabian/British citizen; it has no state backing or affiliation,” added the spokesperson.\n\nAzadeh Moaveni, associate professor of journalism at New York University, described the channel as “one of the most pernicious and damaging forces to enter the Iranian media sphere,” calling it an arm of Saudi foreign policy. “I would not describe Iran International as pro-reform, or organically Iranian in any manner,” she told CNN.\n\nMohammad Marandi, a professor at the University of Tehran who was also an adviser to the Iranian nuclear talks negotiating team, said there’s “no doubt” that Iran International is funded by Saudi Arabia. A prominent figure on state-funded Iranian outlets, Marandi added that Iran International spreads rumors, ethnic and sectarian strife “and it tries to use misinformation to create fear, chaos and promote violence.”\n\nSaudi Research and Marketing Group, a media conglomerate with ties to the Saudi ruling family, has run the Persian language website of the UK’s Independent newspaper since 2018. Its account on Instagram, where many Iranians get their news, has over 600,000 followers.\n\nCNN’s parent company is Warner Bros. Discovery, which has a partnership with Saudi Research and Media Group, a Saudi joint stock company.\n\nSaudi Arabia has for years accused Iran of doing the same with its own Arabic-language news channels: targeting Arab audiences with propaganda. State-run Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting runs Al Alam TV, an Arabic news channel that has interviewed Saudi opposition figures and has been blocked by Arab states. Iran-backed Hezbollah’s Al Manar channel has also been blocked.\n\n“It’s about time Iran gets a taste of its own medicine,” said Ali Shihabi, a Saudi author and analyst. “Iran has spent decades inciting and funding instability in the Arab world so having them pay the price of such behavior themselves is certainly a source of satisfaction to a lot of people,” he told CNN.\n\nThe channel “is making an impact on public behavior in Iran and they are nervous about their domestic situation,” added Shihabi.\n\nAnalysts say that Iran’s tight grip on domestic media outlets and its lack of freedom of expression have created “fertile ground” for anti-establishment platforms such as Iran International to flourish.\n\n“It is not so much the broadcasters themselves, but the situation in Iran has provided the possibility for broadcasters outside of Iran to gather a certain degree of popularity in the Iranian context,” said Gholam Khiabany, a reader in media and communications at Goldsmiths, University of London.\n\nHarun Najafizada, a former journalist at Iran International who is now a director at the sister Afghanistan International news channel, said the parent company Volant Media is privately funded but “I don’t care as long as they do not influence my editorial take,” adding that shareholders never interfere in decision making.\n\nIran International stood out from other Western-backed Persian language news outlets “by taking the side of the disenchanted, oppressed, voiceless people,” while competitor Persian channels in the West were focused on bringing balance by giving the Iranian government a voice, he told CNN.\n\n“They have a vision, of course – they don’t do it for God,” said Najafizada, referring to the shareholders. “That vision is democracy.”\n\nJust two days after Salami’s first warning, however, Ali Akbar Velayati, a top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, was quoted saying that the two countries should reopen their embassies to facilitate a rapprochement, according to the semi-official Iranian news agency ISNA.\n\n“We are neighbors of Saudi Arabia and we must coexist,” he was cited as saying by ISNA. “The embassies of the two countries should reopen in order to solve our problems in a better way.”\n\nIran protests\n\nBusiness owners and factory workers in Iran’s Kurdish region went on strike over the weekend as anti-government protests continued.\n\nVideo shared with CNN by pro-reform activist outlet IranWire shows Sanandaj, the capital of the Kurdish region, quiet at the beginning of the work week as stores remain shut.\n\nThe Norway-based Iranian rights group Hengaw said shopkeepers were on strike in Bukan, Sanandaj and Saqez, as well as Marivan. Strikes and protests have become common in cities and towns across Iran as people unite against the regime.\n\nThe nationwide protests are now in their fifth week, triggered by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died three days after being arrested by the country’s morality police and taken to a re-education center.\n\nHere’s the latest on this developing story:\n\nIran will file a lawsuit against the United States claiming the US had direct involvement in recent riots, Kazem Gharibabadi, the deputy head of the Iranian judiciary and secretary of the country’s High Council for Human Rights, said on Saturday, according to state news agency IRNA.\n\nThe Coordinating Council of Iranian Teachers’ Trade Associations (CCITTA) on Saturday called for a nationwide strike in protest at the recent deaths and detention of students in the country, according to a statement published on Telegram. The council also announced a period of public mourning for students who have died in recent weeks from Thursday through Saturday, and called for a sit-in on Sunday, October 23 and Monday, October 24.\n\nProtests took place in central Berlin on Saturday, with close to 80,000 people standing in solidarity with Iran, German state broadcaster RBB reported, citing police officials.\n\nThe digest\n\nIsrael and Lebanon could sign maritime border agreement on Thursday, Biden energy adviser says\n\nSenior US adviser for global energy security Amos Hochstein said on Sunday that Israel and Lebanon could sign their historic maritime borders agreement as early as Thursday.\n\nBackground: “We’re going to have a deal. We’re going to sign it hopefully this Thursday,” Hochstein said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “And I hope that this continues our commitment to stability in the region and prosperity for both countries,” he added.\n\nWhy it matters: The US-brokered agreement settles a years-long maritime border dispute involving major oil and gas fields in the Mediterranean. Still technically at war, Lebanon and Israel both have much to gain . Not only does the agreement cool down recent security tensions, it also allows Israel to begin drilling and exporting gas to Europe and offers potential economic relief to Lebanon.\n\nHuman Rights Watch says LGBTQ people subjected to arrest and mistreatment in Qatar ahead of World Cup\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has accused Qatar’s security forces of arbitrarily arresting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people and subjecting them to ill-treatment in detention ahead of the FIFA World Cup.\n\nBackground: HRW said in a report issued Monday that it documented six cases of “severe and repeated beatings and five cases of sexual harassment in police custody between 2019 and 2022,” the most recent of which took place in September. Security forces arrested people in public places based solely on their gender expression and unlawfully searched their phones, the HRW report said, adding that as a requirement for their release, security forces mandated that transgender women detainees attend “conversion therapy sessions” at a government-sponsored “behavioral healthcare” center. Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar and punishable by imprisonment. A Qatari official told CNN that the HRW allegations “contain information that is categorically and unequivocally false.”\n\nWhy it matters: Ahead of the FIFA World Cup, which starts November 20, Qatar has said it would welcome LGBT visitors, after concerns were raised from the LGBT community over how safe they will be at the tournament.\n\nEgypt has ordered the release of prominent activist, presidential pardon committee member says\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Monday pardoned a prominent activist and former parliamentarian, Zyad el-Elaimy, according to a presidential pardon committee member.\n\nBackground: Jailed since 2019, el-Elaimy was one of the key participants in the 2011 uprisings that led to the downfall of former longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak. His release is “in response to calls by political parties and forces,” presidential pardon committee member Tarek el-Khouly wrote on Facebook. Young members of political parties, politicians and the presidential pardon committee also coordinated to help secure his release, added el-Khouly. El-Elaimy was given a five-year sentence last year on charges of spreading false news.\n\nWhy it matters: The release comes two weeks ahead of November’s COP27 summit in Egypt. The country has come in for sharp criticism in recent months, with activists denouncing global leaders’ attendance in the light of Sisi’s questionable human rights record. Egypt has been promoting moves to improve its rights record, but activists and critics have described recent reforms as mostly cosmetic.\n\nWhat’s trending\n\nA view of a light and sound show during Deepotsav celebrations, on the eve of the Diwali, on October 23 in Ayodhya, India. Deepak Gupta/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\nUnited Arab Emirates: #Diwali\n\nAlso known as Deepavali, the holiday is widely trending across social platforms in the United Arab Emirates, with many flooding Twitter with colorful photos of candles and wishing joy and prosperity to the world.\n\nSome are also posting photos of themselves in traditional celebratory garments. Diwali is one of the most important festivals in Hinduism, the largest religion in India. This year, it falls on October 24.\n\nIndia and the UAE share a strong political and economic relationship, one that has grown closer in recent years.\n\nThe Indian expatriate community in the UAE is around 3.5 million, according to the Indian embassy in the UAE, adding that it is reportedly the largest ethnic community in the oil-rich Arabian Gulf state. Approximately 15% of the diaspora are in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, added the Indian embassy, while the rest are in six northern Emirates, including business hub Dubai.\n\nThe UAE also accounts for 33% of foreign remittances to India, at more than $20 billion a year.\n\nDiwali is also significant for Sikhs and Jains. It is celebrated in India, Nepal, Malaysia, Singapore and other countries with South Asian diasporas.\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Nadeen Ebrahim Abbas Al Lawati", "Nadeen Ebrahim", "Abbas Al Lawati"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/957271/what-next-for-boris-johnson-resignations", "title": "Five scenarios facing Boris Johnson after 'bombshell' resignations ...", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.
