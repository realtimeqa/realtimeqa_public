Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has roiled the House in chaos. The move to oust McCarthy – known as a motion to vacate – had the support of a handful of hard-right lawmakers who have expressed anger at McCarthy for working with Democrats to avert a government shutdown.\n\nHere's what you missed after a chaotic day in Washington.\n\nGaetz led a group of eight Republicans who voted to remove the speaker, joined by 208 Democrats who at times giggled at the GOP’s infighting.\n\nRepublicans weren't laughing, however, as the civil war has cast a shadow over their majority.\n\nDuring the debate some accused Gaetz of grandstanding and hurtling the House into chaos without a clear plan as to who, if anyone, would take the job.\n\nCatch up with USA TODAY's coverage of the speaker fight in the halls of Congress.\n\nMcCarthy yet to speak with Biden\n\nKevin McCarthy said Tuesday he has not spoken to Joe Biden in a \"long long time.\"\n\n\"I've been thinking about that. It's been a long long time,\" McCarthy said.\n\nMcCarthy says he had respect for the president despite their different philosophies, but wished the president was more \"hands on.\"\n\nThe timeline raised some eyebrows in Washington, considering Congress last week voted to temporarily avert a government shutdown that would have impacted millions of Americans. But House Republicans have also launched an impeachment inquiry into Biden, claiming he benefitted from his family's business dealings.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nPelosi, McCarthy says, vowed to back him up\n\nDuring his pursuit of the speakership that lasted 15 votes earlier this year, one of McCarthy's key concessions was allowing a single member of Congress to file a motion to vacate.\n\nMcCarthy counseled his fellow Californian and former Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for advice. Pelosi, he said, told him to make the concession.\n\nIf the motion to vacate ever came up, McCarthy claimed, Pelosi would have backed him up.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\n'I think you've got a real institutional problem,' Kevin McCarthy warns\n\nNoting that only a small minority – 8 members – of the House GOP conference voted to oust McCarthy, the former speaker said there was an \"institutional problem.\"\n\n\"I think you've got a real institutional problem,\" McCarthy said, also joking that if he knew he would eventually be ousted, he wouldn't have helped his opponents get elected.\n\nBut McCarthy on Tuesday night also gave some advice the next speaker of the Republican-controlled House where a single member can bring forth a motion to vacate: \"Change the rules.\"\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nKevin McCarthy: 'I leave the speakership with a sense of pride'\n\nKevin McCarthy formally announced his intentions to not run again for speaker of the House at a press conference, saying he is making his exit with a \"sense of pride and optimism.\"\n\nThe California Republican noted his decision to work with Democrats to avert a government shutdown put his leadership position at stake, but that \"doing what's right isn't always easy. But it's necessary.\"\n\n\"I took a risk for the American public,\" McCarthy said.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nHouse adjourns until next Tuesday\n\nIn a display of the chaos that has upended the House, lawmakers are headed home until next Tuesday as the lower chamber is now paralyzed without a speaker.\n\nHouse Republicans will decide on candidates for speaker next Tuesday. The next speaker election is expected to take place next Wednesday.\n\n−Ken Tran\n\nMcCarthy will not seek the speakership again\n\nLeaving the closed-door conference meeting, Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., told reporters McCarthy plans to not run again.\n\nThe plan, the Oklahoma Republican said, is to adjourn for the night and discuss alternatives to succeed McCarthy\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nMatt Gaetz walks into GOP closed door meeting\n\nGaetz has entered a closed-door House GOP conference meeting to discuss next steps after he ousted McCarthy as speaker.\n\nHe did not answer any questions on his way in.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWhite House pushes House to ‘quickly elect’ McCarthy’s replacement\n\nPresident Joe Biden wants the Republican-led House of Representatives to move quickly to elect a new speaker to replace McCarthy following his removal, the White House said.\n\n“Because the urgent challenges facing our nation will not wait, he hopes the House will quickly elect a Speaker,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said of Biden. “The American people deserve leadership that puts the issues affecting their lives front and center.”\n\nPrior to the vote to vacate McCarthy’s speakership, the White House did not take a public position whether McCarthy should remain in his role and instead deferred to House Democratic leaders who voted to oust McCarthy.\n\nThe White House highlighted a “split screen” Tuesday between the chaos in the House and action in the executive branch as Biden announced that all 10 prescription drug drugs tapped for Medicare’s first price negotiations have agreed to participate.\n\n“Once the House has met their responsibility to elect a speaker,” Jean-Pierre said, \"he looks forward to working together with them and with the Senate to address the American peoples’ priorities.”\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nGaetz, McCarthy's chief antagonist, claims victory\n\nGaetz, who spearheaded the successful efforts to oust McCarthy from his post, claimed victory on the Capitol steps after the historic vote to remove the speaker.\n\n\"It's the benefit of this country that we have a better speaker of the House than Kevin McCarthy,\" Gaetz told reporters after the vote. \"We should elect a speaker who's better.\"\n\nThe Florida conservative taunted his moderate colleagues as House Republicans are expected to huddle to discuss next steps.\n\n\"The stages of grief I think are in progress right now with some of my colleagues. I think there was a stage of denial. I've certainly experienced a good amount of their anger. And now we appear to be headed towards bargaining,\" Gaetz said.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nGOP Rep. Ryan Zinke: ‘This is a vote without purpose’\n\nRep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., told reporters that he thinks McCarthy being ousted as speaker is “sad and tragic.”\n\nZinke said he doesn’t think McCarthy gives up when asked whether the next election in the House for speaker will spark multiple rounds of contentious voting.\n\n“Last week, one of the latest excuses - not valid - is that McCarthy reached out to members that voted with purpose on the continuing resolution,\" he said, referencing the temporary measure that lawmakers approved to avoid a government shutdown.\n\n\"In the last round, the Democrats did vote with purpose. They voted to keep the government open and they voted to keep the policies in place,\" he said, before calling the vote to remove McCarthy \"a vote without purpose. And I always look at purpose and intent.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nGOP lawmaker to lose Republican support over McCarthy vote\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., one of eight Republicans who voted to oust McCarthy, said he’s already received angry phone calls, less than an hour since the vote ended.\n\n“This will cost me,” Burchett said. “I’ve already gotten the calls from a lot of the big supporters of mine that said they’ll never support me again.”\n\nBurchett said that made it a “tough decision,” but “I worry more about our country.”\n\nWhen asked who would be picked to replace McCarthy, the Tennessee congressman said he’s been in conversations but didn’t have a name to share. He said there could be about eight lawmakers in the running.\n\n“Members have whispered in my ear,” Burchett said.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nRepublican lawmaker: ‘Much different than the speaker’s election’\n\nRep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., told reporters that the vote to oust McCarthy was “much different than the speaker's election where one wins, one loses,” despite the group of Republicans seeking to remove him from the leadership office.\n\n“It’s certainly a disappointment, and I think those responsible for coordinating reflect on it and I think if they do…I don't think they'll ever think they made the right call, but that's up to them,” Cole said.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWho will be the next speaker of the House? Patrick McHenry?\n\nRepublican Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina is temporarily leading the House after Kevin McCarthy was ousted. McHenry, one of McCarthy's closest allies, is known as the speaker pro tempore.\n\nThe speaker pro tempore has far more limited powers compared to a speaker of the House, but he will preside over the lower chamber until a new speaker is elected.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWho voted against Kevin McCarthy\n\nIn a historic turn of events, McCarthy has been ousted as speaker, leaving the House in turmoil as lawmakers must elect a new permanent speaker.\n\nEight GOP lawmakers voted to eject McCarthy from the speakership, they are:\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.\n\nRep. Ken Buck, R-Colo.\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.\n\nRep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.\n\nRep. Bob Good, R-Va.\n\nRep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C.\n\nRep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nKevin McCarthy is ousted, House moves to elect new speaker\n\nConservative rebels successfully ousted McCarthy as speaker, plunging the House into chaos as lawmakers move to elect a new speaker. House Democrats, who voted against the motion to table, joined the conservative hardliners in ejecting McCarthy from the speakership. The vote to oust McCarthy was 216-210.\n\nMcCarthy, even though he was ousted, is still able to run again as speaker if nominated by a lawmaker. In the meantime, an acting interim speaker must be named, but they will have limited power.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nIn sign of hope for McCarthy, one GOP vote flips in his favor\n\nIn a glimmer of hope for McCarthy’s speakership, Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio., who voted against the motion to delay Gaetz’ effort to oust him, also voted against the motion to vacate.\n\nDavidson’s vote is a sign there could be more conservative hardliners who flip in favor of McCarthy.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHouse starts roll call vote to decide Kevin McCarthy's fate\n\nAs the House starts voting on whether or not to eject McCarthy from the speakership, a sense of deja vu has fallen on the House floor, as lawmakers are voting through voice vote, similar to how lawmakers voted during the speaker election back in January.\n\nIt will take a while. Each lawmaker has to be called one-by-one to declare their vote.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMatt Gaetz calls Biden impeachment inquiry ‘failure theater’\n\nGaetz, making his case to oust McCarthy, slammed Republicans’ impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden as “failure theater.”\n\nIn the first impeachment inquiry hearing targeting Biden last week, three expert witnesses invited by Republicans each told the House Oversight Committee no evidence has emerged that Biden committed an impeachable offense. It was a setback in Republican efforts to impeach Biden.\n\n“It’s hard to make the argument that oversight is the reason to continue when it looks like failure theater,” said Gaetz, responding to comments earlier by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who defended McCarthy.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nGOP yells ‘Shame!’ at Gaetz for fundraising off motion to vacate\n\nOne of Kevin McCarthy’s top lieutenants, Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., defended the speaker in an impassioned speech, also lambasting Matt Gaetz for fundraising off of his efforts to oust McCarthy as speaker.\n\n“Using official actions to raise money, it’s disgusting,” Graves said.\n\nWhen Graves held up his phone displaying one of Gaetz’ fundraising messages, GOP lawmakers yelled “Shame!” at Gaetz.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nGaetz met with silence as he debates McCarthy allies\n\nIn a display of just how much power a handful of conservative hardliners wield over the the House, Matt Gaetz has responded to nearly every Kevin McCarthy ally speaking on the California Republicans’ behalf on the House floor.\n\nThe contrast between the two factions couldn’t be any more clear.\n\nWhile McCarthy allies including Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., and Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C. has received overwhelming applause from GOP lawmakers after their remarks, Gaetz’ speeches have been met with silence.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat happens if McCarthy is ousted?\n\nIf the House votes to oust McCarthy, then someone would have to fill his position temporarily until an election is set and the next speaker is chosen in the lower chamber.\n\nThat temporary replacement would be chosen from a succession list McCarthy submitted in January. According to Rule one, clause 8 of House rules, the next person on the list “shall act as Speaker pro tempore until the election of a Speaker or a Speaker pro tempore.”\n\n“Pending such election the Member acting as Speaker pro tempore may exercise such authorities of the Office of Speaker as may be necessary and appropriate to that end,” the House rules say.\n\nThe rules don’t specify how long the person would temporarily fill the speaker’s spot. It is unclear when the House would choose to hold an election for the next speaker if McCarthy is removed.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMcCarthy nearly expressionless as House Republicans debate his fate\n\nWhile House Republicans debate on McCarthy’s fate as speaker, the California Republican, sitting in the second row from the front of the floor, has been nearly expressionless, only occasionally chatting with Rep. Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz., who is seated next to him.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nIs GOP hostage to right-flank of party?\n\nThe 11 Republican lawmakers who joined Democrats to vote against a procedural vote delaying the motion to vacate now leads to a final vote on the House floor to oust McCarthy.\n\nThese 11 Republicans include some of the most ultra-conservative members of the Republican conference, including members of the House Freedom Caucus like Reps. Bob Good of Virginia, Ken Buck of Colorado, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Matt Rosendale of Montana and Eli Crane of Arizona.\n\nDespite comprising a minority of the Republican caucus, these ultra-conservative members, with help from the other side of the aisle, may be the reason McCarthy is removed from his speakership.\n\nSome, like Good, listed their grievances with McCarthy as speaker. Good called it a “totally avoidable situation.”\n\n“We need a speaker who will fight for something, anything, besides just staying or becoming speaker,” Good said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nDemocrats stand aside as House Republicans debate among themselves\n\nWhile Kevin McCarthy's allies and the conservative hardliners against the speaker debate on the House floor over his speakership, Democrats have stayed on the sidelines watching House Republicans quarrel amongst themselves.\n\nAs the rest of the House GOP conference cheered on McCarthy's allies and jeered at Gaetz, House Democrats remained silent, reflecting Jeffries and leadership's intention for House Republicans to settle the matter within their own conference.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nRepublican calls McCarthy ouster 'totally avoidable situation'\n\nRep. Bob Good, R-Va., who voted against tabling the motion to vacate against McCarthy, spoke on the House floor after the vote listing his grievances with McCarthy and calling it a “totally avoidable situation.”\n\nGood said back in January during the votes that made McCarthy speaker, he persuaded five of his colleagues to vote present in the final vote that allowed McCarthy to win his leadership role. He claimed he continued to work with McCarthy and persuade some of his ultra-conservative colleagues to support McCarthy’s priorities throughout the year.\n\nThe Virginia lawmaker claimed McCarthy made a promise to bring 12 spending bills to the floor individually this year, which did not happen as Congress lurched toward a government shutdown this weekend. Good said he reluctantly agreed to vote for a short-term solution to avert a shutdown, despite the promise McCarthy made\n\n“We need a speaker who will fight for something, anything besides just staying and becoming speaker,” Good said.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nMcCarthy ally: ‘This is a very sad day’\n\nSpeaking on behalf of McCarthy and his allies on the House floor, Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., chair of the House Rules Committee, praised the California Republicans’ leadership through multiple tough votes that put McCarthy’s speakership into question, including negotiations over the debt ceiling earlier this year and the recent government shutdown crisis.\n\n“We were on the verge of a government shutdown,” Cole said. “He put his political neck on the line … to do the right thing.”\n\n“He did the right thing for our party,” Cole added, earning a standing ovation from the majority of the House GOP conference.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWho will serve as speaker if Kevin McCarthy is ousted?\n\nThat's not clear.\n\nIf McCarthy is removed from his leadership role a temporary speaker would lead in the House. McCarthy submitted a succession list to the House clerk in January, though the document is private.\n\nBut who's likely on that list? Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., the House majority leader, is a likely option. So is Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., the majority whip, another crucial leadership position.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTexas Republican concerned about upcoming vote to remove McCarthy\n\nThere is not a clear name for McCarthy’s successor, should the speaker be ousted, said Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-TX.\n\n“There’s not really an option. Another reason this is very silly,” he said.\n\nThe Texas congressman said he’s worried about the message today’s events will send to voters about the GOP.\n\n“It’s clear that there’s just a group of people that don’t want conservatives to win,” Crenshaw said. “And they label themselves as the most conservative, which is not possibly true.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nPresident Joe Biden stays out of Kevin McCarthy speakership fight\n\nThe White House is staying out of the fight over McCarthy’s speakership – seemingly more than happy to watch Republicans beat up each other.\n\n“We’re just not going to get involved,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday, deferring to House Democratic leaders who have vowed they won’t help McCarthy.\n\nJean-Pierre said it is “nothing new” for the White House not to weigh in on congressional leadership decisions.\n\n“Is there chaos in the House Republicans? Absolutely. That is something that they have to deal with,” Jean-Pierre said.\n\nOn Sunday, President Joe Biden said, “I don't have a vote on that matter. I'll leave that to the leadership of the House and the Senate.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\n'Get a time machine'\n\nWhen asked whether there was anything McCarthy could do to change anything, Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., told reporters that he could “get a time machine and bring us all back to the table like I suggested two months ago and keep his word.”\n\nBurchett added that “everything’s always chaos..this country was built on chaos” and said he was more concerned about the dollar collapsing and the economy failing.\n\n“It scares me a lot worse,” Burchett said.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\n11 GOP lawmakers vote against McCarthy in setback to his speakership\n\n11 GOP lawmakers voted against the motion to table the effort to oust McCarthy in a massive setback for the speaker. The House will on the motion to vacate McCarthy, which is the formal vote that will decide his speakership.\n\nThe members that voted against McCarthy are:\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.\n\nRep. Ken Buck, R-Colo.\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.\n\nRep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz.\n\nRep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.\n\nRep. Bob Good, R-Va.\n\nRep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C.\n\nRep. Cory Mills, R-Fla.\n\nRep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont.\n\nRep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMotion to table fails: McCarthy’s speakership closer to the brink\n\nKevin McCarthy faced a severe setback when a handful of conservative hardliners and House Democrats voted against a procedural motion – known as a motion to table – to discard Gaetz’ efforts to oust the California Republican as speaker. The vote failed by 208-218\n\nThe House will immediately vote now on the motion to vacate to determine whether McCarthy stays in his post.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhite House vows US support for Ukraine won’t waver if McCarthy loses job\n\nThe White House expressed confidence Tuesday that Congress will continue to support aid for Ukraine if House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is ousted from his speakership.\n\n“Regardless of what happens in the House of Representatives,” said John Kirby, a White House spokesman on national security issues, “all the House leadership is supportive of continuing to help Ukraine and the vast majority of House members on the Republican side are in support.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden is pushing Congress to approve additional aid to help Ukraine fight Russia after Congress passed a continuing resolution to avert a government shutdown for several weeks that lacked Ukraine funding to appease hardline Republicans. A growing number of far-right Republicans in the House oppose continued support of Ukraine.\n\nMcCarthy, whose speakership is in jeopardy, has backed Ukraine funding in the past but said he wants future financial support for Ukraine to be tied to additional security on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n“We don't believe they should be tied, or one dependent on the other, but both are important,” Kirby said.\n\nBiden held a phone call with NATO allies Tuesday in which he “reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes as it,” the White House said.\n\n“As winter fast approaches, it is imperative that we help them take advantage of every single day,” Kirby said. “A lapse of support for even a short period of time can make all the difference on the battlefield.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nDonald Trump: Why are Republicans 'always fighting among themselves'?\n\nWhile attending his bank fraud trial in New York for a second day, Donald Trump found time Tuesday to weigh in on the drama surrounding McCarthy - sort of.\n\nTrump did not mention McCarthy or Gaetz by name in a Truth Social post, nor has he taken a public position on their dispute, but he did criticize GOP in-fighting.\n\nSaid the former president: \"Why is it that Republicans are always fighting among themselves, why aren’t they fighting the Radical Left Democrats who are destroying our Country?\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nNancy Pelosi says Democrats aren't taking up speaker fight\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, shared in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \"In this Congress, it is the responsibility of House Republicans to choose a nominee & elect the Speaker on the Floor.\"\n\n\"At this time there is no justification for a departure from this tradition,\" she added.\n\nHer comments come as House Democrats have vowed not to step in and save Kevin McCarthy from a rebellion from his fellow Republicans.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nPolitics:Will Kevin McCarthy be forced out as Speaker of the House? Here's how it could happen.\n\nAbsences could save McCarthy\n\nAhead of the procedural vote to suspend Gaetz’ motion to vacate against McCarthy, the California Republican could be saved due to absences.\n\nThe procedural vote – referred to as a motion to table – requires just a simple majority rather than an absolute majority. That means McCarthy does not technically need 218 votes to table the motion to vacate, but rather just more votes to table the motion than against it.\n\nBoth House Republicans and House Democrats are seeing absences that could factor into McCarthy’s survival.\n\nIt is unclear how many absences there are on each side, but House Democrats are currently voting by hand in an unrelated vote series likely to buy more time for their rank and file members to make it to the crucial vote on McCarthy’s fate.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\n‘We’ll see what happens’: Lawmakers enter House chamber for votes\n\nAs lawmakers file into the House chamber, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., took a swipe at Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., when asked about the upcoming vote against McCarthy. Greene has long supported the speaker.\n\n“Are we all gonna be dressing like John Fetterman here pretty soon when we don’t have a speaker and don’t have rules,” Greene said. “We’ll see what happens.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nWho's trying to oust Kevin McCarthy? Matt Gaetz, Freedom Caucus members\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., introduced a motion Monday night to remove Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., from the top position in the House.\n\nHis motion came after a contentious week of negotiations to avoid a government shutdown, during which Gaetz had previously threatened to oust McCarthy if the Speaker looked across the aisle for support.\n\nBut Gaetz is joined in the push by several members tied to the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, including Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs.\n\nWhat happens if there's a government shutdown and no speaker of the House?\n\nIf McCarthy is ousted by his fellow Republicans, and Democrats refuse to step in and help him, a temporary speaker would lead in the House. McCarthy submitted a succession list to the House clerk in January, though the document is private.\n\nThat means the House could continue with its important business, as lawmakers have just weeks to compromise on a slate of spending bills to avoid a government shutdown.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat happens if Congress ousts McCarthy?\n\nIf the House decides to remove McCarthy as speaker, then someone from a private backup list provided by McCarthy at the beginning of the year will fill his slot until a new election is held.\n\n“There's a little disagreement amongst Hill procedural experts about how much power that temporary Speaker would actually wield,” Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told The Washington Post.\n\nHowever, McCarthy can choose to run as speaker again. It is unclear when the House would hold that vote.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMotion to vacate history: Has a speaker of the House ever been removed?\n\nThe last time the House voted on a motion to vacate was 1910 against then-Speaker Joseph Cannon, R-Ill. In 2015, then-Rep. Mark Meadows filed a motion against Speaker John Boehner, but it never made it to a floor vote.\n\nA House speaker has never been removed via a motion to vacate. Boehner resigned months after Meadows' motion amid continued dissent in his party.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nCapitol Hill in turmoil\n\nThe move to oust Kevin McCarthy has consumed the House in turmoil as lawmakers strategize over how to approach the conservative rebellion against the California Republican.\n\nMcCarthy, exiting a closed-door weekly conference meeting, told reporters firmly he wouldn't entertain working with Democrats to save his speakership and conceded that \"I'm out\" if a handful of Republicans decide to boot him from the speakership.\n\nIn their own extended closed-door conference meeting to discuss strategy, to prevent leaks, House Democratic lawmakers were barred from bringing in their phones to the meeting as leadership decided on whether or not to bail McCarthy out.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHouse Democrats will vote to remove Kevin McCarthy\n\nIn a lengthy letter sent to House Democrats, Jeffries said leadership will vote to vacate McCarthy from the speakership.\n\n\"It is now the responsibility of the GOP members to end the House Republican Civil War. Given their unwillingness to break from MAGA extremism in an authentic and comprehensive manner, House Democratic leadership will vote yes on the pending Republican Motion to Vacate the Chair,\" the letter reads.\n\nHouse Democrats have for days said they will vote in line with their leadership. Jeffries' statement means that McCarthy's speakership will hinge on uniting enough House Republicans behind him to defeat the conservative rebellion.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat state does Kevin McCarthy represent? How long has Kevin McCarthy been in Congress?\n\nKevin McCarthy was sworn in as a member of the House of Representatives in 2007. He represents California's 20th House District, which includes parts of Kern, Fresno, Tulare and Kings counties.\n\nCongress voted to make McCarthy speaker of the House in January, after a marathon 15 rounds of votes. He faced objections from some of the same hard-right lawmakers in January during his bid to become speaker that he faces now as they seek to remove him.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nIs McCarthy being impeached?\n\nNo, Kevin McCarthy is facing what's known as a motion to vacate, which could remove him from his role as speaker of the House, a role that's in line behind the vice president to succeed the presidency, if needed.\n\nImpeachment is a process designed to remove presidents from office, along with other federal officials. House Republicans have opened up an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, but they haven't approved any formal articles of impeachment against him.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat is a motion to vacate?\n\nA motion to vacate is a congressional procedure initiated by a House member that calls for the removal of a sitting House speaker and the election of a new one, according to Ballotpedia.\n\nWhile the motion can be brought forth by one person, there must be a majority vote in the House to remove the top leader.\n\nUnder House rules, the motion must be voted on in two legislative days.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Democrats help McCarthy?\n\nThe answer is likely no.\n\nAs of noon on Tuesday, it appears Democrats will remain unified and vote to remove McCarthy from his role as speaker of the House.\n\n“House Democrats are going to continue to push people over politics,” House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters Tuesday.\n\n“We are ready to find bipartisan common ground,” he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. \"Our extreme colleagues have shown no willingness to do the same. They must find a way to end the House Republican Civil War.”\n\nOther lawmakers made clear they support House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. call to “end the House Republican Civil War.”\n\n“I hope everybody votes no on the motion to table. I expect everybody to be unified,” Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said Tuesday after leaving a Democratic caucus meeting.\n\nThe New Democrat Coalition also stands unified behind Jeffries.\n\n“New Dems are proud to stand with our leader and our caucus to deliver progress for the American people,” Rep. Annie Kuster, D-N.H., chair of the coalition, said in a statement.\n\n– Rachel Looker and Ken Tran\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nAmong one of the key concessions McCarthy made to conservative hardliners in his bid for the speakership in January was allowing a single lawmaker to initiate a motion to vacate.\n\nPrevious speakers set parameters on how lawmakers could try to oust these leaders, from only allowing party leadership to attempt to eject the speaker or requiring multiple lawmakers to agree on a motion to vacate.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has repeatedly flirted with ousting McCarthy since Republicans took control of the House but the Florida Republican finally followed up on his threats after McCarthy worked with Democrats to avert a government shutdown over the weekend.\n\n“I believe the basis for the motion to vacate is Kevin McCarthy’s repeated breach of the agreement that he made in January,” Gaetz told reporters Monday after formally filing the motion to oust McCarthy, alleging the speaker broke an agreement – that was never released on paper – he made with hardline conservatives in January.\n\n– Ken Tran", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2023/10/03/kevin-mccarthy-motion-to-vacate-house-speaker/71042590007/", "title": "Speaker McCarthy was voted out. How motion to vacate made it ...", "text": "Corrections & Clarifications: This story has been corrected to make clear that Gaetz' home state is Florida.\n\nFor the first time in U.S. history, members of the House of Representatives ousted its speaker of the House in a move Tuesday set in motion by hard-line conservative Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.\n\nHouse members voted 216-210 to replace Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., in a roll call vote. Seven members did not vote.\n\nGaetz had introduced a motion to vacate, a seldom-used congressional procedure to replace a speaker.\n\nHe introduced the motion on the House floor Monday evening. It came after a stopgap funding agreement among McCarthy, Republicans and Democrats late Saturday to avert a shutdown of the federal government.\n\nMcCarthy called a House vote to table the motion Tuesday. That failed, 218-208, with seven members not voting. House debate continued until the motion to vacate was approved.\n\nGaetz and other House conservatives had opposed the temporary funding measure. The Florida congressman accused McCarthy of lying to Republicans during funding negotiations and working with Democrats on the agreement.\n\nMcCarthy was the second speaker in U.S. history to face a motion to vacate.

Matt Gaetz, of Florida\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, of Arizona\n\nRep. Ken Buck, of Colorado\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, of Tennessee\n\nRep. Eli Crane, of Arizona\n\nRep. Bob Good, of Virginia\n\nRep. Nancy Mace, of South Carolina\n\nRep. Matt Rosendale, of Montana\n\nMatt Gaetz\n\nRepresents Florida's 1st district, covering the western-most part of the Panhandle, including Pensacola.\n\nElected in 2016.\n\nGaetz has been a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump and a controversial figure for his far-right views. He is currently under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for allegations of sexual misconduct, campaign finance violations, taking bribes, and using drugs.\n\nGaetz played a central role in ousting McCarthy, bringing the motion to vacate to the house and helping to organize a small group of Republicans to join him in crossing the partisan line. In doing so, he has proved his ability to put provocative statements into power, fueling rumors of a run for the Governor's seat in 2026.\n\nAndy Biggs\n\nRepresents Arizona's 5th District, outside of Phoenix.\n\nElected in 2016.\n\nIn December 2022, he was trying to make a longshot run for Speaker of the House, during which he was referred to the House Ethics Committee for failing to comply with a subpoena from the committee investigating Jan. 6.\n\nBiggs was critical of McCarthy's deals to prevent a shutdown before Tuesday's vote, saying that McCarthy was ineffective at achieving some Republican goals. “This is a lawless Biden regime. They will not enforce border laws,” Biggs said before noting his vote to vacate McCarthy.\n\nKen Buck\n\nRepresents Colorado's 4th District, covering most of the state's rural eastern plains.\n\nElected in 2014.\n\nBuck is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, making him a part of the most conservative lawmakers. He drew criticism from other far-right representatives recently when he called on Trump to tell Americans to \"stand down and allow the judicial system to take its course,” after Trump's multiple criminal indictments.\n\n\"We are $33 trillion in debt and on track to hit $50 trillion by 2030. We cannot continue to fund the government by continuing resolutions and omnibus spending bills. That's why I voted to oust (McCarthy),\" Buck wrote in a post on X. \"We must change course to sensible budgeting and save our country.\"\n\nFAQs:Kevin McCarthy ousted, explained\n\nTim Burchett\n\nRepresents Tennessee's 2nd District, which includes Knoxville.\n\nElected in 2018.\n\nHe has been active in the GOP effort to run an impeachment inquiry on President Joe Biden, which McCarthy launched without a vote from the House. He is also a long-time supporter of term limits.\n\nBurchett supported McCarthy all the way through his speakership votes in January and was torn on ousting him until the last minute, according to The Hill. But it was a condescending comment from McCarthy that pushed Burchett to oust him.\n\n\"Then the first thing out of his mouth on the phone was something very condescending. I thought, ‘Well, I’m gonna listen to him. I’m glad he’s calling. I’m sorry it’s right here at the last hour, but I’m gonna listen to him.’ And it was something condescending about my religious beliefs, and I just thought, I don’t need that,\" he told The Hill. \"And that answered my question right there. The quality and the character there … maybe that’s the wrong thing to judge it on, but that’s what I did.”\n\nEli Crane\n\nRepresents Arizona's 2nd District, covering the majority of the northeastern part of the state.\n\nElected in 2022.\n\nCrane is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, according to his website. He also voted \"present\" during McCarthy's bid for Speakership in January.\n\n\"I ran for congress to make sure the voices of we the people weren't steamrolled by the status quo. We need to change the ineffective and dishonest way this town works,\" he wrote in a statement on X. \"I'm prepared to support a speaker who agrees.\"\n\nBob Good\n\nRepresents the 5th District of Virginia, a large portion of the state southeast of Richmond.\n\nElected in 2020.\n\nA member of the House Freedom Caucus, Good is considered an ultra-conservative congressman. He voiced opposition to McCarthy while he was going for the speaker's seat in January, telling Politico “He doesn’t have anything that I want.” McCarthy supported Good's opponent in Virginia's 2020 congressional race, Rep. Denver Riggleman, whom Good was challenging after the opponent officiated a same sex wedding, the outlet reported.\n\n\"We need a speaker, ideally someone who doesn't wanna be speaker and hasn't pursued that at all costs for his entire adult life, who will meet the moment and do everything possible to fight for the country,\" Good said before casting his vote to vacate.\n\nNancy Mace\n\nRepresents South Carolina's 1st District, a coastal region of the state including Charleston.\n\nElected in 2022.\n\nMace has previously broken from the party on abortion issues. She also recently introduced a bipartisan bill to address the rape kit backlog nationwide.\n\nIn an X thread, Mace said that she cast her vote as an independent voice in Congress to hold McCarthy accountable for not moving the needle on women's issues.\n\nMatt Rosendale\n\nRepresents Montana's 2nd District, covering the eastern part of the state, including Billings.\n\nElected in 2020.\n\nHe is a far-right conservative who supported Trump's false claims about the 2020 election and prioritized security for the southern border in his no-vote for supporting Ukraine, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"I do not take pleasure in what occurred yesterday. But Montanans did not send me to Washington to stand by and watch the Speaker of the House of Representatives sell the American people short by not moving forward with legislation to cut spending, secure our border, and make us energy dominant again,\" Rosendale said in a statement about his vote.\n\nMore:Speaker Donald Trump?

Matt Gaetz on Tuesday threatened to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., from his position as Speaker of the House.\n\n\"I rise today to serve notice − Mr. Speaker you are out of compliance with the agreement that allowed you to assume this role,\" Gaetz said on the House floor.\n\nGaetz cited several reasons for his threats, including McCarthy not holding votes on issues like term limits for lawmakers or balanced budgets. He also criticized McCarthy for not releasing the full security tapes from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.\n\nGaetz on Tuesday denounced McCarthy for what the Florida lawmaker called insufficient accountability for President Joe Biden's family and the lack of subpoenas filed against Biden's son, Hunter Biden.\n\nThreats from individual lawmakers to remove a House speaker hold more weight now. McCarthy agreed earlier this year to House Freedom Caucus demands to allow a single member to call for a vote, known as a motion to vacate, to oust the leader of the lower chamber. The vote needs a simple majority in the House to pass.\n\n\"The path forward for the House of Representatives is to either bring you into immediate, total compliance or remove you pursuant to a motion to vacate the chair,\" Gaetz said.\n\nGaetz: McCarthy didn't put House 'in position to succeed' on shutdown\n\nGaetz said on the House floor Tuesday that McCarthy did not put the House in a position to succeed as the government approaches a looming Sept. 30 shutdown date and still needs to pass 11 appropriations bills.\n\nThe Florida lawmaker called on McCarthy to hold votes on individual spending bills instead of a continuing resolution, a short-term extension GOP leadership has been considering to avert a shutdown. Gaetz said he will move to oust the speaker if a vote is held on the stopgap measure.\n\n\"Sept. 30 is rapidly approaching and you have not put us in a position to succeed. There is no way to pass all the individual appropriations bills now and it's not like we didn't know when Sept. 30 was going to show up on the calendar,\" he said.\n\n'Baby step': Gaetz calls for McCarthy to ramp up impeachment efforts\n\nGaetz was not impressed with McCarthy's Tuesday morning announcement that the House Oversight, Judiciary and Ways and Means committees will lead a formal impeachment inquiry against Biden.\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus member urged McCarthy to do more to subpoena Hunter Biden and other members of the Biden family after House Republicans have claimed that Biden financially benefited from his son's foreign dealings.\n\n\"This is a baby step following weeks of pressure from House conservatives to do more,\" he said of the endorsement.\n\nGaetz floated ousting McCarthy last spring\n\nThis isn't the first time Gaetz has floated the idea of introducing a motion to vacate that would remove McCarthy.\n\nMcCarthy faced a rebellion in the spring from the right flank of his party over his deal with President Joe Biden to suspend the debt ceiling.\n\nGaetz previously said if McCarthy failed to get at least half of House Republicans to vote for the agreement and relied on Democratic support for passage, it would be grounds for a motion to vacate McCarthy's speakership.\n\nIn January, Gaetz was one of several GOP detractors who voted against McCarthy's speakership at the beginning of the 118th Congress. Gaetz nominated and voted for Trump several times during the marathon 15 rounds of votes for speaker before voting \"present\" in the final tally that allowed McCarthy to cinch the role.\n\nMany of McCarthy's detractors rallied around him in exchange for concessions, some of which were never disclosed.\n\n\"Mr. Speaker, dust off our written January agreement. You have a copy. Reflect on the spirit of that agreement and build on the start that we had moments ago.

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona from their committees for inflammatory rhetoric and posts, McCarthy told Breitbart he would strip Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell, both of California, and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota of their committee assignments.\n\nSchiff and Swalwell serve on the House Intelligence Committee, while Omar serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\n“The Democrats have created a new thing where they’re picking and choosing who could be on committee. Never in the history have you had the majority tell the minority who could be on committee,” McCarthy lamented in the interview.\n\nIn response, Swalwell told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Monday night that McCarthy’s vow was “purely for retaliation.”\n\n“He’s targeting me and he’s targeting Schiff and he’s targeting Ms. Omar because we’re effective. Not for any other reason,” Swalwell said on “Anderson Cooper 360.” “This is the Trumpization of politics. … He’s doing it purely for retaliation purposes and he’s not even offering a fig leaf as to why he’s doing it.”\n\nMcCarthy had previously hinted that if Republicans win back the House, a GOP majority may kick some House Democrats off their committee seats. “[House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi has set new policies here. Those same members that I talked about in my speech … voted for these new policies,” the California Republican said in November, alluding to Schiff, Swalwell, Omar and Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, also of California. “This isn’t about threats, but it’s about holding people accountable.”\n\n“I think the majority is going to have to approve any of those members on the committees on which they can serve,” he said at the time.\n\nPelosi had told CNN in response that she was not concerned that Republicans plan to retaliate should the GOP win back the House. “No, we would not walk away from our responsibilities for fear of something they may do in the future,” the California Democrat said at the time.\n\nGosar was censured and removed from his committee seats for posting a photoshopped anime video to his Twitter and Instagram accounts showing him appearing to kill Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and attacking President Joe Biden.

She then guided Democrats as they rode the waves of popular opinion, seeing their power swell to a 257-seat majority after the 2008 elections, ultimately crash to a 188-seat minority, and then rise once again.\n\nHer political career was marked by an extraordinary ability to understand and overcome those political shifts, keeping conflicting factions of her party united in passing major legislation. She earned the Speaker’s gavel twice – after the 2006 and 2018 elections – and lost it after the 2010 elections.\n\nOf late, she has conducted a string of accomplishments with one of the slimmest party splits in history, passing a $1.9 trillion pandemic aid package last year and a $750 billion health care, energy and climate bill in August.\n\nHer legislative victories in the Biden era cemented her reputation as one of the most successful party leaders in Congress. During the Obama administration, Pelosi was instrumental to the passage of the massive economic stimulus bill and the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which provides over 35 million Americans health care coverage.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the California liberal has been relentlessly attacked by Republicans, who portray her as the personification of a party for the coastal elite. “We have fired Nancy Pelosi,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Fox News on Wednesday, after Republicans won back the chamber.\n\nIn recent years, the anger directed toward her has turned menacing. During the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, pro-Trump rioters searched for her — and last month, a male assailant attacked Paul Pelosi, the speaker’s husband, with a hammer at the couple’s home in San Francisco, while she was in Washington.\n\nPelosi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper this month that her decision to retire would be influenced by the politically motivated attack. Paul Pelosi was released from the hospital two weeks ago after surgery to repair a skull fracture and injuries to his arm and hands.\n\nAfter thanking her colleagues for their well-wishes for Paul, the House chamber broke out into a standing ovation.\n\nDemocrats now look to finally choose Pelosi’s successor\n\nPelosi’s long reign became a source of tension within her own party. She won the gavel after the 2018 elections by promising her own party that she would leave her leadership post by 2022.\n\nMassachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, who previously tried to oust Pelosi, told CNN it’s time for a new chapter.\n\n“She’s a historic speaker who’s accomplished an incredible amount, but I also think there are a lot of Democrats ready for a new chapter,” said Moulton.\n\nBut some Democrats praised Pelosi and said they wished she would remain leader. Asked about her decision, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer clutched his chest and said he had pleaded with her to stay.\n\n“I told her when she called me and told me this and all that, I said ‘please change your mind. We need you here,’” Schumer said.\n\nHouse Democrats appear likely to choose New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, 52, to succeed Pelosi as leader, though Democrats won’t vote until November 30.\n\nAfter her speech, Pelosi wouldn’t tell reporters who’d she support. But House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn announced they would also step down from their leadership posts, and endorsed Jeffries to succeed Pelosi. Hoyer said Jeffries “will make history for the institution of the House and for our country.” Clyburn added that he hoped Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Pete Aguilar would join Jeffries in House Democratic leadership.\n\nBefore Pelosi’s announcement, Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, told CNN that she expects her caucus to throw their support behind Jeffries, and help him become the first Black House Democratic leader.\n\n“If she steps aside, I’m very clear that Hakeem Jeffries is the person that I will be voting for and leading the Congressional Black Caucus to vote for,” said Beatty.”I don’t always speak for everybody, but I’m very comfortable saying I believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries.”\n\nRetiring North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield, a former CBC chairman, told CNN that Jeffries “is prepared for the moment” if Pelosi steps aside. Butterfield said he thought Jeffries would run.\n\nThe longtime Democratic leader told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday that members of her caucus had asked her to “consider” running in the party’s leadership elections at the end of the month, adding: “But, again, let’s just get through the election.”\n\nAny decision to run again, Pelosi said, “is about family, and also my colleagues and what we want to do is go forward in a very unified way, as we go forward to prepare for the Congress at hand.”\n\n“Nonetheless, a great deal is at stake because we’ll be in a presidential election. So my decision will again be rooted in the wishes of my family and the wishes of my caucus,” she continued. “But none of it will be very much considered until we see what the outcome of all of this is. And there are all kinds of ways to exert influence.”\n\nPelosi is a towering figure in American politics with a history-making legacy of shattering glass ceilings as the first and so far only woman to be speaker of the US House of Representatives.\n\nPelosi was first elected to the House in 1987, when she won a special election to fill a seat representing California’s 5th Congressional District.\n\nWhen she was first elected speaker, Pelosi reflected on the significance of the event and what it meant for women in the United States.\n\n“This is an historic moment,” she said in a speech after accepting the speaker’s gavel. “It’s an historic moment for the Congress. It’s an historic moment for the women of America.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.", "authors": ["Alex Rogers Annie Grayer Manu Raju", "Alex Rogers", "Annie Grayer", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/politics/kevin-mccarthy-midterm-results-house-republicans/index.html", "title": "Kevin McCarthy moves to secure potential speakership | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nHouse GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy is moving swiftly to lock down the votes to claim the speaker’s gavel as a hard-right faction of his conference discusses whether to mount a long-shot challenge to complicate his bid and force concessions in the process, according to multiple GOP sources.\n\nMcCarthy privately spoke to his closest advisers and confidantes in a Wednesday morning phone call just hours after his party appeared on track to take the House but fell short of their bullish expectations of a massive GOP landslide. The California Republican tapped a group of members to be on his whip team that will help him secure the 218 votes in order to win the speakership in January, with GOP lawmakers on the call promising to “work hard to get him elected,” according to a source familiar with the matter. And several allies were seen popping in and out of McCarthy’s office on Wednesday as they started to hash out and execute their game plan.\n\n“Yes,” McCarthy said confidently Wednesday night as he left the Capitol and was asked if he had the votes to assume the speakership.\n\nBut McCarthy’s easy ascension to the speakership will be determined in large part by the size of a potential GOP majority. If McCarthy maintains a narrow majority, then the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus could stand in the way of his leadership ambitions. CNN has not yet projected a Republican takeover of the chamber.\n\nA source familiar with the House Freedom Caucus’ deliberations told CNN on Wednesday morning that there are around two dozen current and incoming members who are willing to vote against McCarthy if he doesn’t offer them concessions. They are actively discussing putting up a nominal challenger to face McCarthy in next week’s leadership elections in an effort to force the GOP leader to give them more influence in how the House operates, the source said.\n\nMcCarthy, who sent a letter to the conference Wednesday afternoon officially declaring his bid for the speakership and asking members for their support, spoke with some potential GOP holdouts behind closed doors throughout the day, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the controversial conservative who was booted from her committee assignments by Democrats – and a number of Republicans – over her past incendiary rhetoric. Greene has pushed for a spot on the powerful House Oversight Committee in a GOP majority.\n\nLeaving McCarthy’s office, Greene would not say if she’d get what she’s been seeking.\n\n“No comment,” Greene said when asked if she’d support McCarthy for speaker.\n\nNext week’s leadership election is just the first step in the process. McCarthy would need to win a majority of his conference’s support next week to be nominated for speaker before a January vote when he would need 218 votes of the full House to win the gavel. The hope, the source said, is that if they back a challenger to McCarthy in next week’s elections, it would force the California Republican to cut a deal in order to secure their support in the January speaker’s race when he wouldn’t be able to afford to lose more than a handful of GOP votes in a narrow Republican majority.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus’ strategy will come into sharper focus by week’s end as members weigh their options and as incoming lawmakers come to Washington for initial meetings. Rep. Matt Gaetz, an unabashed McCarthy critic who is not a member of the Freedom Caucus but is closely aligned with the group, also started calling members to talk strategy about the speaker’s race, according to a source familiar.\n\nAmong their demands: Making it easier for individual members to call for a vote ousting a sitting speaker, an idea that McCarthy has long rejected and one that was wielded over former Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio. The same source said that the Freedom Caucus wants more representation on the panel that makes selections on members’ committee assignments. They are also calling on GOP leaders to commit to slowing down the legislative process and give them more time to review even non-controversial bills.\n\nHardliners may also push for promises related to launching investigations and impeachment proceedings into President Joe Biden or members of his Cabinet.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican and former chairman of the Freedom Caucus, told a right-wing streaming network that a McCarthy speakership should not be a “foregone conclusion,” complaining that a red wave never materialized and accusing McCarthy of “backpedaling” on impeachment.\n\n“McCarthy has a lot of chips to cash in,” said a senior GOP source. “But he’s gonna have to cash in every single one of them.”\n\nMcCarthy could also win over detectors with plum committee assignments, lush office space and other perks. Prior to Tuesday, there was also talk of adding an extra leadership position to his team, which could also be used to woo critics.\n\nMcCarthy allies are touting his Tuesday endorsement from former President Donald Trump for the speaker’s gavel, something that could help with staunch Trump backers in the House GOP conference. Moreover, McCarthy has long moved to develop a good standing with even the most rebellious forces within the Freedom Caucus and has been in talks with some members of the group about their role in a GOP majority for weeks, according to Republican sources.\n\nPlus, McCarthy allies believe Republicans will credit him for the hundreds of millions of dollars that his outside group raised and spent in key races. McCarthy has been calling victorious GOP candidates and members since Tuesday night.\n\nMcCarthy’s pitch to members, according to a source familiar, has been relatively straight forward: the GOP picked up seats two cycles in a row under his watch, and he is on the verge of delivering Republicans the majority – which will arm them subpoena power and allow them to serve as a check on the Biden administration.\n\nWhile McCarthy’s allies say the GOP leader is willing to hear members out, they believe negotiating with members could become a slippery slope – though McCarthy may have no choice, depending on the margins.\n\nMcCarthy had hoped to pick up at least 20 seats to give him a cushion in both the speaker’s race and to help push through his agenda. It’s unclear if they can get there as many races remain too early for CNN to call.\n\nOther leadership races in flux\n\nAside from the speaker’s race, Tuesday’s underwhelming performance for the GOP has scrambled other leadership races.\n\nThe race for House GOP whip – a position that will only open up if Republicans win the majority – was already competitive, though Rep. Tom Emmer, who chairs the House GOP’s campaign arm, was seen as having the edge since he was likely to be rewarded if they had a strong night.\n\nNow, Republicans say it could be tougher for Emmer to pull out a win.\n\nEmmer told reporters Tuesday he still plans to run and that he doesn’t know if a smaller majority impacts his bid. But his pitch to members is similar to McCarthy’s, saying: “we delivered.”\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, a Trump ally and the head of the conservative Republican Study Committee, also officially declared his candidacy for the whip’s position. And Rep. Drew Ferguson of Georgia, the current deputy whip, is also vying for the post, arguing that his experience on the whip’s team will be even more valuable in a slimmer majority, where the chief vote counting job will be crucial for governing.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona Manu Raju", "Melanie Zanona", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/07/politics/kevin-mccarthy-interview-border-security/index.html", "title": "Kevin McCarthy outlines Republicans' agenda days before midterms ...", "text": "McAllen, Texas CNN —\n\nHouse GOP leader Kevin McCarthy is vowing to secure the border, cut back on government spending and launch rigorous investigations into the Biden administration if Republicans win the House on Tuesday, reflecting a mix of priorities as McCarthy will be forced to contend with an increasingly hardline and pro-Trump conference that is itching to impeach President Joe Biden.\n\nIn an exclusive, wide-ranging interview with CNN, two days before the midterm elections, McCarthy outlined his plans for power, which includes tackling inflation, rising crime and border security – three issues that have become central to Republicans’ closing pitch to voters. To hammer home that message, McCarthy – who has been barnstorming the country in the run-up to the midterms – rallied here on Sunday for a trio of Hispanic GOP women who are vying to represent key districts along the southern border, a key part of the party’s strategy for winning the majority.\n\n“The first thing you’ll see is a bill to control the border first,” McCarthy told CNN, when asked for specifics about his party’s immigration plans. “You’ve got to get control over the border. You’ve had almost 2 million people just this year alone coming across.”\n\nThe Biden administration continues to rely on a Trump-era pandemic emergency rule, known as Title 42, that allows border authorities to turn migrants away at the US-Mexico border. In fiscal year 2022, amid mass migration in the Western hemisphere, US border encounters topped 2 million, according to US Customs and Border Protection data. Of those, more than 1 million were turned away under Title 42.\n\nBut McCarthy also highlighted oversight and investigations as a key priority for a GOP-led House, listing potential probes into the chaotic Afghanistan pullout, the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic and how the administration has dealt with parents and school board meetings. And he left the door open to launching eventual impeachment proceedings, which some of his members have already begun to call for.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Kevin McCarthy asked about impeaching Biden if GOP wins House. Hear his answer 02:29 - Source: CNN\n\n“We will never use impeachment for political purposes,” McCarthy said. “That doesn’t mean if something rises to the occasion, it would not be used at any other time.”\n\nAnd with the MAGA-wing calling to cut off funding to Ukraine while the GOP’s defense hawks vow not to abandon the country amid its war with Russia, McCarthy attempted to reaffirm his support for Ukraine while saying they would not automatically rubber stamp any additional requests for aid.\n\n“I’m very supportive of Ukraine,” McCarthy said. “I think there has to be accountability going forward. … You always need, not a blank check, but make sure the resources are going to where it is needed. And make sure Congress, and the Senate, have the ability to debate it openly.”\n\nMcCarthy declined to name how many seats he thinks Republicans will pick up on Tuesday, but said he was confident it will “be at least enough to win the majority.” McCarthy did say that, in his eyes, “anywhere over 20 is a red wave.”\n\nAnd McCarthy, who had to drop out of the speaker’s race in 2015 amid opposition from the far right House Freedom Caucus, told CNN he believes he’ll have the support this time around to secure the coveted speaker’s gavel – both from his conference and from former President Donald Trump.\n\n“I’ll believe we’ll have the votes for speaker, yes,” McCarthy said. “I think Trump will be very supportive.”\n\nMcCarthy signs a \"Make America Great Again\" hat after an event featuring south Texas Republican congressional candidates in McAllen on Sunday. Tamir Kalifa for CNN\n\nMcCarthy outlines vision for the GOP House majority\n\nOn the influx of migrants at the border, McCarthy said “there’s a number of different ways” his majority will tackle the problem, but said Republicans would not put a bill on the floor to fix the broken immigration system until the border is secure.\n\n“I think ‘Stay in Mexico’ you have to have right off the bat,” he said, referring to the controversial policy where migrants were forced to remain in Mexico while they wait for their immigration proceedings in the United States.\n\nTo help stem the flow of fentanyl coming across the border, McCarthy said “you first do a very frontal attack on China to stop the poison from coming,” and then “provide the resources that the border agents need” and “make sure that fentanyl anytime anybody who wants to move it, you can prosecute him for the death penalty.”\n\nWhen pressed for specific on his plans to fight crime, McCarthy said Republicans would fund the police, provide grants for recruiting and training, and look at how crimes are being prosecuted. And to bring down inflation and gas prices, he said they would reduce government spending and make America more energy independent, though he did not name specific bills.\n\nMost bills will be primarily messaging endeavors, unlikely to overcome the president’s veto or the Senate’s 60-vote threshold, though they would have to pass legislation to fund the government and raise the national borrowing limit at some point next year. McCarthy, however, signaled Republicans will demand spending cuts in exchange for lifting the debt ceiling, teeing up a risky fiscal showdown that could lead to a disastrous debt default.\n\nMcCarthy cheers as Texas congressional candidate Monica De La Cruz is introduced during an event in McAllen on Sunday. Tamir Kalifa for CNN\n\n“If you’re going to give a person a higher limit, wouldn’t you first say you should change your behavior, so you just don’t keep raising and all the time?” he said. “You shouldn’t just say, ‘Oh, I’m gonna let you keep spending money.’ No household should do that.”\n\nMcCarthy acknowledged Republicans were willing to raise the debt ceiling under Trump, but said the calculus is different now because Democrats spent trillions of dollars under Biden.\n\nWhen pressed on whether he’s willing to risk a default by using the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip, McCarthy insisted that wouldn’t happen: “People talk about risking it. You don’t risk a default.”\n\nWith eyes on the speakership, McCarthy vows to restore Greene’s committee assignments\n\nAside from working to recapture the majority, McCarthy has also been campaigning to win the speaker’s gavel. And a key part of that strategy has been elevating potential critics and controversial Trump allies.\n\nTo that end, McCarthy has vowed to reinstate freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia to her committee assignments, despite being stripped of her assignments by Democrats last year for her inflammatory remarks.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Kevin McCarthy reveals whether he will run for speaker if GOP wins majority 01:19 - Source: CNN\n\nMeanwhile, McCarthy reiterated his plans to boot Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat, from his seat on the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nWhen asked if he has any restrictions about which committees Greene can serve, McCarthy – who will have a direct say in doling out those assignments – said “no.” Greene has previously told CNN she wants a seat on the House Oversight Committee, which will play a key role in GOP-led investigations in a majority.\n\n“She’s going to have committees to serve on, just like every other member … Members request different committees and as we go through the steering committee, we’ll look at it,” he said. “She can put through the committees she wants, just like any other member in our conference that gets elected.”\n\nGreene is not the only member who has spouted conspiracy theories or incendiary rhetoric. Most recently, some Republicans have mocked the brutal attack on Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, or peddled fringe conspiracy theories about the incident.\n\nAsked his message to those Republicans, McCarthy said: “What happened to Paul Pelosi is wrong, and I think we should not get into this rhetoric.”\n\nBut when pressed how he would tamp down that type of rhetoric, McCarthy pointed a finger at Democrats.\n\n“The first thing I’ll ask the president to do is not to call half the nation idiots or say things about them because they have a difference of opinion,” he said. “I think leadership matters, and I think it probably starts with the president. And it will start with the speaker as well.”\n\nAgain asked how he’ll handle members of his own party who spread dangerous conspiracy theories, McCarthy responded: “I’ve watched people on both sides of the aisle,” he said. “If I’m speaker, I’ll be the speaker for the whole House. So it won’t be looking at just Republicans. We’ll be looking at Democrats as well.”", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona Kristin Wilson", "Melanie Zanona", "Kristin Wilson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/15/politics/house-speaker-elections-what-matters/index.html", "title": "House speaker elections and floor fights, explained | CNN Politics", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe 118th Congress will begin on Tuesday, bringing in a new era of Republican control of the House and a high-stakes leadership fight that will determine who controls the speaker’s gavel.\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy has the support of a majority of Republicans to be the GOP leader but has so far not secured enough votes to become House speaker.\n\nWhat’s standing between McCarthy and the position he has long sought is a handful of conservative lawmakers. These conservatives, many members of the Freedom Caucus, don’t trust McCarthy and have not yet been convinced by him or those lobbying on his behalf, including former President Donald Trump, that McCarthy will appropriately stand up to Democrats and President Joe Biden.\n\nRepublicans will only have a slim majority – 222 Republicans compared with 212 Democrats – which means McCarthy can’t afford many defections if he is to find the 218 votes needed to make him speaker of the House.\n\nHow the day will unfold\n\nCongress can’t really function until it has a House speaker; the position is filled on the first day of a new Congress, January 3, even before members-elect take the oath of office.\n\nMembers will meet in the morning to tie off loose ends and close the 117th Congress. Then, at noon Eastern time, the clerk of the House will gavel in the new Congress and will call a quorum. The first major order of business will be the speaker election. Democrats will place Rep. Hakeem Jeffries’ name into nomination, and Republicans are set to place McCarthy’s name.\n\nThen the clerk will call the roll and each member will state the name of the person whom they are voting for. If no one amasses a majority of votes cast, it goes to a second ballot. If another ballot is needed, it is not clear if Congress will recess the chamber or if members will continue voting.\n\nMembers can vote for anyone they want\n\nThere’s no rule that the speaker is a House member. Members can vote for anyone, and they can protest by skipping the vote or voting “present.” The vast majority will vote for their party’s leader.\n\nBoth parties met last year to determine their leadership, with Democrats selecting Jeffries and Republicans agreeing to nominate McCarthy, but by a margin that signaled a possible floor fight ahead.\n\nMcCarthy faces a long-shot challenger: hard-right Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona. The challenge highlights the opposition McCarthy is up against and could draw votes away from him.\n\nIf no one wins a majority …\n\nLawmakers will continue voting until someone wins the majority. They can take successive votes on January 3. They can adjourn to horse trade and deal among themselves. But the House does not kick off the new Congress until a speaker is elected.\n\nThis is what people are talking about when they refer to a “floor fight.” It’s when House members require multiple ballots, or votes, to elect their speaker.\n\nIt’s been 100 years\n\nThe chamber of the House of Representatives is seen at the Capitol on February 28, 2022. J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nIn the 200-plus years since the first two-year Congress met in 1789, such floor fights have occurred just 14 times, according to the House historian.\n\nAll but one of those multi-ballot speaker elections took place before the Civil War as the two-party system was evolving. Back then, floor fights were routine.\n\nA floor fight has only taken place once since the Civil War, exactly 100 years ago, when it took nine ballots for Rep. Frederick Gillett of Massachusetts to be elected speaker in 1923.\n\nThere is some mystery here\n\nPolitico notes it’s been so long that the exact procedure if no one has a majority is a smidge unclear. A Congressional Research Service brief on electing the speaker simply says that if no one gets a majority, the vote is repeated.\n\nThere have been exceptions to the majority vote\n\nWay back in 1849, the House had been in session so long without being able to elect a speaker – 19 days – that members voted to elect their speaker with a plurality rather than a majority. Members ultimately confirmed the plurality election with a majority vote.\n\nThe epic record for a floor fight\n\nIn 1855 and 1856, it took 133 separate votes for Rep. Nathaniel Banks of Massachusetts to be elected, again by a plurality and not a majority.\n\nThe process stretched over more than a month and included a sort of inquisition on the House floor of the three contenders. They answered questions about their view of the expansion of slavery. Read more from the House historian’s website.\n\nIt’s also interesting to read about Banks; his official House biography notes he was elected to office as a Republican, an independent, a member of the America Party and as a Democrat.\n\nIt doesn’t always require 218 votes\n\nOne important thing to remember is that McCarthy does not technically need 218 votes to become speaker. A majority of those present and voting is required to get the speakership, which is usually 218 lawmakers. But if enough people skip the vote or vote “present,” the number of votes required for a majority can drop.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi was elected with 216 votes in 2021.\n\nFormer Speaker John Boehner won reelection to the post with 216 votes in 2015 after beating back a conservative rebellion like the one McCarthy is dealing with now.\n\nMost of the negotiation and arm-twisting happens long before the floor vote. Pelosi got 220 votes in 2019 after turning most of the fellow Democrats who opposed her. She did so by agreeing to serve only another few years as speaker, a pledge she kept by announcing her decision in November to not seek reelection for leadership.\n\nAbility to remove the speaker is a sticking point\n\nConservatives who oppose McCarthy have said they want to reinstate a dormant and arcane power to allow any member to call for a vote to remove the speaker at any time. Read more about the “motion to vacate.”\n\nRepublicans who oppose McCarthy see it as a tool for accountability. McCarthy and his allies see it as a recipe for bad governance if he is constantly at risk of losing the post that’s so difficult for him to attain.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

And even looked up a little bit to try and get the lay of the land … I’m saying, ‘How did all that happen in just those few seconds?’ It didn’t make any sense. Like, I just don’t understand it.”\n\nHarris died just days before the 50th anniversary of the catch, and the Steelers had planned to retire his No. 32 jersey during halftime of their game against the Raiders on Saturday.\n\nThe NFL Network in 2019 named the Immaculate Reception the top play in the 100 years of the league.\n\nThe play was not without controversy: There were no convincing replays to determine who deflected the ball when two opposing players collided and whether the ball actually hit the ground when Harris caught it.\n\nIn the interview, Russo said some believe that the nose of the football hit the turf, “But you’re saying that’s not the case, correct?”\n\n“I have no idea, I have no idea,” Harris said. “I remember nothing. That’s what baffles me…”\n\nRusso noted Harris was “a long way away from where the ball ricocheted.” If another Steeler had touched the ball, Harris’ catch would not have been legal.\n\n“I have no recollection of seeing the ball at all,” Harris said. “I have no visual of the ball. I have no recollection. But look at … how fast it came back.”\n\nHarry Cabluck/AP\n\n‘You don’t practice stuff like this’\n\nLooking at the film, Harris says, “I’m thinking that it could only have been” Raiders defender Jack Tatum “that the ball bounced off of” before Harris made the shoestring catch. Tatum had collided with Steelers fullback Frenchy Fuqua.\n\nIn explaining how he made the play, Harris noted that he “always had great reflexes but you don’t practice stuff like this. … So it kind of blows my mind.”\n\nThe Steelers won the game 13-7 for the team’s first-ever playoff victory but lost their next game. Still, the team went on to dominate the 1970s, winning four Super Bowls.\n\nRusso, the host, opened the interview by asking, “How are you today, OK pal?” It was likely the last interview Harris did before his death was announced on Wednesday. His cause of death was not provided.\n\n“Doing great. Fantastic,” Harris said, though he was coughing here and there. “And, like as you said, 50 years ago, and, and it still feels brand new.”\n\nHarris then went on to talk about the game-winning drive, how it started off poorly and left the Steelers in a desperate spot.\n\n“So, things didn’t go too well on those first three plays, as you know. And then it gets down to fourth down. A long way to go. 22 seconds.\n\nAnd I go into the huddle and I tell myself, ‘Franco, this will probably be the last play of the season. It was a good season. Just play it till the end.’\n\nAnd (the coach) called that 66 halfback option.”\n\nHarris’ assignment was to stay in and block.\n\nHe recalled that “there wasn’t much … adrenaline” in the huddle.\n\nWe were winning the whole game and right at the end (the Raiders) scored. It seemed more of a letdown than anything.”\n\nHarris joined the Seattle Seahawks in 1984. Barry Sweet/AP\n\nRusso noted that Harris “did block well” on the play and noticed that quarterback Terry Bradshaw was scrambling under pressure from the defense.\n\n“My thought was to release to be an outlet pass,” Harris said. “And Bradshaw, being as, you know, big and as strong as he is, you know, guys trying to bring him down, he’s able to fight them off and get the ball into the air.”\n\nHarris said when the ball was in the air, “I tell myself, right, I tell myself ‘Go to the ball, go to the ball.’”\n\nHarris said that was his instinct because that was what he was taught as a running back in college, under Joe Paterno at Penn State University.\n\n“That’s what Joe preached to us all four years at Penn State. You know, always go to the ball … And so I start taking some steps to the ball and I remember nothing after that… which blows my mind, that I have no visual, no recollection of anything until I am stiff arming (Raiders defender) Jimmy Warren, going into the end zone.”\n\nSome old-time Raiders still salty\n\nHarris noted how important it was that he didn’t dive for the ball. In those days when a player hits the ground while possessing the ball, he was officially down and could not advance it.\n\n“How lucky am I that I was conscious that, you know, catch it that low without diving for it,” Harris said.\n\nHarris said that after the players collided and the ball deflected into the air, some of the Raiders started to clap and celebrate.\n\n“And the Raiders stop, just for a few seconds, and that few seconds that they stopped gave me the head start to get into the end zone.”\n\nAll these years later, when some old-time Raiders still assert that the catch wasn’t a legal catch, Harris says he pays it no mind.\n\n“As a matter of fact,” Harris said, “I feel good that they’re still sulking about that.”", "authors": ["David J.

South Carolina, as expected, was called for President Donald Trump. The crowd, wearing masks and spread out across the ballroom, groaned.\n\nIn the days leading up to Election Day, the House majority whip had campaigned across his home state pleading with South Carolinians to follow his lead, to vote for Joe Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris. He called on them to support a younger generation in Congress who could take the lead.\n\nThere was a fish fry, a drive-in, an evening rally, watch parties, visits to polling sites and back-to-back interviews. It was an unforgiving pace and a risky one for an 80-year-old Black man in the midst of a pandemic.\n\nAs a young man, Clyburn had faced down baton-waving sheriff deputies so the next generation of African Americans could sit at any lunch counter, shop at any department store and go to any school. Now, here he was again, trying to make America live up to its promise of a just nation.\n\nHe was troubled by racial divisiveness ripping at the nation’s fabric, the novel coronavirus crippling Black and brown communities, the nation’s poor getting poorer. He feared another four years under Trump.\n\nThe recent deaths of the Rev. C.T. Vivian and U.S. Rep. John Lewis, his friends and fellow civil rights legends, made more urgent the need to ready the next generation of leaders.\n\nAt stake was the goodness of the country.\n\n“This ain't about me. It's about my children, it's about my grandchildren, and all others that are similarly situated,’’ Clyburn said. “It’s all about the future.”\n\nIn the ballroom, Clyburn’s phone buzzed. He looked at his iPhone 11 and clicked the green accept button before stepping into the hall.\n\nIt was Joe Biden, calling to thank him.\n\n“I would never be in this position, but for you,’’ Clyburn heard him say.\n\n“You’re quite welcome,’’ Clyburn answered.\n\nIt wasn’t looking good. Trump had an early lead, including in key battleground states.\n\nClyburn walked out of the ballroom just past midnight, leaving behind half-empty glasses. He remained hopeful America would choose a different direction.\n\n“I didn’t expect for it to be that tight,” Clyburn said. But “I never thought we were going to lose.”\n\nA renewed fight for civil rights\n\nTwo days before Election Day, Clyburn stepped out of a black Suburban sporting well-worn Adidas sneakers and a T-shirt that read, “VOTE.” Inside the O was “SC State University 1896,” for his alma mater, South Carolina State University.\n\nClyburn pulled up his dark blue mask emblazoned with the words “Majority Whip J. Clyburn.”\n\nThe smell of fish frying filled the air, a nod to a Clyburn campaign tradition.\n\nA gaggle of reporters thrust tape recorders toward his chest and asked about Biden’s prospects. “He's done much better in South Carolina than anybody thought he would,’’ Clyburn told them.\n\nClyburn is credited with helping revive Biden’s struggling campaign earlier this year. Just days before South Carolina’s primary, Clyburn gave Biden his coveted endorsement, helping him nail a decisive win and providing his campaign with unstoppable momentum.\n\nOutside the community center in Hollywood, a small town near Charleston, Clyburn worked his way through the crowd. Some posed for pictures. Others swarmed in like he was a deacon bearing good news.\n\n“Optimistic’’ by Sounds of Blackness boomed in the background.\n\nClyburn grew up in a close family in the small city of Sumter.\n\nIn 1960, he and Lewis were both 20 years old when they met at the organizing meeting of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, a force in the civil rights movement. As a college student, Clyburn helped lead more than 1,000 students dressed in their Sunday best on a march downtown for a sit-in at segregated lunch counters.\n\nIt was one of many times when Clyburn’s activism landed him in jail. He was locked up when he met a fellow demonstrator and his future wife, Emily England. They would be married 58 years and have three daughters – Mignon, Jennifer and Angela – before she passed away last fall.\n\nIn 1992, Clyburn was elected the first African American to serve in Congress from South Carolina since Reconstruction. A wall in his leadership suite in the U.S. Capitol is lined with Black men who represented South Carolina in Congress in the late 1800s.\n\nIn his 27 years in Congress, Clyburn has pushed to restore a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act; advocate for more funds for historically Black colleges and universities; and work to preserve civil rights landmarks and culture, including the Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor along the coast.\n\nWith the recent passing of Lewis, Clyburn said some colleagues see him as the “moral conscience of the Congress.’’\n\nHe wants others to fill that role.\n\n“What he’s doing now is not just preparing, but making sure the next generation of leaders are overprepared for the moment,” said Antjuan Seawright, a political adviser to Clyburn.\n\nIt had been months since Clyburn regularly campaigned in person. The pandemic had sidelined him. He lost a 79-year-old cousin, Almeta Sinclair, to COVID-19 in April.\n\nWith Election Day approaching, Clyburn ventured out.\n\n“God keeps his angels safe,’’ Seawright said. “There’s no doubt that Jim Clyburn is one of God’s closest angels.”\n\nOn this Sunday, Clyburn was campaigning to get more Democrats in Washington, including South Carolina’s Jaime Harrison, who was running for the Senate, and U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham, who was trying to keep his seat.\n\nClyburn hoped a victory for Harrison, a former aide and protege, over GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally, would send a signal that vitriol rhetoric and racial divisiveness were not acceptable, not in the South, not in the country.\n\n“We will see a New South that is bold, that is inclusive, that is diverse, where all of our voices are valued and heard,” Harrison repeated in his stump speech.\n\nClyburn, who pushed for a Black woman to be on Biden’s ticket, also knew what it would mean if Harris won as the first woman vice president-elect and the first African American and Asian American to serve in the role. Her run had generated support and pride from an army of Black women, including his own daughters and granddaughters.\n\nClyburn was driven to stay on the campaign trail, including virtually, by what he saw as the unraveling of the country.\n\nIt bothered him that people had to take to the streets over police brutality and inequities, much like he and others did in the 1960s.\n\nHe was angry that the federal government hadn’t done enough to help Black and brown communities that have been hit disproportionately hard by the novel coronavirus. He heads an oversight panel on COVID-19.\n\nClyburn has complained about Trump’s efforts to strip away provisions of the Affordable Care Act, his attacks on mail ballots and his handling of the COVID 19 pandemic.\n\n“We have a president who has decided that it’s much more important to win a political argument than to provide safety and security for all our citizens,’’ Clyburn told the crowd in Hollywood.\n\n“Amen,” some shouted back.\n\nAfter the speech, Clyburn got back into the Suburban manned by his security detail for a 25-mile trip to North Charleston. He didn't have time to eat his fried whiting sandwich.\n\nHis next event was a drive-in rally to stump for Biden, Harrison and Cunningham. Clyburn ruled out climbing onto the back of a black pickup truck serving as the stage. He was too old for that, he told the crowd.\n\nParked on the front row, Nichole Green waved her Biden/Harris sign through her sunroof. She had waited for Clyburn to announce who he would endorse for the state’s primary before deciding on a candidate.\n\n“When I heard it, I was like, ‘OK, here we go…That was the stamp of approval,” said Green, 46, a former director of the Old Slave Mart Museum in Charleston.\n\nCunningham said Clyburn’s backing matters.\n\n“It speaks volumes to have him out here and to be shoulder to shoulder with this giant in history,” Cunningham said after the speech. “I don’t know if there’s any bigger endorsement in South Carolina.”\n\nWith his final campaign event done for the day, Clyburn climbed into the SUV and headed home.\n\n‘Restoring the goodness'\n\nEarly on Election Day, Clyburn’s Suburban pulled up to the polling site at the Greenview Park Community Recreation Center in Columbia.\n\nHe strolled over to a poll worker stationed at the door. The woman, sporting a blue Hillman College sweatshirt, stood as the congressman neared. Sharon Hanks knew him as “Mr. Clyburn who used to fuss at me.’’\n\n“You don’t even know who I am,’’ Hanks said as she pulled down her surgical mask.\n\n“Oh, Lord,’’ Clyburn said.\n\n“Jim and Vivian Davis’ daughter,’’ she said.\n\n“Yes!’’ he said. “How’s your mom doing?”\n\nInside, poll workers paused from eating lunch to greet Clyburn, bumping elbows and chatting about their families.\n\n“You make me proud!’’ a woman shouted.\n\nFor Clyburn, community means helping others, like the Bible taught him. The son of a minister and chairman of the Democratic Faith Working Group, Clyburn said his faith is at the heart of every vote he casts and every decision he makes, including why he supports Biden.\n\n“He is basically just a good, decent guy,’’ Clyburn said.\n\n“This campaign is all about restoring the goodness of the American people. This country’s greatness is under threat because we’ve had a lack of goodness in the White House.”\n\nHe has been inspired by a favorite gospel song, \"Stand'' by Donnie McClurkin.\n\n“When there’s nothing left else to do you, just stand,’’ the song says.\n\nClyburn had a wish list for Biden’s administration.\n\nTackle the deadly virus was at the top.\n\nNext, he wants a presidential commission to study the impact of the 1986, 1988 and 1994 crime bills that sent thousands of Black people to prison over drug convictions.\n\n“You've got to ask yourself, ‘How is it that a young person in South Carolina can end up in jail for 20 years for doing something that's legal in Colorado and some other states,’’ Clyburn said.\n\nHe also wants more broadband services in rural communities, community health centers and support for his program aimed at reducing poverty. He wanted a plan to provide safe drinking water, improve sewage systems and expand energy sources.\n\nThose policies, Clyburn said, would help heal racial tensions driven by a lack of economic opportunities.\n\n“People feel they’re being left behind,’’ he said. “When people see that everybody has a seat at the table, everybody benefits from the economy, then they don’t have to blame the other person.”\n\nGetting Black voters to the polls\n\nPolls were slated to close in a few hours. Clyburn sat in his campaign headquarters in Columbia determined to get more Black voters to support Biden.\n\nA Trump win, he said, would end the nation’s pursuit of a “more perfect union.”\n\nHis office had been converted into a studio, with two folding tables, two black umbrellas and a studio light.\n\nClyburn did a quick interview on Fox News. He hopped on a call with a Black-owned gospel station where he urged listeners to vote before polls closed.\n\n“It’s very serious,'' he warned.\n\nThere were more interviews: MSNBC, NPR, a British news station.\n\nClyburn turned down a request from another gospel radio station. He didn’t like that he was told he couldn’t talk about a particular candidate. They don’t do that for white guests, he complained.\n\nIn between interviews, Clyburn scrolled through his phone reading news reports. One polling site in North Carolina had a power outage and shut down for 45 minutes.\n\nTraffic was slow in one precinct in Philadelphia because most people there had already voted. “That’s a good thing,’’ Clyburn said to nobody in particular.\n\nOn his desk was an almost empty bottle of water and books: “The Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America,’’ by Jonathan Kozol and “On Her Own Ground: The Life and Times of Madam C.J. Walker” by A’Lelia Bundles.\n\nClyburn’s communications director, Hope Derrick, told the congressman that he was invited to stop by the watch party at the state Democratic party headquarters.\n\nClyburn nodded, but first he had a video call with the NAACP and voters.\n\n“I can’t go until I finish,’’ he said.\n\nHis efforts wouldn’t be enough.\n\nOn election night in the ballroom, Clyburn staffers rushed over to his table and whispered in his ear. The Associated Press had called the Senate race. Harrison had lost his bid to unseat Graham.\n\nClyburn’s press team quickly packed up their laptops. The security detail moved into position. The boss wanted to speak at Harrison’s watch party across town.\n\nOnce there, Clyburn told Harrison supporters that Harrison may have lost the contest, but the young politician was still a winner. He had run a competitive race, generated interest among young people and set the stage for future races. The contest showed cracks in the state’s GOP armor.\n\nBack in the ballroom there would be better news. Both Clyburns on the ballot had won. Clyburn stood with his back to the screen flashing national election results and saluted his youngest daughter, Angela. She had won a seat on a local school board.\n\nBut in the congressional races, Cunningham had also lost, leaving Clyburn again as the lone Democrat in the South Carolina delegation.\n\nWith that reality settled in, Clyburn stayed up late that Friday to hear what Biden would tell the nation. Clyburn was “damn tired.” Biden was supposed to speak at 8 p.m. He started near 11.\n\n“You know what three hours out of the life of an 80-year old is?” Clyburn said.\n\nStill, he listened to Biden promise, “We’re going to win.”\n\nThe next morning, Clyburn turned on the television while he made waffles and sausage for his family.\n\nAnchors promised announcements about the race. But they had made those promises before. Clyburn decided to go on his regular weekend golf outing with his buddies.\n\nHe was at the 15th hole when a member of his security detail hurried over to tell him the race had been called. Clyburn kept playing.\n\n“I was leading. I was winning all the money,’’ he said with a laugh.\n\nAnother officer came over and told him that Zoom calls were being set up at home. He had to leave.\n\nClyburn would later learn that Trump had also been on a golf course when news of Biden’s victory broke.\n\n“I was having a better day than he was,’’ Clyburn said.\n\nOn the ride home, Clyburn thought about the challenges ahead, including getting legislation through Congress and onto Biden’s desk, especially if Republicans keep control of the Senate.\n\nHe wondered whether Biden and GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell would work together. They had served together in the Senate before Biden served as vice president to President Barack Obama.\n\n“I'm hoping that their relationship will be such that he will treat Biden better than he treated Obama,” Clyburn said.\n\nClyburn was proud that nearly 80 million Americans voted for Biden, but disappointed that nearly 74 million cast ballots for Trump.\n\nHe wasn’t surprised the nation was so divided. He grew up in the Deep South where he was banned from eating at whites-only lunch counters. He served in Congress with former segregationists. He heard Trump say there were “fine people on both sides” after white supremacists paraded through Charlottesville, Virginia, with torches in 2017 and a protester was killed.\n\n“This country has been divided ever since 1619. This country had 244 years of slavery. That’s 10 generations. And then we went (through) another four, five generations of apartheid,’’ he said. “You have a president who has exploited the racial animus in this country. It’s against Black people. It’s against brown people. It’s against Jews. Anybody who ain’t like him. That’s a reality. If I go around getting mad about that I’ll be mad all day, every day.”\n\nIn coming days, as Biden names his top staff and Cabinet picks, Clyburn won’t be on the list. He was re-elected this month as the majority whip.\n\nClyburn encouraged colleagues jockeying for those posts. But he wasn’t interested.\n\nThis is my last job, he told them.\n\nFollow Deborah Barfield Berry on Twitter at @dberrygannett", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/09/12/johnny-cash-death-date-nashville-obituary-anniversary/1279962002/", "title": "Johnny Cash: Farewell to the Man in Black, 16 years later", "text": "Peter Cooper\n\nThe Tennessean\n\nEditor's note: Sixteen years ago on Sept. 12, 2003, the world lost a musical legend when Johnny Cash passed away in Nashville. Below is the obituary we ran the day after the Man in Black died.\n\nSomehow, Johnny Cash is dead.\n\nBattling ill health for years and without his longtime companion since wife June Carter Cash's death in May, Mr. Cash's frailties of body and heart made him seem no less indomitable. Fans and fellow musicians likened him to a force of nature: an iconic, elemental figure, more granite and fire than flesh and blood. He had cheated death enough that it seemed death would never catch onto the ruse.\n\nBut yesterday morning around 2 a.m., Mr. Cash passed away at Baptist Hospital, succumbing to respiratory failure brought on by complications from diabetes. He was 71 years old, and his life altered the course of American popular music.\n\nIn Hendersonville, he was a neighbor. For Nashville, he was an ambassador, an agitator, a kingpin and a musical conscience. To the world, he was a political activist, a genre-blending innovator and the embodiment of well-aged cool.\n\nMost memorably, he was a singer of songs.\n\nIn death's wake came words, all day long, and none would suffice. Singers and pickers, fans and barflies, and journalists and the president of the United States tried to say something to convey the breadth and magnitude of Mr. Cash's life and career. All failed, though not for lack of good intentions.\n\nChapter 1: A hardscrabble youth\n\nKingsland, Ark., is a tiny little town now chiefly known as \"Birthplace of Johnny Cash.\" When Mr. Cash was born there - on Feb. 26, 1932 - no one called him \"Johnny.\" To his parents, and on his birth certificate, he was J.R. Cash, as no one could agree on a name at first.\n\nIn 1935 father Ray Cash moved his family to a five-room house near Dyess, Ark., to take part in a rehabilitation project run by the Roosevelt administration.\n\n\"Actually, it was a socialistic setup with a co-op store and a co-op cotton gin, the intention being that the farmers would share any profits from the gin and the store,\" Mr. Cash wrote in his first autobiography, Man In Black.\n\nThe share-cropping family sang country songs while picking cotton, and work in the fields was not halted even by death. Mr. Cash's older brother, Jack, was killed in a table-saw accident in 1944, an event that haunted Mr. Cash. But the next day, the family was back chopping cotton. Mother Carrie Cash fell to her knees in the field that morning, as her son related in a second autobiography, Cash: The Autobiography.\n\n\"Lest you get too romantic an impression of the good, natural, hard-working, character-building country life back then, back there, remember that picture of Carrie Cash down in the mud between the cotton rows on any mother's worst day,\" he wrote.\n\nCarrie Cash saw musical promise in J.R., the fourth of five children. She saved enough money for the teen to take a few singing lessons.\n\nThough J.R. loved the gospel music he heard at the Pentecostal Church of God in Dyess, he was most smitten with the Grand Ole Opry and the country music he heard on the radio.\n\nA brief encounter with Charlie Louvin of the Louvin Brothers before a concert in Dyess further enraptured the teen: \"I didn't even feel the gravel on my bare feet that night when I walked the two-and-a-half miles home in the dark, singing all the songs I'd heard from the stage at the school auditorium,\" he wrote in Man In Black.\n\nChapter 2: From service to Sun\n\nThough it was music that thrilled Mr. Cash, it seemed incapable of removing him from Arkansas. Upon graduation from Dyess High School in 1950, he moved to Michigan, intending to work in an automobile plant. Making car hoods on an assembly line didn't suit him much better than cotton farming, so he joined the Air Force. The military refused to accept \"J.R.\" as a first name, and he became \"John R. Cash.\"\n\nDuring basic training in Texas, he met a high school senior named Vivian Liberto. His assignment to a base in Landsberg, Germany (he was a radio intercept operator charged with cracking Russian code transmissions) did not deter their burgeoning romance. While in the service, he began strumming a guitar, composing music and verse and playing in a country band.\n\nHis time in the Air Force was of great musical significance, as it was there that he learned some guitar chords and saw a film called Inside Folsom Prison that spurred his now-famous song, Folsom Prison Blues. In the service, he also was struck by an intriguing drawling sound that occurred when his reel-to-reel tape machine was improperly loaded. An attempt to replicate that sound, coupled with his feelings of fidelity toward Vivian Liberto, was the genesis of another classic song, I Walk The Line.\n\nUpon his 1954 discharge, Mr. Cash moved to Memphis, married Liberto, worked as a door-to-door appliance salesman, enrolled at the Keegan School of Broadcasting and put together an upstart country group to help him become a gospel singer. He set his sights on Sun Records, a Memphis operation that was seeing success with a new artist named Elvis Presley.\n\n\"Sun Records was between my house and the broadcasting school,\" Mr. Cash told journalist Peter Guralnick. Mr. Cash visited the studio often, hoping for an audition with Sun owner/producer Sam Phillips.\n\nAfter being repeatedly told that Phillips was unavailable, Mr. Cash happened once to be sitting outside Sun as Phillips came to work. He forced his way into an audition, and Phillips was duly impressed.\n\n\"I don't feel like anyone discovered me because I had to fight so hard to get heard,\" Mr. Cash told Guralnick.\n\nA rock 'n' roll pioneer whose records with Elvis Presley were making pop inroads, Phillips had no use for a gospel artist. He asked Mr. Cash to write or find some secular material. The hopeful artist went back to the studio with his Tennessee Two (guitarist Luther Perkins and bass man Marshall Grant) with homesick train song Hey Porter! and Folsom Prison Blues, a song that borrowed liberally from Gordon Jenkins' Crescent City Blues recording.\n\nNot yet convinced that the man he called Johnny Cash had composed a hit, Phillips charged Mr. Cash to write \"an uptempo weeper love song,\" and he filled the order with Cry! Cry! Cry!, which would be paired with Hey Porter! as Mr. Cash's first single.\n\nReleased in 1955, Cry! Cry! Cry! was a pop and country hit that ultimately peaked at No. 14 on Billboard's country music charts.\n\n\"Musicians scoffed, but Cash and the Tennessee Two possessed the quality that had been lacking in country music since Hank Williams died: originality,\" wrote Colin Escott and Martin Hawkins in Good Rockin' Tonight: Sun Records and the Birth of Rock 'n' Roll.\n\nMr. Cash was among a group of Sun rockabillies including Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis, but he and his Tennessee Two had a propulsive yet distinctly Southern \"boom-chicka-boom\" sound that set them apart. Mr. Cash sometimes compensated for the lack of a drummer by threading wax paper through guitar strings, and Luther Perkins' spare electric lead guitar work was as crudely appropriate as a dirty joke at an all-night poker session.\n\n\"Marshall Grant was mostly right when in later years he said that we didn't work to get that boom-chicka-boom sound ... it's all we could play,\" Cash wrote. \"But it served us well, and it was ours.\"\n\nIn January 1956, Mr. Cash followed the tradition of Elvis Presley and Hank Williams and joined the Louisiana Hayride radio show. Six months later, he was given a slot on the Grand Ole Opry. Opry star Carl Smith introduced Mr. Cash by calling him \"the brightest rising star in the country music of America.\" That December, Mr. Cash again made headlines when he and Presley were photographed with Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins during a Sun session. That photograph is said to have captured \"The Million Dollar Quartet.\"\n\nMr. Cash's sound garnered No. 1 hits I Walk The Line and There You Go, as well as now-classics Home of The Blues and Big River.\n\n\"I taught the weeping willow how to cry/ And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky,\" Mr. Cash sang on Big River. A young man named Robert Zimmerman heard that song on the radio. Years later, when he was known as Bob Dylan, the man told writer Nicholas Dawidoff that the lines of Big River struck him as \"just words that turned into bone.\"\n\nMr. Cash worked an exhausting touring schedule and began taking amphetamines to help him cope, starting a habit that would cause problems throughout much of his life. The pills did not rob him of his ability to connect with audiences, including those of the captive variety: On New Year's Day 1959, Mr. Cash's travels took him to San Quentin prison, where he played a concert for the inmates. Eleven years later, the performer would record a live album at San Quentin, but this initial appearance was notable in that one of the prisoners was future country legend Merle Haggard.\n\n\"Prison is a good place to find out the truth, because them convicts won't lie,\" Haggard said. \"They ain't got no reason to give you any clout that you don't deserve. And we saw the truth that day.\"\n\nUnhappy with several matters, including Phillips' refusal to let him record a gospel album, Mr. Cash left Sun in 1958, moving his family (which by then included two daughters) to California. Phillips was angered, charging that the young singer had secretly signed a deal with Columbia Records while still under contract to Sun. The two later reconciled, and Mr. Cash was an honorary pallbearer at Phillips' funeral in July.\n\nWhile his decades on Columbia would see Mr. Cash rise to greater wealth and fame, many Cash-watchers consider the finest of the Sun recordings to be the apex of his career. On Get Rhythm, Train of Love, Home of the Blues, I Walk The Line, Big River and others, Phillips' recording techniques present Mr. Cash's voice as an unprettied wonder, and Phillips' interest in producing something singular and identifiable helped Mr. Cash to find his own way as an artist.\n\n\"When it dawned on me that I didn't sound like anybody else naturally, I let it come naturally,\" Mr. Cash told journalist Bill Flanagan in 1998. \"Of course, that was the secret of my success. It ain't no secret: Be yourself.\"\n\nChapter 3: To the Top\n\nA July 1958 session in Nashville with producer Don Law marked Cash's ascendance to the major label ranks, as he began work on songs that would comprise his Columbia debut album, The Fabulous Johnny Cash. A western song from that album, Don't Take Your Guns To Town, topped the country charts for six weeks in 1959, and Mr. Cash entered a new decade as a well-established artist in his prime.\n\n\"The 1960s were probably my most productive time, creatively speaking,\" he wrote in Cash. \"Often I wasn't in my best voice, because the amphetamines dried my throat and reduced me, at times, to croaks and whispers, but that wasn't the story all the time, and my energy and output were high.\"\n\nMr. Cash's drug use escalated. He destroyed hotel rooms, canceled shows, started fires, wrecked cars, was busted for illegal acquisition of pills, bashed out the Grand Ole Opry footlights and alienated himself from his wife and four daughters.\n\n\"I'd begin to feel good after two or three days without drugs,\" he wrote. \"Then, though, I'd get home, usually on a Monday, and I'd find the stress of my marriage so hard that I'd drive to that druggist, get two or three hundred pills, head out into the desert in my camper, and stay out there, high, for as long as I could.\"\n\nOn Feb. 11, 1962, June Carter joined the Johnny Cash road show. She was a daughter of acoustic guitar great Mother Maybelle Carter and member of the Carter clan, a group known as \"The First Family of Country Music.\" For some time Mr. Cash had been enthralled by her beauty, humor and talent, and she quickly recognized both Mr. Cash's magnetism and apparent need for a caretaker.\n\nIn addition to flushing pills and soothing nerves, she wrote Mr. Cash a song that described anxious feelings about their escalating relationship. It would become one of his best-known hits: Penned by Carter and Merle Kilgore, Ring of Fire hit No. 1 in 1963.\n\n\"A song like that goes on forever,\" Mr. Cash told The Tennessean in 2002.\n\nWhile much of musical Nashville ignored the burgeoning folk movement, Mr. Cash embraced some of the folk artists and ideologies. He appeared at the New York Folk Festival in 1965, recorded a duet with Carter on Bob Dylan's It Ain't Me Babe in 1964, recorded a concept album about Native American life called Bitter Tears and publicly supported the civil rights movement.\n\n\"When I was young, I saw my dad speaking out against the Vietnam War, speaking out against the Ku Klux Klan, and that's where my social activism is rooted,\" daughter Rosanne Cash told The Tennessean. \"He never bent. He never even almost bent.\"\n\nA thoughtful voice of inclusion and a conduit for crosspollination between folk and country artists, in the mid-1960s Mr. Cash also could be an angry and violent man prone to benders and outbursts.\n\n\"The mixture of amphetamines and alcohol was a maddening poison,\" he wrote in Man In Black. \"My wife and children feared the strange man I had become.\"\n\nIn early 1967 he and Vivian divorced, amid much pill-fueled debauchery, but by late 1967, Mr. Cash committed himself to getting off drugs, though his Jan. 13, 1968, show at Folsom Prison was proof that he was still quite in touch with his dark side.\n\nAt Folsom he delighted prisoners, cursing and joking and singing about egg-sucking dogs and the Cocaine Blues with a carnality and wildness that was at once thrilling, entertaining and empathetic. The show's recording, released as Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison, now is considered one of the most significant albums in country music history.\n\nFor Mr. Cash, 1968 offered moments both wonderful and tragic. He proposed to June Carter onstage Feb. 1, and married her a month later. He set about making up concert dates he'd missed when he was too strung out, and he released two chart-topping hits. But in August 1968, longtime bandmate and \"boom-chicka-boom\" innovator Luther Perkins died in a house fire. Guitarist Bob Wooten soon joined the band, becoming a part of a group that featured Marshall Grant, drummer W.S. \"Fluke\" Holland and original Sun rockabilly Carl Perkins.\n\nThe change in marital status and lifestyle coincided with an increased attention to spiritual matters, and Mr. Cash often spoke to audiences and interviewers about his Christian beliefs. He would later write a book about the Apostle Paul called Man In White.\n\nBy the late 1960s Mr. Cash was touring with an ensemble that included Perkins, members of the Carter Family and vocal group The Statler Brothers. Such a bevy of talent ensured audiences variety, and Mr. and Mrs. Cash kept just such a scene going at home by inviting musicians over to share stories and swap songs.\n\nMr. Cash maintained friendships with artists beyond the country world, and he and banjo innovator Earl Scruggs were two of the few prominent Nashville artists to mingle with politically left-leaning folk and pop musicians during this contentious time of civil rights unrest and war in Vietnam.\n\nOne friend of Mr. Cash's was Bob Dylan: They had kept up a correspondence since the early 1960s. Mr. Cash sang with Dylan on Girl From the North Country, the kickoff track to Dylan's 1969 Nashville Skyline album. Mr. Cash also contributed Grammy-winning liner notes to that album.\n\nA difficult Far East tour in 1969 found Mr. Cash sometimes playing more than 10 shows a day for military troops in locales including Saigon, Vietnam. The stress of that tour wore on Mr. Cash and he went back to pill-popping.\n\n\"My liberation from drug addiction wasn't permanent,\" he would later write. \"Though I never regressed to spending years at a time on amphetamines, I've used mood-altering drugs for periods of varying length at various times since 1967: amphetamines, sleeping pills and prescription painkillers.\"\n\nIn February 1969 Mr. Cash again made an album at a penitentiary. This time it was San Quentin, where he had previously visited three times. He had written a song called San Quentin for the occasion.\n\n\"San Quentin, may you rot and burn in hell,\" he sang, and inmates shouted a dangerous-sounding mix of appreciation and unleashed anguish. Mr. Cash would often later remark that the scene was barely controlled, and that if he had shouted, \"Break!,\" the prisoners would have rioted.\n\nBoth San Quentin and Folsom Prison Blues were written in a first-person narrative that led many listeners to assume Mr. Cash himself had been to prison. He had not, though he spent a little time in jail on minor charges.\n\nA Boy Named Sue, a Shel Silverstein-penned song recorded that night, was the biggest hit from the At San Quentin album. It was a five-week No. 1 country hit and it won the Country Music Association's single of the year prize.\n\nJune 1969 brought At San Quentin's release, and it marked the beginning of ABC-TV's The Johnny Cash Show. Mr. Cash recorded most of the show's 56 episodes at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, and he insisted that guest performers would include then-controversial artists including Dylan, Pete Seeger and Arlo Guthrie. The atypical blend of country, rock, folk and jazz was intended to spotlight conjunctions, not collisions, and the program helped broaden Mr. Cash's fame among those who hadn't listened to country music.\n\nMr. Cash would sell more than 6 million records in 1969, making it the most successful year of his career. Vietnam was raging, Richard Nixon was president and Johnny Cash, a 37-year-old native of Kingsland, Ark., was bigger than The Beatles.\n\nChapter 4: A Fall\n\nBy the turn of the decade, Mr. Cash's music had become a meeting ground for formerly disconnected camps.\n\n\"I wondered how it was possible for a man to maintain constituencies in the widely separated countries of Bob Dylan and Billy Graham,\" wrote journalist Dorothy Gallagher, who profiled Mr. Cash during this period.\n\nMr. Cash's biggest 1970 hits were an indication of his expansive musical vision. He and Mrs. Cash made it to No. 2 on the Billboard country chart with folkie Tim Hardin's If I Were A Carpenter (for which the Cashes won a Grammy), and Mr. Cash scored a No. 3 hit with What Is Truth.\n\n\"This whole world's waking to a brand new day, and I solemnly swear it's gonna be their way,\" sang Mr. Cash. \"Can you blame the voice of youth for asking, 'What is truth?' \"\n\nHe released two No. 1 hits in 1970: One was a version of Kris Kristofferon's Sunday Morning Coming Down, an empathetic portrait of an addict. The other smash, which peaked in early 1971, was the folksy love song Flesh And Blood.\n\nOn March 3, 1970, Mrs. Cash gave birth to a boy, John Carter Cash. Six weeks later, Mr. Cash performed at the White House in front of President Nixon. While a Nixon aide told Mr. Cash that the president would like to hear him sing two right-wing country numbers - Guy Drake's Welfare Cadillac and Merle Haggard's Okie From Muskogee - the singer opted to sing gospel songs and some of his own material.\n\nMarch 1971 also marked the final taping of The Johnny Cash Show, which was canceled amid growing dissension between the star and ABC. Mr. Cash fought for more creative control and the network grew tired of fighting about a show that was not drawing enough viewers.\n\nHis Man In Black single, which found Mr. Cash claiming that he would wear his signature black stage outfits as a somber nod to the needy, hungry, imprisoned, addicted and enlisted, also charted top 5.\n\nBy the end of 1971, he and Mrs. Cash had traveled to Tel Aviv, Israel, to film The Gospel Road, a movie about the life of Jesus Christ.\n\nMr. Cash was now a filmmaker, a father, a husband, a songwriter, a touring attraction, a celebrity and many other things. His recording career was stretched thin by his other interests, and he would not notch another No. 1 hit until 1976.\n\nAs Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings and others turned heads and ears with a vigorous sound that signaled the onset of so-called Outlaw Movement, Mr. Cash made a series of middle-of-the-road albums that seldom rated mention alongside '50s and '60s triumphs.\n\nThough not at his artistic peak, Mr. Cash was still Nashville's greatest superstar, an auditorium-packing concert draw, a sure-bet Country Music Hall of Famer (he would become the youngest-ever inductee in 1980) and a celebrity whose views on social issues were widely sought. The 1975 autobiography Man In Black detailed a rise to fame, numerous falls to drugs and an eventual acceptance of sobriety, marriage and godliness. The book furthered his already substantial fame.\n\n\"Since the late '60s, Cash's records have been rather strange - more the recorded evidence of a great artist floundering in confusion than the masterful products of Cash's own unique mold,\" wrote Country Music magazine's Patrick Carr.\n\n1976's One Piece At A Time was a welcome return to a stripped-down sound reminiscent of Mr. Cash's 1950s work. The song became Mr. Cash's final No. 1 country hit as a solo artist. After that, the only time Mr. Cash's voice appeared on a top-charting country radio single was in 1985, as a member of supergroup The Highwaymen, with Jennings, Nelson and Kris Kristofferson.\n\nDrugs maintained a pull on Mr. Cash. One early-1980s downturn occurred after one of his own ostriches attacked him. The Cashes kept an exotic animal park near their Old Hickory Lake home. Mr. Cash suffered five broken ribs, painkillers were prescribed and the cycle of addiction began again.\n\nMr. Cash would later surmise that some level of self-loathing was involved in all of the substance abuse. Even as fans and fellow musicians celebrated his accomplishments, even with unending devotion from his wife, he was unable to make peace with himself. In 1984, he entered the Betty Ford Center and was treated for addiction to morphine.\n\nThe lowest point in Mr. Cash's career may have come that same year when he failed to make the country Top 40 with an ill-conceived novelty song called Chicken in Black. In later interviews, he would call it \"an embarrassment.\"\n\nColumbia Records did not promote Mr. Cash's 1980s material with much fervor, though the company was quite good at selling the smart and sultry, cutting-edge recordings of his singing, songwriting daughter, Rosanne. Mr. Cash was proud and supportive, though he could not have failed to notice that not only was he no longer bigger than The Beatles, but he also was not even the top-charting Cash.\n\nColumbia Records released Mr. Cash from his contract in 1986, creating an uproar among Cash devotees such as young gun Dwight Yoakam. It seemed logical enough to Mr. Cash, who had been unhappy with Columbia's lack of promotion since his 1977 concept album, The Rambler. He also knew that he'd done some damage to his commercial viability with material like Chicken in Black.\n\nMr. Cash secured a deal with Mercury/Polygram and recorded some excellent material (Beans For Breakfast, Last of the Drifters and a version of Guy Clark's Let Him Roll), but with the dawn of the 1990s, he was considering an exodus from recording.\n\n\"Saying goodbye to that game and just working the road, playing with my friends and family for people who really wanted to hear us, seemed very much like the thing to do,\" he wrote in Cash.\n\nChapter 5: Rising Again\n\nIn 1992, Mr. Cash was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, an honor that reminded many of his spare rockabilly work on Sun Records with independent-minded producer Sam Phillips.\n\nA year later, another independent-minded maverick - long-haired Rick Rubin, known for his work with rap and hard rock acts - would sign Mr. Cash to a record deal with American Recordings, setting into motion a rise back to contemporary viability.\n\nHere was the so-simple-it's-brilliant idea, as supported by the man who had produced the Beastie Boys and Public Enemy: Record Johnny Cash unadorned, strumming an acoustic guitar with his thumb and singing.\n\nEven before the world at large was able to hear the solo/acoustic album called American Recordings, Mr. Cash's credibility was rising. The association with Rubin quickly hoisted the Man in Black from creative quicksand, and his reinvigorated spirit caught on with young hipsters.\n\nThe Viper Room on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles provided a still talked-about \"coming back out\" party. There, Mr. Cash sang for a crowd packed with rock singers and movie stars.\n\n\"It was really a magical event,\" Rubin told writer Nick Tosches. \"It's odd to be in a place like the Viper Room, which is kind of a small but loud nightclub, and have it be so quiet. It's nothing that you could imagine happening, that kind of silence and awe in an audience in that particular kind of place.\"\n\nNoticing the age disparity between performer and audience at a 1994 Austin concert, Mr. Cash told the crowd, \"I hope you enjoy the show, grandchildren.\"\n\nIn April 1994, American Recordings was released. Two recordings from the Viper Room show were included. Response was nearly universally positive, with Time magazine's review proclaiming: \"He has reasserted himself as one of the greats of popular music.\"\n\nMr. Cash also was pleased, saying, \"I think I'm more proud of it than anything I've ever done in my life. This is me. Whatever I've got to offer as an artist, it's here.\"\n\nWhile American Recordings did not sell in astounding numbers, it did reawaken an interest in Mr. Cash's music and expand his audience. American Recordings made it to No. 23 on the country charts, making it the highest-charting of Mr. Cash's solo albums.\n\nThe album won a Grammy award for best contemporary folk album, and spawned a video for Delia's Gone that was played on MTV. After years of creative and commercial decline, Mr. Cash was cool again. Even as country radio ignored the revitalization, Mr. Cash regained a foothold in the rock 'n' roll world. He appeared on a show celebrating the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, recorded Willie Nelson's Time of the Preacher with a backing band that included members of Nirvana and Alice in Chains, and played a House of Blues set in Los Angeles with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.\n\nPetty and the Heartbreakers also were featured prominently on Mr. Cash's second Rubin-produced album, Unchained, released in November 1996. This album abandoned the all-acoustic approach, even using distorted, post-punk electric guitars for a cover of alternative rock band Soundgarden's Rusty Cage. But Rubin and Mr. Cash also included rockabilly songs, gospel material and a bracing take on Petty's ballad Southern Accents. Unchained garnered another round of positive reviews.\n\nMr. Cash was honored Dec. 8, as President Clinton and others applauded him upon receiving a Kennedy Center award. Vice President Al Gore had recommended Mr. Cash, assessing that Mr. Cash's music examined \"the entire range of existence, failure and recovery, entrapment and escape, weakness and strength, loss and redemption, life and death.\"\n\nKristofferson, Emmylou Harris, Lyle Lovett, Robert Duvall and others joined Rosanne Cash in the televised Kennedy Center tribute, and Mr. Cash wiped tears during his daughter's performance. In Cash, he wrote that the attention was flattering but that there was a flip side.\n\n\"The day after the Kennedy Center show, I came further down to earth when my daughters got together with me and voiced some very deep feelings they'd had for a very long time - told me things, that is, about the lives of girls whose daddy abandoned them for a drug,\" he wrote. \"That was very hard.\"\n\nMr. Cash was quite correctly viewed in the public as a crusader for righteous things: for tolerance, spirituality and good music. But Rosanne's song My Old Man artfully rectified the heroic myth with the virtuous, honorable but blemished man:\n\n\"He believes what he says he believes,\" she sang. \"But that don't make him a saint.\"\n\nChapter 6: \"Sober, honest, defiant\"\n\nLess than a year after the Kennedy Center Honors, Mr. Cash leaned over during a concert in Flint, Mich., and nearly fell. He told the audience he was suffering from Parkinson's disease, at first drawing a laugh from a crowd that thought he was joking.\n\n\"It ain't funny,\" he said, according to a review in The Flint Journal. \"It's all right. I refuse to give it some ground in my life.\"\n\nThe diagnosis of Parkinson's, which causes slowed movement, rigidity and tremors, forced Mr. Cash to cancel concerts and book promotions through 1997.\n\nBy Nov. 5, the Parkinson's diagnosis had been slightly altered. Manager Lou Robin announced that Baptist Hospital tests revealed Mr. Cash had a Parkinson's-related illness called Shy-Drager syndrome. While at Baptist that month, he became gravely ill with double pneumonia. Fans and friends worried as Mr. Cash lay unconscious, breathing with the help of a ventilator.\n\nBut once again, he proved himself a survivor. Some had observed his reckless lifestyle in the 1960s and supposed he would drink and drug himself to death. Some watched his slow recovery from a late 1980s heart surgery and thought him not long for the world. And many thought the rare, ugly-sounding Shy-Drager syndrome would do him in. All were wrong.\n\nThe Grammy Awards of February 1998 found Mr. Cash once again victorious. Despite country radio's refusal to play material from Unchained, the album won a Grammy for best country album.\n\nEven as he reeled from illness, Mr. Cash's pugnacious spirit made waves along Music Row, as he sanctioned an advertisement in Billboard magazine that March. \"American Recordings and Johnny Cash would like to acknowledge the Nashville music industry and country radio for your support,\" read the text, while the page's dominant image was Jim Marshall's 1969 San Quentin photograph, with Mr. Cash raising his right hand's middle finger.\n\nAs spring rolled around, Mr. Cash began reappearing. He sang two songs at a private gathering in April, but waited until June for his return to a public stage. As Kristofferson performed Sunday Morning Coming Down during a Ryman Auditorium show, Mr. Cash walked out to join him. Kristofferson cried at the sight and sound of his old friend.\n\nA televised tribute concert in 1999 at Manhattan's Hammerstein Ballroom gave Mr. Cash a chance to once again sing and play his own songs. Musicians including Emmylou Harris, Bruce Springsteen, Sheryl Crow and Wyclef Jean performed Mr. Cash's material and lavished praise on the icon, then 67 years old, but Mr. Cash's appearance was the night's undisputed highlight.\n\n\"If he felt the effects of his lingering disease, he didn't show it,\" Jay Orr wrote in The Tennessean. \"Looking robust, his guitar slung behind him or held at a jaunty angle, Cash ambled confidently to the mike, began stroking his guitar strings up on the neck and launched into Folsom Prison Blues, with all the tics, head gestures and enthusiastic growls that characterized the performances of his prime.\"\n\nThrough much of 1999 and 2000, Mr. Cash was quietly compiling material for a third Rubin-produced album, this one to be titled American III: Solitary Man.\n\n\"I was very ill at the time,\" he later told The Tennessean. \"I went into the studio on and off for a solid year, and I was never pleased with any of my performances. But then I started getting better late last year, like November, and I started working really hard on this record.\"\n\nIn that October 2000 interview, Mr. Cash said that his health was improving and that the diagnosis of Shy-Drager had been erroneous.\n\n\"My doctor told me in November that if I'd had it, I'd be dead by now,'' he said. \"She said, 'You're getting better, so you don't have Shy Drager's. And you don't have Parkinson's.\"\n\nInstead doctors told Mr. Cash he had autonomic neuropathy, a group of symptoms caused by nerve damage. It is at times associated with diabetes, though Mr. Cash sometimes denied in interviews that he had diabetes.\n\nFriend and fellow country legend Merle Haggard appeared on American III, singing a duet with Mr. Cash. Haggard told The Tennessean, \"Johnny Cash and I are as close as two men can be,\" but he worried about Mr. Cash's condition:\n\n\"He's able to laugh and sing and joke, but he's in a lot of pain,\" Haggard said. \"He lives in pain and chooses between pain and pain pills. The only way he can enjoy life is to put up with the pain and not have any pills, so that's what he does.\"\n\nAmerican III was released Oct. 22, 2000, and it was the first recorded evidence that Mr. Cash's voice had changed significantly. His characteristic boom had been replaced with a raspier, more fragile instrument. If anything, tracks such as One and Field of Diamonds and were more tender and poignant than Mr. Cash could have previously summoned.\n\nThe Solitary Man track from American III earned Mr. Cash his 10th Grammy award, this one for best male country vocal performance, on Feb. 21, 2001. That day, Mr. Cash was released from the hospital after another bout with pneumonia. Trips to the hospital, usually for pneumonia or bronchitis, were becoming routine.\n\nWhile others noted Mr. Cash's 70th birthday in 2002 by singing his old songs (two tribute albums were released that year), the Man in Black chose to forge ahead with new recordings. He went back to work with Rubin, preparing for the album that would become American IV: The Man Comes Around.\n\nWhile the American albums were filled with worthwhile material, one thing Mr. Cash had not done in a long time was to pen a song that stood on equal footing with classics such as Big River or Flesh and Blood. He rectified that with his new album's title song, as listeners would find upon the album's Nov. 5, 2002, release.\n\n\"I worked harder and longer on that song than on anything I've ever written,\" Mr. Cash told The Tennessean.\n\nThough the title song's apocalyptic vision was a highlight of American IV: The Man Comes Around, it was a cover version of rocker Trent Reznor's Hurt that spurred the album to a place among the top five country albums on the Billboard chart. Mr. Cash said he recorded Hurt because it was \"the best anti-drug song I'd ever heard.\"\n\n\"The needle tears a hole,\" wrote Reznor. \"The old familiar sting/ Tried to kill it all away/ But I remember everything.\"\n\nDirector Mark Romanek worked on the award-winning video, combining clips of Mr. Cash as a young man with footage that depicted the aged superstar, and including shots of the closed-down, flood-damaged House of Cash museum in Hendersonville.\n\n\"The place was in such a state of dereliction,\" Romanek told MTV. \"That's when I got the idea that we could be extremely candid about the state of Johnny's health: as candid as Johnny has always been in his songs.\"\n\nAs video channels put Hurt into rotation, American IV sold more than 200,000 copies. His new version of Sun recording Give My Love to Rose won Mr. Cash his 11th Grammy: this one for best male country vocal.\n\nMr. Cash's influence on non-Nashville, non-country artists was underscored during a Ryman concert by British rock band Coldplay earlier this year.\n\n\"So many of our heroes have played here,\" said Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin. \"From Johnny Cash, all the way through to Johnny Cash, including Johnny Cash.\"\n\nOn May 15, 2003, Mr. Cash was faced with the loss of his wife, June Carter Cash.\n\n\"My dad has lost his greatest companion, his musical partner, his soul mate,\" said Rosanne Cash at the funeral. Mr. Cash sat in the front pew and was lifted to his feet at service's end. He leaned over his wife's casket, then was helped back to his chair and wheeled out of the church.\n\nBut in the following weeks, Mr. Cash returned to recording and addressed concerns about his health with stubborn wit, saying, \"I plan to outlive all my children. I'm not going anywhere.\"\n\nIn June, Mr. Cash appeared in Maces Springs, Va., at the venue known as the Carter Family Fold. He was hoarse and weak, but he sang several songs and spoke to the crowd:\n\n\"I don't know hardly what to say tonight about being up here without her. The pain is so severe there is no way of describing it.\"\n\nMusic was Mr. Cash's primary balm in attempting to quell that pain. He was often at his studio, working on tracks for an American V album with musicians including Marty Stuart and Jack Clement. Hospitalized at Baptist for the past three weeks with a stomach ailment, he was released Tuesday amid plans to fly to California next week for more recording dates. Late Thursday, he was rushed back to Baptist.\n\nWhere Are Your Mountains?\n\nIn the coming days, artists of all stripes will lavish words of praise upon Mr. Cash.\n\nHe will be remembered as a fallible man who sought honor and peace.\n\nHe will be remembered as a force of music and of personality.\n\nHe will be remembered by some as the greatest of all country music artists, and by others as the tall, wild howler who gave Hank Williams a run for his money.\n\nQuestions, too, will remain. What was the source of his inner turmoil, or of his expansive yet singular musical vision?\n\nHow could an artist who should by 1994 have been well past his prime find within himself an explosion of creativity?\n\nHow could a man constantly surrounded by friends and family embody such loneliness?\n\nAnd, as Mr. Cash once wrote of his friend Bob Dylan, \"So where are your mountains to match some men?\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/us/2022-in-review-fast-facts/index.html", "title": "2022 In Review Fast Facts | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nHere is a look back at the events of 2022.\n\nNotable US Events\n\nJanuary 3 - The US Food and Drug Administration expands the emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine boosters to children ages 12 to 15.

Capano, was trying to answer that question when she wedged herself into the white Igloo cooler that played a grisly role in one of the most sensational and dramatic court cases in Delaware history.\n\nIt was a key piece of evidence in the haunting case that still resonates 20 years after Capano's November 1997 arrest because it echoes current headlines: men in positions of power trying to exert absolute control over their alleged victims.\n\nThe 12-week trial kept the public riveted from October 1998 to January 1999.\n\nCapano had apparently stuffed the 5-foot-10-inch body of his younger, secret girlfriend, Anne Marie Fahey, into the ice chest after she was shot to death at his home with a gun bought by Deborah A. MacIntyre, one of his other longtime mistresses. Capano, married with four daughters, would later blame MacIntyre for Fahey's death.\n\nThe day after Fahey's mysterious June 1996 death, Capano, with the help of his youngest brother, Gerry, used the cooler to transport Fahey's body to Gerry's boat Summer Wind at Stone Harbor, New Jersey.\n\nSummer Wind motored east about 60 to 75 miles, Gerry testified, where he then gave his brother an anchor and chain and turned his back on the scene unfolding on deck. Gerry told the court that Tom Capano vomited, then put a body into the ocean. According to testimony, he turned around in time to see a human foot sink into the deep waters.\n\nTom Capano told his attorney Joseph S. Oteri that he first rejected putting Fahey's body into a brand-new garbage can. Instead, Capano used a 40½-gallon cooler, purchased two months before Fahey's death. Capano’s brother Joseph, who died of a heart attack in 2015, said he told Tom to buy the cooler as a gift for brother Gerry.\n\nTwo and half years after Fahey died, the jury hearing Capano's murder trial was sequestered at the Hilton Wilmington/Christiana near Stanton.\n\nDeliberations lasted three days.\n\nCapano case:For complete coverage, including past stories, videos and more\n\n\"Honestly, a lot of people would be surprised to know that when we first went in to deliberate, first thing we did was take a poll to see where everybody stood and it was half and half,\" said Lee, who counted herself among the not-guilty votes.\n\nLee recalled one of the jurors said: \"'We should see if she could really just fit [into the cooler].'\"\n\nLee, 28 years old at the time and known as Erin Reilly, was just a few inches shorter and weighed about the same as Fahey. Sitting at a big table in a hotel conference room, she felt all eyes on her.\n\nAlthough one of her fellow jurors said she didn't need to do it, Lee agreed to climb into the 3-foot-8-inch hard-plastic cooler that served as a makeshift coffin. She left her high heels on to compensate for Fahey's height.\n\n\"This is important,\" Lee remembers telling herself. \"It's important for everybody. It's important for me because I didn't know.\"\n\nJurors helped the young woman into the cooler and then watched as Lee tried to \"squoosh myself smaller\" to give others an accurate picture.\n\n\"My eyes were closed for sure,\" she said. \"I'm not sure why. Probably because I didn't want to see.\"\n\nAs jurors attempted to shut the cooler's lid, Lee recalls being surrounded by a darkness she had never known.\n\nIn court testimony, Capano said he laid Fahey's body into the cooler on her side. He said he pushed her knees into a fetal position but insisted he broke no bones to make her body fit. Capano also said he had wrapped her body in a cotton blanket.\n\nBut Lee and the other jurors soon learned it wasn't the gentle tuck-in Capano had described.\n\nAs Lee squirmed inside the cooler, the lid wouldn't close. And that's when some of the jurors realized Fahey's bones might have been broken, or worse, to make the corpse fit.\n\nThe macabre situation, and the enormity of what had happened to Fahey, suddenly became real and overwhelming.\n\n\"OK,\" Lee remembers another juror saying. \"That's enough. Let's get her out.\"\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, a traumatized Lee asked a bailiff to escort her to her hotel bedroom. Lee sat alone and sobbed.\n\nTears fell for Fahey, a troubled, insecure, single woman who wanted to end an off-and-on, three-year affair with the then 46-year-old Capano, a controlling, jealous, married lover who wouldn't let her walk away.\n\nAs she cried, Lee, only two years younger than the victim, said she spoke to Fahey: \"I'm just so sorry. I'm so sorry that this happened to you.\"\n\nThe climb into the cooler-turned-casket convinced Erin Reilly Lee and the jury of five other women and six men that Capano was a manipulative liar, a cold-blooded killer.\n\nIt was Capano who shot Fahey, the jury determined.\n\nWilliam Swain Lee, the Superior Court judge who presided over the trial, said he was walking on the beach Saturday, January 16, 1999, when his beeper went off.\n\n\"I had to run about a mile to get back to my car, drive to my house to get to a telephone, and call in,\" he said.\n\nThe jury had reached a verdict.\n\n\"We had to go find everyone,\" Judge Lee added. \"The lawyers were in different restaurants in a three-state area. So, the soonest we could get together was Sunday morning and I did not think that once it was announced that the jury had reached a verdict that we could take a day off.\n\n\"We needed to get it out, so I scheduled the unusual Sunday morning session.\"\n\nSunday morning the jury found Capano, then 49, guilty of the first-degree murder of 30-year-old Fahey, a scheduling secretary for then-Gov. Tom Carper.\n\nJudge Lee sentenced Capano to death.\n\nIt was a stunning fall from grace for the prominent Wilmington attorney who had once counseled a Delaware mayor and governor and was the privileged, eldest son of a well-known Italian custom home builder. In just 31 months, Capano had gone from admired power broker to pariah.\n\nFrom Fahey's disappearance on June 27, 1996, to Capano's conviction on Jan. 17, 1999, the public devoured every morsel of information uncovered. The trial spawned four books and a 2001 TV movie that starred Mark Harmon as Capano.\n\nMore:Prosecutor Colm Connolly: Tom Capano tried to take a hit out on me\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Search set for Carper assistant\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: 300 Join in Fahey search\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: FBI search for Fahey may go on\n\nThe case was revived again in 2006 when Capano's death sentence was overturned. A life sentence was his punishment.\n\nBy then, years of confinement and isolation on death row had begun to take its toll. Capano, overweight with sallow skin and a wispy, white beard, no longer resembled the fit, polished, man-about-town he had once been.\n\n\"He had gained a massive amount of weight since the trial,\" said Colm F. Connolly, the unflappable federal prosecutor who led the investigation and endured Capano's intense hatred, which included verbal attacks and, at one point, plans to put a hit on him.\n\nCapano died of a heart attack on Sept. 19, 2011, at age 61 at the Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna, where he was serving the life sentence.\n\n\"He ate himself to death; there's no question about it,\" Judge Lee said.\n\n\"His father died of a heart attack, he knew he had a heart condition. Once his appeals ran out, I think it was suicide by food,\" said Lee, who retired from the bench nine months after the trial and now lives near Rehoboth Beach.\n\nMore:'This is Tom, Tom Capano,' said the man on the phone\n\nCapano's obituary said he \"was many things to many people, but most of all he was a loving father who will be greatly missed by his [four] daughters.\"\n\nIt touched upon Capano's love of music and places in Wilmington, some no longer open. The man the family called \"Tommy,\" the obituary said, was known for \"his impeccable taste: blasting old classics – the Temptations, the Four Seasons, Aretha Franklin, Frank Sinatra, or the Rolling Stones – at full volume while waiting to pick up pizza from Gallucio's; allowing his daughters to skip school on their birthdays for a luxurious lunch at the Rodney Square Club; ordering an assortment of mouthwatering seafood from DiNardo's with extra Old-Bay seasoning.\"\n\nThe obituary did not mention the murder conviction.\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Capano held in murder of Anne Marie Fahey\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: The Capanos: A house in ruins\n\nTwenty years after he was arrested, the Thomas J. Capano murder mystery continues to fascinate because of its alluring – and grim – elements: sex, power, wealth, politics, secret affairs, lurid moments and an extraordinary reversal of fortune that wouldn't ring true if written in a crime novel.\n\n\"It was amazing the twists and turns throughout the case, especially during the trial,\" said Connolly, then an assistant U.S. attorney who had never before tried a murder case.\n\nWorking with Ferris W. Wharton, a seasoned state prosecutor with nearly 20 years' experience running murder trials, Connolly and his team won a first-degree murder conviction and a death sentence – even though there was no body, no witnesses to the killing and no found murder weapon.\n\nMore:Prosecutor Ferris Wharton: The moment I remember the most is the cooler\n\nIt would be Connolly's one-and-only murder trial. He is now managing partner of the Wilmington law office of Morgan Lewis.\n\n\"I do think the reality is, and I'll have to accept, it was the ultimate professional experience I will ever have, and I was very young to have had it,\" said Connolly, who was 33 when the trial began.\n\nOn the other side of the courtroom, Capano's defense was made up of four well-known criminal defense lawyers who frequently squabbled with their client.\n\nMore:Defense attorney Maurer: I wanted to withdraw from Tom Capano case\n\n\"Often dubbed the ‘Dream Team,’ the defense in this case became a nightmare,\" Eugene J. Maurer Jr. wrote in an essay for The News Journal.\n\n\"Tom was an impossible client, pushing the envelope at all times and making the representation quite unpleasant. Ethical boundaries were of no consideration to him in formulating his defense strategy, as was demonstrated by the evidence at trial.\"\n\nAdded Maurer: \"Instead of a challenging and fulfilling professional experience, the representation of Tom Capano was one of the most depressing and disappointing professional experiences of my life.\"\n\nJoseph S. Oteri, the Boston lawyer who led Capano’s “Dream Team,” was more blunt about representing Capano: “I made a bad mistake in taking a lawyer for a client.”\n\nOteri said he is usually the man in charge. But Capano’s insistence on running the case got in the way.\n\n“He was taking advice from people in the jail rather than the people he was paying for and it was tough,” Oteri told The News Journal. “It didn't make me feel anything but pissed off because I kept saying, ‘You're paying me an enormous fee and you're not listening to me. How stupid can you be?’”\n\n“‘Nah, nah,’” Oteri quoted Capano as saying. “We're doing fine. We're all right.\"\n\nJudge Lee said it was tough going for the defense.\n\n“Capano was always confident he was going to win and it was clear he considered himself smarter than his excellent group of lawyers,” the judge said.\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Cooler found in Fahey case\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: FBI sought weapons in Capano's home\n\nAnne Marie Fahey wanted – and believed – she had escaped Capano's dominance and intimidation.\n\n\"For one whole year, I allowed someone to take control of every decision of my life,\" she wrote in her diary April 7, 1996 – one of the final entries.\n\nHer plan was to move forward with a kind man younger than Capano. It was not to be. A little more than two months after that last entry, Fahey was reported missing.\n\nFahey's remains have never been found. One of the few places to mourn and remember her is a memorial bench erected in 2006 that sits in Wilmington's Brandywine Park. “In our hearts forever,” reads the inscription.\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Power broker now pariah\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Guilty as charged\n\nEvidence from the case, relatively untouched since 1999, today collects dust in a vault at the Leonard L. Williams Justice Center on Wilmington's King Street, formerly called the New Castle County Courthouse.\n\nIt serves as both an elegy and a 1990s time capsule with cassettes and videotapes of interviews with Capano's brothers, handwritten lists of state and defense witnesses –– and pieces of a life that ended much too soon.\n\nUsually, evidence is given away to the defense or destroyed after a defendant’s death.\n\n\"This is the only dead person I still have evidence for,\" said Colleen Redmond of the Prothonotary's office as she looked over items from the trial.\n\n\"The court said we shouldn't get rid of it,\" despite Capano’s death six years ago, she said.\n\nFolded up is a then-fashionable, size 6, cream-and-blue floral Laura Ashley dress. It is possibly the long, springtime dress Fahey bought to wear to Winterthur's Point-to-Point steeplechase races with her boyfriend Michael Scanlan, then community affairs chief of MBNA America Bank, whom she hoped to marry.\n\nAuthorities believe one of the reasons Capano killed Fahey was his jealousy of Scanlan, a devout Catholic who testified his relationship with Fahey was not sexual. Scanlan didn't know about Fahey's involvement with Capano until after her death.\n\nAccording to his Linkedin profile, Scanlan left MBNA in June 1999 and is now assistant headmaster at St. Benedict's Preparatory School in Newark, New Jersey. He also works as a photographer shooting high school sports, portraits and does some commercial work.\n\nGone from the evidence vault are Fahey's wallet, jewelry box and the diary that gave investigators much-needed clues that pointed to her murderer. Her family took those items years ago, court officials say.\n\nBut, still in the vault are the copies of letters mistress MacIntyre wrote daily to Capano in prison before she turned on him in February 1998 and became a key witness for the prosecution. Some of the letters from the divorced MacIntyre, a Capano girlfriend for more than 15 years, begin with the greeting, \"Hey Handsome.\"\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Death for Capano\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Capano found dead in prison\n\nFinally, there are two 162-quart Igloo ice coolers – one used as a demonstration in court, and one the actual cooler, and Fahey's coffin. Inside of it rests a 12-gauge shotgun.\n\nIn one of the case's most surprising twists, the abandoned cooler was found floating in the Atlantic Ocean by four fishermen about a week after Gerry Capano unsuccessfully tried to sink it by firing a slug into it with a 12-gauge Mossberg shotgun.\n\nThe fishermen, who kept it in a shed, turned it over to prosecutors the day after reading media accounts of Capano's arrest in November 1997.\n\nJudge Lee, in a recent interview, said it is astonishing that the cooler had been discovered off Indian River Inlet, 100 miles from where it had been thrown into the ocean.\n\n\"It's certainly stranger than fiction, the truth,\" Judge Lee said. \"My reaction was Tom Capano should know there really is a God now.”\n\nConnolly said bringing the actual cooler into court on Dec. 2, 1998, just before the state rested its case, still stays with him nearly 20 years later.\n\n\"I will never forget that moment. It was dead silent. It was a dark day, so not much light was coming in the windows of the courtroom,\" he said. \"Ferris and I walked the cooler in front of the jury. It was as if we were pallbearers carrying the coffin into the court.\"\n\nJuror Erin Reilly Lee, no relation to Judge William Swain Lee, still gets chills seeing pictures of the Igloo cooler.\n\n“Oh my gosh,” she told The News Journal after viewing photos. “You talk about divine intervention. There’s a great example.”\n\nWharton, now a Superior Court judge, said the court retains all the evidence while there's still ongoing litigation. But, after a defendant's death, it is then offered to the defense and/or destroyed after a period of time.\n\n\"It would surprise me if they got rid of all that evidence just because of the interest in it. People kept wanting to look at it for various reasons,\" Wharton said.\n\nOn the anniversary of Capano's arrest, The News Journal has asked some principal players to recall their memories of the investigation and trial.\n\nEssays and \"As Told To\" stories include thoughts from Connolly and Wharton, defense attorneys Maurer and Oteri, retired Judge Lee, former News Journal reporter Valerie Helmbreck, former Wilmington restaurateur Anthony Stella, juror Erin Reilly Lee and psychiatrist Neil Kaye.\n\nTime has a way of fraying memories and, 20 years later, some participants have slightly different versions of the same story and others share never heard before details. The News Journal has tried to clarify and add context to some of their words using information from court records and articles from the paper's archives.\n\nStill, some of the people who were caught up in Capano's web of lies are more than ready to put the past behind them.\n\nMacIntyre is remarried and now working at the American Society of Cytopathology, a nonprofit organization in Wilmington. The office is near the old Daniel L. Herrmann Courthouse, now the home of the law firm Young Conaway Stargatt & Taylor. In the old courthouse two decades ago, she talked about her longtime affair with Capano and about buying a gun for him six weeks before Fahey died.\n\nMacIntyre, known now as Debby MacIntyre Sheldon, declined to be interviewed.\n\nWhen reached by The News Journal via email on Nov. 13, she replied: \"I have no interest in talking about the case. Best regards, Debby MacIntyre Sheldon.\"\n\nThe Fahey family declined to be interviewed or write about their memories.\n\nAfter Anne Marie’s disappearance, her brothers, sister and extended family said they decided as a group to talk to media to keep attention on the case.\n\nWhile family members were concerned they would appear as seeking attention, they felt it was proper to keep the case in the public eye, and keep pressure on the Capano family.\n\nAfter the trial, the Faheys decided as a group to stop talking to the media, and to draw no more attention to themselves.\n\nMembers of the Capano family reached by The News Journal declined to comment.\n\nThe Thomas J. Capano case captivated Delaware that's known, for better or worse, as a clannish community, especially concerning its native sons and daughters.\n\n\"What's your name? Where did you grow up? Where did you go to high school?\" are frequent questions that start a connect-the-dots conversation about common acquaintances.\n\nTies could be made to Capano and Fahey, both from large Wilmington-area families with high-profile jobs.\n\n“You have Anne Marie Fahey who worked for the governor and she had a family that a lot of people knew. She was very attractive and very personable, and young,” Wharton said.\n\n“Everybody knew of the Capanos. He (Tom) was very prominent. He had been a prosecutor, a public defender, the administrative assistant to the Wilmington mayor. Capano had been a partner in a couple big law firms, Morris James and Saul Ewing. He had been the governor's legal counsel. And everybody knows of Capano because of all the development that they did,” Wharton said.\n\nFor a few days in the summer of 1996, the disappearance of Anne Marie Fahey seemed to be little more than a missing person case.\n\nYears before being selected as a juror, Erin Reilly Lee remembers longtime friends talking about search parties being formed for a missing woman who’d grown up near her childhood neighborhood.\n\nFahey, a pretty and vivacious woman, went to dinner on June 27 with Capano at Ristorante Panorama on Front Street in Philadelphia. The eatery, which is still there, was considered one of the city's great wine destinations and featured classic Italian cuisine.\n\nCapano, married for 24 years, had recently separated from his wife. Going to Philadelphia was his routine. He had multiple mistresses and liked to take them on dates far away from his home and nosy, prying eyes in New Castle County.\n\n\"Wilmington is a small town, a gossipy place,\" he said on the witness stand on Dec. 17, 1998.\n\nAccording to a waitress that night, dinner wasn’t going so well. Capano ordered the food without consulting Fahey. They drank wine and picked at calamari and bruschetta, both looking miserable.\n\nFahey had met Capano in 1993, and wrote in her diary she fell in love with him on her January 1994 birthday. He lavished her with attention, gifts and visits to expensive restaurants. Capano also knew some of Fahey’s hidden secrets, such as she suffered from eating disorders.\n\nIn September 1995, Fahey met Scanlan, who was unmarried and closer to her age. She wanted to end the affair with Capano. But when they left the Panorama restaurant at about 9:30 p.m. June 27, it would be the last time Fahey was seen in public.\n\nTwo days later, family and friends, concerned that she failed to keep a dinner date with Scanlan at her brother’s house, went to her 1718 Washington St. apartment on the third-floor and found it empty. They also find a diary Fahey kept where she wrote that Capano was “a jealous maniac.”\n\nCapano was questioned twice on June 30 at his $2,000 a month rental home at 2302 Grant Ave. in the city’s Highlands neighborhood. Police looked through his home and a Jeep Grand Cherokee, but, at that time, found no signs of Fahey.\n\nMissing person photos of Fahey, a blue-eyed beauty with dark, curly hair, and yellow ribbons begin appearing on telephone poles, trees and signs around Wilmington. A billboard went up on I-95. Her family started a vigil on the front porch of the Washington Street apartment. They frequently met up at O’Friel’s Irish Pub, a then-popular bar in downtown Wilmington. Time marches on and the bar has closed. The building went up for sale in 2001 and later became a salon and spa.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton called Fahey’s boss, Gov. Tom Carper, now Delaware's senior senator, whom Fahey had worked for since her 1991 graduation from Dover's Wesley College.\n\nOn July 5, 1996, Clinton said the federal government would help with the search. However, it seems he forgot to notify the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Delaware, according to Connolly.\n\n“I was in the grocery store, the Acme on [U.S.] 202, and I ran into Judge Greg Sleet, who was the U.S. attorney, my boss. The lead story of The News Journal that day was President Clinton offered federal assistance. Judge Greg Sleet and I laughed because Greg Sleet was the U.S. attorney, so he was the chief federal law enforcement officer, and nobody had contacted him,” Connolly said.\n\n“If you were really going to get the feds involved, you would contact him. He said, 'Well, I'll call over to Wilmington, and we'll offer our services.' The next working day, July 8, the FBI called us.”\n\nState prosecutors later agreed to bow out of the picture. A federal grand jury investigation, which had to remain secret, began.\n\nConnolly, leading a team of investigators, began methodically chipping away at the investigation by conducting interviews, searches, and combing through phone and financial records.\n\nOn July 26, 1996, he and Wilmington police investigator Bob Donovan discovered, through financial records, Capano had made a purchase at a company listed as Wallpaper Warehouse two days after Fahey was last seen in public alive.\n\n“I knew enough about Capano at that point, because we're a week or so into the investigation, I know that he was not the kind of guy who does home improvements himself. I know he's living in a rental house, so he wouldn't be buying wallpaper. I thought it was very weird,” Connolly said.\n\nThey called the number, the person who answered said, “Airbase Carpet.”\n\n“Immediately, Bob and I looked at each other, and thought, 'Oh my goodness, he rolled her up in the carpet. That's what this is all about,'\" Connolly said.\n\nInvestigators also learn later Capano has replaced a love seat, and an employee of Capano’s brother, developer Louis L. Capano Jr., tells them on July 1 he was ordered to have a half-filled trash bin emptied from a Concord Pike construction site.\n\nThey also find Capano has visited a Happy Harry’s store in Trolley Square on June 30 and asks about a blood remover.\n\nInvestigators search Capano’s house for 11 hours on July 31 and find two tiny drops of blood that they later learn matches a sample of Fahey’s blood plasma.\n\nA search takes place Aug. 12-16 of two local landfills to try and find the rug, sofa and other evidence. The search is messy, and officers come up empty.\n\nA turning point arrives in October 1997 when federal agents raid the Wilmington home of Capano's brother Gerry and find illegal drugs and guns.\n\nCapano's brothers Gerald and Louis agree to began cooperating with the authorities in November 1997 to avoid federal charges.\n\nGerry becomes a cooperating witness. He tells authorities that he took out his boat, Summer Wind, and helped Capano dispose of a body in the Atlantic Ocean on Friday, June 28, 1996. He provided other incriminating evidence, including getting rid of a sofa with a basketball-sized bloodstain, and a rug.\n\nHis brother Louis says the stained sofa and rug were put into a dumpster on one of his properties.\n\nAfter the brothers began cooperation with the prosecution as part of a plea agreement, Capano is arrested on Nov. 12, 1997.\n\nWharton said Capano seemed to think he could get away with murder. Why?\n\n“Because he always had. He had done a lot of bad things that nobody ever called him into account for and he thought he could control things,” Wharton said.\n\n“He thought the investigation would be confined to the Wilmington police looking for a missing person which they were never going to be able to find.”\n\nIn February 1998, Deborah MacIntyre, a longtime Capano girlfriend, also signs a plea agreement and becomes a witness for the prosecution. She shares that she bought a .22-caliber gun at Capano’s request. It has never been recovered. MacIntyre also turns over her steamy letters she wrote to Capano and begins taping phone calls he makes to her from prison.\n\nAn outraged Capano asks an inmate, Nicholas Perillo, to arrange to burglarize MacIntyre’s house to intimidate her. The burglary never happened.\n\nDefense attorney Maurer will later accuse MacIntyre of firing the shot that killed Fahey. She vehemently denies it.\n\nThe case takes a twist when Capano attorney Joseph A. Hurley announces in early April 1998 he's quitting the defense team. Hurley, who had been friends with Capano for at least eight years, at that time would give no reason saying only that he will take it \"to his grave.\"\n\nOn Friday – 19 years later – he shared for the first time exclusively with The News Journal that a moment of moral clarity came to him while attending a funeral Mass at St. Helena's Catholic Church in Penny Hill for public defender James F. McCloskey Jr.\n\nHurley sat in a pew, in his childhood church, and said he had a conversation with God.\n\n\"I can only surmise that there was something making me feel like I was falling into an evil pit and this conversation, if that's what you have with God, [went] 'Joe, you're not like this. You can't be this way.'\"\n\n\"I think I was probably facing the reality he was, in fact, guilty of premeditated murder,\" Hurley said.\n\nHe said he'd never asked Capano what happened the night Fahey disappeared.\n\n\"I didn't want to ask him and hear the answer,\" Hurley said.\n\nHe left church, went to see Capano in prison and quit the case.\n\nNo longer considering him a friend, Hurley never saw Capano again.\n\n\"Killing a human being? No. That's the end of friendship,\" Hurley said.\n\nCapano’s trial begins Oct. 6, 1998, with jury selection. Capano’s attorneys try to talk him out of selecting young women.\n\n“The last thing we wanted on a jury was women under 30 with a college education because they would identify immediately with the victim,” Boston lawyer Oteri said.\n\nJudge Lee recalled after the women were included on the jury, he was approached by Oteri who said, \"'Can I go off the record, Judge?' And I went, 'Sure. Off the record.'\"\n\nOteri said: 'The dumb son of a bitch thinks they are going to fall in love with him.'\"\n\nOteri told The News Journal last week that he didn't recall the conversation.\n\nJudge Lee said he didn't know Capano when \"he had the reputation of being a charming man, but in the setting in which I knew him, he was more rodent-like. He was a frightening, scary figure. There was nothing charming about him at all.\"\n\nOteri, who joined the defense team only months before the trial started, drops a bombshell in his opening statement: He says while Capano did dump Fahey’s body at sea, she died from an “outrageous, horrible, tragic accident.”\n\nCapano claims Fahey was shot to death accidentally by MacIntyre in a jealous fit of rage, while she was attempting suicide. \"His story is nonsense,\" Wharton said.\n\nAnd it just gets keep getting stranger.\n\nNeil S. Kaye, a psychiatrist who met Fahey hours before she meets Capano for dinner, shows up to testify in a wooden hat. It earns almost as much attention as what he has to say about Fahey’s fear of ending her relationship with Capano because of his “rage and anger.”\n\nKeith R. Brady, who is then Delaware’s chief deputy attorney and Wharton’s superior, is called to testify about a sexual encounter he had five years earlier with MacIntyre while Capano watched. Capano has said he was supposed to golf with Brady the day after Fahey's death. Connolly questions him on the stand for the prosecution, and Oteri delves into the encounter with MacIntrye. Brady takes an unpaid leave of absence after leaving the stand.\n\n“I don't think Keith ever really accepted the fact that he was going to be a witness. He always thought that was not going to happen,” Wharton said. “We were very discreet about that, the way we phrased our questions, but Oteri was not. Keith looked like he was a dead man up there.”\n\nConnolly reads up on Capano’s cases when he was prosecutor and believes the Wilmington lawyer killed Fahey based on a 1976 murder Capano had prosecuted. Connolly says a man called Robert “Squeaky” Saunders shot a victim in the head, threw the body in a canal and disposed of the gun.\n\nConnolly also continues to get under Capano’s skin. In a burst of anger, he calls Connolly “a heartless, gutless, soulless disgrace of a human being” and is removed from the courtroom.\n\nA final last-minute surprise comes when a neighbor of MacIntyre comes forward in the remaining few days of the trial to say she saw a sobbing MacIntyre stumble out of her car on the night around when Fahey is killed. The neighbor claims the area was lit by floodlights.\n\nBut Connolly tracks down a Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, handyman who says he installed a new, brighter light fixture at MacIntyre’s house – six months after Fahey’s death.\n\nNearly 20 years later, the trial continues to be surreal for Erin Reilly Lee, whose willing venture into Fahey's plastic coffin helped bring focus to a divided jury and sealed Capano’s fate.\n\nHer journey began in Trolley Square, where Lee lived nearly oblivious to the developing Capano-Fahey saga.\n\nShe received a jury duty summons but was certain there were too many similarities between her and Fahey to be picked for jury duty. Lee went to the courthouse believing she would be sent away soon.\n\nWharton remembers that day. “Erin Reilly was a potential juror. She came in, in a plaid sort of jumper. She could have been Anne Marie Fahey. Tall, attractive. The defense lawyers wanted to strike her, but Capano insisted on keeping her because, I think, he thought, he could charm her.”\n\nAt voir dire, the process through which potential jurors are questioned by either the judge or a lawyer, Lee was interrogated then asked to leave the courtroom. When she returned, she was stunned when the judge said she’d been selected.\n\n“My brain just kind of stopped,” she said. “I was so shocked that I looked at him and I said, ‘I’m sorry. Excuse me, what did you say?’”\n\nShe remembers the somewhat taken aback judge reiterating that she’d been selected as a juror.\n\n“I kind of didn’t really hear a whole lot after that because I was thinking, ‘My mom is going to kill me. How am I going to be on this trial?’” Erin Reilly Lee said.\n\nAs the monthslong trial began, Lee watched the attorneys present evidence and question witnesses who would later help her, and others jurors, reach their conclusions. This includes Connolly questioning Capano about how he placed Fahey in the cooler.\n\n“Colm Connolly did such a phenomenal job of getting us to think about, could he really place this girl’s body into a big fishing cooler,” she said. “The way he would just keep pushing Tom.\n\n“Tom said, ‘I had this cooler that I was going to give to my brother and I panicked and so I just figured I’d put her body in there.’ ”\n\nBut Connolly kept pushing, wanting to know – and the jurors – if the body easily fit in or if bones had to be broken to make it fit.\n\n“When we were deliberating, it’s something that we kept coming back to,” Lee said. “You know, could she just fit?”\n\nWhen Lee didn’t fit, jurors realized that Capano was lying. It made it easier to find holes in other parts of his testimony.\n\nConnolly’s ability to bring out the anger in Capano, showed jurors another picture of the former prosecutor who, on the stand, was portraying himself as a meek man.\n\n“Colm did a great job at letting us see [Capano’s] anger and how he could turn,” she said.\n\n“It definitely was surprising. It’s not something I ever would even thought of happening in Wilmington, Delaware.”\n\nContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299, eparra@delawareonline.com or Twitter @eparra3.

He said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built it several years ago to discourage people from sledding on the dam, which can be very dangerous.\n\n“It has a nice parking lot and it’s a fenced-in area,” Meyers said. “It’s a nice, easy slope to walk up and slide down. It’s a big hill meant just for sledding.”\n\nQuarry Trails:Quarry Trails Metro Park is now open: 5 things to know about the new park\n\nDelaware State Park also has a designated sledding hill, Meyers continued.\n\nHowever, his favorite spot to take his daughter sledding when she was younger was at Gallant Woods Park in the Preservation Parks system in Delaware County.\n\nSledding, Meyers said, gives people a great excuse to get outside and get moving even when temperatures are chillier. The activity allows people to see the beautiful parks around central Ohio in a new light and during a different time of year.\n\n“For me, I love winter,” Meyers said. “I think the parks are the most beautiful in the winter.

Juanita Albright, Dawn Lang, Ben Orr and Tiffany Pascoe ran together as a slate of like-minded candidates in opposition to the district's current leadership and priorities. They won decisively; the slimmest margin of victory was more than 14 points.\n\nThe races for three seats and the majority on the Carmel Clay Schools board have been hotly contested and, at times, ugly.

In doing so, she released the following statement:\n\n\"When we decided to run for Marion County Prosecutor, we knew this was an uphill climb. The odds were stacked against us running as a Republican in a blue county, but the stakes were too high not to try.

Todd Young\n\nThomas McDermott, the democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, told gatherers at the Democratic watch party in downtown Indianapolis that he called Republican Sen. Todd Young to concede the race.\n\nThis comes shortly after the Associated Press officially called the race for Young.\n\nSurrounded by supporters in T-shirts and carrying signs, McDermott thanked supporters, family and friends. The night did not go the way he wanted.

Young and support him and try to move American forward because we lot of problems in this country,\" McDermott said. \"We got a lot of problems in this state. We need our elected leaders in Washington DC to do a great job for us.”\n\nYoung, meanwhile, is giving a victory speech at the Republican watch party at the JW Marriott.\n\n\"It's tempting to think of election nights like this as the end of something,\" Young said. \"This is the beginning of something new.\"\n\n8:20 p.m. ― Ryan Mears leads Marion County prosecutors race\n\nIncumbent Democrat Ryan Mears has taken an early lead over Republican Cyndi Carrasco in the race for Marion County prosecutor.\n\nMears, as of 8 p.m. Tuesday, has earned 58% of the votes so far, with 22% of voting centers reporting returns. Carrasco has earned 41% of votes.\n\nMeanwhile, in Hamilton County, former radio talk show host Greg Garrison is holding an early lead in the race for prosecutor. Republican Garrison had tallied 54% of the vote against Democrat Jessica Paxson, with 40 of 217 precincts reporting.\n\n8 p.m. ― Democratic watch party sees speeches by U.S. Rep. Andre Carson, Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett\n\nMore than an hour after the polls closed in Indiana, Congressman Andre Carson walked into the Democratic Party's election watch party to deliver one of the first speeches of the night. The party is taking place at Nevermore, all-encompassing entertainment venue, restaurant and bar on Meridian Street in Downtown Indianapolis.\n\nAn incumbent running to retain his seat, Carson was surrounded by well-wishers, waiting to shake his hand or take a picture. They cheered as some waved campaign signs.\n\nHogsett took the podium before him and introduced Carson, calling the Congressman \"a legend.\"\n\nCarson, Hogsett said, has worked with Democrats in Washington to deliver the American Rescue Plan, a bipartisan infrastructure law that invests in roads and bridges and tackling inflation. Hogsett called Carson a tireless advocate and someone with the heart to do the right thing.\n\nBut there are no celebrations yet.\n\n\"While the margin will settle over the coming hours, it's clear that Indianapolis voters know who can deliver for them in Washington DC,\" he said.\n\nTo cheers, Carson thanked his campaign staff and referenced the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol. That’s the one place he and his colleagues thought was sacred, he said, retelling the story of the insurrection.\n\n“In an empty building with broken glass and debris, then piece by piece, brick by brick, we started to rebuild our democracy,” he said to applause. “That’s what tonight is all about. We have to rebuild again. Win or lose, we need to tell every person who voted today, and who didn’t vote today, that they shouldn’t give up. Our party has the best message. Our party has the best agenda. Our party represents the true values of the American people. Our party represents Hoosiers values.”\n\nMovements, Carson said, are not created behind computer screens or by sitting at home. “They are created when we do the work, and you all have done the work today,” he said.\n\n-Alexandria Burris\n\n7:40 p.m. ― Early projections call U.S. Senate race for Todd Young\n\nCBS, NBC and ABC are calling the Indiana's U.S. Senate race for Republican Sen. Todd Young, though just 12% of the votes have been counted, not including Marion County's.\n\nSo far, Young has 62% of the vote, compared to Democrat Thomas McDermott's 35% and Libertarian James Sceniak's 3%.\n\n7 p.m. ― With polls closed, some early results trickle in\n\nThe Republican party is showing some early leads in key state races so far.\n\nWith about 2% of the vote counted, Republican Diego Morales has 49% of the vote for Indiana secretary of state, while Democrat Destiny Wells has 48% of the vote and Libertarian James Maurer has 3% of the vote.\n\nMore:Indiana election: Republicans have early leads in auditor, treasurer & secretary of state races\n\nIn the race for Indiana's U.S. Senate seat, Republican Sen. Todd Young has a comfortable margin over Democratic challenger Thomas McDermott and Libertarian candidate James Sceniak.\n\nWith about 4% of the votes counted, Young has 58% of the vote, McDermott 39% and Sceniak 3%.\n\nRepublican Auditor Tera Klutz has an early lead in her reelection bid against Democrat ZeNai Brooks and Libertarian John Schick. With about 2% of the vote counted, Klutz has 59% of the vote, Brooks has 39% and Schick has 2% of the vote.\n\nRepublican Daniel Elliott, the chair of the Morgan County Republican Party, has an early lead against Democrat Jessica McClellan, the Monroe County treasurer, on the ballot for state treasurer. With about 2% of the vote counted, Elliott has 52% of the vote and McClellan has 47% of the vote.\n\n6 p.m. ― Abortion and crime are key issues for voters in West side Indianapolis\n\nInside the Roy G. Holland Memorial Park Building, a short line to show ID and access a voting machine formed just before polls closed at 6 p.m. As the sun dropped and temperatures lowered, a steady stream of voters moved in and out.\n\nDorothy Andrews, 75, of Fishers, is a regular voter who normally splits her choices between Democrats and Republicans. But this year, citing the abortion debate, economy and future of social programs, she selected a straight Democratic ticket.\n\n\"Medicare is a big one for me,\" Andrews said. Asked if she meant to protect the program's funding, she nodded. \"At least until I die.\"\n\n5:50 p.m. ― Abortion and crime are key issues for voters in West side Indianapolis\n\nLate Tuesday afternoon, voter traffic ticked up as the sun started to set on the west side of Indianapolis at Lakeview Church.\n\nBy 5 p.m., campaign volunteer Meredith Easley had logged 11 hours. She’d been there since before sunrise.\n\n“I’d say there’s been about 600 voters,” she said. “The age skews older. I haven’t seen anyone under 21.”\n\nA Marine veteran accompanied by an oxygen tank walked by as she talked. So did a man on crutches, missing one leg.\n\n“It’s sad,” Easley said. “I wish the young people could see how hard the old people who’ve been coming have to work just to get here.”\n\nMichael Hicks, 56, and his wife, Camille Hicks, 53, from nearby Speedway, voted here today. They had one particular issue in mind: crime.\n\n“Somebody tried to break in our house two months ago,” Michael said. “There’s no such thing as a decent neighborhood anymore.”\n\nMichael, an army veteran, voted straight Democrat. He hopes whoever is elected will increase police presence in the area.\n\n“My neighbor just had a bullet shot through their window,” he added. “It’s ridiculous.”\n\nOn the younger end of the voting spectrum seen at Lakeview Church was Sabrina Martinez, 29, who lives less than five minutes away. She showed up to vote for the first time ever but was rejected.\n\n“They couldn’t find me in the system,” Martinez said. “When they scanned my I.D., they couldn’t find me.”\n\nMartinez said the inspector made a phone call to figure out what could’ve gone wrong but said the phone just rang without anyone answering. He told her there was nothing he could do, she said, so she left.\n\nVoting info:What to bring and how to vote in Indiana\n\n“I feel… not necessarily disappointed but concerned,” Martinez said, “because how many other people did this happen to?”\n\nAbortion rights were the big issue that compelled her to the polls. She said she knows women who’ve been directly impacted by the change in law.\n\n“I’d like to see abortion be legal again,” Martinez said.\n\n-Brandon Drenon\n\nIndiana races to watch:It's election day. Here are Indiana races to watch\n\n5:20 p.m. ― Overturning of Roe V. Wade, education issues draw voters to IPS administration building\n\nBy late afternoon, the number of voters walking into the IPS administration building in downtown Indianapolis has slowed to a trickle.\n\nGregory Touney, 38, Indianapolis, thinks educators are underrepresented in the state legislature, which is why he voted for Andrea Tunley for state senator.\n\nTunley is a principal at the Center for Inquiry School 2, an IPS magnet school in the heart of downtown. She is running against Republican Evan Shearin for State Senate District 46, which encompasses downtown Indianapolis.\n\nTouney said many of his neighbors know Tunley as their children’s principal and has heard only good things about her.\n\n“I think it would be great to send an educator to the statehouse,” said Touney, who has two kids ages 2 and 10 months. “The impression I get from people is that she’s someone who has parents enthusiastic about her, who understands firsthand as an educator what issues are important.”\n\nOthers, like several who voted Tuesday, said abortion is the single most important issue for them.\n\n“(The overturning of) Roe v Wade has a huge impact on maternal health across the state and across the country,” said Cassandra Tice, 33, Indianapolis, who works in healthcare as a grant writer for IU Health.\n\nVivian Nayiga, 36, Indianapolis, said she prefers no government intervention when it comes to women’s bodies.\n\n“I don’t like that people are trying to tell women what to do with their bodies. It’s their choice,” said Nayiga, who said she’s voting for a straight Democratic ticket.\n\n-Kristine Phillips\n\n4:50 p.m. ― Steady stream in Hamilton County includes a House candidate\n\nA trickle of voters moved through First Baptist Church, 1010 E. 126th St. in Carmel, at 12:30 p.m. Married couple Gene and Sandy Bone, 87 and 75, of Carmel, said they are regular voters and supporting the entire Republican slate in 2022.\n\n\"We were headed in the right direction, and now we're going the opposite,\" Sandy Bone said.\n\nBone said energy independence and rising costs were major concerns.\n\n\"Too many people are suffering,\" she said.\n\nThe Bones don't normally vote solely for one party, Sandy said, but did so on Tuesday.\n\nFoot traffic was more sparse at nearby Chinese Community Church, 3405 E. 116th St., as only a handful of voters entered and exited between 1:15 and 1:30 p.m.\n\nJust before 2 p.m., Jack Belbot, 59, of Carmel, voted at Faith Apostolic Church, 1212 E. 116th St. in Carmel. This year, he split his ticket. He was concerned about the economy, border security and energy independence.\n\nMatt McNally, the Democratic challenger in Indiana House District 39, arrived at Faith Apostolic around 2 p.m. It was stop 18 in his plan to visit all 24 polling places within the district.\n\nMcNally said it was \"hard to tell\" how his race, one of the cycle's more intriguing in the statehouse, was going at this early juncture.\n\n\"It's all anecdotal, you know?\" he said. \"We've seen some posts on social media from people who are supporting us, but (in person) people are private about who they vote for.\"\n\nHe said his campaign contacted some 30,000 voters ahead of the election and knocked on one-third of the doors in the district.\n\nAsked about the issues commonly cited by voters who spoke to IndyStar on election — the economy, abortion, energy independence — McNally said he believes the issues are all interconnected.\n\n\"Indiana needs to be a place that is good for business but also good for the employees of those businesses,\" McNally said. \"Companies like Lilly have said we'll move if our employees can't access good health care and safe public schools. The state says we're going to ban abortion, and that affects the economy when people leave the state.\"\n\nThe stream through CrossRoads Church at Westfield, 19201 Grassy Branch Road, was fairly constant as of 3 p.m. A few dozen cars filled the parking lot, and voters entered or exited the building every minute or two.\n\nMandy Snyder, 40, of Westfield, said she had voted in every election since turning 18.\n\n\"It's how you express your opinion, which I like to do,\" Snyder said as she pushed a stroller containing her 1-year-old son, Cash.\n\nShe cited the economy and crime as reasons for voting, and she typically supported Republicans.\n\n\"I'm concerned about what's going on around me,\" Snyder said. \"Crime has infiltrated our area, even up in Hamilton County. My Westfield moms group has posts about somebody stealing a wallet and things like that near where we live.\"\n\n-Rory Appleton\n\n4:30 p.m. ― Some turnout updates from Central Indiana\n\nElections clerks in Central Indiana counties say this Election Day has been consistently busy and relatively smooth.\n\nAs of about 4:30p.m., 132,216 people have voted in Marion County, in addition to about 50,000 early in-person voters and just under 25,000 mail-in ballots, which are still tricking in, election board deputy director Brent Stinson said. All told, those votes would comprise about 30% of registered voters in the county.\n\nIn Boone County, 9,931 people have voted, with the only long line clerk Jessica Fouts is aware of being in Zionsville. This 36% turnout so far is lower than she expected, given that 56% turned out for the midterms in 2018, she said.\n\nIn Johnson County, 20,359 people have voted in person today. Elections Administrator Beth Sheller hasn't heard of any lines longer than 30 to 40 people, and most poll workers have told her they've been consistently busy all day. In Hancock County, 8,601 people have showed up today.\n\n-Kayla Dwyer\n\n3:30 p.m. ― Abortion and crime pull voters in Fountain Square\n\n﻿For several voters who walked into the Indianapolis Fire Department station in Fountain Square Tuesday afternoon, abortion is the most pressing issue.\n\nCaroline Clark, 30, Indianapolis, said she was really distraught after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending five decades of federal protection on abortion rights. Clark said she does not plan to have children, but several women in her family and circle of friends did not have the kind of independence she enjoys. Some of them, she said, had children at a young age, while others are stuck in abusive relationships.\n\nLike Clark, Sharon Anton, 33, Indianapolis, voted for a straight Democratic ticket, with women’s right to choose in mind.\n\n“I think there’s a lot of major players in government that feel they have the right to make decisions for other people,” Anton said. “(Abortion) is a personal decision. The government has no place.”\n\nThe issue is pressing not just to women.\n\n“I’m tired of old white men thinking they can make choices for everybody,” said Joseph Hofmeister, 30, Indianapolis.\n\nSome have other things in mind.\n\nOssie Pryor, 89, Indianapolis, said she voted for Cyndi Carrasco for Marion County prosecutor because she thinks the Republican challenger will solve the city’s rising crime problem.\n\nPryor, once a loyal Democrat, said she’s particularly disappointed in Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears’ decision to not enforce the state’s red flag law against Brandon Scott Hole, who killed and injured several people at a FedEx facility last year. The gun control law allows law enforcement to take weapons from people deemed dangerous to themselves or to others. Police confiscated a gun from Hole because of suicidal threats months before the FedEx shooting, but Mears’ office decided to not move forward with red flag proceedings.\n\nIn one of the more controversial races, Pryor said she voted for Democrat Destiny Wells for secretary of state.\n\n“The other guy … he has some issues. That’s all I gotta' say,” referring to the slew of controversies, including sexual assault allegations, against Republican candidate Diego Morales.\n\nKevin Anton, 32, Indianapolis, has a broader take. His hope this election season is to elect politicians who aren’t detached from reality. He said both parties are guilty of it, but one example is Republicans’ decision to vote against Donald Trump’s impeachment despite evidence of wrongdoing by the former president.\n\n“You’re just not seeing what’s in front of you,” Anton said.\n\n-Kristine Phillips\n\n3:15 p.m. ― Some tech issues cause long lines in Broad Ripple\n\nOne of the three printers that spat out ballots went down and a replacement printer also glitched, leading to some long waits at Broad Ripple High School today.\n\nMid morning, the line stretched down a hallway inside the school and into the parking lot. Some people were directed to other polling places which had shorter waits.\n\nBy early afternoon, the line outside had nearly disappeared but people still could expect to wait at least half an hour.\n\nThe longer wait at Broad Ripple High School did not deter voters. Susan Vaughn stepped into the school, saw the line and stepped right out. But Vaughn, 53, had no intention of not voting. The mother of two adult daughters, she said that wanted to vote to ensure that they would have full reproductive rights.\n\nSo Vaughn hopped in her car and drove to another polling place about two miles away where she was able to walk in and out.\n\nMark Anderson, 47, who last voted in the 2020 Presidential Election, stuck it out. That time, he said, he waited not one but two hours to vote.\n\n-Shari Rudavsky\n\n3 p.m. ― Some colorful attire at Broad Ripple High School\n\nIn fourth grade, Larry Mitchell voted for Eisenhower in the class’s mock election. But since then he has moved ever left. This year the 75-yer-old Broad Ripple resident did not hesitate as he voted the straight Democratic ticket.\n\nMany people, he said as he exited Broad Ripple High School, will likely end up voting straight tickets.\n\n“There’s such an ideological split that you vote for parties,” he said. “I voted for the party that’s happier and nicer.”\n\nWearing a white t-shirt that proclaimed the phrase “Makey Sensey,” Jordan Hayes, 23, said the message was not meant to be a pointed one for the day.\n\nHayes, who said she voted the straight Democratic ticket at Broad Ripple High School, said she votes for two reasons: One, her parents always told her to do so and two, voting gives her the right to gripe.\n\n“I can’t complain if I don’t vote,” Hayes said, “whatever happens at least I said my piece.”\n\nColin Saunders was doing more than saying his piece. He was wearing it. Decked out in shorts, sunglasses and a hat emblazoned with the Stars and Stripes, Saunders, 35, said this has been his go-to Election Day outfit since he turned 18.\n\nSome people might assume given his sartorial choices that his ballot choice leaned Republican but Saunders said he typically votes for the Democratic candidates and did so this year with the Jan. 6th hearings, abortion and inflation top of mind.\n\n“There’s no monopoly on loving your country,” he said. “I just hope there’s better days to come.”\n\n-Shari Rudavsky\n\n2:05 p.m. — Warren Park Government Center is bustling\n\nBrock Wagner, 32, and Jaris Wagner, 30, said they came out to vote today on the topic of abortion.\n\nThe Indianapolis couple said “we think our baby is very, very super cute, so we voted pro-life.” Their son Maccabee is 11 months old.\n\nWarren Park resident Gary Brewer, 66, said he is out to vote because it’s his right to do so and he’s taking advantage of it.\n\n“There are a lot of changes going around, a lot of them negative, I think, so I’m just trying to do something positive with my vote,” he said.\n\n— Sarah Bowman\n\n1:15 p.m. — Voting is duty for these Indianapolis residents\n\nAt the Sacred Heart Parish Hall, sisters Shirley Mitchell and Linda Walls emphasized the importance of having your voice heard.\n\n\"This is one of my duties,\" said Mitchell, 65, who lives near downtown.\n\nFor Walls, 63, she said: \"I want the Democrats to get in there to win.\"\n\n\"Get out here and vote,\" Walls said. \"Even if you aren't a Democrat,\" she added.\n\nThe issue of women's rights brought 67-year-old Sue Gilliatt to the voting center.\n\n\"I just wanted to support the candidates who support the majority's opinion,\" she said.\n\nShe also talked about the economy. The current economy's woes were not created by either political party, she said; instead, she pointed to the pandemic, which created supply chain issues.\n\n\"As far as the economy goes, it's like when you throw a rock into a puddle,\" she said. \"It causes ripples.\"\n\nDave Ellis, 58, encouraged other voters to state their opinions by casting a ballot.\n\nThough he's a Republican living in a red state, he said he still tends to split his ticket — including in the 2022 midterm election.\n\n\"I vote the issue and I vote the character of the person,\" said Ellis, who lives near downtown.\n\nWhen asked what issues were important to him in this election, Ellis said: \"The right to choose for women.\"\n\n— Ryan Martin\n\n12:45 p.m. — Voters in downtown Indy cite abortion, crime as major concerns\n\nAt the City-County Building in downtown Indianapolis, lines have been relatively short and fast-moving as voters slowly trickle in.\n\nQueen Esther Ray, 67, Indianapolis voted for a straight Democratic ticket. As someone who’s had an abortion herself, she said women’s access to a safe and lawful abortion is one of the issues driving her. She cited the case of the 10-year-old girl from Ohio whose story became a flashpoint for a national conversation about abortion. The girl was raped and went to Indiana for an abortion.\n\n“She’ll have no life if they made her keep that baby,” Ray said. “She’ll be growing up with that baby.”\n\nThe economy has also been top-of-mind for Ray. “It’s getting to be a big struggle to pay for food. It’s ridiculous how much butter costs!”\n\nDemocrats nationally have been facing headwinds ahead of the midterm elections because of rising prices, but that did not affect Ray’s support for the party.\n\n“Democrats still struggle, but I believe, long enough, they’ll get it right,” she said. “It takes time.”\n\nMargo Rickter, over 40, lives in downtown Indianapolis, so crime and safety in the area are important to her. She cited the city’s struggles to hire and retain police officers, as well as the need to fund not only public safety agencies but also places like the Wheeler Mission, which helps the city’s homeless.\n\nRickter, who does not affiliate with any party, voted for Republican Cyndi Carrasco for Marion County prosecutor. Carrasco has blamed Democratic incumbent Ryan Mears for the city’s rising surge in homicides and has criticized the sitting prosecutor for not being aggressive enough in enforcing laws.\n\nRickter, a single woman, said she wants the heart of the city to be safer.\n\n“Majority of my taxes go for things I would never use, like schools, which is okay,” she said, adding that city officials should appropriate taxpayer dollars to make downtown safer, not only for someone like her but also for families with children.\n\n— Kristine Phillips\n\n12:45 p.m. — Over 40,000 voters in Hamilton County, no significant issues\n\nAs of around 12:15 p.m., 42,712 people had voted in Hamilton County on Tuesday, around 30% turnout, election administrator Beth Sheller told IndyStar.\n\nSome locations had long lines, around 30 minutes, but otherwise things were going smoothly. They had to replace two machines, \"which is pretty typical,\" Sheller said.\n\n— Claire Rafford\n\n12:40 p.m. — Updates from the Twittersphere\n\n12:30 p.m. — Vote for Graciela's birthday\n\n12:30 p.m. — Slow going at fire station on Indy's westside\n\nThings were mostly quiet at the Indianapolis Fire Department Station 18 Tuesday morning, a voting center on Indianapolis’ west side.\n\nDozens of campaign signs sat lined up on each side of the walkway, leading toward the entrance. The American flag fluttered high above. Nearby, standing below, was Courtney Rice, 55, the lone campaign volunteer at the location and the only person in sight outside the firehouse at 9:15 a.m.\n\nHoping to bolster support for Jeb Bardon for Wayne Township Trustee, Rice said he’d been there since 5:45.\n\n“It’s been slow. Very slow,” Rice said. “I’d be surprised if there were 75 people that voted here.”\n\nIt was a stark contrast compared to what Rice said he heard the scene was like two years ago when a line of voters wrapped around the building for the presidential election.\n\nEarnest Feather, 58, who lives less than a mile away, showed up to vote. This year, he said he was particularly surprised by the number of candidates up for election.\n\n“I think government has gotten way too big,” Feather said. “I’ve never even heard of half the names on the ballot.”\n\nFeather voted Republican, concerned about inflation and the rising cost of daily expenses like food and gas. However, he’s especially worried about crime.\n\n“These shootings and stuff just got to go,” Feather said. “It’s getting ridiculous.”\n\n“Respect for law enforcement has gone down,” he added. “The financial burdens everyone is going through right now. It’s tough. Harder now than it used to be.”\n\nOver the years Feather has seen Indianapolis change and, according to him, not for the better. He said his vote is underlined by a desire to “just see people happier.”\n\nWalking up to the polling site with her rescue dog, Bentley, a Shih Tzu-Yorkie, Lindsay Berlin, 35, did not have crime and inflation on the top of her priority list.\n\n“I care more about human rights and social justice,” Berlin said, “than how much I pay for taxes.”\n\n“Women are dying because they don’t have the right to choose what to do with their bodies.”\n\nBerlin said she votes with a hope to improve the lives of those in need, those who can’t help themselves, and not about money.\n\nShe voted Democrat, as she has every year, she said, since her first election, voting for former President Obama in 2008. This year, though, Berlin said things feel different.\n\n“There’s so much division,” Berlin said. “There’s never been such a divide amongst peers, colleagues, family and friends.”\n\n— Brandon Drenon\n\n12:30 p.m. — A midterm that’s a pulse for the next election\n\nMickey Lentz, who lives in the Southport area, doesn’t think this midterm feels different from others. But she does believe it will give an indication of what’s to come in the next election.\n\n“You kind of know the pulse of the people and what they’re thinking and what party or person has risen to his or her potential and done something for the city, the state, the country,” said Lentz, 81, outside the Indy Honda voting site off U.S. 31 and East Stop 12 Road. “I think it gives us a chance to kind of weigh that in the next two years before the next presidential election.”\n\nFirst-time voter Paige Tucker, 18, made sure that pulse included young people’s views — a perspective her mom Tisha Tucker, of Perry Township, said will be important this midterm.\n\n“I think young people have a better adaptability to being open-minded,” said Paige Tucker outside of Resurrection Lutheran Church.\n\n“Having children of voting age, they definitely have very different views and opinions about things and so it’s important for them to learn how to get out and advocate for themselves and others on those issues,” said Tisha Tucker, 48.\n\nAfter getting some initial voter registration issues sorted out, Paige called the voting process smooth and easy.\n\n“I feel 18,” she said.\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\n12:05 p.m. — Inflation an important issue for some Noblesville voters\n\nAt about 10:45 a.m., there was a steady trickle in and out of Our Lady of Grace Catholic Church as Noblesville voters cast their ballots.\n\nFor Mike Pierce, 65, of Noblesville, the Senate race was important. Pierce, a Republican, voted for Todd Young and is hoping Republicans can get control of the House and Senate.\n\nAnother important issue was rising prices due to inflation, he said.\n\nScott Britton, 50, of Noblesville, said things are less clear-cut for him.\n\n“I’m all about balance,” he said. “I think we’ve seen a lot of polarizing things going on.”\n\nBritton said the Republican Party has been frustrating him in recent years: “I am actually a registered Republican, and I’m disgusted with the direction the party has taken.”\n\nAnother issue that got him to the polls was the school board elections. Britton, who has children in school, said that he strongly believes in supporting teachers because they’ve been educated on how to teach.\n\nMonica and Warren Brown, 67, of Noblesville, arrived at the polls to vote together.\n\nBoth said they aren’t affiliated with a party and prefer to vote candidate-by-candidate. The main thing they were thinking about as they voted was “the rising cost of everything.”\n\nMonica Warren also pointed out discomfort with polarization.\n\n“Instead of the backbiting, I want people to work together,” she said.\n\n— Phyllis Cha\n\n12:05 p.m. — 'My ancestors fought and died for me to be able to vote'\n\nThe Nora Commons on the Monon had a decent showing in the morning, with about 140 voters showing up before 10 a.m.\n\nSherman Bankhead, 67, of Indianapolis, said he almost missed out on voting because he thought he’d have a mail-in ballot to send off but at the last minute realized he needed to head out to the polls. He votes regularly and said it’s a duty.\n\n“My ancestors fought and died for me to be able to vote,” Bankhead said. “I’m just afraid that if my party don’t maintain power, we’re going to be up the creek without a paddle. As an adult, you know right from wrong and know when someone is lying. There’s so much lying going on now that it’ll almost drive you insane.”\n\nBankhead said there used to be a time when he didn’t care whether a candidate was Republican or Democrat, as long as they were going to work for the people.\n\n“That’s all that matters and I miss those days,” Bankhead said.\n\nTony Driver, 63 of Indianapolis, also said he typically votes even in midterms. He said he’s particularly interested in the senate race this year and that he’s not a fan of Todd Young.\n\n“I don’t see him doing anything for Indiana or the lower and middle class,” Driver said.\n\nAt St. Luke’s on West 86th Street, there were minor delays late morning that cleared up pretty quickly.\n\nJustin Bromley, 35, of Indianapolis, said he does not typically vote in midterm elections but that this year was different.\n\n“It just felt like democracy is at stake,” he said. “I feel like the Republican side is fighting results and it’s very ugly, so I wanted to get out and vote.”\n\nLarry Eglen, 83, and Carol Eglen, 82, both of Indianapolis, were at St. Luke’s late morning to cast full Republican ballots.\n\nLarry said he doesn’t trust the Democrats and wanted to cast a straight Republican ticket, something that isn’t typical for him.\n\n“When you’ve lost as much as we have in our IRAs and savings, I just don’t trust (President) Biden,” Larry said.\n\nThe couple voted Republican because “woke and indoctrinated is a terrible thing,” Carol said.\n\n— Karl Schneider\n\n11:45 a.m. — Making a (fashion) statement\n\n11:45 a.m. — Northside Indianapolis voters say 2022 midterm brings high stakes\n\nMany voters said that they saw these midterm elections as being unusually critical for a non-presidential contest as the nation stands on the brink of heading in one of two directions.\n\nNothing less than the “future of the country” is at stake with this year’s elections, said John Bartholomew, 66. Bartholomew declined to give specifics on how he voted, although he said he did mix up the ballot, as he typically does.\n\n“I’d like to see common sense and sanity come back in government,” Bartholomew said outside of College Park Elementary. “I want it to be the country I grew up in… Just put it back on track, I just don’t like the way it’s going.”\n\nMidterms typically do not draw William Hazelwood, 60, out to vote, he said.\n\nBut as he exited a polling place at a Ditch Road fire station just south of 86th St., Hazelwood said that this year he felt it imperative to vote in light of what happened in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021 and the ensuing hearings.\n\n“I don’t mind public discourse, but when it becomes weaponized, I have a problem with that,” said Hazelwood, who voted a Democratic ticket. “Normally I split my vote, but I couldn’t do it this time.”\n\nLuis Figueroa, 31, agreed that claims of election fraud on the behalf of Republicans propelled him to the polls for this midterm election. In addition, he said, he would like to see Roe v. Wade codified and cannabis made legal in Indiana, just as other neighboring states have done.\n\nThe response to past elections, however, was top of his mind, he said outside the fire station.\n\n“We get a lot of people that don’t want to admit the election was not stolen, which it was not,” he said.\n\nHowever, on Marion County's northwest side, many voters Tuesday morning mentioned how streamlined and easy casting a ballot was.\n\nSome noted with approval the fact that even though one votes electronically, voters then get a printed ballot, which they deposit into a ballot box, allowing for physical recounts should that be necessary.\n\n“I think it was the best set up I’ve seen it,” said Larry Bradshaw, 75, who said he voted the straight Republican party ticket at College Park Elementary.\n\nIn addition to voting for those who, like her, support abortion rights, Hannah Wiese, 30, said she hopes that many others in the state come out Tuesday.\n\n“I want to put my voice forward,” said Wiese as she exited the voting booth at College Park Elementary. “It’s really important for us to represent Indiana.”\n\nA native of Boston and recent Butler graduate, Colin Dennis, 22, now considers Indiana his home. He knows he may lean a little more left than the typical Indiana resident and he said he hopes to bring some of those Massachusetts values here. For instance, he said, he’s particularly concerned about affordable healthcare and which candidates support measures that ensure access to care.\n\n“I’m just trying to get some of those beliefs in Indiana on the local level,” he said.\n\nFor Brentton Campbell, 22, voting was critical enough for the DePauw senior to make the hour-long drive from Greencastle to a northwest side polling place off 86th Street. The son of two public school teachers, Campbell said he views voting as a civic duty, much like paying taxes.\n\nWhile he said he split his vote, he allowed that he did lean liberal, adding that one issue that’s important for him as a college student facing down graduation is finding ways to reduce college debt.\n\nWith ballots cast, voters headed back to work, home, to meet friends for life and go about their day. Tonight they will hear whether their preference carried the majority.\n\nSaid Bartholomew: “I vote and hope.”\n\n— Shari Rudavsky\n\n11:45 a.m. — Voting updates from Johnson, Hancock and Boone Counties\n\nVoting was going smoothly outside of Marion County, minus some long lines at Hancock County polling places, election administrator Robin Spille told IndyStar, with \"just a lot of people showing up to vote.\"\n\nIn Hancock County, 4,115 people had turned out to vote just after 11 a.m.\n\nIn Boone County, Zionsville also had some long lines, though no longer than 30 minutes, Boone County Clerk Jessica Fouts told IndyStar. As of just before 11 a.m., 4,831 people had voted Tuesday in Boone County.\n\nTrena McLaughlin, Johnson County Clerk, said \"we have been very busy, but everything is going well.\" As of around 11:45 a.m. 11,425 people had voted Tuesday.\n\n— Claire Rafford\n\n11:45 a.m. — Election Day food options\n\nDreaming of election night pizza (except the morning shift reporters, sadly.)\n\n11 a.m. — Crime reduction on minds of some south-side voters\n\nCrime, border security and inflation were top-of-mind issues for several south-side voters and those supporting Republican candidates on Tuesday.\n\nSteve Breedlove, 70, said he’s keeping track of key races across the nation. He said his midterm vote at Perry Township Education Center was a way to stall Democratic-led decisions in Washington that he disagrees with.\n\n“I realize you’ve got to have a balance of government; you’ve got to have Republicans and you’ve got to have Democrats,” Breedlove said. “But we’ve been at two years of just all Democratic rule, and look where it’s got us in the last 21 months.”\n\nOutside the doors, Derek Cahill, the president of the Perry Township GOP Club, said the Marion County prosecutor’s race was the most important for Republicans because he’s heard people express worries about Indianapolis’ crime rate.\n\n“Paul Annee is on City-County Council and he’s pretty famous for saying, ‘You can’t be a suburb of nothing,’ and so it does affect everyone,” said Cahill, 44.\n\nJim Wheeler of Homecroft, 62, said politicians aren’t taking care of the economy, and he’d like to see that change. But above and beyond the issues, he and his wife, Brenda Wheeler, 68, said they vote because it’s Election Day and that’s their duty. Brenda is a nurse who moved from the Philippines to the U.S. because of what the country offers.\n\n“It was the land of opportunity,” she said. “It’s an old, old statement or whatever, but it is the truth.”\n\nRem Sanga, a 19-year-old student at Indiana University, left Bloomington at 5 a.m. to support a school board candidate outside Perry Township Education Center. He held a sign for Hre Mang, who’s running for Perry Township School Board.\n\nSanga, who graduated from Greenwood Community High School, and Mang are part of the Chin community, an ethnic group from Myanmar, on the south side.\n\n“Since we came from a dictatorship country, I would say our parents’ generation didn’t really get into politics because there wasn’t really much democracy and politics to get into. So I think it is groundbreaking that Hre Mang is actually running for office and if he wins, he will be a trailblazer,” Sanga said.\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\n9:50 a.m. — Smooth sailing in Marion County\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, around 45,000 voters had turned out in Marion County, Brienne Delaney, director of elections for the Marion County Election Board, told IndyStar.\n\n“We have a steady turnout and voting is smooth,\" Delaney said.\n\n— Claire Rafford\n\n9:00 a.m. — School board races on the minds of Broad Ripple voters\n\nA line of people stretched outside Northminster Presbyterian Church in Broad Ripple as the polls opened at 6 a.m.\n\nKen and Jennifer Roth, both 52, of Indianapolis, were bundled up waiting in line. While no single race brought them out to vote today, Ken said he thinks it’s been kind of a turbulent time in the country.\n\n“I think both parties are pretty polarized, so just want to get out and express our views and make sure they’re reflected,” he said.\n\nJennifer said she knows how things are going with Indianapolis Public Schools. “I just want to be supportive of IPS,” she said.\n\nMore:Here's who is running for school board elections in Marion County\n\nJames Ringer, 30, of Indianapolis, also didn’t have a particular race that brought him to the polls, but he said he’s never missed an election.\n\nPaige Mundy, 29, of Broad Ripple, was at Broad Ripple High School early this morning to cast her first ballot in Indiana. Originally from Pennsylvania, Mundy said she always votes even during midterms.\n\nJoe Smiddie-Brush, 59, of Broad Ripple, spent time researching the ballot before coming out to the polls. He said he’s interested in the school board races this year.\n\n“I’m trying to be an informed person when coming in, and it’s a civic responsibility,” he said. “I wish everyone would (vote), all of my friends even the ones who say they’re voting exactly opposite the way I do.”\n\nAt First Friends Meeting on Kessler, voters quickly moved in and out of the ballot boxes.\n\nBryden Basaran, 32, of Indianapolis, said it was the events of Jan. 6, 2021, that motivated him to get out and vote. It was his first time voting in a midterm election.\n\nBasaran said he voted for a blue ticket event though it wasn’t his preference.\n\n“It’s hard to subvert an election if you don’t have people in the right positions in power to do so,\" he said. \"I’m voting straight ticket until either the Republican Party improves itself or stops being relevant.”\n\nLindsay Hadley, 44, of Broad Ripple, said she normally comes out to vote for midterms.\n\n“My son is 7 and he goes to Washington Township school(s), so I’m voting for the school board member,” Hadley said.\n\nHadley’s son, who usually comes along to the polls, grew up with the son of Prosecutor Ryan Mears, a Democrat incumbent, and Hadley said he was concerned about all the negative ads he saw.\n\n“He’d ask: ‘Why are they saying these things?’” Hadley said. “Like I know, if they could just say nice things.”\n\n— Karl Schneider\n\n8:45 a.m. — Abortion driving Fishers voters to the polls\n\nAimee Bruno, 52, of Fishers, said she votes straight-party Democrat. While she was voting, she said protecting reproductive rights was on her mind.\n\nBruno, who voted before work at 7:30 a.m., said she has children and nieces, which makes abortion a particularly important issue to her.\n\n“It’s the most important thing to me right now,” she said.\n\nShortly after, Tim Jones, 51, of Fishers, exited the polling location at Alhuda Foundation. Jones, who has been a Republican for 15 years, said he voted more Democrat than Republican this year.\n\nAbortion was the big-ticket issue for him this year as well.\n\n“I have five daughters,” he said. “I just can’t imagine someone telling them what to do with their body.”\n\nThough Jones doesn’t support abortion, he believes it’s a conversation that should be had between a woman and their doctor, he said. He tells his daughters that if they get pregnant, it's ultimately their choice whether to have an abortion or not, he said.\n\nAnother thing that has frustrated him about the Republican Party is their rhetoric, he said, citing the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and the comments Republican lawmakers have made about Paul Pelosi, the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was recently attacked inside the couple's California home.\n\n“I'm just tired of all the rhetoric, of all the back and forth,” he said.\n\n— Phyllis Cha\n\n8:45 a.m. — 'I would like a better country'\n\nAt the Kennedy King Park Center, 30-year-old Lauren Dzikowski had a simple reason for voting: \"I would like a better country.\"\n\n\"I feel like we're all disconnected,\" said Dzikowski, who lives in the Herron Morton neighborhood. \"It would be nice if we're one whole country again.\"\n\nSeth Lucas-Falk, who is married to Dzikowski, also noted he does not feel entitled to complain about the country if he doesn't participate in the voting process.\n\nThe Igleharts also voted as a family. For Kent Iglehart, 33, he went \"candidate by candidate\" in deciding who to vote for.\n\n\"I probably split my vote in ways that I haven't in the past,\" he said.\n\nKati Townsley, 37, said it was her civic duty to vote. She's also paying close attention to U.S. Senate races in other parts of the country, particularly Georgia and Pennsylvania.\n\n\"I know the midterms are so important,\" said Townsley, who lives in the Kennedy King neighborhood.\n\nCharlene Wilder, 52, said she wanted to ensure her vote is counted.\n\nThe Center Township resident said she always votes straight ticket for the Democratic party.\n\n\"It's our right so I want to make sure I get out and vote,\" Wilder said.\n\n— Ryan Martin\n\n8:45 a.m. — Yes, you can buy alcohol on Election Day in Indiana\n\nOkay, yes, but why do you want to know?\n\nThe 2012 election marked the first time Hoosiers 21 and older could buy alcohol on Election Day. Indiana was one of the last states to lift the Election Day alcohol ban.\n\n— Claire Rafford\n\n8:45 a.m. — What's open and closed on Election Day?\n\nElection Day is a holiday in the state of Indiana, meaning most local and state offices are closed. All staffed Indy Parks facilities with staff are closed, though the 11 park centers that are voting locations will remain open for voting only.\n\nHowever, Election Day is not a federal holiday, so banks remain open; and the U.S. Postal Service will continue to deliver mail.\n\nSome Indianapolis-area students may get a day off, too. Washington Township schools, for example, are having an e-learning day, and Wayne Township schools are closed for a staff development day. Many schools are also polling locations.\n\nIndiana does not have a law specifying that employers must give employees time off to vote.\n\n— Claire Rafford\n\n7:10 a.m. — Presidential Site inspires voters to exercise civic right\n\nAfter casting his ballot inside the Benjamin Harrison Presidential Site, 26-year-old Patrick O'Neill said it's important for voters to brush away apathy. Social media, he said, has shaped peoples' feelings as if no one has their interests in mind.\n\n\"This year more than ever citizens need to be participating in the process,\" said O'Neill, who lives downtown, \"no matter which side you're on.\"\n\nHe described education as one reason he voted.\n\n\"I hope kids have access to education,\" he said.\n\n\"Reproductive rights and climate change\" are what brought 34-year-old Elise Bowling out to vote.\n\n\"I'm a woman,\" said the downtown resident. \"This is very important.\"\n\nFor Kenneth Hall, a 62-year-old downtown resident, it was the Indiana Secretary of State race because the position governs elections. The roles have become key across the country, Hall said, in ensuring elections are protected.\n\n\"This building and renovation is a picture of that democracy,\" Hall said, nodding back to the presidential site. \"How we preserve our history and celebrate our future.\"\n\n— Ryan Martin\n\n6:55 a.m. — Ride to the polls for free\n\nIndyGo is waiving fares today until 10 p.m., so Hoosiers can take the bus to the polls for free.\n\nYou can find a bus schedule here: indygo.net/routes. Map out your route to your destination here: indygo.net/plan-your-trip.\n\n6 a.m. — Races to watch in Indiana\n\nAs Hoosiers head to the polls, abortion and inflation, two of the most prominent issues of the last few months, are likely on their minds.\n\nSome notable races on the ballot include U.S. Senate race, with Sen. Todd Young running for reelection against Hammond Mayor Tom McDermott, a Democrat. Indiana’s 1st District race between incumbent Democrat Rep. Frank Mrvan and Republican challenger Jennifer-Ruth Green has been classified as a toss-up.\n\nStatewide, Indiana Secretary of State’s race has drawn attention as Republican candidate Diego Morales, running against Democrat Destiny Wells, has drawn disrepute for exaggerating his military service, allegedly sexually assaulting two women and possibly voting illegally, in a different county than the one his permanent address is in.\n\nBoth the Marion and Hamilton County prosecutor's races have been heavily followed, well funded and had big-name endorsements. Democrat incumbent prosecutor Ryan Mears faces Republican challenger Cyndi Carrasco in Marion County; and in Hamilton County, Democrat Jessica Paxson is up against Republican Greg Garrison, a former longtime conservative radio show host.\n\nHere are all the races IndyStar’s been covering and watching: bit.ly/3UlL3rY.\n\nIndiana weather: Sun will be shining on Election Day\n\nAccording to NWS Indianapolis meteorologist Jason Puma, Tuesday will be “a fantastic fall day.”\n\nThe forecast is sunny, with high temperatures around 60 degrees, Puma said.\n\nEarly voting turnout\n\nAs of Monday, 684,692 ballots had been cast in Indiana, including 515,761 cast in person and 157,280 by mail, according to data provided by the Indiana Secretary of State's office.\n\nAs of noon Monday, 49,499 people had voted early in Marion County, according to data provided by the Marion County Election Board.\n\nWho is on my ballot in Indiana?\n\nHoosiers can see the races and candidates appearing on their ballots by visiting indianavoters.in.gov and entering their registration information.\n\nThe Indiana Citizen has created a voter guide that will allow users to create a virtual ballot based on their registered address.

Her clarinet, in its carrying case by the bed. Her emerald Girl Scout sash, draped over the dresser mirror.\n\nUsually, though, the door to Cheri's room stays closed.\n\n“I just can’t get rid of any of it,” Jean said, standing in Cheri’s room on a January afternoon in their home on Binghamton's North Side. “It would be like throwing a part of her away.”\n\nIt's been 34 years since a man who lived just seven blocks away brutally murdered Cheri Lindsey as she collected money on her newspaper delivery route.\n\nShe would have turned 46 last year.\n\nInstead, Cheri's room is a sort of memorial for her parents Jean and David Lindsey, a frozen tableau of their seventh-grade daughter with perfect attendance at East Middle School, who loved music as much as sports, who instinctively thought of others.\n\nNone of Cheri's belongings has ever left the Lindseys’ home. But over the decades, her legacy has manifested in the community where she lived and in the lives of those who knew her, mourned her, and sought justice for her death.\n\nCheri wanted to throw her teacher a baby shower.\n\nTo raise the money, she took a newspaper route. On March 26, 1984, she visited the house of James Wales, who owed delivery money. He raped her, killed her and hid her body in his cellar.\n\nWales, now 69, is serving a 33-years-to-life prison sentence for Cheri’s murder. He is incarcerated at the maximum-security Elmira Correctional Facility in Chemung County.\n\nMore:'I explode': Cheri Lindsey's killer was denied parole in 2017\n\nA New York State Parole Board denied Wales' release on April 12, 2017 — his first opportunity to get out of prison since being locked away in 1984 — ensuring he will be imprisoned for at least two more years, until 2019, when he will have a new chance to lobby for his freedom.\n\nMeanwhile, David and Jean Lindsey have dedicated themselves to preserving their daughter's memory. To coincide with Cheri's birthday each June, the Lindseys coordinate a raffle to support community causes, including Toys for Tots, the Humane Society, youth sports and local schools.\n\nThen there's the park.\n\nCheri's face — dark hair and eyes, a spirited grin — adorns a mural at the memorial park on Truesdell Street on Binghamton's North Side that has carried her name since 1984. There's a swimming pool, ball field, skateboard park, dog park, and now the mural, which is visible to motorists traveling around Prospect Mountain across the Chenango River.\n\nDavid Lindsey, now 76, isn't shy when speaking about Cheri — she's become a bittersweet memory that he and Jean, 68, and their two other children, adults Shelley and Dave, have shared among themselves and with strangers.\n\nBut when asked why this family never wants the community to forget Cheri, David's voice shifts. He sounds like a father who has spent decades grieving the loss of his little girl, a father who also spent 20 years as a Binghamton police officer.\n\n\"We want something to remember her by,\" he says simply. \"We need something to carry her name on.\"\n\nFor about two years, James Wales delivered copies of the Evening Press around the North Side of Binghamton from his home on Sturges Street, which he shared with his then wife.\n\nIn January 1984, Cheri took over the route.\n\nShe tackled the after-school job with dedication, as one Sturges Street resident could attest in March of that year: \"You can set your clock by the time she left the paper,\" the resident told an Evening Press reporter March 27, 1984, while police were still searching for Cheri.\n\nJean usually accompanied her daughter on the newspaper route each afternoon. On this particular afternoon — March 26, 1984 — Jean stayed home to cook dinner.\n\nThis time, Cheri went alone.\n\nAround 4:30 p.m., a friend of Cheri's called the house, expecting her to be back from her deliveries.\n\nDavid Lindsey, a sergeant in the Binghamton Police Department's special investigations unit, was working an evening shift downtown.\n\nHe took a call from his wife, who sounded worried: \"Cheri's not home yet.\"\n\nThat was strange for Cheri, but David didn't panic at first. He dialed a few neighbors and friends, thinking maybe she stopped by. Nobody had seen her.\n\nA Binghamton police lieutenant drove David around the neighborhood, hoping they might catch sight of her. Maybe she was just running late.\n\nMinutes turned to hours.\n\nPolice officers in Binghamton were deployed around the neighborhood. Then Broome County Sheriff's deputies and New York State Police were called in.\n\nSeveral traffic stops were conducted at a roadblock on the North Side, and passing drivers were asked whether they had seen Cheri. A police search helicopter hovered overhead. Trained police dogs sniffed through the neighborhood.\n\nAnd volunteers combed the area for clues.\n\nThe Lindseys are the kind of couple who have honed the skill of filling the blanks for each other when they reminisce. They're comfortable in their home of 47 years.\n\nDavid stays busy browsing Facebook and the web in the living room on his laptop. Jean tracks their medical appointments and get-togethers with friends or family using a pocket calendar book — the days tend to fill quickly.\n\nSeated in their dining room on a late afternoon in January, as an episode of Law & Order played on a small TV behind them near the kitchen, the Lindseys couldn't recall just how many people were part of the search efforts when Cheri went missing.\n\nAfter three decades, not every detail is as sharp as it once was.\n\nMemories of Cheri revolve around her passion for sports — she was a catcher for her youth softball team — and favorite hobby: latch hooking, making decorative pillows. And they remember clearly her dedication to working bingo games on the East Side's American Legion, sticking to her station at the soda fountain and helping clean up after.\n\nThe night Cheri disappeared, neither parent slept.\n\nThough there was much speculation as to her whereabouts, even then the Lindseys had a strong suspicion about the man who once held Cheri's delivery route.\n\nJean remembers telling her husband and the police, \"If you're going to find her, she's going to be at Wales' house.\"\n\nThe Lindseys couldn't exactly put their finger on it at the time, but something never seemed right about Wales.\n\nNot only was he one of the customers who hadn't yet paid her for the week's deliveries, but, Jean recalls thinking, \"He looked at her weird.\"\n\nSometimes when Cheri knocked on Wales' door, his stepson was home and she could see him from the doorway. He and Cheri went to the same school, Jean recalled, and it was only when Cheri could see him at the house that she really felt \"safe.\"\n\nJames Wales had kept a relatively low profile.\n\nHis run-ins with the law were sparse: There was a bad check in Norwich in 1972, arrests in Binghamton on suspicion of drunk driving in 1978 and criminal trespass in 1980.\n\nSo in the hours detectives toiled to come up with a prime suspect in Cheri Lindsey's disappearance, the 35-year-old father of two living on Sturges Street was not on the list. At first.\n\n\"Wales wasn't on our radar,\" recalled John Butler, Vestal's police chief, who was a Binghamton detective sergeant in 1984. \"His name didn't jump out.\"\n\nButler's gruff, plainspoken voice carries a confidence earned through 30-plus years of experience as a law enforcement official, but his words convey sincere empathy. He's seen more than his share of violent crime scenes, but he's spent countless moments talking to victims' families.\n\nEveryone could agree Cheri most likely disappeared at some point along her paper route. But there wasn't much else to go on, Butler recalled during a March 8 interview at the Vestal Police Department office.\n\nFellow detective Barry Angel had spoken to Wales at his residence early on, simply as a person who might have recently been in contact with her.\n\nAs the trail grew cold, Butler recalled thinking, \"Is there anything we missed?\"\n\nAngel had a gut feeling, something about Wales' behavior had seemed \"strange.\" He suggested they bring Wales in for questioning.\n\nWales voluntarily accompanied police to give a statement, delivered in a small interview room at the police department's detective bureau: bare walls, a table and three chairs.\n\nButler and Angel asked the questions. Wales was calm, cooperative.\n\nFrom experience, Butler said, suspects behave differently during questioning. Sometimes, they can be combative. Others can be nervous. Being cooperative is also not uncommon.\n\nInitially, Wales didn't admit to anything.\n\nThen, an hour and a half into questioning, they had their suspect.\n\nWales confessed, and as Butler recalls, it wasn't an \"overly emotional\" one.\n\n\"He was cooperating with us,\" Butler said. \"I don't recall him crying or anything like that, but I do recall him telling us specifically what he did in that house.\"\n\nMeanwhile, at Wales' home, where he'd consented to a search, officers made the discovery: Cheri's body was in the cellar.\n\nButler had not yet learned of the discovery while questioning Wales. And, as a detective sergeant in 1984 — Butler's police career would take him from sergeant to lieutenant and captain of the detective bureau, to Binghamton police chief from 2003 to 2006, then to Vestal — questioning the possible suspect in the murder of a colleague's daughter, it was even more important to stay focused on the job.\n\n\"It was a terrible day for the Lindsey family,\" Butler said. \"But you have to detach yourself from any personal relationship with the victim and the family. We went in there to get a statement from Wales.\"\n\nThe detectives had a hunch, he said, and it paid off.\n\nA jury would hear the details of the crime months later when Wales stood trial in Broome County Court, but David Lindsey said he's never bothered to read Wales' confession. He doesn't want to.\n\nThree months after Cheri's murder, in June 1984, the crowd at the 15-year-old Stow Park on Binghamton's North Side listened to a few short speeches of praise.\n\nCity Council, working with the North Side Booster Club, renamed the park after Cheri Lindsey — the measure had passed April 2, 1984, by a unanimous vote among Binghamton's council-members.\n\nDavid and Jean Lindsey received a commemorative plaque from then-Mayor Juanita Crabb, who described the park as a symbol of the community's love and companionship felt for Cheri's family.\n\n\"I think Cheri would have liked it,\" Crabb said on that cloudless summer day at the dedication ceremony. \"Enjoy the park.\"\n\nAs well-wishers greeted the Lindseys after the park's dedication, David said, \"We appreciate it.\"\n\nThey still visit occasionally — it's less than a mile down the street from their house — and think of it as a special place. During the summers, they catch youth baseball or softball games.\n\nIn this way, Cheri's name, and her memory, persist, even for people who never knew her, even for children born long after she was killed.\n\nBut for the Lindseys, the mission didn't end there.\n\nOne year after Cheri's death, to coincide with her birthday in June 1985, her parents conceived a plan to make a gift the community could share. They enlisted the help of volunteers, including friends, who have pitched in and changed ranks over the years.\n\nAmong those volunteers, one who still pitches in after so many years, is Nancy Bell-Szwalla.\n\nA longtime resident of Binghamton's South Side, she's counted the Lindseys among her \"North Side friends\" — there were many a pizza night. The mother of a now-grown son, a daughter and two stepsons, she thinks back and wonders, \"How could you not find a way to help out?\n\n\"You become so involved that it draws you in to ask, 'Could that have been my kid?' You couldn't stop feeling that way,\" Bell-Szwalla said. \"But the Lindseys have not only used the tragedy to memorialize Cheri, they used it to help a community.\"\n\nThe Cheri Lindsey Memorial Fund was established following her death, and raised money for lighting and bleachers for the Little League field at her namesake park.\n\nA scholarship fund was also raised for Binghamton high school students.\n\nBut perhaps the most long-lasting tradition has been the Lindseys' annual raffle fundraiser in June. The first year raised $10,000 and helped throw the neighborhood a party in the park.\n\nTo keep their endeavor manageable in recent years, the Lindseys have limited their fundraising to 250 raffle tickets.\n\nEvents large and small have been organized and for the raffles, Bell-Szwalla still pitches in to sell some tickets each year. About this band of volunteers, she says, \"It's a family, and nobody has ever abandoned one another.\"\n\nAnnual raffles and fundraising efforts over the years have helped the Lindseys make donations to Toys for Tots, the Humane Society and Binghamton schools — their efforts helped fund a rock wall and jungle gyms for Theodore Roosevelt Elementary School's playground — and they continue to look for different causes each year.\n\nThinking back, the couple described managing the different fundraisers as appearing relatively easy. Although there have been more than a few stressful phone calls along the way, they said, it's always worth the effort.\n\n\"All we've gotta hear is that somebody needs something, especially a kid, and they got it,\" David said. \"We make what we make and try to find a good place for the money.\"\n\nNearly nine months after Cheri's murder, in December 1984, Broome County Court Judge Robert Coutant pronounced Wales' fate: 33 years to life in prison.\n\nAt the time, the judge told Wales his crime had \"plunged a knife deep into the heart of this community.\"\n\nDavid and Jean Lindsey still bear that scar.\n\nCheri's easy to spot when you step in the front door of the Lindsey family home: A framed photo of her smiles from a memorial wall fixture.\n\nUpstairs, where Cheri's room was adjacent to her older sister's, the siblings would quibble over each other's territory and even mark it off with tape across the hallway carpet. There's still a message to Cheri's sister, Shelley, written on the door in chalk: \"Shelley, stay out of my room.\"\n\nJean recounts that story, plus a few more. Then she pulls the creaky wooden door of Cheri's bedroom closed, preserving once more the space where her daughter slept, all those years ago.\n\nDavid and Jean have another tradition, too: They publish a memorial obituary each anniversary of Cheri's death, remembering how \"that little crooked smile is something that will be with us all the while,\" and all the other accomplishments of her short life.\n\nThose who see the memorial park mural on Binghamton's North Side can see that smile themselves. David and Jean Lindsey say they're satisfied the park that bears their daughter's name continues to bring joy to others.\n\nIt can't bring Cheri back. But it matters.\n\nHands folded on his dining room table, David pauses, looks up.\n\n\"I don't think the community forgot her.\"\n\nOn Twitter: @PSBABorrelli\n\nMore:VANISHED: What really happened to Bambi Madden?\n\nMore:Haley Anderson, slain Binghamton U. nursing student, remembered as 'a beacon of joy'\n\nMore:Hunters.

Police already are “depleted and exhausted,” and leaders don’t want to add to restrictions that already include early closing times and crowd limits at nightspots, Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox said. But the sight of crowds like those that gathered near campus in an area called The Strip are disheartening after officials spent weeks pleading with people to take steps that will slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, Maddox said. Maddox’s comments came after University of Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne tweeted a photo that showed dozens of people, many not wearing face masks or staying away from others, waiting to get into a popular bar in Tuscaloosa on the day sororities accepted new members. “Who wants college sports this fall?? Obviously not these people!! We’ve got to do better than this for each other and our campus community. Please wear your masks!” Byrne said in a tweet Sunday. Tuscaloosa police officers issued 12 citations for mask violations and arrested four people, but the problem wasn’t just at the University of Alabama: Photos on social media also showed large crowds and relatively few masks around Auburn University over the weekend.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Travel on an Alaska ferry was temporarily suspended after the vessel transported passengers who tested positive for COVID-19, officials said. The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities announced sailings by the M/V Matanuska are suspended until Monday, The Juneau Empire reported. The transportation department said in a statement that five passengers who traveled aboard the Matanuska last week tested positive for the virus. The ferry’s crew was required to receive negative test results before the ship resumes service, the department said. On Monday, the department said tests on all 47 crew members returned negative. Passengers who had tickets for the canceled sailings this week were being notified and either rescheduled or refunded, the department said. The passengers are believed to have been infectious while traveling on the Matanuska, which embarked from Kake, traveled through Sitka and arrived in Juneau on Aug. 10. While the ship was in transit, the crew learned some passengers had been in close contact with an individual in Kake who had tested positive, the department said. The passengers were quarantined in their cabins and provided room service until arriving in Juneau, in accordance with protocols, the department said. The passengers informed the department they had tested positive and the department informed other passengers and the public out of an abundance of caution. State health officials recommended recent travelers on the Matanuska self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 and take extra precautions.\n\nArizona\n\nWindow Rock: The Navajo Nation has lifted its stay-at-home order but is encouraging residents to leave their homes only for emergencies or essential activities. The stay-at-home order was rescinded Sunday, when 24 additional coronavirus cases and zero deaths were reported. Tribal officials on Monday reported 12 new COVID-19 cases but zero deaths again. The numbers are a vast change from earlier this year, when the tribe had one of the highest per-capita rates of infection in the U.S. The tribe’s executive branch released its reopening plan last week. Although some tourist destinations partially overseen by the federal government reopened Monday, tribal officials discouraged visitors from off the reservation. The National Park Service said it is working within the tribe’s guidelines but could not police who visits Canyon de Chelly National Monument in Chinle, Navajo National Monument near Shonto and Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site in Ganado. Limited services such as restrooms, self-guided trails and overlooks were open. Tribal parks such as Monument Valley and the Four Corners Monument were not open, Navajo President Jonathan Nez said Monday. Representatives for Nez didn’t respond to requests for further comment.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Dr. Deborah Birx, President Donald Trump’s top coronavirus adviser, said friends and families holding parties are driving the virus’s spread in the community, issuing the warning as outbreaks at some colleges across the country are being tied to large gatherings. Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, urged people to wear masks and socially distance after visiting with Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and state health officials, pointing to the gatherings as a particular concern. Arkansas’ Health Department on Monday reported 412 new virus cases and four more deaths from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Hutchinson said ensuring college students in Arkansas don’t have large parties like the ones Birx warned of is a challenge. “This is where the universities need to educate and they also need to have a plan whenever a student doesn’t behave properly or carefully,” Hutchinson said. Arkansas’ K-12 public schools are set to resume classes next week. Although schools are allowed to offer virtual classes or a hybrid option that includes some onsite classes, the state is requiring schools to be open five days a week for students who need in-person instruction. Birx stopped short of weighing in on that approach, but said offering the students the option of virtual learning decreases the number of students in the classroom.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The Los Angeles Unified School District will launch an aggressive coronavirus testing and contact tracing program for all students, staff and their families as part of a broad plan to safely reopen campuses. No date has been set for reopening schools in the nation’s second-largest district. The academic year formally begins this week with distance learning. The spread of COVID-19 in the Los Angeles area still exceeds state guidelines governing the possible return of students to campuses. The testing and tracing plan announced Sunday will provide data that can be used as a guide for renewing school operations, Superintendent Austin Beutner wrote in an opinion article for the Los Angeles Times. Tests will first be given to staff working at schools, as well as to any of their children participating in child care provided for Los Angeles Unified employees. Testing will also be provided to family members of students and staff who test positive for the coronavirus and family members who show symptoms. In the event of a positive test, contact can be made with others in the school community to quickly isolate the virus, Beutner wrote.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:The beginning of Colorado State University’s move-in week is far different this year. Students are being tested for COVID-19 and required to wear masks or other facial coverings inside – outside, too, if social distancing can’t be maintained. And instead of having as many as 4,000 students moving in on a single day during the usual two-day window, they’re arriving and moving belongings into their rooms in small groups at preassigned times throughout the week. “It’s definitely going to be different,” said Martika Hererra, a freshman from Artesia, New Mexico. “It’s just a new way of life, because we all have to wear masks and do different things. There are different regulations and laws. It’s not our usual way of life and doing things.” Hererra and her parents, Rachel and Ben, had no reservations, though, about moving her into Piñon Hall during her assigned time Monday. “I’m more excited than anything,” Martika said. Students began the move-in process Monday, with even the largest residence halls – 12-story Westfall and Durward – limiting access to 15 students per hour and limiting each student to a maximum of two helpers. Move-in times begin at 8 a.m. and end at 9 p.m. daily through Friday, said Tonie Miyamoto, the director of communications and sustainability for CSU’s housing and dining services. Residence hall capacity has been reduced for the semester from 6,300 beds to about 5,600, Miyamoto said, to allow for more social distancing in community areas and to set aside living spaces with separate entrances for any students who might need to be quarantined because of a positive COVID-19 test or close contact with someone who tests positive.\n\nConnecticut\n\nUncasville: The Mohegan Sun casino said it will lay off an unspecified number of employees because of impacts from the coronavirus pandemic. The southeastern Connecticut casino on sovereign tribal land opened June 1 despite opposition from Gov. Ned Lamont over the potential danger of spreading the virus in large group settings. About 3,000 of roughly 5,000 workers returned to work at that time. The company said it is ending its furlough program on Sept. 30. Mohegan Sun President & General Manager Jeff Hamilton said the move will reduce their workforce among employees who have not been called back to work before the end of September.“This difficult decision came after careful consideration and was driven by the unprecedented circumstances created by the pandemic, including reduced capacity and the inability to open all of the property amenities,” Hamilton said in a prepared statement reported by NBC Connecticut.The company said it was working with employees to find new positions.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: State health officials said that coronavirus-related hospitalizations have fallen to below 30 for the first time. The Delaware State News reported Monday that there were 29 hospitalizations. The numbers come from the Delaware Division of Public Health. Seven of the hospitalizations are considered critical. Delaware has recorded more than 16,000 positive COVID-19 cases. New Castle County has seen the most. It has 7,580 cases. Sussex County has recorded 6,197, Kent County has had 2,496. There are 263 cases where the county is not yet known.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Mayor Muriel Bowser said the District will expand its number of contact tracers by 175, bringing the total to 450, WUSA-TV reported. D.C. health officials said contact tracers will begin conducting home visits starting on Thursday for cases in which individuals were reached but did not complete an interview, or were unable to be reached. The home visits will allow investigators to assess the need for additional social services.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The state reported its lowest number of new coronavirus cases since mid-June on Monday as the number of people hospitalized continued to fall. The state reported 2,678 new confirmed cases, a level the state hasn’t seen since June 17 just as Florida began a monthlong surge of new infections that peaked at 15,300 on July 12. The seven-day average for new cases is now about 3,600, down from 11,000 a month ago. Also, the number of people being treated in Florida hospitals for COVID-19 has been declining since highs above 9,500 on July 23. The number of patients in the late morning Monday stood at 5,657, according to a total posted online by the state. The state reported 87 deaths Monday, bringing the total since the outbreak was first reported in Florida on March 1 to at least 9,674. Mondays are typically low numbers for deaths as some hospitals don’t report over the weekend.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A longtime county commissioner in Georgia died Monday after more than two weeks in the hospital fighting the coronavirus. Chatham County Commissioner James Holmes of Savannah was 82. His wife, Yvonne, confirmed his death to news outlets. She said her husband had been hospitalized with COVID-19 since July 30. “This is something of a reminder, and I don’t think we need this occasion to remind folks of it, of how serious the coronavirus really is,” Al Scott, chairman of the Chatham County Commission, told reporters at a news conference. Holmes was a former high school basketball coach who had also worked as an assistant coach at Savannah State University. Scott said that Holmes planned to leave office at the end of the year after serving on the commission since 2005.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Anastasiya Kamaletdinova spent her first day of eighth grade at Kaimuki Middle School on Monday on a computer in her bedroom. “I was more shy than usual,” Kamaletdinova , 13, said. “Everything was great except for the last 20 minutes, I had problems with my computer and I couldn’t hear my teacher for some reason.” Like many public school students across Hawaii, she started the new academic year remotely as coronavirus cases are surging on Oahu, where Honolulu is located. The statewide teachers union led an effort to delay the first day for students by two weeks. At the union’s urging, the Hawaii Department of Education announced most schools would start the first four weeks online. The union is still concerned there are students on campuses this week. Education officials said some students will be on campuses for things such as picking up learning materials and learning how to use technology for remote instruction. This week, Aikahi Elementary on Oahu’s windward side is welcoming small groups of students for a few hours each day for orientation, training on distance learning systems and connecting with teachers and friends, said Principal Keoki Fraser. The union warned some teachers would be using personal or sick leave to avoid jeopardizing health and safety. Fraser said all his teachers were present Monday.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A school district in southwestern Idaho has announced plans to reopen during the coronavirus pandemic despite recommendations against doing so from local health officials. The New Plymouth School District Board voted 4-1 on Aug. 10 to reopen classrooms five days a week to about 1,000 students starting Aug. 24, the Idaho Statesman reported Monday. However, Southwest District Health reported that Payette County has the highest level of community spread, which comes with a recommendation to close school buildings. New Plymouth is located in Payette County, about 50 miles northwest of Boise. Board Chairman Marc Haws scrutinized the community’s latest COVID-19 data, reviewed a parent survey and weighed the risk of the coronavirus against the impact of more lost time in the classroom and did not find a compelling reason to keep the schools closed. Haws said the district considered recommendations from the local health department but argued that the school board has the ultimate responsibility to open or close the schools. New Plymouth Superintendent David Sotutu said everyone at the schools will be required to wear facial coverings and practice social distancing. Sotutu also said masks will be offered, sanitation procedures will be increased and students will have the option to learn solely online.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: State public health officials on Monday launched a COVID-19 hot spot map for travelers to assess their risk before leaving the state. The online map shows which U.S. states have an average daily case rate of at least 15 cases per 100,000 people, which is considered higher risk. “This virus does not recognize borders and specific regions and it doesn’t stop at the edge of a region or a county,” Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said at an East St. Louis news conference. “We know that people may have to travel, but potentially based on where you may go that travel may increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19.” She urged travelers to factor in details like how to safely manage airport terminals and rest areas.\n\nIndiana\n\nRockville: The Parke County Board of Commissioners voted to cancel this year’s Covered Bridge Festival because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The commissioners voted 2-0 on Monday, with one member abstaining to cancel the event that had been scheduled for Oct. 9-18, the Tribune-Star reported. Commissioner Bruce Hartman said he had spoken to many local health care and emergency management professionals recently and had “come to the conclusion there is a absolutely a risk to the people of Parke County.” Hartman said he had heard from residents on both sides of the issue but not one had presented a solid reason to hold the festival other than the income it generates. As one resident pointed out to him, Hartman said, “Money’s no good if you’re dead” from the coronavirus. The festival in years past has attracted as many as 1 million visitors to the rustic western Indiana county to enjoy its 31 covered bridges. Commissioner Jim Meece agreed with Hartman, saying there was no realistic way the county could enforce or hope to achieve anti-COVID measures recommended by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or Gov. Eric Holcomb and the State Department of Health.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A state agency said it is working to fix a data error on Iowa’s coronavirus website that lowers the number of new confirmed cases and therefore downplays the severity of the outbreak, just as schools are deciding whether to reopen. The glitch means the Iowa Department of Public Health has inadvertently been reporting fewer new infections and a smaller percentage of daily positive tests than is the case, according to Dana Jones, an Iowa City nurse practitioner who uncovered the problem. It’s particularly significant because school districts are relying on state data to determine whether they will offer in-person instruction when school resumes in the coming days and weeks. Potentially thousands of coronavirus infections from recent weeks and months have instead been erroneously recorded as having happened in March, April, May and June, Jones said Monday. The numbers are skewed because some people tested negative earlier but recently tested positive. Iowa’s system has been recording their new positive results as having happened when their original negative results were reported. “It’s one of the worst data errors that could be happening right now,” said Megan Srinivas, an infectious disease physician in Fort Dodge, Iowa. “We are making these policy calls based on completely flawed numbers and that needs to be acknowledged.” An Iowa Department of Public Health official confirmed the glitch in an email to Jones Friday. He said a system-generated date when test results are reported to the state stays the same when an individual later tests positive. But the state has yet to publicly announce the error. Amy McCoy, a spokeswoman for the public health department, told the Associated Press that she hoped to have more information about the issue soon.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly imposed a new ban on evictions and foreclosures on home mortgages in Kansas because one federal program to aid unemployed workers has expired and she isn’t sure that the state will participate in an alternative offered by President Donald Trump Kelly’s order prevents landlords and lenders from initiating efforts to remove people from their apartments or homes if they can’t pay their rent or make their mortgage payments because of financial problems resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Kelly’s executive order took effect Monday and is remains in effect until Sept. 15. The governor said she might extend the order longer if Congress does not approve another coronavirus relief package. She also said that she recognizes that her new order will burden landlords and home lenders, and her administration has started to look for ways to provide relief to them. A federal program providing an additional $600 a week to unemployed workers expired at the end of July. Trump issued an executive order earlier this month offering $300 a week in extra benefits, with an extra $100 available to jobless workers if states cover the cost. Kansas has yet to sign up for either version, and Kelly questioned whether Trump has the power to bypass Congress.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky should accept a supplemental $300 in federal weekly assistance for its unemployed workers under a White House offer that won’t require any extra spending by the state, Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell said in a letter to the state’s Democratic governor. McConnell, the Senate majority leader, noted in his Monday letter to Gov. Andy Beshear that some states – including some led by Democratic governors – have started accepting the assistance. McConnell added that “Kentucky must not be left behind.” “All you need to do is sign up,” McConnell, the chief congressional ally to President Donald Trump, said in his letter. Kentucky and other states were hit by surging unemployment during the coronavirus pandemic. The option recently provided by the White House involves less than the $600 a week in federal aid that unemployment recipients received until the assistance expired on Aug 1. Congress has been unable to agree on an extension amid an impasse on a new round of coronavirus aid. Trump issued a series of executive orders, including the lower supplemental unemployment payments, after negotiations broke down over the new relief bill. Another option for Kentucky and other states is to tap into federal aid already provided under the coronavirus rescue package to raise the extra weekly payment to $400 for unemployment claimants, McConnell said. McConnell was a chief architect of the massive relief provided under the measure. Kentucky recipients will still receive regular state unemployment benefits under the options. Beshear responded later Monday that his administration had reviewed the application and “put together a draft” but still needed “clarity” on some points in the program.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A federal judge in New Orleans refused to block a state order closing bars to stop the spread of COVID-19, handing a defeat to 10 southeast Louisiana bar owners who had sued to stop the closure. U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman said the closure order was legal under the broad powers a governor has under public health emergencies such as the pandemic. Feldman, a judge in the federal court system’s Eastern District of Louisiana, ruled even as a hearing in a similar suit played out in the Western District. Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, who issued the order last month, was testifying in that lawsuit Monday afternoon, according to a Twitter post by an Edwards spokeswoman. The hearing was before U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays in Lafayette, where 11 bar owners were fighting the closure order. Feldman heard arguments Friday. “The case turns on a classic who-decides question: As between democratically accountable state officials and a federal court, who decides what measures best protect Louisianans during a global pandemic?” Feldman wrote. “The answer is state officials.” It is unknown when Summerhays will rule. Feldman said federal court precedent makes clear that “the bar owners cannot succeed on the merits of their claim that the Governor’s enforcement of the ban of on-site consumption of food or drinks at ‘bars’ violates their constitutional rights.”\n\nMaine\n\nMillinocket: Two dozen Maine residents tested positive for the coronavirus after a wedding reception in Millinocket – the state’s first outbreak linked to a social gathering, officials said Monday. Eighteen people who attended the Aug. 7 reception and six others who had close contact with attendees subsequently tested positive, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control. All told, about 65 people attended the indoor event at the Big Moose Inn, said Maine CDC spokesman Robert Long. The governor’s executive orders put in place during the global pandemic limit indoor gatherings to 50 people if there’s adequate space, and 100 people are allowed at outdoor events. Attendees should also follow physical distancing guidelines and wear masks while not eating. The Maine CDC was communicating with Big Moose Inn about the nature of the event and adherence to state requirements. A telephone message was left at the inn on Monday afternoon. Millinocket Town Manager John Davis said Monday that he didn’t have all the details about the outbreak, but said there was enough concern to close the town hall and local schools as a precaution. It’s unknown if the owner of the Big Moose Inn could be cited if it’s confirmed there were too many people at the reception. The governor’s executive orders allow for a fine of up to $10,000, the governor’s spokeswoman said.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:SunFest, the city’s “biggest and best festival,” won’t go on as planned in 2020, becoming yet another event to be postponed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. SunFest is an annual festival that brings artists, musicians and food vendors to the Ocean City Inlet each fall. This year’s event was scheduled for Oct. 1-4. The Ocean City Mayor and Town Council unanimously voted Monday night to postpone SunFest after a long discussion about the festival’s viability given the pandemic and statewide restrictions. Despite the postponement, Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan still encouraged people to visit the beach town this fall, according to a press release announcing the change to SunFest. “Ocean City has actively promoted the many ways visitors can enjoy the town while maintaining physical distancing this summer, but for an event like Sunfest, we recognized it would not be possible to host the event in a way that was in the best interest of public health,” Meehan said. The decision by the town came after state officials issued guidance stating SunFest couldn’t have any audiences for live performances because of COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state has taken another step toward an expedited renovation project at a veterans’ care center that was the site of one of the nation’s deadliest COVID-19 outbreaks at a long-term care facility. The Office of Administration and Finance said it had selected a company to conduct a 12-week assessment of what needs to be done at the Soldiers’ Home in Holyoke. The assessment includes meetings with stakeholders such as veterans and their families, staff, community members and state legislators. It will also look at cost estimates, financing options and realistic timelines for regulatory approvals, design and construction. The assessment by Payette will be used to develop and implement a plan to apply for a federal Veterans’ Affairs State Home Construction Grant by the April 15 deadline. “Our administration is committed to supporting important facility improvements for the Soldiers’ Home to ensure the facility can provide the best care possible for the veteran residents who have served our country with honor,” Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said in a statement. During the outbreak at the 250-bed state-run facility that opened in 1952, 76 aging and sick residents died after contracting the disease caused by the coronavirus and dozens of other residents and staffers were sickened. A state investigation found that a building poorly designed for infection control, as well as “baffling” decisions by management, allowed the disease to run amok.The home’s superintendent was fired, and the state Veterans Services Director, who oversaw the home, resigned. The state has already spent $6 million to improve infection control at the facility, including the replacement of furnishings and the installation of air purification units.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Legislators gave final approval Monday to bills that would provide flexibility for K-12 schools as they prepare to open amid the coronavirus pandemic, waiving physical attendance and minimum instruction requirements to allow for remote classes. The legislation, which Gov. Gretchen Whitmer will sign, would give districts and charter schools the option to choose in-person instruction, online or a hybrid based on consulting with local health departments. Their student count, the foundation of state funding, would be weighted heavily toward last year’s figure and less so on uncertain enrollment in the new academic year. The plan utilizes innovative methods of instruction and keeps kids safe “without jeopardizing their education,” said House Education Committee Chairwoman Pamela Hornberger, a Republican from Macomb County’s Chesterfield Township. The measures were passed on 77-33, 77-29 and 81-25 bipartisan votes in the GOP-controlled House two days after clearing the Republican-led Senate following a deal with the Democratic governor. The bills would revise how attendance is linked to funding. Currently, districts must have 75% average daily attendance to get their full state aid. Instead, schools would have to make sure there are two-way interactions between 75% of students and their teachers. Districts also would have to administer a benchmark assessment to K-8 students twice, including once in the first nine weeks.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:The City Council voted 5-1 to censure member Paul Brandmire for suggesting a mask mandate could lead to yellow star badges that mark COVID-19-positive people. At Monday’s meeting, council member Carol Lewis asked for the censure, stating she “never expected that a false equivalency of marking someone for death” would come up during during a discussion on mandating face masks to preserve life by preventing the spread of COVID-19. The council approved a mask mandate July 20, days before Gov. Tim Walz ordered masks worn in indoor spaces statewide. At the meeting, Brandmire said, “I mean, if we can mandate masks we can certainly mandate that any COVID-positive people wear some sort of identification badge, maybe like a bright yellow star or something on their lapel.” At the following meeting, on Aug. 3, Lewis and council member George Hontos asked Brandmire to apologize for his remarks. Brandmire refused to apologize for what he said was a “vague reference” against government overreach but said he would apologize to Holocaust survivors who were offended. Brandmire was unable to vote on the motion; he also did not respond to the motion or other council members’ comments Monday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is expanding access to free coronavirus testing for teachers and school-based emergency telehealth coverage after more than 70 of the state’s 82 counties have reported outbreaks during their first few weeks back in the classroom. The State Department of Health has reported 245 cases of coronavirus in teachers and 199 in students since some districts began returning to school in late July. More than 2,000 students and about 600 teachers at the start of this week are in quarantine after being exposed to the virus, state health officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said. To curb the spread of the virus, Dobbs announced Monday that K-12 teachers in the state will now have access to free testing, regardless of whether they have symptoms or know they have been exposed. They will be able to be tested at the state’s two community testing sites, as well as 16 new regional mobile testing sites to be set up early next week. Additionally, the Mississippi Division of Medicaid said that it has expanded its coverage to allow schools without nurses or school-based clinics to access telehealth services. That change began Aug. 1 and will continue through the end of the pandemic, officials said. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said the two measures will ensure that Mississippi’s schools “will remain safe,” adding that he hopes expanding testing for teachers, in particular, will give educators confidence and “peace of mind” about returning to school.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The mayor of Missouri’s largest city has been getting plenty of messages about people not following social distancing guidelines at bars, so he decided to check for himself. Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas told the Kansas City Star that he spent two hours on Saturday night dropping by or looking into eight businesses in the city. His decision to spot check came after a video circulated online showing more than 100 people – most without masks – at an event in the Power & Light District. The Democratic mayor publicized his personal cellphone number and he has received several messages about people ignoring guidelines aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. He decided to check out establishments in various neighborhoods of the city: Midtown-Westport, Country Club Plaza and the 18th and Vine Jazz District, where he lives. Lucas told the Star that most businesses were trying to follow public health guidance. He found “one bad actor,” another that did an “outstanding” job following protocols, and most somewhere in the middle. “There was one establishment I went to that appeared to be following absolutely no protections in the slightest,” said Lucas, who did not name the business.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:Gov. Steve Bullock said his office has been in contact with actress Sharon Stone, shortly after she posted on social media about her sister, in which she said it took five days in Montana to get test results for a COVID-19 test. Bullock said Stone called the governor’s office last week but there was no indication of family members in hospitals and she offered to be part of a fundraiser to increase funding for testing. Bullock said in a news conference in which he was discussing Montana’s fire fund and budget that the state is working with health care providers to make sure they have the resources they need for testing and “we’re continuing to do the work to get rapid turnaround testing … 2-5 days … everywhere across the state.” Stone, 62, urged Instagram followers Sunday to wear a mask “for yourself and others” after her sister Kelly, who is immunocompromised, was hospitalized in Montana with COVID-19, USA TODAY reported. Stone posted photos of her sister Kelly’s hospital room and wrote that Kelly, who has lupus, had only visited the pharmacy but still contracted the virus. Stone said in a video that in Montana, where Kelly and her husband, Bruce Singer, live, people can’t get tested unless they are symptomatic. She said this was happening as people carried guns in a protest in front of a courthouse saying it was their right to not wear a mask. She said earlier that Bullock was not returning her calls and that the health department had hung up on her. She urges people to vote for Democratic president candidate Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris because “with women in power we will fight for our families.” Bullock said the citizen advocate from the governor’s office called her Monday morning for more information. Bullock said there have been protesters in Helena and other places statewide about not only masks, but his stay-at-home order.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A western Nebraska school district has canceled most classes this week after three staff members tested positive for the coronavirus, requiring two dozen school workers to quarantine. Classes for most grade levels in the Broken Bow School District have been canceled for the week, the Omaha World-Herald reported. Superintendent Darren Tobey said in an online announcement that classes for prekindergarten and grades 6-12 were canceled through Friday. Kindergarten through fifth-grade classes were expected to be held as usual. The district is now also requiring all students and staff to wear masks through Sept. 7, including at extracurricular activities and on school transportation. The requirement will be revisited before it expires, Tobey said. The school district covers 426 square miles in Custer County and has an enrollment of more than 800 students.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A Walmart in Mesquite and high-end retailer Nieman Marcus on the Las Vegas Strip were among 11 businesses statewide fined last week by inspectors for failure to comply with coronavirus pandemic mitigation measures, including mask-wearing and social distancing, officials said. A tire shop in Fernley was the only northern Nevada business that made the list following about 700 initial workplace visits statewide, a Nevada Occupational Safety and Health statement said. A Las Vegas pizza restaurant was fined about $6,000 and a Boulder City bar was ordered to pay more than $4,800, OSHA said. Other fines ranged from less than $3,000 for a tire store in Las Vegas to more than $12,600 for Walmart. Nieman Marcus was fined $8,501. The inspections followed Gov. Steve Sisolak’s announcement in July that he would focus more closely on data specific to businesses and municipalities rather than broad guidelines for geographic areas to reopen with measures in place to prevent COVID-19. The communities of Dayton and Mound House in Lyon County had the lowest municipal compliance rate, at 50%, OSHA said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The University of New Hampshire expects to open a coronavirus testing lab with a 12-hour turnaround time for results within a few weeks, the head of the state university system said Monday. Chancellor Todd Leach joined colleagues from private colleges and the community college system for a discussion hosted by U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan. Students have begun returning to many campuses this week, and so far the process has gone smoothly, they said. At the public universities, students are required to get tested for the virus before arriving, and will be tested upon arrival and again within weeks, Leach said. The new lab will be able to process thousands of samples a day, not just from the UNH campus in Durham but from Plymouth State University and Keene State College, Leach said. “That will ensure no matter how busy things get around the country, we’ll have a turnaround time that’s fairly tight,” he said. At the state’s community colleges, where fewer students live in campus, the focus is less on testing and more on personal protective equipment, said interim Chancellor Susan Huard. That’s because many students also work as essential workers.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy gave a strong endorsement of having high school sports while saying such activities need to be limited to outdoors-only and with precautions. Murphy said the final determination on fall high school sports seasons will be made by the State Interscholastic Athletic Association, which he said “will only pursue a sports schedule if they feel the proper health and safety requirements can be met.” If districts opt not to have teams take the field, the state will not overrule them, he said. But Murphy said he was “hugely of the opinion we need sports,” citing beneficial mental and physical health, teamwork and camaraderie effects. If high school sports weren’t pursued, he said, third-party organizations would “fill that void” and might not provide the same level of oversight as would the high school athletic association. Murphy said most fall sports are outdoor activities and safer than indoor ones, and social distancing can be ensured among spectators and on sidelines. “There just isn’t evidence of outdoor flare-ups,” the governor said. “The flare-ups that we’ve seen at the college level, even at the community level, as far as we can tell have been overwhelmingly tied back to indoor activities that were away from the athletic activity.” The state’s high school athletic association said July 30 that “our return-to-play plan is in full swing throughout New Jersey,” adding “we’re eager to begin our seasons in mid-September.” NJ.com reported that the Newark school district, the state’s largest, announced plans Monday to begin the fall with all-remote instruction, reversing plans for some in-person instruction. Other school districts have announced similar plans and some have canceled high school sports for the fall.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces:With schools beginning classes through distance learning, districts have seen cases of staff with COVID-19 on their campuses – including Hatch Valley Public Schools, Gadsden Independent School District and Deming Public Schools. This has required schools to work closely with the New Mexico Department of Health to help track down those who have come in contact with people who have tested positive. Statewide, school districts are looking ahead and planning for students’ eventual return to campus for face-to-face learning. This has led districts to consider what actions they will take to limit the spread of the virus when it comes time for in-person learning. “It’s not a matter if we’ll have positive cases, it’s when we have positive cases — (and) to the extent we have them,” said Kelly Jameson, spokeswoman for Las Cruces Public Schools. “If there was a potential outbreak, it would be incumbent upon the district to be responsible and disclose any kind of threat to the public.” Like other districts, LCPS will be following guidance and taking advice from the DOH on procedures moving forward. Jameson said LCPS will be communicating any coronavirus activity to the community.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Indoor gyms in New York can reopen as soon as next week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday, if they meet public health requirements, including inspections, mandatory mask wearing, a 33% occupancy limit and 6 feet between gym-goers. All gyms that meet the state’s health and safety standards can open by Monday or as at late as Sept. 2 if local officials say they need more time for local inspections. County governments and the mayor of New York City can also decide to delay the start of indoor fitness classes beyond Sept. 2, Cuomo said. The governor’s announcement came just over five months after the state shuttered gyms and other businesses statewide in hopes of reducing the spread of the coronavirus. Gym and fitness studio owners have been clamoring for New York for their businesses to reopen as Cuomo has lifted restrictions on certain industries since mid-May. “The fitness industry is ready to reopen safely, with proper protocols in place to protect our employees and members,” Bill Lia, chairperson of the New York State Fitness Alliance, said recently. The Cuomo administration allowed bowling alleys to open with restrictions starting Monday, while indoor dining is allowed outside New York City.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Public schools returned to class Monday, with most students still learning from home through computers to start the year because of continued worries about COVID-19. Nearly every school in all K-12 districts began the new school year. Leaders of districts and charter schools that teach two-thirds of the 1.5 million public school students chose to implement full-remote learning for now, according to data from the Department of Public Instruction. The first day was marked by technical challenges beyond those that video conferencing and virtual learning bring. Districts reported trouble for children and instructors logging on to the North Carolina Education Cloud. The portal provides access to several digital applications, including tools for grading and attendance, instructional materials and lesson plans. “The product experienced a degradation in service this morning,” the Department of Public Instruction said in a news release. The service was working as of midday Monday, the agency said, and the vendor that provides the service will expain what went wrong. In a Facebook post, the Craven County Public Schools said the system experienced an “overload due to so many students across the state trying to login at the same time.” Under Gov. Roy Cooper’s plan, school boards could start the year by offering full remote learning, in-person instruction with strict social distancing or a mix.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Interim committee meetings for lawmakers have been canceled at least through next week after a member of the Legislature’s research arm tested positive for the coronavirus. John Bjornson, who heads the Legislative Council, said the staff member told him late Sunday night. Bjornson said he notified legislative leaders early Monday, who gave the OK to cancel the meetings as a precaution. Bjornson said the staff member is asymptomatic and was working from home on Monday. Five interim committee meetings had been scheduled for this week, and at least two next week. All will be rescheduled, Bjornson said. Bjornson, the Legislature’s top attorney, said he has encouraged all 32 of his staff to get tested for the coronavirus. The nonpartisan agency includes accountants and attorneys who help lawmakers with research, bill drafting and budget proposals. The staff member is not believed to have had close contact with any lawmaker over the past several days and came within reach of only a “handful” of fellow agency employees, Bjornson said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:A state senator and two of her family members are recovering at home from COVID-19. “Both relatives are out of the hospital,” Sen. Tina Maharath, D-Canal Winchester, told The Columbus Dispatch on Tuesday morning. The 29-year-old workforce analyst tweeted Monday night that she had tested positive and two of her family members were hospitalized. She asked her followers to “wear your masks and stay at home if you’re sick” because her sister-in-law, who had been fighting cancer before she contracted the virus, didn’t survive. “I know she’s rooting for our recovery up in heaven right now,” Maharath tweeted. Maharath, whose parents immigrated to the United States as refugees from Laos, said her surviving family members were lucky to arrive at the hospital when they did. They need help translating what was being said, and a health-care worker just happened to know Lao and Hmong.If not for that man, Maharath said, her family would have been stuck dialing a language hotline and waiting until they found someone who could translate, “which can oftentimes take too long due to the lack of staffing for the southeast Asian languages.” The state senator isn’t the only elected official in Ohio to test positive. State Rep. Stephanie Howse, D-Cleveland, tested positive for COVID-19 in July.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt said he has submitted an application for unemployed Oklahomans to receive an additional $300 in federal unemployment benefits. Once the Federal Emergency Management Agency approves the state’s grant application, the federal government will fund the $300-per-week benefit and Oklahoma will fulfill the 25% state match through existing unemployment benefits, Stitt said. For months, on top of their state benefit, unemployed Americans also collected $600 a week in federal jobless aid, but that expired at the end of July, and negotiations in Congress to extend it collapsed. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order that would provide $300 a week to replace the expired $600. Unemployed Oklahomans have faced numerous challenges in receiving their unemployment benefits, with lines of people often stretching for blocks outside the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. The agency has blamed delays on an outdated computer system, and Interim OESC Director Shelley Zumwalt acknowledged some delays in the new benefit should be expected.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The state’s jobs recovery slowed in July despite the unemployment rate dropping to 10.4% from 11.6% in June. The state gained back 20,500 jobs in the month after adding 57,000 jobs in June, and the state has gained back 38% of the jobs cut in March and April because of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Well, although the past couple months we’ve seen historic monthly job gains, employers have only added back about two of the five jobs that were cut in March and April,” said Anna Johnson, senior economic analyst for the Oregon Employment Department. The largest monthly job gains in July were in the leisure and hospitality sector, which recovered 7,300 jobs; the government added 5,700, retail gained 3,600 and health care added 3,100. Nationally, the unemployment rate declined to 10.2% in July from 11.1% in June.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration is trying to make it clear that masks are to be worn practically at all times by students in school, drawing complaints that school leaders must again change their preparations. The administration this week released additional guidance that Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said Tuesday clarifies the state’s intentions for mask-wearing in schools as they prepare to reopen in the coming days and weeks. Masks must be worn in school, even when students and educators are 6 feet apart, Levine said. “We have had questions about it and we’ve had enough questions that we wanted to clarify,” Levine said at a news conference. “That we mean that when the young people are wearing masks, that they are wearing masks that they are in their classroom even though they’re six feet apart, they should be wearing their masks.” But with some private or career technical schools already open, school officials said it is another frustrating change in guidance. They said they had previously been told that students and educators could remove their masks in the classrooms if they were at least 6 feet apart. The American Academy of Pediatrics said that universal face covering is ideal in schools, but not always possible in the school setting for many reasons. DiRocco said it’s going to be a much more difficult task to ensure that students have a mask on their face throughout the day in a classroom setting, particularly in younger children through third grade.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: There were 75 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Rhode Island on Monday and one additional death, the state Department of Health reported Tuesday. The department also reported 78 people in the hospital with the disease as of Sunday, the latest day for which the information was available, a slight decline from the previous day. Eight patients were in intensive care. The state has now had nearly 20,700 confirmed cases of the disease and 1,024 fatalities. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Rhode Island went from 104.43 per day on Aug. 3 to 91.14 per day on Monday, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Rhode Island declined from 2.56% on Aug. 3 to 2.36% on Monday, according to the Johns Hopkins statistics.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville:South Carolina has the nation’s third-highest rate of COVID-19 infections in children, trailing only Arizona and Tennessee, according to a medical report issued this week. The report from the American Academy of Pediatrics stated that 15,295 children in South Carolina have contracted COVID-19 since the pandemic began. That figure accounts for slightly more than 1% of the state’s age 20-and-under population. About 15% of the state’s overall COVID-19 cases are in children. South Carolina is the nation’s 23rd-most populated state but ranks eighth in its number of COVID-19 infections in children. Two children under age 5 have died of COVID-19 in South Carolina, according to the state Department of Health and Environmental Control. One was from Greenville County. More than 75,000 new cases of COVID-19 in children were reported across the nation between July 30 and Aug. 13 – a 24% increase from the previous two-week period, according to the AAP report. Children infected with COVID-19 are less likely to develop serious illnesses than adults who have the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, according to the most recent information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the CDC noted, “hospitalization rates in children are increasing.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: This year’s Sturgis Motorcycle Rally drew more than 460,000 vehicles during the 10-day event, according to a count that South Dakota transportation officials released Tuesday. The count represents a decrease of nearly 8% from last year but showed that many were undeterred by the coronavirus pandemic. Sturgis officials said they expected fewer people to show up this year, estimating they would see between 250,000 and 300,000 people during the 10-day event. Most people didn’t take significant precautions against COVID-19 infections at this year’s rally. A few people wore masks and some said they were avoiding crowds, but many others packed close together at bars and concerts. With people traveling to the rally from all over the country, the mass gathering has raised concerns it could become an epicenter of infections that are hard to track, but spread quickly as rally-goers travel home. The city releases an estimate of rally turnout after the event every year, based mostly on the weight of the trash generated. Last year, the estimate tracked closely with the number of vehicles counted: 499,654 vehicles entered Sturgis, and city officials estimated 490,000 people came to the rally. The city plans to conduct mass COVID-19 testing in an effort to catch outbreaks.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee has signed into law sweeping protections for businesses, schools and nursing homes against coronavirus lawsuits. Lee touted the legislation as “historic” and argued the law would protect businesses from “frivolous lawsuits.” The GOP-dominated Statehouse could not advance the proposal earlier this year when negotiations among lawmakers broke down in the hectic waning hours of legislative work. Lee convened a special legislative session to not only address COVID-19 liability, but also telemedicine and penalties against protesters who violate certain laws. Under Lee’s leadership, Tennessee was one of the first states to begin reopening in late April after the Republican reluctantly issued a safer-at-home order that forced businesses to close. Lee has since maintained he will not shut down the economy and has resisted calls for a statewide mask mandate.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Texas surpassed 10,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths Monday as the lingering toll of a massive summer outbreak continues, and health experts expressed concerns that recent encouraging trends could be fragile as schools begin reopening for 5 million students across the state. Roughly four in every five of those deaths were reported after June 1. Texas embarked on one of the fastest reopenings in the country in May before an ensuing surge in cases led Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to backtrack and impose a statewide mask order. August has seen an improving outlook, although Texas officials are now concerned that not enough people are seeking tests. The Texas Department of State Health Services reported 51 new deaths Monday, along with more than 2,700 new cases, Numbers are typically lower on Monday because reporting lags over weekends. Texas joins New York, New Jersey and California as the other states to surpass 10,000 coronavirus deaths. Florida is also approaching the grim milestone. Abbott is now urging Texans not to grow complacent as the numbers improve and schools and universities reopen.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A Utah lawmaker said some teachers in the state haven’t received any personal protective equipment as students start returning to schools. Democratic Sen. Kathleen Riebe, who is also a teacher, said her classroom hasn’t received any of the necessary equipment during an education subcommittee hearing Monday, Fox 13 reported. Riebe, who represents Cottonwood Heights, said teachers in her district were “nervous” about the lack of supplies. “I have not seen any of this equipment in our schools, and I’m receiving many emails and phone calls and social media displays that these things have not made it to our schools,” said Riebe, whose school district will reopen Monday. Sarah Young, the state Board of Education’s director of strategic initiatives, said the necessary PPE is in stock and that teachers in Riebe’s district will receive it this week. Education officials said they have purchased extra face coverings and other equipment, but an order for nearly 200,000 packages of disinfectant wipes likely won’t be delivered to the state until Sept. 15. Each teacher is supposed to receive five packages of the wipes.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: As schools prepare to restart in September, Vermont plans to expand child care capacity, including opening regional hubs to serve school-aged children on remote learning days at their schools, Republican Gov. Phil Scott said. Scott said he would also modify state regulations to allow registered home-based child care centers to serve longer hours on school days, which he believes will add about 3,000 spots. “We know we need more childcare capacity and we need it quickly,” Scott said, noting that child care will be a challenge for many parents as schools move back and forth from in-person and remote learning. The regional child care hubs will be set up in workplaces, as well as school, recreational, municipal and summer camp buildings, Agency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said. The state anticipates needing 73 such hubs that could serve as many as 7,000 school-aged children, he said. The state also will expedite administrative processing and increase flexibility for applicants seeking to become registered child care providers, Smith said. The Scott administration is recommending that $12 million in federal coronavirus relief funding be used on the child care initiative, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Lawmakers met Tuesday for a special session to address the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and widespread calls for criminal justice reform sparked by the death of George Floyd. Gov. Ralph Northam also announced budget proposals aimed at increasing voter access, including $2 million for prepaid postage for all absentee ballots and budget language that expressly permits local governments to use drop boxes or implement drop-off locations for absentee voters. Before the session, two groups of protesters gathered on the sidewalk outside of the Science Museum of Virginia, where the state Senate was meeting inside. Lawmakers in the House met at Virginia Commonwealth University’s basketball arena, with desks spread far out. Many male lawmakers skipped wearing ties, which Northam – a pediatric neurologist – has said can help spread disease. Most lawmakers wore masks, but not all of them. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported one group of protesters, organized by the Virginia New Majority, gathered outside the museum to lobby for rent relief and to call for an end to evictions, chanting “eviction is violence.”\n\nWashington\n\nKitsap:Under state COVID-19 guidelines, bowling alleys are listed as reopening in Phase 4, two beyond Kitsap’s current Phase 2. There’s increasing worry that Kitsap might not get there until at least 2021, leaving the family that owns Kitsap’s last two bowling alleys – All Star Lanes & Casino in Silverdale and the Hi Joy Bowl in Port Orchard – in limbo. “This is the only time we’ve ever asked, ‘Are we gonna make it,’ “ said Kylie Myers-Hicks, All Star’s operations manager. “It’s scary for sure.” These are bowling’s slow months; business picks up in the winter. Getting through late 2020 and early 2021 could make the difference, she said. The alleys, like other indoor recreation businesses, face a precarious future under the restrictions of the pandemic. Far removed from their midcentury heyday, when even Kitsap had at least a half-dozen bowling alleys, the sport now faces possible obsolescence. Earlier this month, Glacier Lanes in Everett closed its doors after 60 years in business. Hi Joy and All Star, owned by the Myers family since 1970 and 1985, respectively, have been closed since March 16. While restaurants and bars at both have been able to reopen, the lanes – 40 at All Star and 32 at Hi Joy – remain empty. The bowling alley’s management received money from the federal Paycheck Protection Program, but that money will run out by October. At that point, things are uncertain for the employer of more than 200 people. “There’s just a point where the savings runs out and there’s nothing to fall back on,” Myers-Hicks said. Myers-Hicks would like to see rules established for earlier openings of bowling alleys like those her family operates. Already, the business has created a socially distanced environment and ramped up disinfection. There is one bowling alley that remains open, albeit on a limited basis, and it’s just for sailors and their families. The Olympic Bowling Center at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor is open Friday and Saturday nights. Base officials inspect the center before opening, and bowling is restricted to every other lane. Only families can bowl together, according to Jake Chappelle, a Naval Base Kitsap spokesman.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State officials have decided to cancel elk tours this year because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Logan State Park naturalist Lauren Cole, who leads the tours, told the Charleston Gazette-Mail that there would be too many risks involved if the tours were allowed. “The problem is that we have to put 12 guests and two employees in a 15-passenger van to get to the (Tomblin) Wildlife Management Area property where the elk are. There’s no way to social-distance in a van,” she said. Division of Natural Resources officials have allowed up to 24 public tours each year since 2018, and they are usually timed between early September and mid-October to coincide with mating season. The tours quickly became very popular, and Cole said she expects resume leading them fall as long as there’s no concern about the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Interim University of Wisconsin System President Tommy Thompson said he will ask Gov. Tony Evers to include a nearly $100 million boost for the system in the next state budget and give him permission to borrow up to $1 billion as the coronavirus pandemic bleeds revenue from campuses. A UW news release outlining the request makes no mention of the virus. The closest it comes is a sentence with Thompson acknowledging “unprecedented challenges.” Instead, the release lists a number of new initiatives Thompson wants to use the money to launch. Chief among them is the Wisconsin Tuition Promise, a pledge to pay up to four years’ worth of tuition and fees at any regional campus for incoming state resident freshmen and transfer students whose families make $60,000 or less. The initiative is modeled after UW-Madison’s Bucky’s Tuition Promise, which covers tuition for resident freshmen and transfer students at the state’s flagship university. The money also would go toward expanding and enhancing online courses, forgiving teachers’ student loans, providing stipends for student teachers, adding 20 county-based agriculture positions in the Division of Extension at UW-Madison, and expanding student mental health services. Thompson also plans to ask Evers to include permission in the budget to borrow between $500 million and $1 billion in the current fiscal year to cushion pandemic-related losses, according to a budget summary prepared for regents.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The total number of coronavirus cases in Wyoming grew by 45 on Monday, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 40 and the number of probable cases rising by five, the Casper Star-Tribune reported, according to the Wyoming Department of Health’s daily update. Patients have tested positive for coronavirus in all 23 of Wyoming’s counties. Wyoming has the second-lowest recorded number of coronavirus deaths of any state with 33, behind Hawaii, and its death rate of 5 per 100,000 residents is third-lowest behind Hawaii and Alaska, according to the New York Times.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/18"}]}

Sign up here.\n\nCNN —\n\n“I’m a man and I love men. I do – please don’t be shocked – have sex with other men. This is normal. So please get used to it, or stay out of football.”\n\nDario Minden was a relatively unknown German football fan before a video of a powerful speech he made was widely shared on social media in September.\n\nFor the majority of the 15-minute talk he spoke in his native German before switching to English, a change he deliberately made, he says, for impact. He wanted the world to hear.\n\nLooking directly at Qatar’s ambassador to Germany, Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Saud al-Thani, in a room full of dignitaries and sponsors at a human rights conference in Frankfurt, hosted by the German Football Association, he said his impactful words. Sitting in the front row, the camera pans briefly to al-Thani and shows him looking at and listening to Minden.\n\n“Football is for everyone,” Minden continued. “It doesn’t matter if you’re lesbian, if you’re gay, it’s for everyone. For the boys, for the girls and for everyone in between … The rule that football is for everyone is so important. We cannot allow you to break it no matter how rich you are. You are more than welcome to join the international football community and, also, of course, to host a big tournament. But in sports, it is how it is. You have to accept the rules.”\n\nWhen Minden finishes, a sprinkling of applause can be heard from some members of the audience.\n\nThat he loves men and has sex with men isn’t an issue in his homeland, but it is in Qatar, a country which from Sunday will be hosting the month-long World Cup, one of sport’s biggest and most lucrative events.\n\nVisitors gather at the FIFA World Cup countdown clock in Doha on October 30, 2022. Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, it is undoubtedly a historic event, but it is also one clouded by controversy, from the death of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured as the Gulf state prepared for the tournament, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nHomosexuality in Qatar is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison. A report from Human Rights Watch, published last month, documented cases as recently as September of Qatari security forces arbitrarily arresting LGBT people and subjecting them to “ill-treatment in detention.”\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Minden said he would not be going to Qatar and would not be watching the competition on television.\n\n“When we talk about the situation for the LGBTQ+ rights, we mean not only the football tourists, but also the situation before, and especially after, the World Cup,” he said.\n\nAfter the conference, Minden said he spoke privately with the ambassador who he said told him all were welcome to Qatar. But Minden told CNN: “It’s not safe and it’s not right.”\n\n‘Everyone is welcome to Qatar’\n\nA Qatar government official told CNN in a statement that the World Cup host was an inclusive country. “Everyone is welcome in Qatar,” the statement read, adding: “Our track record has shown that we have warmly welcomed all people regardless of background.”\n\nMeasures were being implemented to ensure discrimination of any kind did not happen, such as human rights training sessions with public and private security forces, and the enacting of legal provisions for the protection of everyone, according to FIFA.\n\nA statement sent to CNN on behalf of the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, said it was committed to “an inclusive and discriminatory-free” World Cup, pointing to the fact that the country had, it said, hosted hundreds of international and regional sporting events since being awarded the World Cup in 2010.\n\n“There has never been an issue and every event has been delivered safely,” the statement read.\n\n“Everyone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.”\n\nBut there have been mixed messages with a World Cup ambassador and former footballer Khalid Salman saying earlier this month that homosexuality was “damage in the mind,” in an interview with German broadcaster ZDF.\n\nWhen asked by CNN for its advice to any members of the LGBTQ community traveling to Qatar, FIFA referred to a recent public statement made by Fatma Samoura, the the governing body’s secretary general, who said: “No matter your race, your religion, your social and sexual orientation, you are most welcome, and Qataris are ready to receive you with the best hospitality that you can imagine.”\n\n‘I don’t feel comfortable traveling to Qatar’\n\nBut for Englishman Rob Sanderson the respecting of cultures is a “two-way street.”\n\nSanderson is Special Projects Officer of Pride in Football, a network of UK LGBTQ fan groups and one of the supporter groups which joined forces in an open letter to condemn both FIFA and the Supreme Committee, refuting the world governing body and Qatar’s claims that it would be a World Cup for all.\n\nHe is a regular at England internationals and was once the victim of a homophobic assault, he says, at Wembley four years ago, ahead of England’s match against Spain in 2018, when he had an altercation with another fan. The incident was reported to the police and investigated, he says, but there was “insufficient evidence” to proceed, he says. But, largely, he has felt accepted at England matches, where he and his friends hold pride flags aloft celebrating their community and the team.\n\nHowever, he will not be going to Qatar and says if England were to win the tournament, it would be a tarnished trophy.\n\n“I don’t feel comfortable traveling out to Qatar and being in any way visible because if I’m visibly showing I’m an LGBT+ football fan, all I’m doing is drawing a target on the back of a local who is anything other than hostile towards me,” the 34-year-old told CNN.\n\n“I don’t feel comfortable being used as an excuse for any hostility that would be around after the tournament. It doesn’t sit right with me.”\n\nQatar isn’t the first controversial host of a big sporting event, or even a FIFA World Cup. The last edition was held in Russia, a country which introduced laws in 2013 which banned “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations.”\n\nIn the build-up to the 2018 tournament, the UK Foreign Office warned of a “heightened risks” to members of the LGBT community traveling to Russia.\n\nBut while some Pride in Football members went to Russia, Sanderson says, feeling that it was safe as Russian society had previously accepted, in the post-Soviet and pre-Putin era, same-sex relationships, none of its members are going to Qatar. “It’s a totally different environment,” he said.\n\n“They said ‘everyone’s welcome’ but they’ve signed that line off by saying ‘you must respect our culture’.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off on Sunday.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Samoura was sent out to the 32 participating nations but would not divulge the contents.\n\nA joint statement issued earlier this month by fan groups Pride in Football, The Rainbow Wall and Three Lions Pride said: “Let’s be clear, talking about human rights is neither ideological nor political. It is simply asking for decency and the ability for people to be able to watch their teams without fear of abuse.”\n\nA number of European federations also issued a statement saying they would continue to campaign at the tournament on human rights issues and compensation for migrant workers.\n\nUSA's team logo is displayed in a room used for briefings during a training session at the team's training camp in Doha ahead of Qatar 2022.

Wales is one of eight participating European countries at the World Cup supporting the initiative.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before traveling to Qatar, the former Real Madrid player said: “We can shed a light on the problems that are going on.”\n\nHowever, Hugo Lloris, captain of France, another team participating in the OneLove campaign, said on Monday he had to “show respect” to Qatar’s culture when asked by reporters about wearing a rainbow-colored armband.\n\n“In France, when we welcome foreigners, we often want them to play by our rules and respect our culture – and I will do the same when I go to Qatar,” he said.\n\nEngland flew into Qatar on Tuesday on a plane called “Rain Bow” and the US Men’s National Team (USMNT) is displaying a rainbow logo at the team’s training facility in Doha.

But it does nothing to ...", "text": "Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt CNN —\n\nThe world has failed to reach an agreement to phase out fossil fuels after marathon UN climate talks were “stonewalled” by a number of oil-producing nations.\n\nNegotiators from nearly 200 countries at the COP27 UN climate summit in Egypt took the historic step of agreeing to set up a “loss and damage” fund meant to help vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters and agreed the globe needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half by 2030.\n\nThe recent devastating floods across Pakistan are just one example of the suffering caused or made worse by the climate crisis. Fida Hussain/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe agreement also reaffirmed the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n\nHowever, an attempt to address the biggest source of the planet warming emissions that are causing the climate crisis ended in a fiasco after a number of nations, including China and Saudi Arabia, blocked a key proposal to phase out all fossil fuels, not just coal.\n\n“It is more than frustrating to see overdue steps on mitigation and the phase-out of fossil energies being stonewalled by a number of large emitters and oil producers,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement.\n\nAddressing the summit early on Sunday morning, the European Union’s Climate Chief Frans Timmermans said the EU was “disappointed” with the final outcome of the summit.\n\n“What we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and planet … we should have done much more,” Timmermans said.\n\nVictory for climate crisis victims\n\nThe agreement to help the world’s most vulnerable countries deal with loss and damage represents a breakthrough, however, in what has been a contentious negotiation process.\n\nIt marks the first time countries and groups, including longtime holdouts like the United States and the EU, have agreed to establish a fund for nations vulnerable to climate disasters made worse by pollution disproportionately produced by wealthy, industrialized nations.\n\nNegotiators and non-governmental organizations observing the talks praised the deal as a significant achievement, after developing nations and small island countries banded together to amplify pressure.\n\n“The agreements made at COP27 are a win for our entire world,” Molwyn Joseph, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said in a statement. “We have shown those who have felt neglected that we hear you, we see you, and we are giving you the respect and care you deserve.”\n\nThe creation of the fund also became one of the key demands of activists attending the summit. Unlike in previous years, when huge protests and loud calls for action become part of the event, demonstrations were muted this year.\n\nProtests are rare and mostly illegal in Egypt and the Egyptian government put strict limits on protesters attending the conference.\n\nStill, the biggest protest of the summit saw hundreds of activists marching through the venue last weekend, demanding climate payments. On Friday, 10-year-old Ghanian activist Nakeeyat Dramani received a standing ovation in the plenary after calling on the delegates to “have a heart and do the math.”\n\nClimate activists staged a number of protests during the conference, demanding end of fossil fuels and climate finance. Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nThe fund will focus on what can be done to support loss and damage resources, but it does not include liability or compensation provisions, a senior Biden administration official told CNN.\n\nReaching the agreement was not easy. The summit was originally scheduled to end on Friday, but went well into overtime with negotiators still trying to hammer out the details as the conference venue was being dismantled around them.\n\nThe US and other developed nations have long sought to avoid such provisions that could open them up to legal liability and lawsuits from other countries. And in previous public remarks, US Climate Envoy John Kerry had said loss and damage was not the same thing as climate reparations.\n\n“‘Reparations’ is not a word or a term that has been used in this context,” Kerry said on a recent call with reporters earlier this month. He added: “We have always said that it is imperative for the developed world to help the developing world to deal with the impacts of climate.”\n\nDetails on how the fund would operate remain murky. The text leaves a lot of questions on when it will be finalized and become operational, and how exactly it would be funded. The text also mentions a transitional committee that will help nail down those details, but doesn’t set specific future deadlines.\n\nAnd while climate experts celebrated the win, they also noted the uncertainty going forward.\n\n“This loss and damage fund will be a lifeline for poor families whose houses are destroyed, farmers whose fields are ruined, and islanders forced from their ancestral homes,” World Resources Institute CEO Ani Dasgupta said. “At the same time, developing countries are leaving Egypt without clear assurances about how the loss and damage fund will be overseen.”\n\nAn outcome on a fund came this year in large part because the G77 bloc of developing nations stayed unified, exerting increased leverage on loss and damage than in past years, climate experts said.\n\n“They needed to be together to force the conversation we’re having now,” Nisha Krishnan, resilience director for World Resources Institute Africa told reporters. “The coalition has held because of this conviction that we did need to stay together to deliver this – and to push the conversation.”\n\nFor many, the fund represents a hard-fought years-long victory, pushed over the finish line by the global attention given to climate disasters such as Pakistan’s devastating flooding this summer.\n\n“It was like a big buildup,” former US climate envoy Todd Stern told CNN. “This has been around for quite a while and it’s getting all the more aggravating to vulnerable countries because there’s still not a lot of money getting put into it. As we can see the actual disaster impacts of climate change are getting more and more intense.”\n\nThe EU's Frans Timmermans speaks to reporters during the summit. Thomas Trutschel/Photothek/Getty Images\n\nText on 1.5 degrees remains\n\nGlobal scientists have for decades warned that warming must be limited to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels – a threshold that is fast-approaching as the planet’s average temperature has already climbed to around 1.1 degrees.\n\nBeyond 1.5 degrees, the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages will increase dramatically, scientists said in the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.\n\nBut while summit delegates affirmed the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, climate experts expressed dismay about a lack of mention of fossil fuels, or the need to phase them down to keep global temperatures from rising. As it did last year at the Glasgow summit, the text calls for a phasedown of unabated coal power, and “phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies,” but does not go further to call for a phase-out of all fossil fuels, including oil and gas.\n\n“The influence of the fossil fuel industry was found across the board,” Laurence Tubiana, CEO European Climate Foundation, said in a statement. “The Egyptian Presidency has produced a text that clearly protects oil and gas petro-states and the fossil fuel industries. This trend cannot continue in the United Arab Emirates next year.”\n\nIt took some dramatic action to even hold onto the 1.5-degree number struck in Glasgow last year.\n\nOn Saturday, EU officials threatened to walk out of the meeting if the final agreement failed to endorse the goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In a carefully choreographed news conference, Timmermans, flanked by a full line-up of ministers and other top officials from EU member states, said that “no deal is better than a bad deal.”\n\n“We do not want 1.5 Celsius to die here and today. That to us is completely unacceptable,” he said.\n\nThe talks were further complicated by the fact that Kerry, who was leading the US delegation, tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday. He continued to communicate with his team and his foreign counterparts by phone, but his physical absence was noticeable during the crunch time at the summit.\n\nUS Climate Envoy John Kerry gestures toward his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua at the COP27 summit. Nariman El-Mofty/AP\n\nThe US and China resume climate talks\n\nAside from the final agreement, the summit brought several other significant developments including the resumption of formal climate talks between the US and China – the world’s two largest greenhouse gas emitters.\n\nAfter China froze climate negotiations between the two countries this summer, US President Joe Biden and China President Xi Jinping agreed to reestablish US-China communications when they met last week at the G20 summit in Bali, paving the way for Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua to meet again formally.\n\n“Without China, even if the US is … moving towards a 1.5-degree program, … if we don’t have China, nobody else can make … that goal,” Kerry told CNN last week.\n\nThe two sides met throughout the second week of COP, trying to pick up where they left off before China suspended the talks, according to a source familiar with the discussions. They were focused on specific action points, such as enhancing China’s plan to reduce emissions of methane – a powerful greenhouse gas – and their overall emissions target, the source said.\n\nUnlike last year, there was no big, joint climate announcement from the two countries. But the resumption of formal communication was seen as an encouraging sign.\n\nLi Shuo, a Beijing-based global policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia said this COP “saw extensive exchanges between the two sides, led by Kerry and Xie.”\n\n“The challenge is they should do more than talk, [and] also need to lead,” Shuo said, adding the restarted formal dialogue “helps to prevent the worst outcome.”", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Ella Nilsen Rachel Ramirez", "Ivana Kottasová", "Ella Nilsen", "Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/19/football/gianni-infantino-press-conference-qatar-2022-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Gianni Infantino: Explosive tirade from FIFA boss threatens to ...", "text": "Doha, Qatar CNN —\n\nThe World Cup finally gets underway on Sunday after 12 years of questions and criticisms of the tournament being held in Qatar. But though kickoff for the opening match is just hours away, soccer itself is still being overshadowed by off-the-field matters.\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino’s extraordinary tirade against Western critics of the controversial tournament in an explosive hour-long monologue is still making headlines around the world. Human rights groups described it as “crass” and an “insult” to migrant workers.\n\nInfantino, the boss of world soccer’s governing body, looked on glumly as he addressed hundreds of journalists in Doha, Qatar, Saturday, and started the news conference with a near hour-long speech, during which he accused Western critics of hypocrisy and racism.\n\n“We are taught many lessons from Europeans, from the Western world,” he said, referring to criticisms of Qatar’s human rights record.\n\n“What we Europeans have been doing for the last 3,000 years, we should be apologizing for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons.”\n\nThis tournament will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but is also mired in controversy, with much of the build-up focusing on human rights, from the death of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nThose involved in the tournament have faced much criticism.

Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images\n\n‘Today I feel gay’\n\nWhile Qatar’s team will take on Ecuador in the first game at 11 a.m. ET Sunday, in his remarkable press conference Infantino barely spoke about soccer and focused his attention on what he called the “hypocrisy” of Western criticism.\n\nInfantino told journalists that he knew what it felt like to be discriminated against, saying he was bullied as a child for having red hair and freckles.\n\n“Today I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arab. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel a migrant worker,” he said, in front of a stunned audience.\n\n“I feel this, all this, because what I’ve been seeing and what I’ve been told, since I don’t read, otherwise I would be depressed I think.\n\n“What I’ve seen brings me back to my personal story. I am a son of migrant workers. My parents were working very very hard in difficult situations.”\n\nInfantino said progress had been made in Qatar on a range of issues, but insisted real change took time, adding that FIFA would not leave the country after the tournament finished. He suggested that he thought some Western journalists would forget about the issues.\n\n“We need to invest in education, to give them a better future, to give them hope. We should all educate ourselves,” he said.\n\n“Reform and change takes time. It took hundreds of years in our countries in Europe. It takes time everywhere, the only way to get results is by engaging […] not by shouting.”\n\nHuman rights groups have criticized the FIFA boss and his speech. Nicholas McGeehan, director of FairSquare, a non-profit human rights organization, said in a statement: “Infantino’s comments were as crass as they were clumsy and suggest that the FIFA president is getting his talking points direct from the Qatari authorities.\n\nSteve Cockburn, Amnesty International’s head of economic and social justice, said in a statement: “In brushing aside legitimate human rights criticisms, Gianni Infantino is dismissing the enormous price paid by migrant workers to make his flagship tournament possible – as well as FIFA’s responsibility for it.\n\nAlcohol ban\n\nInfantino also addressed questions around the last-minute decision to ban alcohol from being sold at the eight stadiums which will host the tournament’s 64 matches. In a FIFA statement issued on Friday, the governing body said alcohol would be sold at fan zones and licensed venues.\n\nThe Muslim country is considered to be very conservative and tightly regulates alcohol sales and usage.\n\nIn September, Qatar had said it would permit ticketed fans to buy alcoholic beer at World Cup stadiums three hours before kickoff and for one hour after the final whistle, but not during the match.\n\n“Let me first assure you that every decision that is taken in this World Cup is a joint decision between Qatar and FIFA,” he said. “Every decision is discussed, debated and taken jointly.”\n\n“There will be […] over 200 places where you can buy alcohol in Qatar and over 10 fan zones, where over 100,000 people can simultaneously drink alcohol.\n\n“I think personally, if for three hours a day you cannot drink a beer, you will survive.”\n\n“Especially because actually the same rules apply in France or in Spain or in Portugal or in Scotland, where no beer is allowed in stadiums now,” he added.\n\n“It seems to become a big thing because it’s a Muslim country, or I don’t know why.”\n\nInfantino finished the press conference by insisting that everyone would be safe in Qatar, amid concerns from the LGBTQ community.\n\nHomosexuality in Qatar is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison, but the FIFA president promised that this was a tournament for everyone.\n\n“Let me mention as well, the LGBT situation. I have been speaking about this topic with the highest leadership of the country several times, not just once. They have confirmed, and I can confirm, that everyone is welcome,” Infantino said.\n\n“This is a clear FIFA requirement. Everyone has to be welcomed, everyone that comes to Qatar is welcome whatever religion, race, sexual orientation, belief she or he has. Everyone is welcome. This was our requirement and the Qatari state sticks to that requirement,” Infantino said.", "authors": ["Ben Church"], "publish_date": "2022/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/28/china/china-lockdown-protests-covid-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China's lockdown protests: What you need to know | CNN", "text": "Beijing CNN —\n\nChina has moved quickly to suppress demonstrations that erupted across the country against the government’s zero-Covid policy on the weekend, deploying police forces at key protest sites and tightening online censorship.\n\nOn Tuesday, while defending the policy, top health officials appeared to acknowledge its impact and pledged to “reduce inconvenience” to the public by lifting lockdowns “as quickly as possible” following outbreaks.\n\nHowever, it may not be enough to appease the protesters, who took to the streets of several major cities and university campuses to demand an end to the country’s increasingly costly lockdowns.\n\nAs numbers swelled, so too did the range of grievances aired, with some even calling for the removal of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who for nearly three years has overseen a strategy of mass-testing, lockdowns, enforced quarantine and digital tracking.\n\nHere’s what we know.\n\nWhy are Chinese people protesting?\n\nThe protests were triggered by a deadly fire last Thursday in Urumqi, the capital of the far western region of Xinjiang. The blaze killed at least 10 people and injured nine in an apartment building – leading to public fury after videos of the incident appeared to show lockdown measures had delayed firefighters from reaching the victims.\n\nThe city had been under lockdown for more than 100 days, with residents unable to leave the region and many forced to stay home.\n\nVideos showed Urumqi residents marching to a government building and chanting for the end of lockdown on Friday. The following morning, the local government said it would lift the lockdown in stages – but did not provide a clear time frame or address the protests.\n\nThat failed to quell public anger and the protests rapidly spread beyond Xinjiang, with residents in cities and universities across China also taking to the streets.\n\nWhere are the protests happening?\n\nSo far, CNN has verified 23 demonstrations that took place across 17 Chinese cities – including the capital Beijing and financial center Shanghai.\n\nIn Shanghai on Saturday, hundreds gathered for a candlelight vigil on Urumqi Road, named after the Xinjiang city, to mourn the fire victims. Many held up blank sheets of white paper – a symbolic protest against censorship – and chanted, “Need human rights, need freedom.”\n\nSome also shouted for Xi to “step down,” and sang The Internationale, a socialist anthem used as a call to action in demonstrations worldwide for more than a century. It was also sung during pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing before a brutal crackdown by armed troops in 1989.\n\nBy Sunday evening, mass demonstrations had spread to Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Wuhan, where thousands of residents called for not only an end to Covid restrictions, but more remarkably, political freedoms. Residents in some locked-down neighborhoods tore down barriers and took to the streets.\n\nProtests also took place on campuses, including the prestigious institutions of Peking University and Tsinghua University in Beijing, and Communication University of China, Nanjing.\n\nIn Hong Kong, where a national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 has been used to stifle dissent, dozens of people gathered on Monday evening in the city’s Central district for a vigil. Some held blank pieces of paper, while others left flowers and held signs commemorating those killed in the Urumqi fire.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear protesters in China call for Xi Jinping's resignation 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\nWhy is this significant?\n\nPublic protest is exceedingly rare in China, where the Communist Party has tightened its grip on all aspects of life, launched a sweeping crackdown on dissent, wiped out much of civil society and built a high-tech surveillance state.\n\nThe mass surveillance system is even more stringent in Xinjiang, where the Chinese government is accused of detaining up to 2 million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in camps where former detainees have alleged they were physically and sexually abused.\n\nA damning United Nations report in September described the region’s “invasive” surveillance network, with police databases containing hundreds of thousands of files with biometric data such as facial and eyeball scans.\n\nChina has repeatedly denied accusations of human rights abuses in the region.\n\nProtesters march in Beijing on November 27. Ng Han Guan/AP\n\nWhile protests do occur in China, they rarely happen on this scale, nor take such direct aim at the central government and the nation’s leader, said Maria Repnikova, an associate professor at Georgia State University who studies Chinese politics and media.\n\n“This is a different type of protest from the more localized protests we have seen recurring over the past two decades that tend to focus their claims and demands on local officials and on very targeted societal and economic issues,” she said. Instead, this time the protests have expanded to include “the sharper expression of political grievances alongside with concerns about Covid-19 lockdowns.”\n\nThere have been growing signs in recent months that the public has run out of patience with zero-Covid, after nearly three years of economic hardship and disruption to daily life.\n\nIsolated pockets of protest broke out October, with anti-zero-Covid slogans appearing on the walls of public bathrooms and in various Chinese cities, inspired by a banner hung by a lone protester on an overpass in Beijing just days before Xi cemented a third term in power.\n\nEarlier in November, larger protests took place in Guangzhou, with residents defying lockdown orders to topple barriers and cheer as they took to the streets.\n\nHow have authorities responded?\n\nWhile protests in several parts of China appear to have largely dispersed peacefully over the weekend, authorities responded more forcefully in some cities.\n\nThe Shanghai protests on Saturday led to scuffles between demonstrators and police, with arrests made in the early hours of the morning. Undeterred, protesters returned on Sunday, where they met a more aggressive response – videos show chaotic scenes of police pushing, dragging, and beating protesters.\n\nThe videos have since been scrubbed from the Chinese internet by censors.\n\nOne Shanghai protester told CNN he was one of around 80 to 110 people detained in the city on Saturday night. He described being transferred to a police station, having his phone confiscated and biometric information collected before being released a day later.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify the number of those arrested.\n\nTwo foreign reporters were also briefly detained. BBC journalist Edward Lawrence was arrested in Shanghai on Sunday night, with a BBC spokesperson claiming he was “beaten and kicked by the police” while covering the protests. He has since been released.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows British journalist 'beaten' and detained in China 01:17 - Source: CNN\n\nMichael Peuker, China correspondent for Swiss public broadcaster RTS, was reporting live when he said several police officers approached him. He later posted on Twitter that the officers took him and his cameraman into a vehicle, before releasing them.\n\nOn Monday, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian later said Lawrence had not identified himself as a journalist before being detained, and seemed to deflect questions about the protests.\n\nWhen a reporter asked whether the widespread displays of public anger would make China consider ending zero-Covid, Zhao replied, “What you mentioned does not reflect what actually happened.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Zhao further defended zero-Covid, claiming Chinese citizens “enjoy various legal rights and freedoms that are fully protected by law. At the same time, any rights and freedoms should be exercised within the framework of the law.”\n\nPolice form a cordon during a protest in Beijing on November 27.

In clips of the leaked audio posted by the Times, Martinez is heard recounting a conversation and says, “Bonin thinks he’s f**king Black.”\n\nMartinez says Bonin appeared with his son on a float in a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade and he “handled his young Black son as though he were an accessory.” The boy is 8 years old, according to a Facebook post by his father.\n\nThe Times reported that Martinez also said of Bonin’s child, “Parece changuito,” or “He’s like a monkey.”\n\nCouncilmembers de Leon and Cedillo – alongside former president of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor Ron Herrera, who also resigned Monday – were all negatively implicated in the recording. Though Martinez has stepped down from her role as president, advocacy groups and Democratic leaders across California continue to call for her resignation from the council, as well as the resignation of the other councilmembers.\n\n“The comments by these individuals are abhorrent and raise serious concerns over whether they are fit to serve the diverse communities of Los Angeles,” the California Legislative Diversity Caucus said in a statement on Monday.\n\n“Each individual was heard making, agreeing with, and amplifying racist and homophobic remarks, and must be held accountable.”\n\nLos Angeles mayoral candidates Rick Caruso and Karen Bass also urged the councilmembers to resign on Monday, and current Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti echoed this in a statement sent to CNN, saying, “There is no place for racism anywhere in L.A. Everyone in our city deserves to feel safe and treated with equal respect.”\n\nWorking toward solidarity in Los Angeles\n\nThe controversy surrounding the resignations undermines the arduous work that has been done to build bridges between communities in Los Angeles, said Manuel Pastor, a professor of sociology and American studies and ethnicity at the University of Southern California.\n\n“One of the things that’s tragic about the conversation that was recorded and revealed to the world is that it erases the political progress that got made, all that community building, and instead the story that’s being told is just about the division between communities. These divisions exist, but there are tremendous bridges, as well,” said Pastor.\n\n“There’s been a tremendous fortune of political alliances between communities of color in Los Angeles and in California,” he said. “The movements to raise the minimum wage, to address environmental inequities, to improve education – particularly by providing college prep in South L.A. and in East L.A. – have been the result of … coming together to actually engage in political struggle for things that will improve their communities.”\n\nPastor is the co-author of “South Central Dreams: Finding Home and Building Community in South L.A.”\n\nIn it, he chronicles the changing relationships between Los Angeles’ Black and Latino communities through the years and how this relationship changed the demographics and identities of specific Los Angeles neighborhoods.\n\nBlack and brown kids were and are still going to school together and experiencing similar oppressive structures, according to Pastor, who added that those shared experiences and continue to lead to an emergence of organizing and alliance-building in South Los Angeles. This history is essential to understanding the relationship today.\n\nDespite the ways in which these two communities work together for equity and justice, the idea that Los Angeles is some multicultural utopia is misplaced, according to Tanya K. Hernández, a comparative race relations expert and professor of law at Fordham University.\n\nHernández is the author of “Racial Innocence: Unmasking Latino Anti-Black Bias and the Struggle for Equality,” in which she coined the term Latino Racial Innocence Cloak – describing a common misconception that Latinos can’t be racist due to their multicultural identity.\n\n“We in the United States tend to think of anti-Blackness in very parochial terms; it’s only something that happens within the United States as committed by white English-speaking Anglo people against English-speaking African Americans. That’s it. It’s a narrow picture,” Hernández said. “In fact, many other communities can be just as complicit in harboring anti-Black bias.”\n\nHer commentary is supported by analysis from the Pew Research Institute in 2021, which found 53% of Latinos ages 18 to 29 say they hear racist or racially insensitive comments or jokes about other Latinos or others who are not Latino from their Latino friends and family.\n\nFifty-nine percent of Latinos say that having a lighter skin color helps at least a little in the ability of Latinos to get ahead in the country these days, while 62% of Latinos say having a darker skin color hurts their ability to get ahead, according to the study.\n\n“It’s the best of times and the worst of times. You can have this sense of linked fate and common desire to be in community, and then you can also have longstanding, deeply entrenched anti-Blackness seeping through as well,” she said.\n\n“Both of these things can be true at the same time.”", "authors": ["Jalen Brown"], "publish_date": "2022/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/01/asia/indonesia-soccer-stadium-stampede-persebaya-surabaya-arema-fc-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Indonesia soccer stadium crush: At least 125 killed in Malang, East ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAt least 125 people are dead after chaos and violence erupted during an Indonesian league soccer match into the early hours of Sunday, according to Indonesia’s National Police Chief in what is one of the world’s deadliest stadium disasters of all time.\n\nSupporters of Arema FC and rival Persebaya Surabaya, two of Indonesia’s biggest soccer teams, clashed in the stands after home team Arema FC was defeated 3-2 at a match in the city of Malang in East Java, police said.\n\nSupporters from the losing team then “invaded” the pitch and police fired tear gas, triggering a fan crush that led to cases of suffocation, East Java police chief Nico Afinta said during a press conference following the event.\n\nTwo police officers were also among the dead, he said, adding that the crush occurred when fans fled for an exit gate.\n\nMore than 300 people were injured, according to Indonesian authorities, with fears that the death toll could rise.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, the governor of the East Java province, where the incident occurred, said the death toll was at 131.

I also would like to emphasize that supporters in the field were Arema FC’s.”\n\nThere have been previous outbreaks of trouble at matches in Indonesia, with a strong rivalry between clubs sometimes leading to violence among supporters.\n\n“All sports clubs (in Indonesia) that compete between the two cities are always intense,” Indonesian football analyst Dex Glenniza told CNN, who noted that it was “forbidden” for Arema and Persebaya supporters to visit each other’s stadiums.\n\n“(This is) in order to avoid friction and clashes between supporters,” he said. “But there are still many incidents between the supporters, most of which off the field.”\n\nPolice chief Listyo said officers will look at the organization and security that was in place during the match, and that a number of specialized units have been dispatched to investigate the incident.

CNN has geolocated the images to Haizhu district, but could not independently confirm them.\n\nIt is not clear how many people were involved in the protest, or how long it lasted. Related posts were swiftly scrubbed from the Chinese internet by censors.\n\nWhen CNN reached the phone line of the Haizhu District government office, a phone operator said that the area was still “largely closed off”.\n\nWhen asked whether protests took place in recent days, the operator declined to answer.\n\nThe public protest – an exceedingly rare event in China, where authorities keep tight control over dissent – appears as yet another sign of the mounting public anger and desperation over the government’s stringent zero-Covid policies.\n\nThe scenes in Guangzhou, which reported over 5,100 new Covid cases on Tuesday – the vast majority asymptomatic – come as Beijing’s unrelenting drive to stamp out the spread of the virus faces questions of sustainability, amid fast-spreading new variants.\n\nResidents on the streets of Guangzhou appeared to defy Covid restrictions. @whyyoutouzhele/Twitter\n\nSurge in cases\n\nChina is experiencing a surge in infections nationwide, this time fueled by simultaneous outbreaks across multiple cities, where control measures are stretching residents and local authorities to the brink.\n\nOn Tuesday, China’s National Health Commission reported more than 17,772 new Covid cases across the country, its highest total since April 2021, with Guangzhou, a city of 19 million, accounting for more than a quarter of those.\n\nLast week, the city placed three districts including Haizhu under lockdown in a bid to stem the spread, imposing a raft of restrictions’ on residents’ movements and business activity. That was followed in recent days by additional measures on neighborhoods designated “high risk.”\n\nZhang Yi, deputy director of the Guangzhou municipal health commission, told a news conference Monday that “pandemic containment measures” will be “enhanced” – a veiled reference for lockdowns – in the entirety of Liwan and Panyu districts, as well as parts of Haizhu and Yuexiu districts.\n\nThe rising case numbers and accompanying controls have pushed more residents across China to question the costs of the brute-force measures employed by authorities to stamp out cases, which include mandatory quarantining close contacts of Covid patients, mass testing, and lockdowns that can see people confined to their districts, neighborhoods or apartments – sometimes for months on end.\n\nTop officials in Beijing, including Chinese leader Xi Jinping, have pledged that the measures should be balanced with economic and social interests. Authorities last week revised the policy, including discouraging unnecessary mass testing and overly zealous classification of restricted “high risk” areas.\n\nThey also largely scrapped the quarantining of secondary close contacts and reduced the time close contacts must spend in central quarantine – all changes officials insist are not a relaxation but a refinement of the policy.\n\nThose measures came as Xi prepared for a week of diplomacy attending summits in Southeast Asia in a signal that China was ready to return to the world stage, with Xi meeting with key Western leaders in person this month for the first time since the pandemic began.\n\nBut for the citizens back home who are trapped in lockdown, recurring issues like accessing prompt medical care or enough food and supplies, or losing work and income – have over and over again led to hardship and tragedy, including numerous deaths believed to be linked to delayed access to medical care.\n\nLockdown hardship\n\nGuangzhou’s Haizhu district, where images showed nighttime protests, is home to a number of migrant workers living in densely packed buildings in areas known as “urban villages.”\n\nTheir circumstances can compound the hardship of the oppressive measures as the true number of residents needing supplies in a given housing block may be unclear to officials delivering goods. There’s also no option of remote work to preserve income for those employed in factories and on construction sites.\n\nIn messages shared on social media, observers noted hearing Haizhu residents originally from outside Guangzhou pleading for help from officials such as compensation for rent and free supplies.\n\nIn a video circulating on social media, a man can be heard screaming “Us Hubei people want to eat! Us Hubei people want to be unsealed!” referring to another province in China, where many migrant workers in the district come from. He is part of a crowd that’s gathered facing a Covid workers in hazmat suits.\n\nIn a separate clip of the same scene, another man asks the workers: “If your parents have gone sick, how would you feel? If your children are suffering from fever and prevented from leaving (for the hospital), how would you feel?”\n\nPeople in another video can be heard shouting out their frustrations and desperation to a man who identifies himself as the neighborhood director and says he wants to address their concerns. One resident rushes forward to say that as non-local residents they’re left to queue for hours for Covid-19 testing and the meat sold to them by the government has gone bad, while they can’t get through to local support hotlines.\n\n“Nobody came to explain and the community’s office line is always busy. And our landlord doesn’t care if we live or die. What should we do?” the resident says, while the other members of the crowd start to shout together: “Unseal! Unseal!”\n\nIn the city news conference Monday, a Haizhu district official acknowledged criticisms that restrictions could have been announced earlier and with more clarity on areas affected by the measures.\n\n“We have also realized many of our shortcomings,” said Su Mingqing, a deputy head of Haizhu district.", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy Kathleen Magramo", "Simone Mccarthy", "Kathleen Magramo"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/politics/marthas-vineyard-migrants-shelter-desantis/index.html", "title": "Migrants sent to Martha's Vineyard have been voluntarily taken to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe roughly 50 migrants who were sent by plane to Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts by Florida’s governor this week were taken to a military base Friday to receive shelter and humanitarian support, officials said.\n\nThe migrants, after two days of uncertainty on the small island and a large local effort to provide for them, cheered Friday morning when they were told they’d be taken to Joint Base Cape Cod.\n\nThe migrants had been flown from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard on Wednesday in arrangements made by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis – part of a series of moves by Republican governors to transport migrants to liberal enclaves to protest what they say are inadequate federal efforts on southern border security.\n\nMartha’s Vineyard had not been expecting the group, and DeSantis’ move was sharply denounced by the White House, migrants’ advocates and Democratic officials.\n\nAt a church where they had been staying on Martha’s Vineyard, migrants cheered Friday morning when they heard the Massachusetts government would shelter them at the Cape Cod military base. They boarded government-arranged buses willingly, officials said, and they arrived at the military installation Friday afternoon.\n\nJoint Base Cape Cod – already an emergency shelter designated by the state emergency management agency – is set up to provide “a safe temporary accommodation appropriate for the needs of families and individuals,” Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker’s office said in a news release.\n\nThe migrants “will be housed in dormitory-style spaces at JBCC, with separate spaces accommodating both individuals and families,” and families will not be separated, it said. They will have access to services including legal, health care, food, hygiene kits, and crisis counseling, according to Baker’s office.\n\nAt the base, some of the migrants from Venezuela received general information about US immigration laws, according to a migrant who spoke to CNN. At this time, CNN is unable to verify what exactly was shared or from whom due to lack of access.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of civil rights attorneys working with the migrants said their stories are “heartbreaking – and infuriating.” Many of the migrants went to a hospital in need of care upon their arrival at the island Wednesday.\n\nSome of these migrants were sent to Martha’s Vineyard even though they have immigration hearings scheduled nowhere near Massachusetts, the group said. Migrants released from government custody often move to other cities in the US as they go through their immigration proceedings.\n\n“This cowardly political stunt has placed our clients in peril,” the Lawyers for Civil Rights group said in a news release Friday. “Some now have immigration hearings as early as Monday thousands of miles away.”\n\nSome attorneys from the group accompanied the migrants on the buses to the Cape Cod base.\n\nCNN has reached out to Baker’s office and the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency for comment, as they are coordinating efforts to care for the migrants at the base.\n\nMigrants on Martha's Vineyard board buses Friday that took them to a military base on Cape Cod.

And last month, DeSantis telegraphed Florida might help move migrants from the US-Mexico border – not from his state.\n\n“We do have money to be able to do (that), but that’s from people from the southern border, that’s not going in the interior of Florida,” DeSantis said at an August press conference.\n\nHis administration secured $12 million in the state budget to pay for migrant relocation, and he has repeatedly threatened to use the money to send them to liberal strongholds.\n\nWhen he laid out his immigration plans at a December news conference, DeSantis teased Martha’s Vineyard as a potential destination, saying, “It’s somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but it is true, if you sent (them) to Delaware or Martha’s Vineyard or some of these places, the border would be secure the next day.”\n\nMigrants on Martha's Vineyard boarded three buses Friday headed for Joint Base Cape Cod. CNN\n\nIn a Friday news conference in Daytona Beach, DeSantis said he intends to use “every penny” of the $12 million and set the expectation for more buses and “likely more” flights with migrants paid for by Florida.\n\n“These are just the beginning efforts,” he said. The governor defended using taxpayer dollars to send the migrants to Martha’s Vineyard because he said many of the people who cross the border end up in his state.\n\nState budget records show six days before the migrants were flown to Massachusetts, Florida’s Department of Transportation paid $615,000 to Destin, Florida-based aviation company Vertol Systems as part of the governor’s program to relocate migrants.\n\nBudget records do not detail what kind of “contracted services” Vertol provided the department, nor is it clear whether the $615,000 was for two flights to Martha’s Vineyard. Additional budget records obtained by CNN also show the state first requested the payment on September 7.\n\nCNN reached out to Vertol Systems, the Department of Transportation and DeSantis’ office but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nA Venezuelan migrant is led onto a bus Friday in Edgartown, Martha's Vineyard.

They were dropped on the island without notice to anyone in the community,” the news release reads.\n\nIn his Friday news conference, Florida’s governor disputed the migrants did not know where they were going, because he said they had signed a waiver and had been provided with a packet including a map of Martha’s Vineyard adding, “It’s obvious that’s where they were going,” and it was all “voluntary.”\n\nTwo of the migrants told CNN, while they were in San Antonio, they decided to go on the trip after two women and a man approached them on the streets near a migrant resource center.\n\nOne of the migrants, Wilmer Villazana, said he was put up in a hotel for five days before the flights and was well taken care of. The women told him they were from Orlando and worked for private organizations that raise funds to help migrants, Villazana said.\n\nOne of the women told Villazana and the other migrant, Yang Pablo Mora, they would get help with shelter and jobs once they arrived at their destination, Villazana and Mora said.\n\nVillazana and Mora did not know the flights were headed to Martha’s Vineyard, they said. Villazana thought they were going to Boston, he said.\n\nWhite House denounces DeSantis’ move\n\nDeSantis’ decision to arrange the migrants’ flight to Massachusetts was one of two high-profile transports sent north by southern Republican governors this week. On Thursday, two buses of migrants sent from Texas by Gov. Greg Abbott arrived outside Vice President Kamala Harris’ residence in the nation’s capital.\n\nTexas started busing migrants to Washington this spring. Arizona’s Republican Gov. Doug Ducey followed suit, and the two states have since sent thousands of migrants to Washington. Abbott has expanded Texas’ effort to include New York City and Chicago.\n\nThe White House on Thursday denounced this week’s moves by DeSantis and Abbott. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre accused the governors of using migrants as “political pawns” and said their actions amounted to a “cruel, premeditated political stunt.”\n\nUS Attorney for Massachusetts Rachael Rollins will speak with members of the Department of Justice about DeSantis sending the migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, though she did not yet have enough information to say whether he broke any laws in doing so, she told reporters on Thursday.\n\nDespite Wednesday’s unannounced arrivals on Martha’s Vineyard, some residents of the island worked quickly to provide some key services. The island is known for being a summer haven for the affluent.\n\n“Our island jumped into action putting together 50 beds, giving everyone a good meal, providing a play area for the children, making sure people have the healthcare and support they need,” Massachusetts state Rep.

But I guarantee you behind the scenes, there’s so much work going on.”\n\nThat work includes interviews with more than 90 people as detectives look into more than 700 leads.\n\nBut Moscow, a city of about 26,000 residents, hasn’t recorded a murder since 2015. The quadruple homicide has rattled the small college community, and anxieties have only heightened with the ongoing lack of answers.\n\nFlow of information\n\nMuch of the information in the case will eventually be used for prosecution and cannot be put into the public eye, at risk of impeding justice at the very end, Snell said.\n\nBut the limited details available to the public and confusion over early police statements hasn’t eased community concerns.\n\nMoscow police initially told the public that the attack was targeted, with no further threat to the public. But by day four, Police Chief Jason Fry adjusted that statement: “We cannot say that there is no threat to the community.”\n\nSnell acknowledges the early messaging may have been off, given that the roughly 30 members of the Moscow Police Department all initially responded to the crime scene, with no dedicated public information staff within the department.\n\nWithin days, the department had to bring in outside resources to assist with the investigation, including Snell.\n\nIn addition to the hundreds of leads, police are also combing through large files of surveillance footage submitted by residents of the early morning hours when police believe the murders happened.\n\n“This is a very large operation, a very large investigation and it’s a very terrible crime,” Snell said.\n\nOther angles are taking longer to investigate. It is believed a fixed-blade knife was used in the attack on the students, and to aid in the investigation, law enforcement asked local businesses to come forward with evidence that a fixed-blade knife was purchased. As of Tuesday, Snell says no local businesses have provided information that a knife matching that description was bought or obtained.\n\nThreat to the public\n\nAnytime a person or people responsible for such a violent crime have not yet been caught, there is a threat to the public, Snell said.\n\n“We recognize that it’s always wise for people to lock their doors, walk in pairs, be alert of what they’re doing. There is somebody or some people out there somewhere that are murderers, and we want to find them and bring them to justice,” Snell said.\n\nHe told CNN there could potentially be more than one person responsible for the killings. He also reiterated that police still believe it was a targeted attack, partly because of evidence found at the scene and the fact that two people in the house survived.\n\nSome students have since left the area to take classes remotely, telling CNN that police statements have not been reassuring.\n\nEthan Chapin, 20; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Madison Mogen, 21, were found dead November 13, police said. CNN\n\nThe University of Idaho president said Tuesday that many students have given the school input on how they hope to proceed after the fall break, resulting in a decision to allow students to finish the rest of the semester either in-person or remotely.\n\nIn his message, University of Idaho President Scott Green said, “Faculty have been asked to prepare in-person teaching and remote learning options so that each student can choose their method of engagement for the final two weeks of the semester. Moving courses fully online is not preferred but may be necessary in limited situations.”\n\nHowever, others in the community, including the mother of victim Ethan Chapin, have extended patience and gratitude for the police department’s work.\n\nAt a memorial on Monday evening, Stacy Chapin thanked the “Moscow Police Department, who now carry the burden every day not only for us, but for all of the impacted families.”\n\nQuelling rumors\n\nIn the absence of details, rumors have been spiraling about the case, causing police to have to dispel them publicly, one by one.\n\n“As people are out there and they’re talking about this case, the public sentiment changes,” Snell said. “They’re confused.

It’s an example of the mass migration around the world that’s arriving at the US-Mexico border.\n\nThe influx is an alarming trend made more difficult by the wide range of nationalities arriving. Many of the migrants who spoke to CNN said they came from Venezuela, Cuba, Colombia and Peru – marking a shift from previous years.\n\nPreviously, Yuma usually received people from Mexico and Central America, meaning countries that are easier to process, according to Yuma Border Patrol Sector Chief Chris Clem. Now, they’re seeing more than 100 nationalities.\n\n“The countries we’re receiving now – those nationalities are flying in, arriving to the border, and they’re having to be processed and there’s just so many of them that it is posing a challenge to the workforce,” Clem said, adding that up to 1,000 migrants are apprehended daily.\n\nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security, more than 6 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants have fled the country.\n\nA Venezuelan migrant, overcome with emotion, held on to her family as she walked toward Border Patrol.\n\n“I feel as though I’ve been reborn,” she told CNN, in Spanish.\n\nAuthorities can turn back migrants under a Trump-era pandemic rule, known as Title 42, but it doesn’t apply to everyone. The public health authority allows border officials to swiftly expel migrants to Mexico, but there are limits on which nationalities can be turned back.\n\nThat, coupled with frosty relations with countries like Venezuela and Cuba, keeps the US from removing certain people, meaning they might be released while going through immigration proceedings.\n\nThe Yuma sector has tried to adjust to manage the increasing flow of people.\n\n“We continue to evolve with technology and resources not only for our agents, but also for the overall mission, the form of surveillance systems. And then we continue to add to the processing and the humane care of the migrants in custody – wraparound medical services, food contracts to make sure that we’ve got plenty of food and to be able to take care of those in custody,” Clem said.\n\nBorder authorities are working closely with Mexico as well as using technology, like cameras, ground sensors and surveillance equipment, to monitor flows, Clem added, calling the situation “dynamic.”\n\n“An agent from Yuma Station can start off in the Imperial Sand Dunes. Next thing you know, they’re jumping on the boat in the Colorado River pulling somebody out who may be drowning. And then responding to 200 people from all over the world,” Clem said, describing shifts for agents in his sector where the ongoing flow of people has taken a toll.\n\nA challenge for the Biden administration\n\nThe flow of people north presents a steep challenge for President Joe Biden, making it a top issue discussed this week between him and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.\n\n“Addressing migration is a hemispheric challenge, a commitment captured in the Los Angeles declaration adopted by the Summit of the Americas,” Biden said, referring to a document that was signed on to by 20 Western Hemisphere nations, and later adding that migration is at “historic levels” throughout the region.\n\nAdministration officials have been monitoring the increased movement of migrants in the region for months. Many migrants who are journeying north worked informal jobs before the Covid-19 pandemic and were especially vulnerable to falling into extreme poverty as economies tightened, while others are fleeing violence and political instability.\n\nMigrants often pass through a perilous jungle, known as the Darién Gap, which spans Panama’s and Colombia’s borders, in their journey to the US.\n\nBetween January and July 11, 56,175 migrants have crossed through the Darién Gap, according to the Panamanian government. Since February, the number of migrants passing through have increased, figures show. The first 11 days of July have already surpassed the entire month of April.\n\nIsai Flores, a migrant from Venezuela, told CNN he had traversed the Darién Gap jungle on his way to the US, calling it “horrible.” Flores cited worsening conditions in his country as his reason for leaving.\n\nAs he prepared to turn himself in to Border Patrol, Flores told CNN he finally felt freedom.\n\nThe US has sought assistance from Panama, as well as its neighbor Costa Rica, where migrants also travel through. An agreement between the US and Costa Rica outlines broad commitments to strengthen enforcement, exchange information on flows and stabilize host communities, according to text reviewed by CNN.\n\nThe document states, for example, that the US and Costa Rica will “explore options” to strengthen the Professional Migration Police and the Border Police of Costa Rica, “integrate technologies that facilitate the exchange of information on migratory flows, in accordance with the laws of each participant,” and develop information campaigns. But it doesn’t provide further specifics on the execution of those measures.\n\nBut those efforts take time. And the political pushback over the handling of the border has been swift.\n\nArizona Gov. Doug Ducey signed legislation at the end of June to shore up funds for border security, following an announcement in May to bus migrants apprehended at the Yuma-Mexico border to Washington, DC. Twenty-five buses have departed Yuma with a total of 942 migrants as of Monday, according to the governor’s office.\n\n‘We haven’t seen these numbers since the Haitian migrant crisis’\n\nThe changing demographics of who’s arriving have also strained resources along the Texas-Mexico border.\n\nThe Del Rio sector, located along the Texas-Mexico border, is facing record-breaking numbers, according to a US Customs and Border Protection official.\n\nOver 24 hours this week, around 2,200 migrants were apprehended across the Del Rio sector, almost 1,000 more apprehensions than the Rio Grande Valley during that same time, the official said.\n\n“We haven’t seen these numbers since the Haitian migrant crisis,” the official told CNN, referring to last September when thousands of migrants – primarily Haitians – gathered under the Del Rio International Bridge.\n\nOn Tuesday, one group apprehended totaled about 500 people, the official added, describing the total arrests as a “high-water mark” for the sector. For days, the sector has been grappling with three to five large groups, defined as 100 or more people, turning themselves in to Border Patrol daily.\n\nThis week, in a signal of the growing number of arrivals, CBP announced the opening of a new facility in Eagle Pass, Texas, to process migrants. The new facility replaces a smaller structure, according to CBP, and has a capacity of 1,000.\n\nMigrants are crossing during the day and often have to wait hours in triple-digit heat to be processed and transported via buses to the station. They’re usually from Cuba and Venezuela, nationalities that are not subject to Title 42. There has also been an influx of Nicaraguans and Colombians.\n\n“We’re doing everything we can to stop that from happening,” the official told CNN, referring to a repeat of last September. “That’s always a concern.”", "authors": ["Priscilla Alvarez"], "publish_date": "2022/07/15"}]}

Here's some travel news for those visiting in 2017.\n\nAcross Spain, neglected corners of many cities are now being made more inviting for visitors. Sevilla's Triana neighborhood, for example, long considered the \"wrong side of the river,\" is soon to be the most colorful part of town. Just across the Guadalquivir River from the city center, it now hosts a bustling fruit and vegetable market, numerous tapas bars and the Museo de la Cerámica de Triana, which highlights the district's tile-producing history. After visiting the museum, it's fun to wander and admire the lavishly decorated facades of the ceramics workshops that once populated this quarter.\n\nAnd in Madrid, the formerly sleazy, no-go Chueca district, just north of the busy shopping street called Gran Vía, is now trendy and appealing. It feels like today's Madrid — and without the tourism. Eating here is especially fun, either at a table on the central Plaza de Chueca, at the San Anton market hall or at one of the creative eateries nearby.\n\nThe exception to this upward trend is in Barcelona, where the iconic Ramblas boulevard has lost much of its charm. Once home to authentic markets, characteristic eateries and a thriving local ambience, it's now awash in tacky tourist trinkets and lousy restaurants. If you come to Barcelona, you've still got to ramble the Ramblas — just don't eat or shop there.\n\nBarcelona is home to many great buildings designed by Antoni Gaudí, the famous Modernista architect. With the opening of the Gaudí Exhibition Center, visitors finally have a central place to learn about his contributions to the city. Filling a complex of ancient and medieval buildings alongside Barcelona's cathedral, the center uses a beautifully lit, well-described exhibit and plenty of historic artifacts to introduce the man and his accomplishments.\n\nTo accommodate a steadily increasing influx of visitors in this wildly popular city, Barcelona's main attractions are getting wise to the advantages of advance ticket sales. For instance, visitors can now save time at the line-plagued Picasso Museum by buying timed-entry tickets in advance. For last-minute types, another option is to buy an Articket BCN, which covers six top Barcelona museums and allows visitors to walk right in anytime at the Picasso Museum.\n\nLikewise, at the Sagrada Família, Gaudí's remarkable unfinished church, it's best to purchase advance tickets online. However, ticket buyers now must decide ahead of time if they want to add the audioguide, tower elevator, live guide or the Gaudí House — there's no option to buy these extras once inside the church.\n\nCasa Batlló and La Pedrera, two more popular Gaudí sights, now offer pricey fast-pass tickets (in addition to regular advance tickets). People with the fast-pass tickets can bypass all lines, including those to enter the building and to access certain areas of the sight, such as the roof, that are closed to non-VIP guests.\n\nIn neighboring Portugal, several new and improved museums are making sightseeing even more interesting for travelers. Lisbon's recently opened Aljube Museum of Resistance and Freedom covers the country's troubled mid-20th-century history. Once a prison that held political opponents of Portugal's longtime dictator António Salazar, the building now houses a well-presented, three-floor exhibit about the repressive regime, which endured from 1926 until 1974. It's food for thought for anyone with an appetite for recent history.\n\nAt Lisbon's Museum of Ancient Art — covering the 15th and 16th centuries, a time when the Portuguese ruled the seas — a planned renovation should make this fine space even more inviting (but may cause disruptions or even closure in 2017).\n\nExtra crowds are expected this year at the Catholic pilgrimage site of Fátima, which celebrates the centennial of the Virgin Mary's apparition to three young villagers in 1917. To learn more about this event, travelers can check out the new Miracle of Fatima Interactive Museum, which features a 40-minute multisensory re-creation of this apparition. The admission fee is steep and the tone is evangelical, but it's probably the best of the commercial attractions in town.\n\nIn Lagos, on Portugal's southern Algarve coast, the Slave Market Museum (Mercado de Escravos) has been completely renovated with new exhibits telling the sad history of Europe's first modern-era slave market (founded in 1444).\n\nAs it has in much of urban Europe, Uber has made it to Portugal. It's a good, cheap way to get around in hilly Lisbon and Porto. And there's another fun new option in both towns: goofy little tuk-tuks (three-wheeled taxis). Find a likeable driver with good language skills and a little charm, and negotiate a private tour. The vehicles are just right for getting into back lanes and making impromptu photo stops.\n\nMuch has changed since I first started visiting these countries decades ago. But even though Spain and Portugal are keeping up with 21st-century trends, their attractions are timeless.\n\nRick Steves writes European travel guidebooks and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhat if doctors could just print a kidney, using cells from the patient, instead of having to find a donor match and hope the patient’s body doesn’t reject the transplanted kidney?\n\nThe soonest that could happen is in a decade, thanks to 3D organ bioprinting, said Jennifer Lewis, a professor at Harvard University’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. Organ bioprinting is the use of 3D-printing technologies to assemble multiple cell types, growth factors and biomaterials in a layer-by-layer fashion to produce bioartificial organs that ideally imitate their natural counterparts, according to a 2019 study.\n\nThis type of regenerative medicine is in the development stage, and the driving force behind this innovation is “real human need,” Lewis said.\n\nIn the United States, there are 106,800 men, women and children on the national organ transplant waiting list as of March 8, 2023, according to the Health Resources & Services Administration. However, living donors provide only around 6,000 organs per year on average, and there are about 8,000 deceased donors annually who each provide 3.5 organs on average.\n\nThe cause of this discrepancy is “a combination of people who undergo catastrophic health events, but their organs aren’t high enough quality to donate, or they’re not on the organ donor list to begin with, and the fact that it’s actually very difficult to find a good match” so the patient’s body doesn’t reject the transplanted organ, Lewis said.\n\nAnd even though living donors are an option, “to do surgery on someone who doesn’t need it” is a big risk, said Dr. Anthony Atala, director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine. “So, living related donors are usually not the preferred way to go because then you’re taking an organ away from somebody else who may need it, especially now as we age longer.”\n\nAtala and his colleagues were responsible for growing human bladders in a lab by hand in 2006, and implanting a complicated internal organ into people for the first time — saving the lives of three children in whom they implanted the bladders.\n\nA bladder scaffold is seeded with cells at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine. Courtesy Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine\n\nEvery day, 17 people die waiting for an organ transplant, according to the Health Resources & Services Administration. And every 10 minutes, another person is added to the waitlist, the agency says. More than 90% of the people on the transplant list in 2021 needed a kidney.\n\n“About a million people worldwide are in need of a kidney. So they have end-stage renal failure, and they have to go on dialysis,” Lewis said. “Once you go on dialysis, you have essentially five years to live, and every year, your mortality rate increases by 15%. Dialysis is very hard on your body. So this is really motivating to take on this grand challenge of printing organs.”\n\n“Anti-hypertensive pills are not scarce. Everybody who needs them can get them,” Martine Rothblatt, CEO and chairman of United Therapeutics, said in June 2022 at the Life Itself conference, a health and wellness event presented in partnership with CNN. United Therapeutics was one of the conference sponsors.\n\n“There is no practical reason why anybody who needs a kidney — or a lung, a heart, a liver — should not be able to get one,” she added. “We’re using technology to solve this problem.”\n\nPrinting organs 101\n\nTo begin the process of bioprinting an organ, doctors typically start with a patient’s own cells. They take a small needle biopsy of an organ or do a minimally invasive surgical procedure that removes a small piece of tissue, “less than half the size of a postage stamp,” Atala said. “By taking this small piece of tissue, we are able to tease cells apart (and) we grow and expand the cells outside the body.”\n\nThis growth happens inside a sterile incubator or bioreactor, a pressurized stainless steel vessel that helps the cells stay fed with nutrients — called “media” — the doctors feed them every 24 hours, since cells have their own metabolism, Lewis said. Each cell type has a different media, and the incubator or bioreactor acts as an oven-like device mimicking the internal temperature and oxygenation of the human body, Atala said.\n\n“Then we mix it with this gel, which is like a glue,” Atala said. “Every organ in your body has the cells and the glue that holds it together. Basically, that’s also called ‘extracellular matrix.’”\n\nThis glue is Atala’s nickname for bioink, a printable mixture of living cells, water-rich molecules called hydrogels, and the media and growth factors that help the cells continue to proliferate and differentiate, Lewis said. The hydrogels mimic the human body’s extracellular matrix, which contains substances including proteins, collagen and hyaluronic acid.\n\nThe non-cell sample portion of the glue can be made in a lab, and “is going to have the same properties of the tissue you’re trying to replace,” Atala said.\n\nThe biomaterials used typically have to be nontoxic, biodegradable and biocompatible to avoid a negative immune response, Lewis said. Collagen and gelatin are two of the most common biomaterials used for bioprinting tissues or organs.\n\nThe printing process\n\nFrom there, doctors load each bioink — depending on how many cell types they’re wanting to print — into a printing chamber, “using a printhead and nozzle to extrude an ink and build the material up layer by layer,” Lewis said. Creating tissue with personalized properties is enabled by printers being programmed with a patient’s imaging data from X-rays or scans, Atala said.\n\n“With a color printer you have several different cartridges, and each cartridge is printing a different color, and you come up with your (final) color,” Atala added. Bioprinting is the same; you’re just using cells instead of traditional inks.\n\nHow long the printing process takes depends on several factors, including the organ or tissue being printed, the fineness of the resolution and the number of printheads needed, Lewis said. But it typically lasts a few to several hours. The time from the biopsy to the implantation is about four to six weeks, Atala said.\n\nA 3D printer seeds different types of cells onto a kidney scaffold at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine. Courtesy Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine\n\nThe ultimate challenge is “getting the organs to actually function as they should,” so accomplishing that “is the holy grail,” Lewis said.\n\n“Just like if you were to harvest an organ from a donor, you have to immediately get that organ into a bioreactor and start perfusing it or the cells die,” she added. To perfuse an organ is to supply it with fluid, usually blood or a blood substitute, by circulating it through blood vessels or other channels.\n\nDepending on the organ’s complexity, there is sometimes a need to mature the tissue further in a bioreactor or further drive connections, Lewis said. “There’s just a number of plumbing issues and challenges that have to be done in order to make that printed organ actually function like a human organ would in vivo (meaning in the body). And honestly, this has not been fully solved yet.”\n\nOnce a bioprinted organ is implanted into a patient, it will naturally degrade over time — which is OK since that’s how it’s designed to work.\n\n“You’re probably wondering, ‘Well, then what happens to the tissue? Will it fall apart?’ Actually, no,” Atala said. “These glues dissolve, and the cells sense that the bridge is giving way; they sense that they don’t have a firm footing anymore. So cells do what they do in your very own body, which is to create their own bridge and create their own glue.”\n\nRemaining challenges\n\nAtala and Lewis are conservative in their estimates about the number of years remaining before fully functioning bioprinted organs can be implanted into humans.\n\n“The field’s moving fast, but I mean, I think we’re talking about a decade plus, even with all of the tremendous progress that’s been made,” Lewis said.\n\n“I learned so many years ago never to predict because you’ll always be wrong,” Atala said. “There’s so many factors in terms of manufacturing and the (US Food and Drug Administration regulation). At the end of the day, our interest, of course, is to make sure the technologies are safe for the patient above all.”\n\nWhenever bioprinting organs becomes an available option, affordability for patients and their caregivers shouldn’t be an issue.\n\nThey’ll be “accessible for sure,” Atala said. “The costs associated with organ failures are very high. Just to keep a patient on dialysis is over a quarter of a million dollars per year, just to keep one patient on dialysis. So, it’s a lot cheaper to create an organ that you can implant into the patient.”\n\nThe average kidney transplant cost was $442,500 in 2020, according to research published by the American Society of Nephrology — while 3D printers retail for around a few thousand dollars to upward of $100,000, depending on their complexity. But even though low-cost printers are available, pricey parts of bioprinting can include maintaining cell banks for patients, culturing cells and safely handling biological materials, Lewis said.\n\nSome of the major costs of current organ transplantation are “harvesting the organ from the donor, the transport costs and then, of course, the surgery that the recipient goes through, and then all the care and monitoring,” Lewis said. “Some of that cost would still be in play, even if it was bioprinted.”", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/03/11/how-30-year-old-faced-kidney-failure/81527860/", "title": "How a 30-year-old is facing kidney failure", "text": "Dwight Adams\n\nIndyStar\n\nMigraines run in the family. His father has them. His sister and uncle and grandmother, too. And David Scott had them on and off since he was in high school in Indianapolis.\n\nBut something else was wrong last fall when the University of Kentucky grad student sought help at UK’s Chandler Medical Center in Lexington, Ky.\n\nThe migraines were more frequent. By mid-November, he was vomiting a lot, couldn’t sleep, was often thirsty, had blurry vision and was fighting chronic fatigue.\n\nHe was just 30 years old. What could be wrong?\n\nA few weeks before Christmas, Scott learned he had end-stage renal failure — a total shutdown of his kidneys. His blood pressure was so high, doctors were surprised he hadn’t had a stroke.\n\nScott, who was teaching philosophy and law classes, working on his doctoral dissertation and pursuing his dream of being a college professor, faced a health catastrophe. He needed a kidney immediately and would need many long hours of dialysis.\n\n“I really didn’t understand,” he said of his initial reaction. “I didn’t know anything about kidney disease. Kidney disease just never even entered into my mind.”\n\nAn estimated 26 million American adults have kidney disease, according to the National Kidney Foundation, but most aren’t even aware they are sick. The disease kills more people in the U.S. each year than breast cancer or prostate cancer, and 1 in 3 Americans is at risk.\n\nDiabetes and high blood pressure are the two leading causes, and now that those problems are on the rise, so is chronic kidney disease (CKD). The incidence of end-stage renal failure soared nearly 600 percent from 1980 to 2009, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The share of adults 30 and older who have CKD is projected to rise from 13.2 percent today to 16.7 percent in 2030, according to a 2015 report in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases.\n\nAnd the financial costs are staggering: More than $87 billion in Medicare funds were spent on kidney disease and kidney failure in 2012, according to the U.S. Renal Data System.\n\n“It absolutely is increasing because of hypertension and diabetes,” Tricia Behringer, program director of the National Kidney Foundation of Indiana, said of CKD. “It’s a very serious disease. It’s on the rise, and we cannot do enough education.”\n\nKidney disease is called the silent killer, experts say, because the patient often doesn’t notice any symptoms until the disease has done severe damage.\n\nEarly detection is the key. If people have a history of diabetes or high blood pressure, they should get tested for kidney disease once a year, Behringer said.\n\nAll that is needed is a urine analysis and blood test. The Kidney Foundation provides free screening at events statewide, including during March, which is National Kidney Month.\n\nYour chances of getting kidney disease increase as you age, says Dr. Tim Taber, a transplant nephrologist with IU Health, because kidneys become less efficient with time. The average person loses about 1 percent of their kidney function every year after age 45, he said.\n\nThere is good news on the treatment front, however. Taber said doctors can now receive more accurate estimates of a patient's glomerular filtration rate, a key gauge of kidney function, which can lead to an earlier diagnosis of the disease. Medications to treat kidney disease also keep improving, he said, and stem cell research may someday make it possible for a new kidney to be created from a patient's cells.\n\nEarly diagnosis \"can lead to preservation of function,\" Taber said. \"If we catch it early, maybe you'll never need a transplant. So it's important that people get screened and that it's found early on.\"\n\nIt was clear Scott had unknowingly been living with the disease for a long time. When a doctor saw images of his diseased kidneys, the scarring was significant.\n\nNow that the shock has worn off, Scott says he’s better informed about the disease and his options, he’s on the kidney recipient list, and he’s regaining his energy.\n\nA big step: He no longer has to go to a dialysis center for four or five hours at a time, three times a week. Scott is now performing the procedure at home himself, including the laborious setup to protect against infection as well as the handling of the medicine and machine that cleans his blood at night while he sleeps.\n\nMore than 100,000 people are on the waiting list for kidneys in the U.S. and 1,200 are waiting in Indiana, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. IU Health performs about 200 kidney transplants a year, Taber said.\n\nWhile Scott knows he could be on dialysis awhile as he awaits a live kidney, options such as paired-donor programs could speed the process. In such programs, two kidney patients are paired with two donors to increase the chance of finding a good match.\n\nBut there are obstacles to having more live kidney donors, Behringer said, not the least of which is the fear of giving up one's kidney even though it’s been proven you can live well on just one.\n\nScott is staying positive, despite the challenges.\n\n“I’m still anxious, but it’s nothing like it was before,” he said. “I’m a lot more optimistic. You can control your own destiny, really improve your odds. There are things you can do, rather than feel hopeless.”\n\nScott was always interested in spirituality, but he says his illness has brought him closer to God in a more meaningful way, including regular readings of Scripture and weekly meetings with a \"life group\" of like-minded men in their 20s and 30s.\n\nMany people suffering from kidney failure are 60 or older. But Scott has had to face his own mortality at a much-younger age than most.\n\n“Before, I was like a lot of young people my age,\" he said. \"I felt kind of invincible.\n\n“Now I have more passion. It’s kind of an extreme motivator. I realize I have to do those things now because I don’t know how much time I will have.”\n\nKidney disease facts\n\n• More than 26 million adult Americans have chronic kidney disease and most don't know it. One in 3 Americans is at risk of developing the disease.\n\n• High blood pressure, diabetes or a family history of kidney disease are the major causes of CKD.\n\n• Minority populations, including African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans and the elderly are at highest risk.\n\n• CKD can cause other problems, including cardiovascular disease, a heart attack, a stroke and nerve damage as well as kidney failure.\n\n• Kidney disease is the ninth-leading cause of death every year in the U.S.\n\n• If you have these symptoms, see a doctor immediately: blood in the urine or foamy urine; painful urination; increased thirst; fatigue; puffiness around the eyes; swelling of face, hands, ankles and feet.\n\n• Early detection is key. Those with major risk factors should be screened annually for the disease.\n\nSource: National Kidney Foundation\n\nHow to help\n\n• To learn more about a kidney donation for David Scott, go to the Donor for David Facebook page.\n\n• For more information about the disease, go to the National Kidney Foundation of Indiana website at kidney.org/offices/nkf-indiana.\n\nCall IndyStar digital producer Dwight Adams at (317) 444-6532.

It’s about three meters lower than the biggest, Ghazipur, and both contribute to the country’s total output of methane gas.\n\nMethane is the second most abundant greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, but a more potent contributor to the climate crisis because methane traps more heat. India creates more methane from landfill sites than any other country, according to GHGSat, which monitors methane via satellites.\n\nAnd India comes second only to China for total methane emissions, according to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Global Methane Tracker.\n\nRagpickers at the Bhalswa landfill site on April 28, 2022, in New Delhi, India. Sanchit Khanna/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\nAs part of his “Clean India” initiative, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said efforts are being made to remove these mountains of garbage and convert them into green zones. That goal, if achieved, could relieve some of the suffering of those residents living in the shadows of these dump sites – and help the world lower its greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIndia wants to lower its methane output, but it hasn’t joined the 130 countries who have signed up to the Global Methane Pledge, a pact to collectively cut global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Scientists estimate the reduction could cut global temperature rise by 0.2% – and help the world reach its target of keeping global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nIndia says it won’t join because most of its methane emissions come from farming – some 74% from farm animals and paddy fields versus less than 15% from landfill.\n\nIn a statement last year, Minister of State for Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate change Ashwini Choubey said pledging to reduce India’s total methane output could threaten the livelihood of farmers and affect India’s trade and economic prospects.\n\nBut it’s also facing challenges in reducing methane from its steaming mounds of trash.\n\nA young boy in the narrow lanes of slums in Bhalswa Dairy Village. Rishabh Pratap/CNN\n\n‘Here we are, with no relief’\n\nWhen Narayan Choudhary, 72, moved to Bhalswa in 1982, he said it was a “beautiful place,” but that all changed 12 years later when the first rubbish began arriving at the local landfill.\n\nIn the years since, the Bhalswa dump has grown nearly as tall as the historic Taj Mahal, becoming a landmark in its own right and an eyesore that towers over surrounding homes, affecting the health of people who live there.\n\nChoudhary suffers from chronic asthma. He said he nearly died when a large fire broke out at Bhalswa in April that burned for days. “I was in terrible shape. My face and nose were swollen. I was on my death bed,” he said.\n\n“Two years ago we protested … a lot of residents from this area protested (to get rid of the waste),” Choudhary said. “But the municipality didn’t cooperate with us. They assured us that things will get better in two years but here we are, with no relief.”\n\nThe dump site exhausted its capacity in 2002, according to a 2020 report on India’s landfills from the Center for Science and Environment (CSE), a nonprofit research agency in New Delhi, but without government standardization in recycling systems and greater industry efforts to reduce plastic consumption and production, tonnes of garbage continue to arrive at the site daily.\n\nNarrow lanes of the slum in Bhalswa Dairy Village. Rishabh Pratap/CNN\n\nBhalswa isn’t the only dump causing distress to residents nearby – it is one of three landfills in Delhi, overflowing with decaying waste and emitting toxic gases into the air.\n\nAcross the country, there are more than 3,100 landfills. Ghazipur is the biggest in Delhi, standing at 65 meters (213 feet), and like Bhalswa, it surpassed its waste capacity in 2002 and currently produces huge amounts of methane.\n\nAccording to GHGSat, on a single day in March, more than two metric tons of methane gas leaked from the site every hour.\n\n“If sustained for a year, the methane leak from this landfill would have the same climate impact as annual emissions from 350,000 US cars,” said GHGSat CEO Stephane Germain.\n\nDangerous toxins in groundwater\n\nMethane emissions aren’t the only hazard that stem from landfills like Bhalswa and Ghazipur. Over decades, dangerous toxins have seeped into the ground, polluting the water supply for thousands of residents living nearby.\n\nIn May, CNN commissioned two accredited labs to test the ground water around the Bhalswa landfill. And according to the results, ground water within at least a 500-meter (1,600-foot) radius around the waste site is contaminated.\n\nA ground water sample from the Bhalswa landfill in northwest Delhi. Vedika Sud/CNN\n\nIn the first lab report, levels of ammonia and sulphate were significantly higher than acceptable limits mandated by the Indian government.\n\nResults from the second lab report showed levels of total dissolved solids (TDS) – the amount of inorganic salts and organic matter dissolved in the water – detected in one of the samples was almost 19 times the acceptable limit, making it unsafe for human drinking.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Standards sets the acceptable limit of TDS at 500 milligrams/liter, a figure roughly seen as “good” by the World Health Organization (WHO). Anything over 900 mg/l is considered “poor” by the WHO, and over 1,200 mg/l is “unacceptable.”\n\nAccording to Richa Singh from the Center for Science and Environment (CSE), the TDS of water taken near the Bhalswa site was between 3,000 and 4,000 mg/l. “This water is not only unfit for drinking but also unfit for skin contact,” she said. “So it can’t be used for purposes like bathing or cleaning of the utensils or cleaning of the clothes.”\n\nDr. Nitesh Rohatgi, the senior director of medical oncology at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram, urged the government to study the health of the local population and compare it to other areas of the city, “so that in 15 to 20 years’ time, we are not looking back and regretting that we had a higher cancer incidence, higher health hazards, higher health issues and we didn’t look back and correct them in time.”\n\nMost people in Bhalswa rely on bottled water for drinking, but they use local water for other purposes – many say they have no choice.\n\n“The water we get is contaminated, but we have to helplessly store it and use it for washing utensils, bathing and at times drinking too,” said resident Sonia Bibi, whose legs are covered in a thick, red rash.\n\nJwala Prashad, 87, who lives in a small hut in an alleyway near the landfill, said the pile of putrid trash had made his life “a living hell.”\n\n“The water we use is pale red in color. My skin burns after bathing,” he said, as he tried to soothe red gashes on his face and neck.\n\n“But I can’t afford to ever leave this place,” he added.\n\nJwala Prashad, 87, at the handpump in front of his house in Bhalswa Dairy Village. Rishabh Pratap/CNN\n\nWaste target in doubt\n\nMore than 2,300 tonnes of Municipal Solid Waste arrive at Delhi’s largest dump in Ghazipur every day, according to a report released in July by a joint committee formed to find a way to reduce the number of fires at the site.\n\nThat’s the bulk of the waste from the surrounding area – only 300 tonnes is processed and disposed of by other means, the report said. And less than 7% of legacy waste had been bio-mined, which involves excavating, treating and potentially reusing old rubbish.\n\nThe Municipal Corporation of Delhi deploys drones every three months to monitor the size of the trash heap and is experimenting with ways to extract methane from the trash mountain, the report said.\n\nBut too much rubbish is arriving every day to keep up. The committee said bio-mining had been “slow and tardy” and it was “highly unlikely” the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (which has now merged with North and South Delhi Municipal Corporations) would achieve its target of “flattening the garbage mountain” by 2024.\n\n“No effective plans to reduce the height of the garbage mountain have been made,” the report said. Furthermore, “it should have proposed a long time ago that future dumping of garbage in them would pollute the groundwater systems,” the report added.\n\nCNN sent a series of questions along with the data from the water testing questionnaire to India’s Environment and Health Ministries. There has been no response from the ministries.\n\nIn a 2019 report, the Indian government recommended ways to improve the country’s solid waste management, including formalizing the recycling sector and installing more compost plants in the country.\n\nWhile some improvements have been made, such as better door-to-door garbage collection and processing of waste, Delhi’s landfills continue to accumulate waste.\n\nIn October, the National Green Tribunal fined the state government more than $100 million for failing to dispose of more than 30 million metric tonnes of waste across its three landfill sites.\n\n“The problem is Delhi doesn’t have a concrete solid waste action plan in place,” said Singh from the CSE. “So we are talking here about dump site remediation and the treatment of legacy waste, but imagine the fresh waste which is generated on a regular basis. All of that is getting dumped everyday into these landfills.”\n\n“(So) let’s say you are treating 1,000 tons of legacy (waste) and then you are dumping 2,000 tons of fresh waste every day it will become a vicious cycle. It will be a never ending process,” Singh said.\n\n“Management of legacy waste, of course, is mandated by the government and is very, very important. But you just can’t start the process without having an alternative facility of fresh waste. So that’s the biggest challenge.”", "authors": ["Vedika Sud Rhea Mogul Rishabh Pratap Arpit Goel", "Vedika Sud", "Rhea Mogul", "Rishabh Pratap", "Arpit Goel"], "publish_date": "2022/12/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/us/2022-in-review-fast-facts/index.html", "title": "2022 In Review Fast Facts | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nHere is a look back at the events of 2022.\n\nNotable US Events\n\nJanuary 3 - The US Food and Drug Administration expands the emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine boosters to children ages 12 to 15.

It will ...", "text": "Itu, Sao Paulo State, Brazil CNN —\n\nThe drive through Sao Paulo state in Brazil is decidedly unremarkable, blocks and blocks of high-rise buildings give way to commuter highways and eventually to gentle rolling hills. It is hardly the scene where one would expect to find the climate’s salvation.\n\nAnd yet as Luis Guedes Pinto climbed his sky-high perch above a reclaimed swath of Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, he explained you don’t have to go to the Arctic or even the Amazon to learn how to nurse Earth’s forests back to health.\n\n“This project doesn’t change a big landscape, but it shows it’s possible to bring back life, to bring back water, to bring back biodiversity, to the center of the state of Sao Paulo,” said Pinto, the CEO at SOS Mata Atlântica, as he pointed down to two square miles of forest restoration.\n\nPinto’s organization is a non-profit devoted to rehabilitating the swath of forest on Brazil’s Atlantic coast. The forest itself is home to more than 145 million Brazilians, and — just as the Amazon rainforest has been ravaged by deforestation in the past several years — around three-quarters of it has already been wiped out by urban and infrastructure development and aggressive agribusiness practices.\n\n“We need to plant and replant, but we cannot lose another acre,” Pinto said as he guided CNN through a nursery with more than 50 species of carefully cultivated trees and plants in what was once degraded, drought-prone pasture. “A forest we replant is not going to be the same as a forest we cut down. Some of the forests we’re losing have trees in them that are hundreds of years old.”\n\nThese are the seedlings of a forest’s revival. In just 15 years, it has become a thriving eco-lab with a healthy water table, trees, plants and animals. It is a completely different landscape to the pasture land on its borders, where drought-stricken grass overtakes acres of what was previously forest.\n\nThe SOS Mata Atlantica was able to recover this patch of pasture and restore it into a wild habitat. Vasco Cotovio/CNN\n\nA volunteer plants a tree at the SOS Mata Atlantica compound. Different species of plants grow at different rates so volunteers have to keep coming back to reforested areas for years before a habitat is fully restored. Vasco Cotovio/CNN\n\nAs president-elect Lula Da Silva comes into power, projects like this are now at the crossroads of climate and political history in Brazil, a country that is home to one of the planet’s most significant stores of biodiversity.\n\nFor nearly four years, the government of President Jair Bolsonaro was accused of undoing the environment progress of Lula, who served as president from 2003 through 2010. Data from Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research show the rate of deforestation under Bolsonaro’s presidency climbed by more than 70% from 2018 to 2021.\n\nAlready the Amazon rainforest is emitting more carbon dioxide than it absorbs in some locations — a shift that could have an enormous negative impact on global warming trends. And scientists warn the precious rainforest is nearing a point of irreversible decline and is less capable of recovering from disturbances like drought, logging and wildfires.\n\nLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva speaks during a campaign rally in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on July 7, 2022.

Eraldo Peres/AP In pictures: Brazil's President, Lula da Silva Prev Next\n\nLula’s record as former president shows his government was able to cut deforestation rates dramatically by the end of his term in 2010. And his new promise goes even further: to reach zero deforestation in Brazil. This would be substantially more ambitious than his previous government’s goal to eliminate illegal deforestation, not deforestation of all kinds.\n\nSpeaking at the UN’s COP27 climate summit on Wednesday in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, Lula told a jam-packed conference room that “Brazil is back to resume its ties with the world,” and there is “no climate security for the world without a protected Amazon, and we will do whatever it takes to have a different vision in the degradation.”\n\nHe also promised to punish those who are responsible for the deforestation in Amazon, and announced a new ministry for indigenous people “so that the indigenous people themselves can present and propose to the government about policies that can derive their survival with dignity and security, peace and sustainability.”\n\nHis remarks were met with huge applause that trickled out of the conference room into the hallway, where people who were not able to get into the crowded room, but eager to hear Lula speak on the climate crisis, watched from their phones.\n\nBut Bolsonaro allies, who continue to control congress, could make climate action much more difficult over the next four years. One of those allies is Ricardo Salles, Bolsonaro’s former environment minister and now a newly elected lawmaker in Brazil’s conservative-leaning congress.\n\nFormer environment minister and Brazilian lawmaker Ricardo Salles argues the best way to protect the Amazon is to make it economically viable for the populations living in and around it. Vasco Cotovio/CNN\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Salles said he and others are willing to work with Lula’s incoming administration on climate goals, but cautioned it should not come at the expense of economic development.\n\n“I was the only guy as minister of environment in the entire history of the ministry who brought these economic questions to the table,” said Salles. During his time as environment minister, the Bolsonaro government often described development and economic activity in the Amazon as vital to longterm sustainability – an approach decried by many environmental activists in the country.\n\nSalles says Brazil will have to work closely now with international allies into order to tap the billions of dollars in climate funds and carbon credits now on offer both by governments and businesses worldwide.\n\nBut climate advocates argue neither Brazil nor the planet can afford the kind of compromises now being advocated by Bolsonaro allies.\n\nIndigenous activist Txai Surui supported Lula da Silva during his latest presidential campaign, but vows to oppose him should his policies go against the environment. Vasco Cotovio/CNN\n\n“We don’t need to destroy to develop. We can do that in harmony with nature. And it’s the indigenous peoples who teach that,” Brazilian indigenous leader Txai Suruí told CNN.\n\nSuruí said she is optimistic Lula’s government will make good on promises to act quickly, despite the economic pressure from not only Bolsonaro allies, but millions in the Amazon whose livelihoods depend on its commercial development.\n\n“Because that agenda — of the Amazon, of climate change, of the environment — it’s a global agenda,” she said. “If Lula does not address it, it won’t just be us, indigenous people, that will be knocking on his door, it’ll be the entire world.”\n\nThe urgency to commit to those goals is not lost on Pinto who says it’s not just Brazil’s future that is at stake.\n\n“We need to understand as a nation that is key for the planet and that decisions we will make will be important for us but also for others,” he says.\n\nThe SOS Mata Atlântica nursery, where hundreds of saplings are grown before being replanted in the wilderness.

Officials say people should skip large family gatherings in favor of scaled-back events. “We all want to see our family at holiday time, and yet this is a special year. This is a year unlike any we’ve ever had,” Alabama State Health Officer Scott Harris said. “Many things maybe could be done virtually, which is not nearly as much fun but certainly safer.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines. Suzanne Judd, an epidemiologist from the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s School of Public Health, said Thanksgiving is particularly problematic because it’s a holiday celebrated by family gatherings indoors. “Gatherings greater than 10 people pose a substantial risk of one of the people being COVID-positive and not knowing,” Judd said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The spread of the coronavirus at the state’s largest prison has accelerated beyond an initial outbreak, with 110 inmates testing positive for the virus as of Monday. Goose Creek Correctional Center first announced a virus outbreak at the facility Nov. 2, when the Alaska Department of Corrections said 22 inmates and five staff members tested positive, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The prison west of Wasilla near Point McKenzie housed 1,317 pretrial and sentenced prisoners as of Monday, department spokeswoman Sarah Gallagher said. Staff are required and inmates are strongly encouraged to wear masks, she said. The outbreak began in one of the prison’s housing units, known as mods. Each mod has 64 prisoners, indicating the outbreak has expanded beyond a single unit, Gallagher said. Each mod continues to operate as a “family unit” in order to minimize the risk of further transmission, Gallagher said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With the state reporting a daily average of 1,900 new COVID-19 cases over the past week, Gov. Doug Ducey has urged residents to be careful. In a video posted Tuesday, Ducey urged Arizona residents to wear face coverings, wash hands, practice social distancing and stay home when sick. “Gatherings of families and friends from outside your household are no safer than going to the grocery store,” he said. Ducey, a Republican, has not implemented a statewide masking requirement, while many local governments in the state have done so. He announced no new virus prevention initiatives in the video posted on social media and his office’s website. He cited past moves that included increasing testing and providing money to hospitals for protective gear, staffing and ventilators. Ducey said he wants to protect public health “keep our economy safely open and moving, We know that both are important to the health and well-being of Arizonans.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations again hit a new high Tuesday, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson resisted calls for new restrictions on businesses or gatherings to combat a surge in coronavirus cases. An outbreak of the virus among state legislators also grew to 11 on Tuesday, with a lawmaker testing positive. The Department of Health reported 24 more people were hospitalized because of COVID-19, bringing the state’s virus hospitalizations to a new high of 810. The state’s confirmed and probable virus cases rose by 1,424 to 124,235. “The numbers aren’t good, the trend is not good, and we have a lot of work to do here in Arkansas and across the nation,” Hutchinson said at his weekly news briefing on the virus. The state’s COVID-19 deaths rose by four to 2,112. The Republican governor said many of the state’s cases are coming from smaller gatherings at homes that he said can’t be regulated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city will study the feasibility of using its enormous convention center as a temporary shelter for the increasing number of homeless people living on the streets. City Councilman Curren Price introduced a motion Tuesday seeking a report on what it would take to transform the 720,000-square-foot LA Convention Center in his downtown district. The property has not been used for conventions since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, the pandemic has forced more people into homelessness, Price said. With more than 60,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, encampments have gone up throughout the region on sidewalks, in empty lots and under freeway overpasses. “We’re in a panic situation along with a pandemic situation. Folks on the streets are just suffering,” Price told the Los Angeles Times. “We have to do a better job of housing individuals who are homeless.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Department of Public Health and Environment has routinely deleted emails related to the coronavirus pandemic even though the state archives has asked that they be saved, a newspaper has found. The Denver Post reports it discovered that emails sent and received by state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy were deleted after the newspaper requested documents. The department said it would provide some records, including emails. But it said emails “from May would have already been auto-deleted unless otherwise preserved, or they were previously deleted by Dr. Herlihy as part of a normal business process,” said Monica Wilkerson, the department’s records and legal services liaison. As of last year, the department deleted most employee emails after 90 days. The policy mirrors similar practices by the state government. The Colorado State Archives posted a notice in June asking agencies to “keep all records related to COVID-19.” Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition Executive Director Jeff Roberts said it is important to keep records so that journalists can report on a crisis affecting the health and safety of residents.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Canaan: More than 350 students and 20 teachers in a wealthy suburb are in quarantine after a new round of coronavirus testing turned up 15 infections, according to the local school district. New Canaan schools on Tuesday reported 13 students and two teachers tested positive, days after all 540 tests of students came back negative, the Stamford Advocate reports. There were also 26 new positive tests last weekend, First Selectman Kevin Moynihan said. “We continue to see cases spread from gatherings, dinner parties, out-of-town caregivers, house cleaners and, not unexpectedly, within families,” Moynihan said. “This rapid case increase over the weekend illustrates how fast community transmission spreads and accelerates.” The most recent testing resulted in quarantines for 213 students at New Canaan High School, 70 at Saxe Middle School and 70 at three elementary schools. People in quarantine are told they must stay home for 14 days.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Attorneys for a cleric say they’ve reached a settlement with Gov. John Carney over the coronavirus restrictions he imposed on worship services. The Rev. Christopher Allan Bullock filed a lawsuit in May claiming Carney’s restrictions were unconstitutional and discriminatory. Carney then rescinded many of the restrictions, and his lawyers argued Bullock’s claims were moot. But Bullock’s attorneys asked for an injunction prohibiting the governor from imposing similar limitations in the future. Lawyers representing the New Castle County pastor and community activist said Wednesday that the settlement requires the governor to treat houses of worship in a neutral manner in any future emergency. Among other things, if certain businesses or activities are considered essential, that definition will include churches. Attorney Thomas Neuberger said the state also agreed to pay the plaintiffs $150,000 in lawyer fees and $7,200 in court costs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. reported 206 new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday – its highest single-day total since late May, WUSA-TV reports. Daily test data lags behind and is only available up to Nov. 7, so it’s unclear what, if any, connection to the weekend’s celebrations these numbers may have. The city is now averaging more than 100 new cases a day for the first time since May 30.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: More than a dozen Miami nurses and front-line health care workers are finally getting a well-deserved break. The group was scheduled for an upcoming, mandatory – aka boring – 48-hour training but was instead surprised with an island vacation to the Florida Keys. Jackson Health System supervisors were asked to choose staff who went above and beyond during the pandemic. Many of the staff, including respiratory therapists and lab techs, have not been able to take any time off during the pandemic to relax or spend time with their loved ones and have been working tirelessly treating COVID-19 patients, the hospital said. The 50 workers were told they had to attend a two-day training, but when they gathered at the hospital Tuesday, they were handed gift boxes with gift certificates. Hawks Cay Resort in the Florida Keys donated two-night stays to its island on Duck Key, surrounded by sparkling waters and swaying palm trees, as part of its Heroes Salute program.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is again hitting a new peak in public high school graduation rates. The state Department of Education said Tuesday that 83.8% of seniors graduated on time in the spring. That’s the highest level recorded since Georgia began calculating according to current methods, which require a student to graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma, and rose from 82% in 2019. The state says part of the increase came from a waiver allowing the state to count students with significant cognitive disabilities, about 1% of students overall, as graduating on time even if they take more than four years to complete high school. Because of the pandemic, many high school students did not have to take end-of-course exams last year, which would have counted for 20% of their overall grade. Most students take the courses that require the exams before their senior year, so it’s unclear whether the lack of tests influenced Georgia’s graduation rates.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Bankruptcies declined in October for the eighth time in 10 months as state unemployment reached a national high of 15.1% and as tourism was in the beginning stage of reopening after a major economic downturn. There were 125 bankruptcy filings in October, a 22.6% decrease from the 162 during the same period in the previous year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Data provided by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Hawaii, showed bankruptcy filings were down 9.8% to 1,274 for the year through October compared to 1,412 during the same period in 2019. Chapter 7 liquidation filings, the most common type of bankruptcy, fell 19.8% in October to 93 from 116 in the year-earlier period. Chapter 13 filings, which allow people with regular income sources to establish installment payment plans to creditors over three to five years, dropped 27.3% to 32 from 44 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge dismissed a case against a woman who was cited for holding a yard sale authorities said violated the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order. Judge Van Valin on Friday dismissed the case brought by officials who said the yard sale was not an “essential business,” The Idaho Statesman reports. Valin ruled the yard sale conducted in April by Christa Thompson of Rathdrum was not a business. Defense attorney Edward Dindinger said in a statement that the judge ruled the language of the stay-at-home order issued in response to the coronavirus pandemic did not apply to Thompson. The Rathdrum Police Department said in April that the event was a “large nonessential yard sale” that filled the front yard and spilled into the back yard of her home. Thompson held the sale “to liquidate her late father-in-law’s estate,” Dindinger said. Thompson faced a possible sentence of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state set another single-day record for coronavirus infections Tuesday, pushing the total number of people who have tested positive in the state since the pandemic began past 500,000. Gov. J.B. Pritzker presented statistics to show that hospitalizations are nearing their spring peak, when the initial wave of infections had officials scrambling for hospital beds and professionals to tend them. State public health officials reported 12,623 newly confirmed cases of the virus, nearly 15% higher than the previous record set Saturday, when cases also topped 12,000. In Chicago, officials reported a daily average of 1,686 new cases, roughly four times higher than a month ago. “There are no signs of slowing,” Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said. Hospitalizations jumped 7.5% in one day to 4,742. The seven-day average of 4,207 in hospital beds is creeping toward the 4,822 average hit May 5.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is continuing its record-setting increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations and new infections, health officials said Tuesday as the state once again surpassed 4,000 new cases and reported 63 more deaths. The newly reported deaths raised Indiana’s pandemic death toll to 4,731, including confirmed and presumed coronavirus infections, the Indiana State Department of Health said in its daily statistics update. The 4,879 infections reported Tuesday were Indiana’s second-highest daily count of newly reported coronavirus cases and marked the sixth straight day the state reported more than 4,000 new cases. Indiana’s seven-day rolling average for newly confirmed cases rose to 4,490, according to Tuesday’s daily update of the state’s coronavirus dashboard. That is the highest level Indiana has seen during the pandemic and more than five times the seven-day rolling average of 858 newly confirmed cases the agency reported Sept. 22.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two more state prisons are reporting outbreaks of coronavirus infections, according to the Iowa Department of Corrections. Recent testing has revealed outbreaks at prisons in Clarinda, where 377 inmates and 16 staff members are positive, and Rockwell City, where 254 inmates and four staff members are positive, a DOC report updated Sunday shows. The Clarinda prison has about 900 inmates, and Rockwell City has 426. The department released data Friday showing an outbreak at the Anamosa prison, and the updated numbers show 485 infected inmates of the 982 inmates at the prison. An additional 50 staff members tested positive. Additional smaller prison outbreaks are reported at Mount Pleasant, where 18 inmates and five staff members are positive, and the women’s prison in Mitchellville, where four inmates and 10 staff members are positive.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s largest public school district, in Wichita, has scrapped plans to allow its middle and high school students to attend some in-person classes, and three counties have imposed new restrictions inspired by the coronavirus pandemic. The moves by local officials come as the state works to expand its overall testing capacity so under a “unified” statewide strategy announced by Gov. Laura Kelly in late September. The strategy calls for regular testing of at-risk populations, including first responders, prison inmates, nursing home residents, and K-12 students and staff, as well as more aggressive testing in virus hot spots. The state plans to spend at least $53 million in federal coronavirus relief funds on contracts with private laboratories. But Kelly said Tuesday during a Statehouse news conference: “It won’t work if people are not abiding by the other safety protocols, particularly wearing masks and avoiding large gatherings.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentuckians should avoid large Thanksgiving gatherings as a safeguard to protect extended family and friends from a surging COVID-19 outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. Instead, in-person get-togethers should be limited to people from the same household, he said. While the health guidelines might be tough to swallow, the guidance can save lives as Kentucky struggles with its worst outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the Democratic governor said. “That person that you may think that you will really miss sitting across the table from you this year, I want to make sure is across the table from you next year,” Beshear said at a news conference. “And this right now is the most dangerous time we’ve had in this virus.” The Thanksgiving guidance came as the state reported 2,120 new virus cases – its highest total for a Tuesday and fifth-highest day overall, Beshear said. He also reported 14 more virus-related deaths.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Shoppers will see state sales taxes suspended for two days this month, under a bill passed by lawmakers in their latest special session and signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, a Gonzales Republican, sponsored the measure to help residents and businesses recovering from hurricanes Laura and Delta and coping with the coronavirus pandemic. The state sales tax holiday will be held Nov. 20-21. Louisiana’s 4.45% state sales tax will not be charged on the first $2,500 of a purchase. The holiday doesn’t cover car, truck and other vehicle purchases. And it doesn’t apply to local sales taxes. The state is estimated to lose $4.5 million in sales tax collections because of the tax holiday, according to a nonpartisan financial analysis of the bill.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers plan to hold their first legislative sessions at the Augusta Civic Center instead of the Statehouse as coronavirus cases grow. The city-owned, 49,000-square-foot civic center, about 3 miles from the Statehouse, is typically used for events such as concerts, agriculture conventions and conferences. It would provide more space than the Statehouse, and that would make it easier to observe social distancing, a spokeswoman for outgoing Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon told the Portland Press Herald. The full Legislature last met in March. The top priority for lawmakers will be crafting a new, two-year state budget at a time when Maine’s finances have been stressed by the pandemic. New Hampshire lawmakers took a similar approach in June when they met in the University of New Hampshire Whittemore Center Arena.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will reduce indoor operations for bars and restaurants from 75% to 50% in response to rising coronavirus cases and increased hospitalizations, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday. The new limits took effect Wednesday. “Last week, I said that the warning lights were starting to blink on the dashboard and that it appeared we were approaching a critical turning point in the fight. Today, I’m reporting that we have now crossed over into the danger zone,” Hogan said at a news conference. “Too many residents and businesses have COVID fatigue and have begun letting their guard down.” State health officials also have issued a public health advisory effective immediately to strongly discourage indoor gatherings of 25 people or more at family gatherings or house parties. Contact tracing data has shown an increase in cases resulting from such gatherings.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases could force the state to once again open field hospitals to care for a possible overflow of patients as intensive care units fill up, Gov. Charlie Baker warned Tuesday. Hospitals are also prepared to make an additional 400 beds available for COVID-19 patients by converting acute care beds to ICU beds to deal with an expected rise in cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus during the fall and winter, Baker said at a press conference. “The trends obviously are going in the wrong direction and show no signs of changing,” he said. When and where field hospitals might be set up depends on space and need, Baker said. Massachusetts residents had done a good job controlling the virus after an initial spike in the spring but are getting careless and allowing the virus to get a toehold again, leading to a second surge, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state on Tuesday posted a record number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases, near 6,500, and reported 59 deaths within the previous 24 hours – its deadliest day in six months. COVID-19, which subsided over the summer after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer imposed sweeping stay-at-home and other restrictions, has rebounded this fall. Asked if she might again order people to stay home, the Democrat said she was talking with the state health department about potential next steps. Mask requirements and gathering limits remain in effect despite a “confusing” state Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a law she used to issue orders, she said. Whitmer said she will not see extended family in person for Thanksgiving and said it is “inherently dangerous” to have more than one household in an enclosed space without ventilation and open windows. The state’s latest average positivity rate is 9.4%, up from 4.9% two weeks ago.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials reported a record 56 new deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said. Walz told Minnesota Public Radio the daily report shows positivity rates above 20%, an important measure of how fast the disease is spreading. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Minnesota has nearly doubled over the past two weeks from just under 7% on Oct. 27 to nearly 13% on Tuesday, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. The governor made the comments a day after warning Minnesotans that the state is approaching the worst phase of the pandemic and that conditions will get dramatically worse unless people start changing their behavior. He said it won’t be unusual for people to open their newspapers and see 50 to 60 new deaths. “This is just inevitable if we do not change our behaviors and take some mitigation efforts.” Walz told MPR. Minnesota’s previous record was 36 deaths, reported Friday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that he, his wife and their three daughters are in isolation after the youngest tested positive for the coronavirus. Maddie Reeves, 8, attends a private elementary school in Jackson. The Republican governor said in a social media post: “She feels OK, but could still use prayers! Please pray for her momma too!” Reeves also said everyone in his family is being tested for the virus. The governor announced his daughter’s infection shortly after he canceled his coronavirus news conference that was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. An executive order issued by Reeves requires children and teachers to wear masks in public and private schools. Sixteen of Mississippi’s 82 counties have been under a mask mandate that was set to expire Wednesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Twenty-eight employees of an election board have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent weeks, and a director believes they most likely got infected from voters, though local health officials aren’t convinced. The Jackson County Election Board’s Republican director, Tammy Brown, said Tuesday that eight full-time and 20 part-time employees tested positive for the virus in the past 21/ 2 weeks. Most are doing well and recovering at home, but two are hospitalized, including one in intensive care, Brown said. Jackson County is Missouri’s second-largest county, behind St. Louis County. While Kansas City is part of Jackson County, the city has its own election board. The Jackson County board handled votes cast by nearly 200,000 people. Jackson County Health Department spokeswoman Kayla Parker said community transmission is so widespread that determining the source would be next to impossible.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, the state’s chief epidemiologist said the spread of the coronavirus has stressed medical services to the brink, and he predicted the situation will get worse as winter sets in. “We’re kind of preparing for the worst here,” Jim Murphy said. “We have pretty spooky numbers for COVID, going into a fall respiratory season. It’s not a position that anybody would like to be in.” Murphy said the increase in cases across the state has led to a shortage in health care workers, in addition to a shortage in hospital beds. “You can have a lot of beds. But if you don’t have the staff to support those beds, that’s a problem,” he said. U.S. officials have dispatched a team of nearly 30 physicians, nurses, paramedics and other health care workers to Montana’s largest city. The National Disaster Medical System team arrived Friday and will work in Billings for two weeks, The Billings Gazette reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to set records with the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, and health care providers expect that to continue because of the recent surge of cases. Cliff Robertson, CEO of CHI Health, said his group of 14 hospitals in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa is preparing for COVID-19 cases to keep increasing over the next three to four weeks. He said COVID-19 patients already account for about 25% of all the patients in his hospitals. “We highly encourage folks to take this seriously because … this virus is rampant in our community right now,” Robertson said. The steady increase in cases raises the concern that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed, said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases specialist at Nebraska Medicine in Omaha. “In three weeks’ time, our hospitals will be overwhelmed, and we will no longer be able to deliver optimal and effective care for COVID, and we will also no longer be able to deliver appropriate care for everyone who comes in with a heart attack or a stroke.”\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Although the coronavirus is spreading at record rates, the state will not need to tighten restrictions if individuals commit to preventive measures like mask-wearing and working from home, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday. For the third time in three weeks, the governor referred to “alarming trends” and said Nevada was almost at the point where stricter measures would be necessary. But unlike in the past, when he has hesitated to commit to benchmarks or timelines, he provided a deadline: If Nevada doesn’t show signs that it’s containing the virus in two weeks, he will be forced to tighten the state’s prevention measures. “If you don’t have to go out, don’t go out. Reduce your time in public to what is necessary, and limit any and all exposures to those outside your household,” Sisolak said. “Think about changes like ordering groceries for delivery instead of going into the store, or picking up dinner curbside.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAmherst: Officials say an Election Day voter at a polling place tested positive for the coronavirus, but the town had safety precautions in place. WMUR-TV reports town officials in Amherst said they were notified by the state that a voter tested positive for the virus. They said the infected person was at Souhegan High School between 10:15 a.m. and 11:15 a.m. on Election Day. Amherst town moderator Steve Coughlan said it wasn’t crowded. The town is now contacting election volunteers who may have had direct contact with the voter. Coughlan said plexiglass shields separated voters from election workers. Volunteers had to wear masks, but voters did not. “I think we provided a very safe environment,” Coughlan said. “It would be crazy for us to have thought that there would be zero infected voters out of everyone coming in. So we took precautions that were appropriate.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The family of the state’s first law enforcement officer to die from COVID-19 has filed a claim to sue Hudson County, saying he did not receive any masks or other personal protective equipment while working at the county jail. Bernard Waddell Sr., a corrections officer with 32 years of experience, was forced to work within close proximity to inmates who he believed were infected, said family lawyer Paul da Costa. “Up to his last day on the job, he was not provided with any PPE,” da Costa said. The virus devastated the jail in Kearny. Along with Waddell, it claimed the lives of two nurses, a commissary director and another corrections officer. Waddell, 56, died April 1. The Jersey City resident is survived by his wife and two sons. Around the time of his death, New Jersey was experiencing a severe shortage of face masks and gowns, prompting hospitals to ask the public for donations.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Santa Fe Public Schools is ending a short-lived soft opening of in-person learning as the coronavirus pandemic hobbles the state. “I am announcing today a hiatus of our volunteer hybrid program due to the rampant rise in COVID-19 cases in Santa Fe County and New Mexico and SFPS’ philosophy to always prioritize the safety and well being of our students and staff,” Superintendent Veronica Garcia said. The volunteers included 58 teachers who went to work despite the pandemic, enabling about 200 elementary students to attend school in person at least part of the week. The program started Oct. 26 and will hold the last day of classes Nov. 20. “If parents are able to keep their children home next week, I urge them to do so,” Garcia said. The announcement comes as the state sets records for COVID-19 cases amid dwindling space in hospitals and as students are failing classes at much higher rates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants, bars and gyms will have to close at 10 p.m. across the state in the latest effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday. He said people will also be barred from hosting private gatherings with more than 10 people. Cuomo said the new restrictions, which go into effect Friday, are necessary because new coronavirus infections have been traced to those types of activities. Businesses can reopen each morning. “Bars, restaurants, gyms, house parties – that’s where it’s coming from, primarily,” Cuomo said. The governor spoke as rates of coronavirus infection continued to rise. He said 1,628 people were hospitalized across the state for COVID-19 on Tuesday, and 21 people died. “What we’re seeing is what they predicted for months,” Cuomo said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state will remain paused in its current reopening plan for an additional three weeks, with indoor gathering limits reduced from 25 people to 10 people starting Friday. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced the tightening of gathering restrictions during a Tuesday news conference. The decision not to further reopen ahead of Thanksgiving comes at a time when the state is concerned about increases it has seen in COVID-19 cases and the percentage of coronavirus tests coming back positive. “The science shows that the transmission of this virus is much greater indoors, and the more people are gathered, the easier this virus can spread,” Cooper said. Cooper, who won reelection last week, noted that churches and restaurants would be unaffected by the updated guidance. The executive order will remain in place until Dec. 4.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state continues to lead the nation in daily new coronavirus cases per capita, with 1 in 83 residents testing positive in just the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. In the past two weeks, there were 2,265 new cases per 100,000 people in North Dakota, which ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project. State health officials reported a dozen new deaths due to complications from the coronavirus Wednesday, down from a record 30 deaths Tuesday. The deaths reported Wednesday increased total fatalities to 696 since the pandemic began. The report said 123 deaths have occurred in November, matching all of September. October has been the deadliest month so far in North Dakota, with 292 deaths. State health officials reported 1,039 new coronavirus cases Wednesday and a daily positivity rate of more than 18% for the second straight day.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine beseeched Ohioans on Wednesday to take the surging coronavirus spread seriously, issuing new orders on mask enforcement in businesses, limiting gatherings across the state, and threatening to close bars, restaurants and fitness centers if cases continue to rise. “Throughout our country’s history, each generation has faced unique sacrifices,” DeWine said in the statewide address. “Today, we all must do something far less dramatic but very important: Wear a mask so your friends and family members can live.” DeWine shifted the authority of mask enforcement from the local counties to the state. The Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation will be responsible for inspections across the 88 counties. If a business receives more than one violation, it will have to close for 24 hours. “We must do this to protect our front-line workers,” DeWine said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of people hospitalized with confirmed and probable coronavirus in the state shattered the previous one-day record by nearly 200 on Wednesday, and more than 2,100 new cases were reported, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The department reported 1,248 hospitalizations to surpass the previous record of 1,055 set last Thursday. The department reported 2,177 new cases and 19 additional deaths since Tuesday for totals of 142,334 cases and 1,470 deaths since the pandemic began in March. The true number of infections is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the seven-day average of the percentage of people who tested positive has risen from 9% to nearly 16% in Oklahoma, and the average number of new cases each day increased from 1265.8 per day to 1,947.3.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown and state health officials warned Tuesday of the capacity challenges facing hospitals as COVID-19 case counts continue to spike. The Oregon Health Authority recorded a record 285 confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospitals Tuesday – a 57% increase in just the past week and an 83% increase in the past four weeks. “There are limitations to what Oregon’s health care system can handle,” said Dana Hargunani, the health authority’s chief medical officer. “Even with regional planning and the hard work of all of our hospital partners, we cannot handle ever-growing high daily case counts and widespread hospitalizations.” Currently out of Oregon’s 703 listed intensive care unit beds, 27% are available, and about 18% of non-ICU adult hospital beds in the state are available, based on data on from the health authority’s website. “Our fear that this virus would spread out of control as the colder months set in is now becoming a frightening reality,” Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city’s public school students will continue to attend classes virtually for the foreseeable future, district officials announced Tuesday. The announcement came on the same day Philadelphia public health officials saw a peak in confirmed virus cases and increased hospitalizations. The school district had planned to begin bringing back younger students for a hybrid in-person instruction model starting Nov. 30, with plans to phase in instruction for students with complex instructional needs and then older students next. “We hope to see these students back in school before the spring,” Philadelphia district Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. said, adding that it would ultimately depend on health experts and infection trends. About one-third of parents with students who would have been eligible to return had opted for in-person, part-time instruction that would have put students in classrooms two days a week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Employees of the state Senate are being told to work from home after three workers tested positive for the coronavirus, state officials said. The Senate’s roughly 50 workers were instructed to start working remotely Monday after three staffers tested positive over the weekend, The Providence Journal reports. They were told to work remotely for two weeks. The directive came from Gov. Gina Raimondo. Senate spokesman Greg Pare said the Senate president is “following that guidance and wants to do all he can to keep Senate staff members safe.” The House said it has no plans to shift to remote work. The new cases in the Senate were reported as the General Assembly looks for ways to gather for its first full sessions since July. Democratic Senate President Dominick Ruggerio previously said he is exploring whether meetings can be held at the Rhode Island Convention Center.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials in the state’s largest school district say the number of students who received an F in at least one class tripled this year, as the district adjusted learning because of the coronavirus pandemic. First-quarter report cards show a little more than 16,000 students in Greenville County Schools had an F. That compares to roughly 5,300 students with at least one failing grade in the first quarter last year. The pandemic has limited in-person teaching for the district’s 75,000 students, and Associate Superintendent of Academics Jeff McCoy said that likely was a factor in the jump in Fs. He also cited the stress of the crisis on families and the emergency shutdown of schools in the spring. Still, the district wasn’t expecting such a big increase in the number of struggling students. McCoy said the report cards show a much larger proportion of virtual students are receiving failing grades compared to in-person students.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The mayor cast the tie-breaking vote that defeated a proposed mask mandate in the state’s largest city Tuesday night. After more than two hours of public comment, Mayor Paul TenHaken rejected the mandate after the City Council tied 4-4 on the ordinance. The mandate would have required face coverings to be worn by people in most indoor public places where 6-foot social distancing was not achievable. Violations carried a $50 fine. “I believe the small uptick we’ll see in compliance is not worth the community division that this will create,” TenHaken said as he ended debate. Councilor Greg Neitzert said he did not want to live in a city where people are calling the police because someone isn’t wearing a mask. “It’s not just about health,” Neitzert said. “We also have to look at principles.” The Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce opposed it. Several faith leaders in the city supported the mandate.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that he’s looking to include “meaningful” teacher pay raises in next year’s budget despite facing financial crunches brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lee had originally proposed funneling an additional $117 million to K-12 teacher salaries earlier this year before the virus outbreak began rippling across the state. If approved, the starting minimum annual salary for teachers would have increased from $36,000 to $40,000 over the next two years. Yet months later, Lee was forced to strip the teacher funding boost, as well as many other budget initiatives, as officials braced for funding shortfalls. However, Tennessee’s revenues have come in slightly higher than originally projected over the past three months, allowing Lee’s administration to remain slightly optimistic that it will be able to fund some new measures rather than have to dip into rainy day funds.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state has become the first with more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases as the nation continues to face a surge of infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University early Wednesday. The nation’s second-most populous state has recorded 1,010,364 coronavirus cases with 19,337 deaths since the pandemic began in early March, according to the count on the Johns Hopkins website. Texas recorded 10,865 new cases Tuesday, setting a new daily record that surpassed by 74 cases an old mark set July 15, state officials said. According to state figures Tuesday, an estimated 132,146 cases are active, the most since Aug. 17, and 6,170 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, the most since Aug. 18. There were 94 new deaths Tuesday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Meanwhile, cases of the coronavirus are surging in the Laredo area, health officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A group of teachers has organized an event to encourage educators across the state to call in sick and use the day off to get tested for the coronavirus amid a surge in confirmed infection cases. “There are no testing requirements for teachers or students currently,” Granite School District teacher Lindsay Plummer said. Some teachers believe the “test out” planned for Thursday will prompt state leaders to do more to limit the spread of COVID-19 and increase safety protocols in classrooms, FOX13 reports. Plummer said the group was inspired to act following remarks made by Republican Gov. Gary Herbert on Sunday, when he put in place a statewide mask mandate. “The goal of doing something like this is we want to push them to do more,” she said. The Utah Education Association said it is aware of event but is urging teachers to be patient. Herbert’s office has said all teachers have universal access to testing.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state on Tuesday suspended a program that allowed people from across the Northeast to visit Vermont without quarantining if they come from a county with a low rate of coronavirus infection. Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that the number of counties eligible – listed on a map that uses red, orange and green to indicate eligibility – has continued to shrink. As of Tuesday only two counties between Maine and Ohio were listed as green. “The fact is, along with social gatherings, travel to and from other states without the proper quarantine continues to be one of the common denominators in our rising case counts,” Scott said. Essential travel – such as work, school, medical care, personal safety, shared child custody or buying groceries – is not affected, but people should only do what they need to do and then return home, he said. Vermont determined eligible counties as those with virus rates of less than 400 cases per million residents.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, Gov. Ralph Northam on Tuesday announced plans to significantly increase statewide testing capacity and to launch a media campaign in southwest Virginia, which has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past month. The moves came three days after Virginia reported 2,103 new cases – its biggest single-day increase in new cases since the start of the pandemic. On Tuesday, the state reported 1,435 new cases. The state’s seven-day moving average of new cases is 1,462. The seven-day testing positivity rate has also climbed from just under 5% a few weeks ago to 6.2% on Tuesday. Since the start of the pandemic, the state has recorded a total of 194,192 cases, with 3,726 deaths. Northam said he is focusing on mitigation efforts and continuing to encourage people to wear masks and practice social distancing. He said he is not currently considering ordering new restrictions.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two hospitals near the city are struggling with COVID-19 outbreaks within the facilities. The Auburn Medical Center reported at least five employees and eight patients tested positive for the coronavirus, after an outbreak on a fourth-floor unit. The hospital said in a statement Tuesday that one patient died after the outbreak was detected late last week, The Seattle Times reports. The MultiCare hospital system, which owns the hospital, tested all 40 patients in the unit and 212 staffers who had worked there in the two-week period before the first positive test was reported, officials said. At St. Michael Medical Center in Bremerton, at least six people have been infected since early November. CHI Franciscan, the hospital system that owns St. Michael, announced Tuesday that four patients and two employees have been infected to date. State health officials have reported 350 outbreaks in health care settings, including hospitals, since Oct. 24, a statewide outbreak report said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a new high of 642 coronavirus cases Wednesday and seven deaths as the pandemic continued its march into rural enclaves. There are 277 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, slightly down from the peak of 290 last week. A total of 553 deaths have been linked to COVID-19. Virus-related deaths have increased 45% in the past month. The daily positivity rate is up to 5.9%, the highest it has been in about two months. “The enemy is at our borders, and the enemy is coming at us right now,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a press briefing. Twenty-five counties had the most severe designation of virus spread, with 25 or more cases per 100,000 residents. Justice said all options are on the table for bringing new travel and business restrictions, but nothing is planned yet. “Legally, I can’t go out and start arresting people” for not wearing masks, Justice said in urging people to follow guidelines and get tested for the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers renewed his pleas Tuesday for people to stay home to avoid the coronavirus in an unusual prime-time speech hours after the state set new records for infections and deaths. The governor announced he was advising people to stay in their houses and businesses to allow people to work remotely, requiring masks, and limiting the number of people in stores and offices. He said projections show that if nothing changes, deaths could double to 5,000 by January. Evers has been imploring people to stay home and wear masks for months during twice-weekly afternoon news conferences to little avail. This time his office streamed his remarks live on his Facebook page and YouTube channel. “So I want to be clear tonight: Each day this virus goes unchecked is a setback for our economic recovery,” Evers said. Republicans and their conservative allies have worked to block every Evers initiative to stop the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The son of a state representative who opposed COVID-19 public restrictions said his father was positive for the coronavirus when he died. Roy Edwards, 66, died Nov. 2 at Wyoming Medical Center in Casper after being hospitalized for more than a week with illness that was not immediately disclosed, The Gillette News Record reports. Edwards continued to oppose public restrictions resulting from the pandemic during his recent campaign to retain his House seat. He was reelected the day after he died. Mitch Edwards said his father initially experienced minor virus symptoms. He was told by a medical professional that he had sinusitis, an inflammation of the sinuses, and did not need to be tested for COVID-19. Roy Edwards was not advised to quarantine, but he did so as a a precaution, Mitch Edwards said. His symptoms worsened, and he had trouble breathing Oct. 23, when he again sought medical attention.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/11/29/hepatitis-c-in-new-england-how-state-medicaid-covid-hurt-public-health-viral-treatment-cure-hep-c/8236317001/", "title": "Hepatitis C in New England: What to know, obstacles to the cure", "text": "Harriet Callahan was caught completely by surprise.\n\nWhile visiting a doctor for arthritis a few years ago, a routine blood test revealed she had hepatitis C, one of the deadliest infectious diseases in the United States. Callahan, in her 70s, was told it was likely the viral infection had been living silently in her bloodstream for decades.\n\nShe doesn't know where she contracted it. Was it in her teens when she received several blood transfusions after a car accident? Or from occasional drug use during her \"hippie\" days?\n\nAll these years later, it didn't really matter. The retired medical and legal secretary living in Hingham, Massachusetts was shocked — she'd shown no symptoms of the infection, which can lead to liver cancer and cirrhosis and contributed to upwards of 14,000 deaths in the U.S. in 2020.\n\n\"It was hard to deal with,\" said Callahan, 74, \"knowing all these years I had it.\"\n\nAfter two rounds of direct-acting antiviral treatment through the Brockton Neighborhood Health Center, Callahan was considered cured. Today she is \"100% pleased\" to be rid of it.\n\nBut even before taking her first pill, Callahan — on a Medicare prescription drug plan — said she was \"ready to go home and live with it\" when she saw the price tag — up to $30,000 per treatment round for the most common direct-acting antivirals. And she had two.\n\nCallahan received a grant from the Patient Access Network Foundation to help cover the costs not paid for by insurance. And while she was cured, her story offers a daunting glimpse of the red tape that keeps people with hepatitis C from getting healthy.\n\nWhen revolutionary direct-acting antivirals started to debut on the market between 2011 and 2014 and were later proven to cure hepatitis C 90% of the time, they sported a list price around $94,500, or $1,000 a day in some cases. States didn't want to dole out the money, concerned about the chunk of Medicaid funding hepatitis C treatment would take up alone.\n\nSo state Medicaid programs implemented restrictions such as prior authorization, constraints around substance use and special pharmacy/physician requirements — barriers to treatment that did years of damage, experts say. For years in which low-income people could have been cured of hepatitis C, they were instead faced with administrative roadblocks and labyrinthine regulations.\n\nDr. Francis Collins, former director of the National Institutes of Health and currently acting science adviser to President Joe Biden, said direct-acting antivirals — the most common being Harvoni, Epclusa and Mavyret — are some of the most exciting medical developments of the last decade. The drugs have the ability to cure the most common bloodborne disease, and one of the most deadly, with 8-12 weeks of pills.\n\nDespite a proven treatment, people are still dying.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2016 and 2020, the U.S. saw more than 80,000 deaths with hepatitis C listed as a cause. That data doesn't include undocumented immigrant or fetal deaths.\n\nIn the year 2020 alone, across all six New England states, approximately 467 people died with hepatitis C named on their death certificate.\n\nAn analysis by the USA TODAY Network found that hepatitis C treatment rates vary significantly across New England's state Medicaid programs and have actually fallen since 2018 and 2019 in all states except Maine, the last in the region to expand Medicaid in 2019.\n\nThe region's death rates vary dramatically, too. Federal and state data shows Rhode Island and Vermont had the highest death rates related to hepatitis C in New England between 2016 and 2020 and most years both states were higher than the national average. Maine and Connecticut had the lowest death rates in the region.\n\nOfficials have attributed the recent decline in treatment largely to the COVID pandemic which interrupted pathways to health care, though people with hepatitis C have faced challenges in accessing the cure long before the public health crisis.\n\nThe numbers paint a revealing picture that the region, and more broadly the country, isn't making the necessary progress to eliminate hepatitis C as a public health problem by the World Health Organization's 2030 goal.\n\nCDC study shows:Fewer than a third of insured Americans with hepatitis C receive timely treatment\n\nWhat is hepatitis C and how is it spread?\n\nHepatitis C is a viral infection spread primarily through contact with blood and blood products. Symptoms can include bleeding and bruising easily, fatigue, nausea, poor appetite, jaundice and dark-colored urine. Some people never show symptoms and can ultimately clear the virus.\n\nBut in the chronic phase, hepatitis C can cause cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure. According to the CDC, more than half of people who become infected with hepatitis C experience a long-term, chronic infection.\n\nBefore doctors were able to screen and test for hepatitis C, blood transfusions were one of the most common ways to spread the virus — one of the complex reasons so many \"Baby Boomers'\" are infected with it. Boomers, defined as people born between 1946 to 1964, make up three-quarters of Americans chronically infected with the virus, according to the CDC.\n\nIn the early 1990s, developments in testing nearly eliminated transfusion-related infections. Today, injection drug users are most commonly at risk for contracting hepatitis C, specifically through repetitive use of needles and other drug-related materials. It's estimated more than 50% of people who inject drugs have the viral infection.\n\nPregnant women with hepatitis C can also pass it to their baby. Other less-frequent ways of contracting the virus include illicit tattooing, needle-stick injuries in health care settings, and sometimes sexual activity in higher-risk populations.\n\n\"The whole human family all over the world is touched by hepatitis C,\" said Dr. Lynn Taylor, a Rhode Island expert in hepatitis C prevention and treatment and director of the RI Defeats Hepatitis C program. \"We need to treat people with dignity and respect. When we get people cured, the relief of that stigma and that shame can be profound.\"\n\nTaylor said everybody knows someone with hepatitis C, whether they know it or not. A loved one, co-worker, neighbor. Between 2013 and 2016, an estimated 2.4 million people in the U.S. were living with hepatitis C, but the true number could be much higher since many people go untested.\n\nPublic health officials in March and April of 2020 issued significant updates to hepatitis C screening recommendations, but the announcement was largely lost in the COVID frenzy. The CDC now recommends universal hepatitis C screening at least once in a lifetime for all adults 18 years and older and for all pregnant people during each pregnancy.\n\nThe Biden administration is working on unveiling a comprehensive national hepatitis C plan, one that would include the CDC, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Indian Health Service, Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\n\"The only way we can treat our way out of the hepatitis C epidemic in the U.S., driven by injection drug use, is diminish the infectivity of the transmitting population,\" said Taylor. \"We need to prioritize and target people who inject drugs.\"\n\nWhy hasn't New England made more gains in hepatitis C treatment?\n\nTracking by the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation at Harvard Law School and National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable shows that Medicaid restrictions for hepatitis C treatment remain across much of the country today.\n\nSeventy-three percent of states currently require prior authorization before Medicaid beneficiaries can access treatment, and 36% still put restrictions in place for those actively using drugs, despite drug users being at disproportionate risk for contracting the virus, according to the 2022 State of Hep C Report.\n\nMore:States make secret deals with drugmakers to fight hepatitis C – and taxpayers pick up the tab\n\nThe federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has previously told states that some of those restrictions violate federal law, and yet they persist. CMS has not released any updated guidance for states since 2015.\n\nDr. Arthur Kim, director of the Viral Hepatitis Clinic in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, said populations that acquire and live with hepatitis C are more likely to be on Medicaid than private insurance, making Medicaid a good barometer of how the country as a whole is making progress, or not, against the virus.\n\nTreatment roadblocks in state Medicaid programs pose extremely large barriers to eliminating hepatitis C completely, experts say, because the lion's share of those infected have insurance through them.\n\nIn New England, the region is split. Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire have since lifted nearly all Medicaid restrictions, while Vermont, Maine and Connecticut maintain prior authorization requirements and other various stipulations.\n\nIt's too soon to tell if lifting some of the major restrictions will increase the number of people taking direct-acting antivirals in New England, though other studies have found that hepatitis C treatment improves with such policy changes. Massachusetts and New Hampshire, for example, just lifted prior authorization in 2022, and Rhode Island in 2021.\n\nNew England as a region has made progress in recent years on the Medicaid front, perhaps more so than other areas of the U.S., but it hasn't always been that way. Kim said despite being a \"fairly liberal place compared to the rest of the country,\" for a long time, New England states saw hepatitis C as \"something not to treat widely because of the cost.\"\n\n\"Many payers were not willing to pay for everyone they were covering all at once,\" said Kim. \"They saw very large dollar signs and said, 'We need to restrict this....' It really limited the impact of these highly promising agents.\"\n\n\"Hepatitis C: State of Medicaid Access,\" a tracking effort by the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation of Harvard Law School and National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable, shows how New England's approach has changed over the last five years. In 2017, Maine, New Hampshire and Rhode Island all had substance use and sobriety restrictions in place, for example. In Maine, someone had to be six months sober before becoming eligible for treatment, while New Hampshire and Rhode Island required someone undergo substance use screening and counseling.\n\nAll of New England has since eliminated Medicaid restrictions for substance users.\n\nVermont and Rhode Island once both reserved Medicaid coverage of hepatitis C treatment only for people with F2 and F3 stages of fibrosis, respectively, designations that signal severity of liver scarring. Both states dropped those restrictions by 2018.\n\nKim said states started to see a drop in numbers on their liver transplant lists as Medicaid restrictions were shelved.\n\nSuzanne Davies, clinical fellow at the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation, said a \"huge improvement\" in New England is the recent removal of prior authorization in Massachusetts (2022), Rhode Island (2021) and New Hampshire (2022). That administrative process, she said, can be a significant barrier to tapping into direct-acting antivirals.\n\n\"Now in those states, it's as simple as the doctor prescribing whatever the medication is and the person going to the pharmacy,\" said Davies. \"But because it's such a recent change, one thing I've heard many times from providers and advocates is it's not enough to just remove a restriction. In the wake of a state Medicaid program making a really big change to their program, it's important they make sure all of the providers are aware of the change and what they should be doing now.\"\n\nAnd yet, noted Davies, there's still another layer of complication. Many state Medicaid programs contract with managed care organizations, which each have their own set of requirements. While prior authorization has been dropped in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, she said, not all of the states' managed care organizations have made the change themselves.\n\nTaylor pointed to what she perceives as \"administrative waste\" associated with hepatitis C treatment restrictions.\n\n\"How much time do we spend on these bureaucratic tasks rather than the patients?\" she said. \"We have to simplify and streamline the pathway. We have a very arduous pathway. We put people through a lot.\"\n\nHow well are New England states treating hepatitis C patients on Medicaid?\n\nThe USA TODAY Network submitted information requests to each New England state Medicaid program to track direct-acting antiviral treatment for hepatitis C patients over the last five years.\n\nThe data provided reflected a national problem with gathering uniform numbers on hepatitis C.\n\nAn October report released by HepVu and the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors found that one-third of U.S. jurisdictions in 2021 did not have a full-time viral hepatitis surveillance employee, and only 55% of jurisdictions could produce an annual surveillance summary.\n\nIn New England, state Medicaid programs offered different definitions of treatment, for example. Some provided numbers of prescriptions per year, while others provided the number of unique individuals treated per year. Some states struggled to calculate the total number of Medicaid beneficiaries with a hepatitis C diagnosis.\n\nIn its response, MassHealth − Massachusetts' Medicaid program − noted the data doesn't necessarily reflect someone being cured of hepatitis C, but rather simply their use of direct-acting antivirals. \"Some members may require longer treatment durations, and completing a course of therapy does not indicate a clinical cure (whichneeds to be confirmed via lab tests),\" the state's response said.\n\nIn 2020:Two Americans, British scientist win Nobel medicine award for hepatitis C virus discovery\n\nComparing the states' treatment rates proved difficult, but the USA TODAY Network was able to identify overall trends in each state between 2017-2021. While the number of Medicaid beneficiaries in New England with a hepatitis C diagnosis has declined, data shows, so has the rate at which states have been treating people.\n\nGenerally speaking, New England states saw their biggest treating years in 2017, 2018 and 2019, but nearly all have fallen off since. According to the American Association of the Study of Liver Disease, the nation saw an overall decline in the number of patients with hepatitis C who initiated treatment between 2015 and 2020.\n\nMassachusetts, for example, went from treating 3,763 hepatitis C patients in 2017 to 1,708 in 2021. Connecticut went from treating 1,588 patients in 2018 to treating 726 in 2021.\n\nThough 2022 isn't finalized, preliminary data shows Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut are all on track to treat the fewest number of patients in six years.\n\n\"Our team thinks we may be seeing a combination of incomplete 2022 data, claims submission lag and the need for patients to catch up on many areas of routine medical care that may have lapsed during the pandemic,\" said Kerri White, spokeswoman for Rhode Island Medicaid. \"We are ramping up our (2023-2027) Hepatitis Elimination Plan. The next step of our plan is direct conversations with providers, to remind them of who to test and how to test. We also will be offering presentations to hospitals, group practices and medical staff meetings, as well as print materials for providers and patients.\"\n\nNew Hampshire and Vermont saw the least fluctuation in the number of people treated each year since 2017. And Maine actually saw a large increase that proved steady through COVID, despite still having several Medicaid coverage restrictions in place such as prior authorization, required consultation with a specialist and prohibition of retreatment if someone is infected more than once.\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, Maine was treating 205 and 234 people per year, respectively, and in 2019, jumped to treating 495 people. The state has since consistently treated more than 450 people each year.\n\nThat's because 2019 was the year Maine expanded Medicaid, the last state in New England to do so.\n\nJackie Farwell, spokesperson for MaineCare, the state's Medicaid program, said, \"Many MaineCare members who enrolled early on through the expansion had multiple chronic conditions, including hepatitis C, and were able to access treatment with their coverage.\"\n\nIn 2020, Maine also saw the nation’s highest new hepatitis C case rate, according to the CDC.\n\nCDC data from 2016 to 2020 shows people with hepatitis C living in Vermont and Rhode Island are dying at higher rates than the rest of New England. During 2017-2019, Rhode Island consistently saw the highest death rate in the region, while Vermont had the highest in 2020.\n\n'The business of medicine out-ruled public health'\n\nDespite the resources and wealth at its disposal, the U.S. remains leaps and bounds away from a society where hepatitis C is eradicated, said Taylor. She pointed to countries such as Nigeria, Egypt, Switzerland and Portugal that are on their way to eliminating the virus.\n\n\"We're now years into this therapeutic revolution (with direct-acting antivirals), and that should have been a transformative moment where we really came together and said, 'We're going to cure everyone,'\" said Taylor. \"Unfortunately the first thing that happened, the business of medicine out-ruled public health.\"\n\nTaylor called the country's hepatitis C response \"the posterchild for health care disparities,\" one in which minorities, Indigenous people, the homeless, incarcerated and substance users are disproportionately hurt.\n\n\"We've had a patchwork response and instead of saying this is an opportunity in the long-run to save money, even if you don't care about health and wellness and suffering, Medicaid responded by saying, 'We're going to ration treatment and make up rules. We're going to decide who's worthy and who's not.'\"\n\nWiping out hepatitis C is going to take a multi-pronged approach. Experts cite dropping insurance barriers, harm reduction, opioid agonist therapy, and co-locating treatment in easy-to-access places as all critical to the fight against the infection. But instead, said Taylor, the country is addressing it in silos, making someone's likelihood of dying from the virus dependent on socioeconomic status and geographic location.\n\nHepatitis C doesn't exist in a vacuum, Kim said. Opioid addiction, homelessness and lack of access to health care keep people infected with hepatitis C, despite a widely available cure. By addressing the underlying problems that feed hepatitis C, said Kim, the country will also address the infection itself.\n\n\"The idea that you can't treat hepatitis C and cure it in these populations is basically false,\" Kim said. \"But there's still barriers even if you make it easy from an insurance standpoint, including connection to care, competing priorities in life. Getting to an appointment to get your hep c treatment when you're dealing with homelessness or child custody issues. And then COVID came along and has clearly set us back in terms of people moving along the cascade of care.\"\n\nExperts like Taylor and Kim argue, and are corroborated by data, that rationing Medicaid coverage of hepatitis C treatment means spending more on the back-end: liver cancer, cirrhosis and the many costs associated with substance use. The CDC itself says the average cost of curing people with hepatitis C \"is not only cost-effective, but cost-saving to the health care system.\"\n\nIn 2011, the estimated total health care costs associated with hepatitis C infection was $6.5 billion, according to the CDC. Since 2017, one study has found, Medicaid has saved more money each year in long-term health costs by curing hepatitis C than it spent covering direct-acting antivirals themselves.\n\nOn the front lines of curing hepatitis C in New England\n\nTesting for and treating hepatitis C in rural areas is a different challenge. In New Hampshire and Vermont, researchers are taking a mobile approach as part of the second-phase of the Rural New England Health Study focusing on injection drug users.\n\nA joint effort between Better Life Partners, Baystate Health and Tufts University School of Medicine, a van offering hepatitis C testing, treatment and syringe services connects with people in rural communities in the Connecticut River Valley − setting up in parking lots of community-based agencies people are already frequenting.\n\nPeople who test positive for hepatitis C on the van are either referred to Dartmouth Medical Center or the University of Vermont Medical Center, or, participate in a trial to receive treatment directly on the van − a way to measure effectiveness of mobile treatment.\n\nDr. Peter Freidmann, chief research officer at Baystate Health, said the availability of services in rural areas is \"very limited,\" and researchers wanted to focus on risk factors for injection drug users in communities as such. Whether people would respond positively to an unmarked van offering hepatitis C services was a big question.\n\n\"We did a number of surveys with 600-plus people who use drugs, the lion's share of whom inject drugs,\" said Thomas Stopka, associate professor of public health and community medicine at Tufts University. \"Some of the qualitative data really caught our attention because people talked about repetitive use of syringes. Access to harm reduction in Boston is much easier, for example.\"\n\nMobile treatment:Health care providers take a van to rural Vermont to curb hepatitis C\n\nStopka said the van allows researchers and medical staff to \"get into nooks and crannies of the community that otherwise won't be reached or will have to go to great lengths to access services.\"\n\nThey've received widely positive feedback. \"Wow, your staff on the van really get it, they listen to us,\" said Stopka, paraphrasing patients. \"They are kind and are interesting in helping us.\"\n\nFarther south, 25 miles outside of Boston, Dr. Shrien Saini looks proudly at the board of ribbons representing each patient the Brockton Neighborhood Health Center has cured of hepatitis C. Somewhere on the board is Harriet Callahan's ribbon from a few years back.\n\nIn March, Saini took over the center's hepatitis C clinic, which takes places every Thursday overseen by two providers. In 2022, they've cured nine patients — each person documented to be clear of the virus via a lab test three months post-treatment.\n\n\"When patients come to know about their cure, they are relieved,\" said Saini. \"I believe they get a sense of encouragement that they have turned the corner and are another step closer to being healthy.\"\n\nSaini recognizes the obstacles to care. Patients without working phones or safe places to sleep at night. Fear of bloodwork. Reluctance to attend an initial appointment, and then difficulty following through on subsequent appointments. She knows anecdotally that insurance is a major problem, but said the Brockton Neighborhood Health Center has a dedicated nurse who works on prior authorizations and communicating with various insurers. She calls the center \"lucky\" in that regard.\n\nMeanwhile, next door in Rhode Island, Taylor often feels it's hard to make a dent in the crisis. She said the country's response to the deadly bloodborne disease is akin to \"turning the bathtub water on full force with the drain open.\" She cures one patient and then diagnoses five new cases.\n\n\"I could just sit here and treat, treat, treat, \" she said, \"cure, cure, cure.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/12/04/weight-loss-treatment-medication-availability/10794568002/", "title": "Wegovy, Mounjaro and new weight loss medication availability in ...", "text": "The science that helped develop weight loss drug Wegovy is leading to other medications that are expected in 2023.\n\nThese new drugs can reduce weight up to 20%, though doctors caution that not everyone will benefit.\n\nAnalysts estimate the weight loss medication field could generate $50 billion annually by 2030.\n\nA new generation of anti-obesity medications offers the promise of dramatic weight loss but there is still a long way to go to make them accessible to those who need them.\n\nObesity is the last major untapped medical condition – one that more than 100 million Americans share – and drug companies have been trying for decades to develop a treatment.\n\nFinally, medications are coming on the market with the promise of reducing weight by 15% to more than 20%, more than has ever been possible with medications and the kind of weight loss rarely seen outside of surgery.\n\nBut so far, only the wealthiest and luckiest have been able to access the first of a new class of medications.

Kennedy and Husseini Manji\n\nTo those whose loved ones struggle with mental illnesses and to researchers who know how close we are to new discoveries, the National Institutes of Health's recent budget proposal is particularly urgent. The agency has requested $4.5 billion over the next dozen years to meet the critical goals of President Obama's BRAIN Initiative. The project, to map the circuitry of the brain, would not only help us to better understand complex human behavior, but could spark profound new advancements in treating brain disorders.\n\nFifty years ago, President John F. Kennedy's administration helped release thousands of mentally ill and disabled from institutions into community care settings. Too many had been warehoused, treated with neither dignity or respect. Yet resources to care for them never met the need. When President Bill Clinton held the first-ever White House Conference on Mental Health 15 years ago, an estimated one in five Americans experienced a mental disorder every year. Today, it is one in four — and of the quarter of the American population who experience mental illness, 60% receive no treatment.\n\nThat's why the BRAIN Initiative is so critical. For one, the price tag pales in comparison to what mental illness costs America and the world each year. They are the world's most expensive group of diseases. They have a greater negative impact on the world economy than HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer, in part because they rob people of their ability to function during their most productive years. In 2010, mental illness cost the world about $2.5 trillion. By 2030, the World Economic Forum estimates the cost will exceed $16 trillion.\n\nNor is the toll strictly economic. Three times as many mentally ill people are incarcerated as are hospitalized. Every year since 1999, the adult suicide rate has increased. It's estimated that every day 22 veterans with untreated mental illness take their own life. Suicide is the third-leading cause of death in young people.\n\nThree immediate steps would help address this crisis:\n\nFirst, increase the federal budget for research while fully funding the BRAIN Initiative. Despite the increasing need for such research — which promises breakthroughs not just into mental illness, but Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease — the NIH budget is actually $1.2 billion less than it was four years ago. Adjusted for inflation, the NIH's mental health arm, the National Institute of Mental Health, receives the same level of funding as it did 15 years ago — despite the fact that neuroscientific advances have brought us to the verge of a new era. For instance, new drugs being studied offer promise to reduce major symptoms of severe depression within hours or days rather than weeks or months. We need to build on this life-saving research.\n\nSecond, enforce the law and improve the system. The 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act was a big step toward guaranteeing equality of treatment and care in mental health. But the law has not yet been fully implemented, and discrimination remains widespread. It still takes too long for the mentally ill to receive help. \"Separate and unequal\" is not an acceptable standard.\n\nThird, increase cooperation. From the development of semiconductors to particle physics, many industries have grown by pooling knowledge. It was the coordinated efforts of activists, government and pharmaceutical companies that turned HIV/AIDS from a feared and fatal illness into a serious but manageable chronic disease. In the same vein, pharmaceutical companies, private and public foundations, and the government should work together to advance scientific research into mental illness.\n\nAll of us have a friend or family member who struggles with a mental illness. It has been 15 years since President Clinton declared that \"Americans with mental illness should have the same opportunity all Americans have to live to the fullest.\" We now have the opportunity and the know-how to make that aspiration a reality. Let's seize the moment.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., was a chief sponsor of the 2008 Mental Health Parity Act. Husseini Manji is head of neuroscience research at Janssen Research & Development, LLC, a Johnson & Johnson company, and the former chief of the Laboratory of Molecular Pathophysiology and director of the Mood & Anxiety Disorders Program at the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors.

The House State Government Committee voted 8-4 for the Gender Is Real Legislative Act, or GIRL Act, by Republican Rep. Chris Pringle. The bill, which awaits input from the full House, would ban K-12 schools from allowing trans athletes to compete under their gender identity. It would instead require students to participate under the gender listed on their original birth certificate. Opponents criticized the measure as motivated by fear and discrimination toward trans people. Pringle said the bill is designed to ensure a level playing field in girls’ sporting events. Pringle acknowledged he knew of no competition problems in Alabama but said disputes have arisen in other states.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state Department of Fish and Game will conduct its fourth survey of moose in the Anchorage area with the help of citizen scientists. The three-day survey relies on citizens to call or text in sightings of moose. The 2020 survey begins at 8 a.m. Friday and runs through 5 p.m. Sunday. Biologists in less populated areas conduct moose surveys from the air. Pilots fly paths close to the ground and circle when they spot moose. Anchorage air traffic and flight restrictions make that impossible, said Dave Battle, area biologist. “It’s just not something that can be done in the Anchorage Bowl,” he said. Anchorage spans 1,963 square miles, an area the size of the state of Delaware, with a population as of July 2018 of 291,500. Residents embrace moose as part of the landscape, and the animals at times can be seen in the busiest parts of the city.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The City Council has voted to oppose controversial state legislation that would seek voter approval to enshrine a statewide ban on sanctuary cities in the Arizona Constitution. The Republican-led Legislature already has taken the first steps to pass the legislation for a constitutional ban on sanctuary cities, or jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The state already has an existing ban on sanctuary cities, implemented in 2011. The Arizona Daily Star reports that while no local jurisdictions in Arizona meet the definition of a sanctuary city, and the city of Tucson overwhelmingly rejected a ballot proposition to become one in November, law enforcement agencies in Tucson have adopted immigrant-friendly policies.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Supreme Court on Thursday said it won’t reconsider its ruling rejecting a death row inmate’s request for new DNA testing of evidence that his attorneys say could exonerate him. In a 5-2 decision, justices rejected Stacey Johnson’s petition for rehearing over the court’s decision last year that he wasn’t entitled to the additional testing of evidence from the 1993 killing of Carol Heath. Johnson was one of eight inmates Arkansas sought to execute over an 11-day period in 2017 before its supply of a lethal injection drug expired. Johnson and three other inmates were spared by the courts, and Arkansas ultimately put the other four men to death. Arkansas doesn’t have any executions scheduled, but Attorney General Leslie Rutledge in December said the court’s ruling cleared the way for Johnson’s. Arkansas doesn’t currently have any execution drugs.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: In an unusual reversal, federal regulators this week agreed to cover about $300 million in repair costs at the Oroville Dam, where a spillway collapse three years ago prompted the evacuation of nearly 190,000 people in Northern California. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said last March that it wouldn’t pay for repairs involving damage regulators said existed at the Sierra Nevada dam before the collapse. But after an appeal, FEMA agreed to cover the repairs, the Sacramento Bee reports. The state now expects to be reimbursed for about $750 million of the $1.1 billion in repair costs, Erin Mellon, spokeswoman for the state Department of Water Resources, said in an email to the Bee. “This is pretty rare, and for California it’s huge money,” Jerry Quinn, a Sacramento consultant who helps government agencies recover money from FEMA, told the paper.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: Graduates from the U.S. Air Force Academy in the state are expected to cross-commission into the Space Force this spring, military officials said. About 60 cadets would be commissioned into the new armed service branch, which formed in December with the signing of the $738 billion National Defense Authorization Act, the Gazette reports. “They’re doing Air Force Academy curriculum, and they’ll just be directly commissioned into the Space Force,” academy Vice Superintendent Col. Houston Cantwell said. Academy leaders and members of the Colorado’s congressional delegation announced the cross-commission plan at an oversight Board of Visitors meeting Wednesday. The plan would be similar to how the U.S. Naval Academy commissions Marine officers. It is unclear how exactly academy leaders plan to commission cadets into the Space Force.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont says he is dropping his plan for highway tolls for trucks, expressing frustration with legislative leaders who have delayed a vote on the issue. The General Assembly had planned to vote Thursday on the tolls, which were under consideration to fund a wide-ranging transportation improvement plan. But Lamont, a Democrat, said Wednesday that the Senate needed more time. “I think it’s time to take a pause,” Lamont said at a news conference. Tolls for trucks had been projected to raise an estimated $200 million. Lamont said he plans for now to generate that money instead through state borrowing.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Some lawmakers want the state to start compensating people who were put in prison and then later found to be not guilty. A bill waiting on a vote in the state House would compensate people as much as $50,000 per year they were incarcerated, as well as some attorney’s fees. Emeka Igwe, an attorney, said his client Elmer Daniels was the “catalyst” for the legislation. After Daniels served 39 years for a rape he says he didn’t commit, “he was basically released with just a T-shirt on his back and left to fend for himself.” Under the proposed bill, if someone were imprisoned in Delaware for one or more crimes that they didn’t commit, they could file a complaint in Superior Court within three years of the wrongful conviction being reversed or vacated. If an eligible person had been in prison for less than a year, their compensation would be $137 for each day they were incarcerated.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: What country music is to Nashville and jazz is to New Orleans, go-go is to D.C. And on Wednesday, the living legends of go-go music came out to the Culture House DC art center to witness history, WUSA-TV reports. Gregory “Sugar Bear” Elliot, lead singer of Experience Unlimited; Big G of BackYard Band; and the oldest daughter of Chuck Brown – the godfather of go-go – were all present to see Mayor Muriel Bowser sign a bill designating go-go as the official music of D.C. The creative arts performance space was packed with people wearing green “Don’t Mute DC” hats and T-shirts, and the crowd was pumped up. Before signing the official document, in true call-and-repeat go-go fashion, Bowser asked the crowd to chant with her. “When I say go-go, you say ‘is D.C.,’ ” she shouted. The crowd enthusiastically chanted it three times.\n\nFlorida\n\nMelbourne: An algae toxin 1,000 times deadlier than cyanide lingers at trace levels in the livers of bottlenose dolphins in the Indian River Lagoon, a new study shows, remaining there even when the algae is not blooming. The long-term health implications for the lagoon’s top predator and other marine life remain uncertain. “We’re not making any conclusions about what it’s doing to them,” said Spencer Fire, an assistant professor at Florida Tech. The study for the first time establishes a baseline level of the toxin in lagoon dolphins by which to compare future toxin levels during dolphin strandings or die-offs. “This is what we expect to be sort of background levels,” Fire said. The poison, called saxitoxin, comes from the same algae that glows like fairy dust at night in the lagoon. The study, led by Florida Tech, is the first report of saxitoxin being detected in marine mammals absent an algae bloom.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Lawmakers are considering raising the state’s minimum dropout age from 16 to 17. But a Wednesday hearing on Senate Bill 343 revealed concerns about how much additional students would cost the state, as well as whether it’s worthwhile for the state to try to force uninterested teens to remain in school. The Senate Education and Youth Committee didn’t vote on the bill. Chairman P.K. Martin, a Lawrenceville Republican, promised another hearing, but it’s unclear if the measure will move forward. Some Democrats have been seeking for years to raise past 16 the age for students choosing to leave school. “If we allow young people to leave our schools at 16, there are no jobs for them,” said the bill’s sponsor, Democrat Lester Jackson of Savannah. He argues the 16-year-old age was set when unskilled jobs such as being a farmhand were widely available.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A paddleboarder earned the Maui Police Department’s highest civilian honor for fighting off an attack by a tiger shark to protect members of a tour group he was leading. The department awarded its Civilian Medal of Valor to Triston Kahookele-Santos on Tuesday, The Maui News reports. The 20-year-old employee of the Andaz Beach Crew, part of the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, was leading five stand-up paddle-boarders about a quarter-mile offshore about 9:30 a.m. Feb. 5. The group was watching whales and following fish and a manta ray, Maui police spokeswoman Lt. Audra Sellers said. A 10-foot tiger shark appeared and launched an attack at a Washington man in the group, “violently thrashing his board,” Sellers said. Kahookele-Santos used the blade of his paddle to strike the shark, which let go of the board and turned on Kahookele-Santos. The others paddled safely to shore as he fought off the shark with the paddle while it circled him three times. No injuries were reported as a result of the attack.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A bill that would reduce the number of people required to report suspected child abuse narrowly won approval from a panel of state lawmakers. The House Judiciary and Rules Committee approved the bill 9-8, The Times-News reports. Currently, anyone in the state who sees evidence of child abuse, abandonment or neglect is required to report that evidence to law enforcement, and those who don’t can be charged with a misdemeanor. The legislation approved Wednesday would remove that requirement for most residents, leaving only teachers, doctors, law enforcement officials and social workers as mandatory reporters. Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, says unfounded child abuse claims cost taxpayers money. But Rep. John McCrostie, D-Boise, and Rep. Linda Hartgen, R-Twin Falls, both opposed the legislation, saying it could lead to underreporting of child abuse, causing real harm to Idaho kids. The bill now heads to the full House.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city’s former police chief has been receiving a pension of more than $15,800 a month since the mayor fired him in December for allegedly lying about a night he was found asleep in his city-issued SUV, according to a newspaper report. Eddie Johnson was awarded the pension by the Policemen’s Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago, the Chicago Tribune reports, citing records it obtained under Illinois’ Freedom of Information Act. The pension adds up to nearly $190,000 annually, or 75% of his average salary of just over $253,000 per year during his final four years with the Chicago Police Department. Johnson, 59, blamed medication for making him drowsy before he was found asleep in his SUV, but media reports disclosed that the married superintendent had been drinking for hours and kissing a woman on his security detail and that the responding officers took steps to keep it secret.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor has told state agencies to calculate the damage along the Lake Michigan shoreline that’s been caused by high water ahead of possibly seeking federal assistance. The order announced Thursday comes as several lakeshore communities have already declared local beach erosion emergencies with waves damaging property and threatening roads. The Indiana Department of Homeland Security has declined to declare a state emergency, but Gov. Eric Holcomb said he wanted a new review after viewing the shoreline by helicopter Sunday. The erosion is happening as Lake Michigan approaches its highest levels in recorded history, and forecasters expect the Great Lakes to remain high well into 2020. State Sen. Karen Tallian, an Ogden Dunes Democrat, called Holcomb’s action “long overdue,” as she asked the governor for an emergency declaration almost two months ago.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: Those hoping to visit the “Field of Dreams” movie site the week of Major League Baseball’s game between the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox had better have a ticket. Go the Distance, which runs the site of the iconic baseball movie, announced the grounds would be inaccessible to fans Aug. 8-16. The White Sox and Yankees will play Aug. 13 on a specially made field located next to the field and on the grounds. A spokesperson for MLB says information about ticket plans for the game will be made available in March or April. The site has been a hot-spot tourist attraction for baseball fans who have flocked to the iconic diamond built in the middle of a Dyersville cornfield, made famous by Kevin Costner’s 1989 blockbuster. There will be plenty of other activities around town before the game, including exhibits, games, a Fan Fest and a movie showing.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Legislature’s auditing division says state agencies have significant information technology security weaknesses and haven’t made progress since previous reports showed the same problems. More than half of 19 state agencies studied failed to comply with IT security practices that protect sensitive information against data loss or theft. The findings were presented to the Legislative Post Audit Committee in an executive session and published online. The audit division studied IT functions at agencies from January 2017 to December 2019. Most agencies failed to scan and patch computers to keep them secure. They didn’t have adequate response plans and didn’t encrypt, back up or destroy electronic data. The report blamed a lack of management attention and inadequate resources for the failures.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear spoke at an LGBTQ-rights rally in the Capitol on Wednesday, advocating for a statewide fairness law and a bill banning “conversion therapy.” “Kentucky cannot reach its full potential if all of our people don’t feel supported to be themselves,” Beshear said. “Discrimination against our LGBTQ brothers and sisters is absolutely unacceptable in this commonwealth.” The rally, held by the Louisville-based Fairness Campaign every legislative session, featured activists and legislators advocating for those bills and against a slew of bills targeting transgender youth. Beshear threw his support behind legislation banning discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, which has failed to pass either chamber in each legislative session over the past decade.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A month after delaying a decision, the state’s higher education policy-making board voted Wednesday to bolster its minimum admission standards for public universities by adding the threat of financial penalties for campuses that disobey the requirements. The Board of Regents approved the adjustments to the state’s existing, 15-year-old admissions standards without objection, after weeks of behind-the-scenes negotiations to get board members comfortable with the changes. Most of the rewrites were modest. But the penalty provisions represent the first real effort to force compliance with the policy. The board has never penalized schools for not complying with admissions criteria. Still, financial penalties won’t be automatic for campuses that violate the admissions criteria, and the threat of reduced funding doesn’t come unless a school has breached the policy for two consecutive years.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Lobsters have long delighted tourists as the state’s most beloved seafood. But one company thinks the crustaceans can save human lives by providing their blood for use in new drugs. The company working on the lobster blood project, Lobster Unlimited of Orono, is investigating whether lobster blood can be used as a potential weapon against viruses and cancer. Representatives with the company said results are promising – the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued them a patent in late October related to their work. The blood is easy to come by because it’s a byproduct of lobster processing, company head Robert Bayer said. Lobster blood is likely a long way from playing a role in new drugs, Bayer said, but there’s “no question it has antiviral and anticancer properties” based on research needed to apply for the patent. “Right now, this blood is literally thrown out on the floor and goes down the drain,” said Bayer, a professor emeritus of Animal and Veterinary Sciences at University of Maine.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2030, under an ambitious measure outlined Wednesday as the coastal state grapples with increasing concerns about sea-level rise. The legislation would increase the state’s current goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 40%, based on 2006 levels. It also would set the state on a path toward achieving net-zero statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. Supporters of the “Climate Solutions Act of 2020” say Maryland, which has about 3,100 miles of tidal shoreline, must be a leader in addressing rising sea levels. Environmentalists say the measure is the the most comprehensive approach to addressing greenhouse gas emissions before lawmakers this session in a Legislature controlled by Democrats. The measure’s goals include planting 1 million trees a year in the state for a decade. It also calls for requiring new commercial buildings with 25,000 square feet of rooftop to use solar panels.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nChicopee: A former police sergeant accused of lying about his role in sharing pictures of a homicide victim has been reinstated to the department. The state Civil Service Commission voted to allow Jeffrey Godere to return to the Chicopee Police Department at a lower rank after winning an appeal of his termination, MassLive.com reports. Godere was fired by then-Mayor Richard Kos in November 2018 after he and three other officers were implicated in sharing images of a victim’s body and the crime scene in the 2011 killing of 20-year-old Amanda Plasse. The commission ruled last week that Godere would be demoted to patrolman because of his misconduct and prior disciplinary record. City officials and the police department are reviewing the commission’s decision with lawyers and exploring options to appeal it in superior court, according to Michael Wilk, public information officer.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Marijuana will have to carry labels warning pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers about the health risks for their fetuses and infants under newly enacted state laws. Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist signed the two bills Wednesday because Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was out of the state. The labels must be placed on legal recreational and medical marijuana products and warn that use by pregnant or breastfeeding women may result in fetal injury, preterm birth, low birth weight or development problems for children. The laws also require that an informational pamphlet be made available at every point of sale. It must include safety information related to use by minors and include the poison control hotline number – in case children accidentally eat candy or brownies that contain marijuana.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBecker: Firefighters battled a stubborn fire at a metal recycling plant in this small community for a third consecutive day Thursday. The fire at the Northern Metals plant in Becker was unleashing noxious, billowing smoke, and the wind had shifted direction, prompting school officials to cancel classes for the day. Firefighters from around the region continued to work the blaze in the Sherburne County city about 50 miles northwest of Minneapolis. In a Facebook update late Wednesday, the Becker Police Department said the fire could last several more days. Firefighting crews were using heavy equipment to separate a portion of a burning stack of vehicles in hopes that the blaze would eventually die out. The strategy was intended to protect nearby buildings.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Replicas of Christopher Columbus’ Nina and Pinta have arrived along Mississippi’s Gulf Coast, sailing into a Biloxi harbor as spectators aimed their phones out to the horizon. About a dozen spectators lined a pier Wednesday as the ships arrived. Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic on the Nina on his three voyages of discovery to the New World beginning in 1492. He was long celebrated in the U.S., but in recent years a reckoning has been held with the brutal aspects of his legacy. Columbus’ arrival brought violence, disease, enslavement, racism and exploitation to the native people. The original Nina was last heard from in 1501, but this replica, finished in 1991, serves as a floating museum. It was built entirely by hand, without the use of power tools, and is considered the most historically accurate Columbus ship replica ever built. The Pinta replica was built in Brazil and launched in 2005 to accompany the Nina on travels. While in port, the ships will be open for public tours. They are scheduled to leave Biloxi on March 2.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The St. Louis Zoo announced Thursday that it has a new resident in Teak, a black and white colobus monkey born Feb. 3. Colobus monkeys are born white with a pink face. By age 6 months, the little monkey will get his adult coloration – mostly black hair but with white hair around the face and part of the tail, though adults also have a distinctive mantle of long white hair from their shoulders around the edge of their backs. Colobus monkeys live in families with several females sharing in the care of newborns, a behavior called allomothering. Teak’s mother, Cecelia, has raised five babies of her own along with three other babies in the family, the zoo said. Teak’s father, Kima, watches over the family and often interacts with the youngsters, the zoo said. Teak’s sister and his half-sister also interact with and help care for Teak. The monkeys, also known as Guereza colobus, are native to east and central Africa.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Montana Cowboy Hall of Fame officials say they are saddling up with the C.M. Russell Museum on an inaugural exhibit within the internationally known museum in Great Falls that will add to the celebration of the American West. The exhibit, a two-year pilot project planned to open in September, would be a blend of Cowboy Hall of Fame honorees and their history. Efforts are underway to curate the specific content for the initial exhibit, Cowboy Hall of Fame board member Mike Gurnett said at a Feb. 7-8 meeting. The exhibit in Great Falls gives something of a foothold for the hall of fame. The Montana Cowboy Hall of Fame, established by the Legislature, has spent nearly 17 years looking for a permanent home after an effort failed in Big Timber. Earlier attempts in Wolf Point and other communities never came to fruition.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A state senator who is pushing the Legislature’s main bill to lower property taxes says she hopes to reach a deal with opponents who are trying to derail it out of concern that it could hurt the state’s K-12 public schools. Sen. Lou Ann Linehan, of Omaha, said Thursday that she and other senators will try to find an agreement with school officials who are lobbying against the measure. The bill has won support from farm and business groups and Gov. Pete Ricketts because it would lower taxes that have risen over the past decade. But school administrators, school boards and the state teachers’ union argue it would hinder their long-term spending flexibility. “This bill is bad for Nebraska, and it’s bad for our kids,” said Sen. Wendy DeBoer, of Bennington, who opposed the measure. The bill would boost state aid to schools by about $520 million over three years and redistribute it so that smaller, rural schools get a larger increase.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Virgin Trains Las Vegas has released plans to build a proposed train station near the South Premium Outlets mall south of the Strip. The $4.8 billion high-speed rail link with Southern California would be two stories tall and span more than 273,000 square feet, with a seven-story-tall parking garage, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Construction is scheduled to begin later this year, according to planning documents submitted to Clark County. Operations are scheduled to begin in 2023. Plans call for the two-story station to include a self-ticketing area, departure lobby, retail space, baggage claim, office space, passenger waiting areas and security. Plans also include a parking garage that would connect to the train terminal and have more than 2,600 parking spaces. The project would be designed to provide easier access to California, while also providing thousands of jobs and opportunities in the area, company officials said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nCroydon: The police chief took it literally when he was stripped of his duties at a local board meeting, disrobing to his underwear and walking out into a snowstorm. Richard Lee has been chief in the small town of Croydon for 20 years. On Tuesday night, the three-member selectboard voted to eliminate the one-man department and move to 100% coverage by the New Hampshire State Police. Lee, who was at the meeting, was told to turn in the key to his cruiser, his guns and his uniform – immediately. He went into an office he shared with town officials and took off his clothes before the board chairman. “I gave them my uniform shirt. I gave them my turtleneck. I gave them my ballistic vest. … I sat down in the chair, took off my boots, took off my pants, put those in the chair and put my boots back on, and walked out the door,” Lee said. He didn’t have spare clothes or a ride home. He walked nearly a mile before his wife picked him up.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEgg Harbor Township: A Superior Court judge has denied a neighborhood’s attempt to leave the township and join a neighboring borough. Judge Julio Mendez ruled that Egg Harbor Township’s refusal to allow Seaview Harbor residents to join Longport was “not arbitrary or unreasonable.” The township argued against the move, declaring that it would harm the township economically and socially and benefit the homeowners only economically, the Press of Atlantic City reports. The homeowners stood to pay significantly less in property taxes in Longport, which does not have a school system. Mendez said court decisions have not favored de-annexation for “tax shopping.” Mendez’s opinion said the township stood to lose over $500,000 a year in municipal tax revenue and $1.8 million in revenue to township schools. The average homeowner would save almost $18,000 a year in property taxes, based on 2015 numbers.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLos Alamos: A conservation group is calling on members of the state’s congressional delegation to rethink proposed legislation that would change the designation of Bandelier National Monument to a national park. While one of the goals is to attract more tourists to the region with the “national park” brand, the nonprofit group Caldera Action said Bandelier would not be able to cope with additional crowding because of inadequate and crumbling infrastructure and limited staffing. The group also is worried about opening up part of Bandelier to hunting and trapping, saying there are other locations throughout the Jemez Mountains that already allow for hunting, and doing so at Bandelier would complicate management for the National Park Service. Tucked into northern New Mexico’s ancient canyons, Bandelier has a long history that stretches back more than 11,000 years to the days when nomadic hunters and gatherers tracked wildlife across the region’s mesas and canyons. Grand multistory structures were built into the walls of Frijoles Canyon and along Frijoles Creek centuries ago, but all that remains are stone and mortar outlines of the settlements.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Animal rights advocates have lost a bid to get a Bronx Zoo elephant declared to have human-like rights and transferred to a sanctuary, though a judge said the case for sending the pachyderm to a sanctuary was “extremely persuasive.” Bronx Judge Alison Tuitt on Tuesday dismissed the Nonhuman Rights Project’s petition arguing that Happy the elephant is “unlawfully imprisoned” at the zoo where she has lived since 1977. She has been kept separate from other elephants for more than a decade. New York courts have previously said animals aren’t legally considered “persons,” and Tuitt said those rulings applied to Happy, too. But the judge said she was “extremely sympathetic to Happy’s plight.” “This court agrees that Happy is more than just a legal thing, or property. She is an intelligent, autonomous being who should be treated with respect and dignity, and who may be entitled to liberty,” the judge wrote, calling the arguments for transferring Happy from her “lonely” exhibit to a sprawling elephant sanctuary “extremely persuasive.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: A free downtown music and arts festival that organizers say draws 30,000 locals and tourists may be canceled this summer. LEAF Downtown AVL official Ehren Cruz has said the sixth annual festival scheduled for Aug. 7-8 until 10 p.m. at Pack Square Park may not happen, after organizers were asked to have equipment and gear removed by early Aug. 9, Cruz said. The downtown event is different from LEAF’s main festival, which happens at Lake Eden outside Black Mountain. LEAF, a nonprofit focused on arts and cultural enrichment, would have to pay subcontractors to work overtime overnight, including the staging company, tent suppliers and an “environmental green team,” Cruz said. That would cost $6,000-$10,000 and isn’t possible considering the limited revenue the festival brings in, he said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State regulators on Wednesday unanimously approved expanded capacity for the Dakota Access pipeline, saying they believed the project had met exhaustive state and federal requirements. The 3-0 vote by the all-Republican Public Service Commission came after the body signaled last month that it was likely to approve a permit to expand the capacity of the pipeline, despite objections from opponents who said it would increase the probability of a disastrous oil spill. Commissioners said they expect their decision to be challenged in state court. Commissioner Julie Fedorchak said she welcomed such a review. Texas-based Energy Transfer proposed doubling the capacity of the pipeline last year to meet growing demand for oil shipments from North Dakota, without the need for additional pipelines or rail shipments. Commissioner Brian Kroshus said Wednesday that he believes the project would help take oil trucks off the road, reducing traffic fatalities.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine on Thursday presented the state’s highest non-combat decoration for service to a retired fighter pilot and astronaut. Col. Guion Bluford of Westlake in suburban Cleveland flew 144 combat missions in South Vietnam with the U.S. Air Force and later earned a doctorate in aerospace engineering at the Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton. In 1983, Bluford became the first black astronaut to fly in space on a shuttle mission. DeWine presented the 77-year-old Bluford with the Ohio Distinguished Service Medal at a Statehouse ceremony. Bluford, who was honored on the 58th anniversary of fellow Ohioan John Glenn becoming the first American to orbit the Earth, attributed his success to chasing his dreams and advised others to do the same by figuring out “what gets you excited.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state House committee overwhelmingly rejected a bill Thursday to repeal a new law that allows most adults to carry firearms without a background check or training. Despite the 11-1 vote against his bill by the House Public Safety Committee, Rep. Jason Lowe, an Oklahoma City Democrat, vowed to continue fighting the law with a signature-gathering effort to put a question on the ballot to repeal it. “I believe this law is absolutely dangerous,” Lowe said. “It’s a ticking time bomb, and it’s been an absolute disaster.” Dubbed permitless carry by its opponents, the new law allows most adults to carry firearms, concealed or openly, without a license. It was the first measure signed into law by Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt and took effect in November. Oklahoma’s Republican-led Legislature has embraced numerous bills that expand gun rights in the state. The committee on Thursday approved a bill to expand the state’s “Stand Your Ground” law. Last week, the Senate approved a bill that would allow more public school teachers to carry firearms in their classrooms.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Department of Land Conservation and Development says a proposed liquefied natural gas export terminal in Coos Bay would have significant adverse effects on the state’s coastal scenic and aesthetic resources, endangered species and critical habitat. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that in a letter Wednesday to backers of the Jordan Cove Energy Project, agency director Jim Rue said that neither the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission nor the Army Corps of Engineers “can grant a license or permit for this project unless the U.S. Secretary of Commerce overrides this objection on appeal. The decision on one of the key state permits for the project is a rebuke that comes just before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is scheduled to issue a final environmental analysis on the project, approving or denying its primary federal license.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: As many of the state’s counties adopt new hand-marked ballot voting systems, a persistent criticism is a perceived loss of privacy in polling places when filling them out and scanning them. The criticism, raised again Wednesday by state lawmakers, has emerged repeatedly ahead of the presidential elections, after a two-year push by Gov. Tom Wolf to get counties to switch to paper-based voting systems as an election security bulwark against hacking. Some lawmakers say they have heard from unhappy voters accustomed to electronic touchscreen voting machines that, in the past, had been screened off or arranged to allow voters to make selections unseen. Now, other voters or poll workers may be able to see how someone voted while they are filling out their ballot or while they feed their ballot into an electronic scanner that reads it. “I think we’re disenfranchising so many voters who don’t like the new system,” Rep. Doyle Heffley, R-Carbon, told top state election officials at an Appropriations Committee hearing Wednesday. “It’s not a secret ballot. Other people can see how they vote.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The University of Rhode Island is using a $1 million federal grant to offer education and training about opioids to residents in rural areas of the state. Officials with the university in South Kingstown say health professionals and students have been preparing to start the outreach campaign. Funding from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration will be used to send students and staff to farmers markets, fairs, festivals and other events to discuss issues related to opioids, hand out information about how to obtain overdose-reversal medication and offer related health counseling. Deborah Sheely, of URI’s Cooperative Extension, says the goal is to remove the stigma associated with opioid misuse and ensure that residents in rural areas have the information and technical assistance they need.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The Columbia Housing Authority was fined just under $11,000 after pleading guilty Wednesday to 24 safety violations found after two residents died from carbon monoxide poisoning from a poorly maintained heater. One code violation was dropped as city officials appeared in court, and they asked for a jury trial on one other violation, WLTX-TV reports. The violations included broken smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors and fire extinguishers, as well as failing to do routine maintenance. Calvin Witherspoon Jr., 62, and Derrick Roper, 31, died in separate units in the same building in January 2019 at Allen Benedict Court in Columbia. Investigators immediately inspected all 244 of the units at the 80-year-old complex and found hundreds of problems missed as employees in the Housing Authority’s maintenance department either retired or left and weren’t replaced, authorities said. Prosecutors said they could not file criminal charges because South Carolina lacks a criminal negligence law.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Legislation to prevent the spread of zebra mussels is headed for the state Senate after it received unanimous approval from the Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee on Tuesday. The bill, which has already passed the House, requires people to decontaminate their boats by cleaning and draining them after leaving the water. It also creates inspection stations. Senators were told the invasive species has now been found in four South Dakota lakes. Zebra mussels can cause a foul taste and smell in drinking water, increase algae and alter aquatic food chains. The widespread invasive species wasn’t found in South Dakota until 2016, when the zebra mussels were discovered in Lewis and Clark Lake and McCook Lake. It was found to have spread to Sharpe and Francis Case lakes last year.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A state panel won’t vote on whether to remove or add context to a bust of a Confederate general and early Ku Klux Klan leader in the Capitol until a board vacancy is filled, the board’s chairman said at a meeting Thursday. Finance Commissioner and Capitol Commission Chairman Stuart McWhorter said he’s unsure when Gov. Bill Lee will replace Tyreece Miller, who recently left the commission as the nominee for U.S. marshal in western Tennessee. McWhorter said he doesn’t want to act on Nathan Bedford Forrest’s bust before Miller is replaced. The Tennessee Heritage Protection Act also requires the state Historical Commission’s approval to remove the bust. Forrest amassed a fortune before the Civil War as a plantation owner and slave trader in Memphis. After the war, he was a leader of the Klan, which terrorized black people as it sought to reverse Reconstruction efforts and restore white supremacy.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The state will close two of its more than 100 state prisons amid a years­long decline in the incarcerated population and serious understaffing at some facilities, officials said Thursday. The closures of a prison in South Texas and another in suburban Houston will result in annual savings of about $20 million, according to the office of state Sen. John Whitmire, who heads the Senate Criminal Justice Committee. The Garza East Transfer Facility in Beeville, 100 miles southeast of San Antonio, is set to close in May, but a date has not been set for the closure of the Jester I Unit in Sugar Land, according to Whitmire’s chief of staff, Lara Wendler. She said both prisons were at more than 90% population capacity as of Thursday, and those inmates will be transferred to other prisons.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Brigham Young University has revised its strict code of conduct to strip a rule that banned any behavior that reflected “homosexual feelings,” which LGBTQ students and their allies felt created an unfair double standard not imposed on heterosexual couples. The university is owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which teaches its members that being gay isn’t a sin, but engaging in same-sex intimacy is. BYU’s revisions to what the college calls its honor code don’t change the faith’s opposition to same-sex relationships or gay marriage. The changes were discovered by media outlets Wednesday. BYU spokeswoman Carri Jenkins said in an email that the updated version of the code aligns with a new handbook of rules unveiled by the faith, widely known as the Mormon church.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A panel formed to review community policing practices in the city has recommended changes to the police department’s use-of-force policy, with a focus on de-escalating potential physical confrontations. The 15-member committee, which released its report this month, also advises improving civilian oversight of police, Vermont Public Radio reports. The City Council formed the panel in June following several interactions in which officers allegedly used excessive force. The council told the committee to focus on the police department’s use-of-force policy and the police commission. Committee Chair Randall Harp told the council Tuesday that the panel advises making de-escalation a priority in the use-of-force policy. “And emphasize that officer behavior can escalate the level of force required, and it sanctions officers that do so,” he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nMount Vernon: George Washington’s Mount Vernon estate says it will no longer sell a souvenir depicting the founding father’s false teeth amid criticism that Washington’s dentures were made with teeth pulled from the mouths of his slaves. Critics said selling a souvenir magnet depicting Washington’s famous false teeth trivialized the fact that Washington’s slaves had to give up their own teeth. On Wednesday, Mount Vernon said on Twitter that it would remove the magnet from its online store. The webpage on which the magnet had been offered for sale was disabled as of Wednesday afternoon. The old story that Washington’s dentures were made of wood has long been known to be false. It has been known for years that Washington paid about six pounds for nine teeth that were pulled from slaves’ mouths. The payment is recorded in a 1784 ledger. The fact has received renewed attention following publication of a revisionist biography.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Bills that would have limited how many rounds can be stored in gun magazines and what guns can be sold failed to make their way through the Legislature. KING-TV reports neither bill was approved before Wednesday’s 5 p.m. deadline. Lawmakers knew earlier this month that the proposed ban on firearms defined as assault weapons did not have the votes to proceed. The high-capacity limit bill passed out of House and Senate committees but never came up on the floor for debate. Republicans opposed to the bill filed an unusually high number of amendments on the bill, meaning debate could last a day or more, according to Democratic staffers. Aberdeen Republican Rep. Jim Walsh, who submitted six amendments, was asked if the long list of amendments was a political ploy to prevent debate. “That’s part of it,” said Walsh. “But it’s also a very bad policy.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Foster parents may soon get more money for adopting children under a measure passed by the House of Delegates this week aimed at alleviating the state’s overburdened foster care system. Delegates voted 96-1 to approve the bill, with Republican Del. Pat McGeehan as the lone “no” vote after he was told the measure would cost the state about $17 million. “Great emphasis has been placed on the projected cost of this bill, but we must acknowledge that this is an investment, an investment in West Virginia children,” said Del. Jason Barrett, a Berkeley County Democrat. The proposal, sent to the Senate, would give families at least $900 a month for each child adopted. Child placing agencies would also get $1,000 every time they finalize an adoption. The bill also establishes a foster care bill of rights, which would ensure children and parents understand their rights in the state’s foster system.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A group monitoring a legal settlement over the Milwaukee Police Department’s stop-and-frisk practices reports officers failed to document a justification in 80% of such incidents in the first half of 2019. The Crime and Justice Institute found many of the officers’ report narratives lacked the details necessary to establish reasonable suspicion that the people being frisked were armed or dangerous to others around them. The Boston-based institute is monitoring the police department’s compliance as part of a $3.4 million settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin in 2018 over stop-and-frisk practices. The ACLU had argued in its lawsuit that over the past decade, tens of thousands of minority residents in Milwaukee have been stopped by police without reasonable suspicion of a crime.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Environmental groups are suing over plans for a potentially huge gas field they say would endanger antelope in Grand Teton National Park by hindering a migration route between the park and a basin. The Upper Green River Alliance, Western Watersheds Project and the Center for Biological Diversity sued the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in U.S. District Court in Cheyenne on Wednesday. The groups say the agency insufficiently took into account a 170-mile pronghorn antelope migration corridor between Grand Teton and the Upper Green River Basin before approving a plan to develop the Normally Pressured Lance gas field in the basin in 2018. The Jonah Energy project would potentially add 350 gas wells a year to the gas field over a decade. With 3,500 wells, the Normally Pressured Lance field could become one of the biggest onshore gas fields in the U.S.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/21"}]}

The agreement also includes staging games in South American countries Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, which had earlier promoted a rival co-hosting bid.\n\nThose three countries will each host one match to start the tournament, which allows FIFA to stage the opening game in the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo, where the Centenario Stadium hosted the inaugural 1930 World Cup final.\n\nThe bid had started out as a joint venture between Spain and Portugal before expanding to include Morocco, in northern Africa, earlier this year.\n\nAll six host nations will get automatic entry to the 48-team tournament, FIFA said. It is the first time the World Cup will be played on more than one continent.\n\n“The centennial World Cup could not be far from South America, where everything began,” said Alejandro Dominguez, the president of South American soccer body CONMEBOL. “The 2030 World Cup will be played in three continents.”\n\nThe consensus reached by the continental soccer bodies also allowed FIFA to open bidding for the 2034 World Cup, with only member federations from Asia and Oceania eligible to bid for the hosting rights.\n\nSaudi Arabia immediately entered that contest and Australia is also interested after successfully co-hosting the Women’s World Cup this year with New Zealand. Either way, the 2034 tournament will almost certainly be played in November and December — like last year's World Cup in Qatar, in the heart of the European club soccer season.\n\nAccelerating the choice of a 2034 host to the end of next year will be widely seen as a victory for Saudi Arabia and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has built close ties to FIFA president Gianni Infantino in the past six years.\n\n\"We want to celebrate our football culture and share our country with the world,” Yasser Al Misehal, the president of the Saudi soccer federation and a member of the FIFA Council, said in a government statement announcing its intention to bid.\n\nThe FIFA Council’s acceptance of a unified 2030 candidacy still needs formal approval next year at a meeting of the 211 member federations. That should be just a formality. The 2034 pick will be made at a separate congress, FIFA said.\n\n“In 2030, we will have a unique global footprint, three continents — Africa, Europe and South America — six countries — Argentina, Morocco, Paraguay, Portugal, Spain and Uruguay — welcoming and uniting the world while celebrating together the beautiful game, the centenary and the FIFA World Cup,” Infantino said in a statement.\n\nThe 48-team tournament scheduled for June-July 2030 is set to start in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay — which FIFA branded as “Centenary Celebration Matches” — before the action moves to the core host nations Spain, Portugal and Morocco.\n\nThe plan involves an unprecedented amount of travel across distances and time zones, including 13-hour flights from Buenos Aires to Madrid.\n\nIt was not popular with Football Supporters Europe, the fan group officially recognized by European soccer body UEFA.\n\n“FIFA continues its cycle of destruction against the greatest tournament on earth,” FSE said in a statement. “Horrendous for supporters, disregards the environment and rolls the red carpet out to a host for 2034 with an appalling human rights record.”\n\nSaudi Arabia and Australia both are members of the Asian Football Confederation yet the organization's president, Bahraini royal Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, stated a clear preference Wednesday.\n\n“The entire Asian football family will stand united in support of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s momentous initiative,” Sheikh Salman said in an AFC statement, adding it was committed to working for its win. Australia was a losing candidate when Qatar won its hosting vote in 2010.\n\nThe South American co-host bid has been promoted since the 2018 World Cup in Russia and had included Chile, which was not mentioned Wednesday.\n\nUkraine was also dropped after it was added to the European bid a year ago at a news conference at UEFA headquarters in Switzerland. However, Ukraine had not been mentioned in official comments about the UEFA-backed bid this year.\n\nThe first 48-team men's World Cup will be hosted in 2026 by the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe 2030 decision marks a victory for Morocco, which has invested heavily in infrastructure in its largest cities and was last week chosen to host the 2025 African Cup of Nations. The men's national team helped push its case by reaching the World Cup semifinals in Qatar, eliminating Spain and Portugal in the previous rounds. It will be the second African nation to host the tournament after South Africa in 2010.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Moroccan King Mohammed VI’s Royal Cabinet said the selection “recognized Morocco’s choice place in the ranks of great nations.”\n\nThe 2030 deal was clinched six weeks after the former president of Spain’s soccer federation became an international embarrassment for his behavior at the Women’s World Cup final.\n\nLuis Rubiales was was suspended by FIFA and eventually forced to resign after kissing a player on the lips during the awards ceremony in Sydney, Australia on Aug. 20, which drew attention away from the greatest achievement of Spain’s women’s soccer team. He is now under criminal investigation.\n\nSpain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez had expressed public concern that Rubiales could derail the bid to host the men's World Cup if he remained in office.\n\nSánchez said in Spanish on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter: “We will show the strength of our country as champions of the men’s and women’s world titles, and we will defend the values of equality, solidarity and fair play that should always be present in sports.”\n\nSpain previously hosted the 1982 World Cup, Argentina was the 1978 host and Uruguay had the inaugural 1930 tournament. Portugal, Morocco and Paraguay will be first-time hosts.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Mauricio Savarese in Sao Paulo, Brazil; Sam Metz in Rabat, Morocco; and Joseph Wilson in Barcelona, Spain contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/16/football/host-cities-2026-fifa-world-cup/index.html", "title": "2026 FIFA World Cup sites revealed for 16 cities in Canada, Mexico ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMatches for the 2026 World Cup will be held in 11 US cities as well as three host sites in Mexico and two in Canada, soccer’s world governing body, FIFA, announced Thursday.\n\nThe 16 host cities will be: Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Guadalajara, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Miami, Monterrey, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, Toronto and Vancouver.\n\nFIFA officials will decide at a later date which of the 16 cities will host group play and which will host elimination round matches.\n\n“We congratulate the 16 FIFA World Cup Host Cities on their outstanding commitment and passion,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a news release. “Today is a historic day – for everyone in those cities and states, for FIFA, for Canada, the USA and Mexico who will put on the greatest show on Earth.

It aims to bring the World Cup back to Europe 12 years after Russia hosted.\n\nThe expected Spain-Portugal bid, which has been in the works for more than three years, previously was made UEFA’s preferred candidate. About 200 FIFA member nations will vote on the host in 2024.\n\n“Now it’s not the Iberian bid, it’s the European bid,” Spain soccer federation president Luis Rubiales said at the launch. “Together we represent the power of transformation football has in society.”\n\nNo details were given about how many games at the 48-team World Cup would be staged in Ukraine or in which cities. The 70,000-seat Olympic Stadium in Kyiv hosted the finals of the 2012 European Championship and the 2018 Champions League.\n\nThe European bid is facing a South American candidacy with co-hosts Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay, which wants to mark the centenary of hosting the inaugural 1930 World Cup.\n\nSaudi Arabia, which has built close ties to FIFA and its president, Gianni Infantino, has been preparing to anchor a bid potentially including Egypt and Greece.\n\nIt is unclear how Greece would be approved by UEFA to be part of such an unprecedented multi-continent idea that was aired last month and appears to have accelerated the revised European bid.\n\nUEFA president Aleksander Čeferin had a front-row seat for part of the launch though left before the end and no UEFA official formally took part or took questions.\n\nRubiales, who like his Portuguese counterpart Fernando Gomes is a UEFA vice president, said soccer officials in Spain had recent talks with the national government and royal family as part of the process toward teaming with Ukraine.\n\nPavelko said he believed since the first days of the war in February that soccer could help unite the world with Ukraine, which co-hosted Euro 2012 with neighboring Poland. That event had just 16 teams playing in four cities in each country, while the 2030 World Cup will have 48 teams likely needing about 15 venues.\n\nUkraine's ambition increased when the national league that was suspended in February started a new season in August — in stadiums with no fans and bunkers for players and officials to shelter during air raid alerts — and was a popular success.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy then “fully supported that the next step should be the organizing maybe of a big tournament,\" Pavelko said. “We realize that Ukrainian people feel football (is) a good opportunity to come back to normal life.”\n\nA symbolic victory for Ukrainian soccer would be if World Cup games are played in the nation's second most famous stadium, the Donbas Arena in occupied Donetsk that was built ahead of Euro 2012.\n\nThe Shakhtar Donetsk club has been exiled from its home stadium since 2014 when conflict started in eastern Ukraine between pro-Russia separatist groups and government forces.\n\n“We will have enough time to renovate the Donbas Arena,\" Pavelko said, though it is unclear how damaged the 52,000-seat venue has become.\n\nAsked if Ukraine could accept the Russia team playing on its turf in 2030, Pavelko said “it can’t be my personal decision.”\n\nAll Russian teams are currently banned from international competitions for security reasons by UEFA and FIFA, which removed the men's team from 2022 World Cup qualifying playoffs in March. Poland had first refused to play its scheduled game against Russia.\n\nIf Russia is reinstated and then qualified for the 2030 edition, its path through the tournament could be steered in the draw toward playing in Spain and Portugal.\n\nUkrainian teams have continued to play in international competitions with most “home” games organized in Poland.\n\n“I am absolutely sure,” Pavelko said, “that all the boys and girls who are now in the occupied territories of Ukraine will have the chance of playing in these (World Cup) stadiums under the Ukrainian flag.”\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/politics/world-cup-women-pay-what-matters/index.html", "title": "Big moments for women at the men's World Cup | CNN Politics", "text": "A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter.

Read more about the prize money.\n\nFIFA pays bigger awards to the men’s tournament, which draws in more revenue to the international soccer governing body, than to the women’s. The agreement between the US men and women is unique.\n\n“To everyone it should indicate how big the disparity is that FIFA has made between their value of women’s soccer and men’s soccer, and this is the only way that equity could be achieved, if all parties agreed – and they did,” said Briana Scurry, a former US goalkeeper, appearing on CNN Wednesday.\n\nIt’s a moment to congratulate the men\n\nNot only did the US Men’s National Team advance to earn the payday, but they also agreed to this unprecedented pot-splitting with the top American women earlier this year.\n\n“These are Title IX males,” said Christine Brennan, the sports columnist and CNN analyst, referring to the US men’s team during an appearance on “CNN Tonight” on Tuesday. She was referring to the landmark 1972 law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities receiving federal funds. It has revolutionized women’s sports in the US and, Brennan argued, influenced male athletes too.\n\n“They weren’t raised like their dads or their grandfathers. And they have a much different outlook, not only about women’s equality in terms of pay, but these are the same men who’ve been talking about standing with the Iranian protesters,” Brennan said.\n\nShe praised the US Soccer Federation and the Men’s National Team, who have distinguished themselves not only by advancing, but “even more so in terms of our culture and the stands they have taken.”\n\nIt’s a moment to acknowledge where women aren’t thinking about soccer\n\nIranian women, as you’ll know from following coverage of protests in that country and at the World Cup, are fighting for basic rights.\n\nCNN reported on celebrations in Iran at the national team’s loss to the US. From that report:\n\n“I am happy, this is the government losing to the people,” one witness to celebrations in a city in the Kurdish region, who CNN is not naming for security concerns, told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nThe Norway-based Iranian rights group Hengaw posted several videos of similar scenes. “People in Paveh are celebrating Iran’s national team lose over America in World Cup in Qatar, they are chanting ‘Down with Jash (traitors),” Hengaw said in a post.\n\nFIFA is making some moves toward equality\n\nMeanwhile, back in Doha, Qatar, another landmark moment for women in the world’s most popular sport will come Thursday, when the first all-women refereeing team in men’s World Cup history debuts in a pivotal match between Germany and Costa Rica.\n\nStéphanie Frappart, the French lead official, has already overseen matches at the top levels of European club soccer, so, “I know how to deal with it,” she said in a statement released by FIFA. This match, with a potential audience of billions, will show a woman in charge.\n\nIt’s a moment to acknowledge where women are starting to play\n\nIf the US men and women are on the road to some sort of parity – the men still make much, much more from their clubs – there are some women in the Middle East who are just gaining access to the pitch.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s men’s team put in a solid show at this World Cup with their defeat of storied Argentina in the opening round. But the Saudis failed to advance past the group stage after losing to Mexico Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, women in Saudi Arabia were only allowed inside soccer stadiums in 2018, much less play.\n\nAs Saudi Arabia weighs a joint bid to co-host the 2030 men’s World Cup, the kingdom is also in the beginning stages of building a national women’s team. It’ll surely be many years before the Saudi women can be competitive on the world stage, but simply being able to play is certainly progress.\n\nCNN’s Becky Anderson, who is reporting from Doha during this World Cup, talked to the German women’s team legend Monika Staab, who is coaching the nascent Saudi women’s team. She said the kingdom is developing its women through three development academies and wants to host an international tournament in 2026.\n\nStaab said the all-women referee team in Thursday’s match in Qatar will be a powerful symbol for Muslim women watching.\n\n“The women can do like the men,” Staab said on CNN International Wednesday night. “I think that is a big sign for the whole world. We in Saudi Arabia, we play football. That has a great impact on every Muslim girl who wants to play,” Staab said.\n\nPeople are watching\n\nIn the US, women’s soccer has at times been a bigger draw than the men’s game.\n\nAbout 14 million American viewers watched the women’s World Cup final, featuring the winning US team, in 2019. That was more than watched the men’s World Cup final between France and Croatia in 2018, but far below the 20 million who watched the US take on England in the group stage last Saturday across Fox and Telemundo.", "authors": ["Zachary B. Wolf"], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/05/politics/supreme-court-june-opinions/index.html", "title": "Supreme Court has 29 opinions remaining in one-month sprint to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs the Supreme Court rounds the final weeks of the term it has yet to decide an unusually high number of cases including disputes over abortion, gun rights, religious liberty, immigration and the environment – issues that deeply divide the public and exacerbate the ideological split on the 6-3 conservative-liberal court.\n\nJune is always a fraught time at the court, as several justices have openly acknowledged in speeches over the years. But this spring is different. Not only are the nine judges reshaping contours of social issues that drive the public debate, but they are also working to salvage the institutional legitimacy of their own branch of government.\n\nThe court released one opinion Wednesday – on a case involving a US Border Patrol agent – and has 29 remaining.\n\nIn addition, the justices are dealing with unprecedented turmoil triggered by an internal investigation. Last month, Chief Justice John Roberts ordered the Marshal of the Court to find the person who breached internal protocols and leaked the draft opinion that would reverse Roe v. Wade that had been circulating among chambers.\n\nAs a result, according to CNN’s exclusive reporting, the court has taken steps to require law clerks to provide cell phone records and sign affidavits. The process will distract the court from its duties and sow uncertainty – even paranoia.\n\nThe leak, that Roberts himself called “absolutely appalling,” has rattled the justices’ faith in their ability to deliberate. Justice Clarence Thomas – the conservative leader of the court – told an audience last month that justices are now looking over their shoulders, shaken by the breakdown of their institution. He compared the leak to an “infidelity.”\n\nHere are the highlights of the court’s docket:\n\nAbortion\n\nIt was Thomas, the longest serving justice on the current court, who likely assigned fellow conservative Justice Samuel Alito to write the draft majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The dispute concerns a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks. The state is asking the justices to take the giant step of overturning Roe v. Wade, a seminal case decided in 1973 establishing a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability which most experts say occurs now around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAt oral arguments, Mississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart told the justices that Roe and a follow up decision from 1992 “haunt” the country.\n\nAt one time Mississippi’s law was dismissed as blatantly unconstitutional, even by a conservative-leaning appellate court. But much has changed since then, including the fact that in December the justices allowed a six-week ban on abortions in Texas to remain in effect. Since then, red states, invigorated by the Supreme Court’s conservative majority, have passed increasingly restrictive laws. Last month, for example, Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill into law that bans abortions from the stage of “fertilization” and allows private citizens to sue anyone who helps a woman obtain the procedure.\n\nIn the draft opinion, Alito said that Roe “must be overruled.” If the five-member majority holds, it will wipe away near 50-year-old precedent and change the landscape of women’s reproductive health going forward.\n\nSupporters of abortion rights are clinging to the fact that Alito’s opinion was a draft and hope it only reflects an opening salvo written after the justices casted initial votes at conference.\n\nVotes can change during deliberations. Sometimes majority opinions fizzle into concurrences or even dissents. Other justices could be simultaneously working on separate opinions, hoping to pick off votes from Alito’s draft or to weaken the thrust of his opinion.\n\nSecond Amendment\n\nAs the country grapples with gun violence, the justices will decide how broadly they want to rule in a case that could open up a new chapter in constitutional challenges to gun safety laws.\n\nAfter oral arguments last year, it seemed the conservatives were ready to strike down a New York law – enacted more than a century ago – that places restrictions on carrying a concealed weapon outside the home. Supporters of gun rights have been pushing the court to clarify the scope of the Second Amendment for years. The effort has been led by Thomas who in the past called the Second Amendment a “disfavored right in this court.”\n\nBut the entire landscape of the debate has shifted in recent months. Since the justices began deliberating, mass shootings have occurred across the country including a Texas massacre of 19 school children in Texas. While the shootings did not directly implicate the issue of concealed carry, the country as a whole is now debating gun safety laws.\n\nReligious liberty\n\nOn top of abortion and gun rights, the court is also considering cases that could allow more religion in public life.\n\nIn December, they heard arguments concerning a Maine initiative that excludes some religious schools from a tuition assistance program. The program allows parents living in rural areas with no school district to use vouchers to send their children to public or private schools elsewhere. But it came under challenge when some parents wanted to use the vouchers to send their kids to religious schools.\n\nThe court could insist that if a state provides vouchers for public and private education, it cannot exclude schools that teach the curriculum through the lens of faith.\n\nThe justices are also grappling with the case of Joe Kennedy, a former Washington state high school football coach at a public school who lost his job for praying at the 50-yard line after games.\n\nKennedy told CNN that “every American should be able to have faith in public and not be worried about being fired over it.”\n\n“I think it is important to keep our promises – especially to God,” he said.\n\nBut the school district said it suspended Kennedy to avoid the appearance that the school was endorsing a particular faith, in violation of the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.\n\nThe liberal justices on the court – Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor –made clear at oral arguments that they were worried about players feeling coerced by the school to pray.\n\n“I’m going to just sort of suggest,” Kagan began “the idea of why the school can discipline him is that it puts some kind of undue pressure, a kind of coercion, on students to participate in religious activities when they may not wish to, when their religion is different or when they have no religion,” she said.\n\nImmigration\n\nAs the political branches spar over immigration, the justices are considering several cases concerning border disputes.\n\nIn one case, a group of Republican-led states are seeking to step in and defend a controversial Trump-era immigration policy, a version of which the Biden administration abandoned. The policy – an expansion of the “public charge rule” – has been excised by the Biden administration.\n\nThe case does not center on the legality of the rule, but, instead, whether the Biden administration followed proper procedures when it set out to revoke the rule and dismiss pending legal challenges. The Trump policy made it more difficult for immigrants to obtain legal status if they use certain public benefits such as Medicaid, food stamps and housing vouchers. The justices could reinvigorate legal challenges.\n\nIn a separate dispute, the justices are grappling with whether the Biden administration can terminate a Trump-era border policy known as “Remain in Mexico.” Lower courts have so far blocked Biden from ending the policy.\n\nUnder the unprecedented program launched in 2019, the Department of Homeland Security can send certain-non Mexican citizens who entered the United States back to Mexico – instead of detaining them or releasing them into the United States – while their immigration proceedings played out. Critics call the policy inhumane and say it exposes asylum seekers with credible claims to dangerous and squalid conditions. The case raises questions not only regarding immigration law, but also a president’s control over policy and his diplomatic relationships with neighboring countries.\n\nClimate change\n\nThe justices unexpectedly also agreed to decide a case concerning the EPA’s authority to regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants, in a dispute that could cripple the Biden administration’s attempts to slash emissions. It comes at a moment when scientists are sounding alarms about the accelerating pace of global warming.\n\nThe court’s decision to step in now concerned environmentalists because there is currently no rule in place. A lower court wiped away a Trump era rule in 2021 and the Biden administration’s EPA is currently working on a new rule.\n\nBut the fact that there were enough votes to take up the issue now, struck some as an aggressive grant, signaling the court wants to limit the scope of the EPA’s authority even before a new rule is on the books.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue"], "publish_date": "2022/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/23/us/five-things-october-23-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know on October 23, 2022: Start your week smart: China ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe 2022 midterm elections are now just weeks away, and with control of both chambers of Congress and dozens of governorships, secretaries of state and attorneys general posts on the line, it’s important to know both how and when to vote in your state.

My eyes burned terribly. Moscow-Samara train. Oily smell all over the car. Departure has already been delayed by 30 minutes. I’ll try to wash off. (The attacker) shouted: ‘Muratov, here’s to you for our boys.’”\n\nA spokeswoman for the newspaper, which last month announced that it was suspending publication until the end of the war in Ukraine, told CNN that Muratov’s eyes “seem to be ok.”\n\nEarlier this week, Muratov told CNN’s “Amanpour” show that his team were “forced” to stop operating due to “military censorship.”\n\nDuring the interview, Muratov said it was “impossible to look at” photos from scenes from Mariupol, Melitopol, Bucha and other Ukrainian communities, adding that: “This will become a huge case study of what dictatorship means.”\n\nFor the past 20 years, Russian people have been subjected to “total propaganda,” he said, the effect of which was “the same as radiation.”\n\n“This propaganda has won a victory but not over everyone,” he added.\n\nMuratov said by the Kremlin’s own estimation some 25 million Russians are against the “special operation” in Ukraine, but that his organization estimates that figure to be as high as half the population. As of July 2021, Russia’s population was estimated at around 142 million.\n\n“Those who refuse to be zombies, that half of the country is for peace and against war,” he told CNN.\n\nLast month, Muratov revealed plans to auction off his Nobel Peace Prize medal to support Ukrainian refugees.\n\nIn a statement published on the newspaper’s website, Muratov said the droves of “wounded and sick children” requiring “urgent treatment” compelled him to offer up the prestigious medal.", "authors": ["Uliana Pavlova Anna Chernova Lianne Kolirin", "Uliana Pavlova", "Anna Chernova", "Lianne Kolirin"], "publish_date": "2022/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/10/06/ican-just-won-nobel-peace-prize-what-ican/738744001/", "title": "ICAN: What is this year's Nobel Peace Prize winner?", "text": "ICAN, a little-known organization that campaigns to abolish nuclear weapons, won this year's Nobel Peace Prize.

It is now headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and operates in more than 100 countries.\n\nWhat does ICAN do?\n\nICAN is an umbrella group comprised of hundreds of non-governmental organizations that push for abolishing nuclear weapons. It lobbies the United Nations and national governments, and runs nuclear-awareness campaigns and events. ICAN campaigned for the United Nations' Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\n\nWhy did ICAN win the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded ICAN the prize \"for its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition.\"\n\nIt seems likely the committee was trying to make a political point in light of the standoff between the United States and North Korea over the latter's nuclear ambitions, as well as the possibility President Trump could pull the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nFrom ICAN:\n\nThe prize \"sends a message to all nuclear-armed states and all states that continue to rely on nuclear weapons for security that it is unacceptable behavior. We will not support it, we will not make excuses for it, we can’t threaten to indiscriminately slaughter hundreds of thousands of civilians in the name of security. That’s not how you build security,\" the group's executive director Beatrice Fihn said.\n\nFrom the European Union:\n\n\"We share a strong commitment to achieving the objective of a world free from nuclear weapons,\" Federica Mogherini, the political bloc's top diplomat, said on Twitter. Mogherini was involved in brokering a deal to contain Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nFrom President Trump:\n\nThere hasn't been one.

But experts in the fields of peace and security warn that the bleak geopolitical picture may muddle 2022’s award.\n\n“Sometimes, it’s hard to figure out who might get the prize because there are so many possible candidates,” said Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)\n\n“This year, it’s hard to figure out who might get the prize because there’s so little good that is happening in the world of peace and security,” Smith told CNN.\n\nThe Nobels are notoriously difficult to predict, and the thought process behind each selection is shrouded in secrecy. But experts have highlighted a short list of frontrunners – while reserving the right to be surprised by a left-field decision.\n\nThe impact of the war in Ukraine\n\nNo peace prize was awarded throughout most of the First and Second World Wars, and on a handful of other occasions. But the prize has frequently been used to highlight other ongoing conflicts, or to provide a beacon of hope when the world encountered grim times.\n\nThat question will have been front and center among decision makers in Oslo, Norway, who have been tasked with picking a symbol of peacemaking even as a bordering country wages war on the continent.\n\nThe conflict “would weigh enormously on their minds,” Smith said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky sits atop many bookmakers’ list of favorites to win the prize, and some companies also list as frontrunners the general population of Ukraine and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which has aided people displaced by the war.\n\nThere have been previous occasions where the committee has become involved in ongoing conflicts.\n\n“Sometimes the prize is about sending a message in a quite specific sense,” Smith said. He cited the 1993 award to Nelson Mandela and Frederik Willem de Klerk, who at the time were negotiating for South Africa’s first open elections following the end of apartheid.\n\n“That process was ongoing and the committee at the time wanted to influence it,” he explained.\n\nBut bookmakers’ odds are rarely a reliable guide to the victor, experts say, because they tend to overstate the relevance of topical events.\n\nAnd an award that directly wades into the Ukraine conflict is considered unlikely.\n\n“Zelensky is a war leader, and what is happening at the moment is war. You can admire or not admire the action he’s undertaking, but it’s about war and the armed defense of his country,” Smith said. “That’s a fact that should be respected in and of itself.”\n\n“Hopefully, the war will come to an end and they will make peace,” he added. “If Zelensky or somebody else can contribute to making that peace, then there will be time to acknowledge that enormous achievement.”\n\nKremlin critics highly tipped\n\nCritics of the Russian regime and its allies are among those many expect to clinch the award.\n\nAlexey Navalny, the Kremlin critic and opposition leader who was sentenced to jail on fraud charges by a Moscow court this year, features atop many experts’ predictions.\n\nNavalny is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most prominent domestic critic, and his dissenting views have nearly cost him his life. He was poisoned with a nerve agent in 2020, an attack several Western officials and Navalny himself openly blamed on the Kremlin. Russia has denied any involvement.\n\nAfter a five-month stay in Germany recovering from the Novichok poisoning, Navalny last year returned to Moscow, where he was immediately arrested for violating probation terms imposed from a 2014 case.\n\nRussian opposition leader Alexey Navalny stands near law enforcement agents in the building that housed his Anti-Corruption Foundation in Moscow in 2019. DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBut some expect even his path to the award to be a narrow one. “Navalny I think is heroic, (but) he’s a political leader,” Smith said. That has not stopped some politicians, like US President Barack Obama, from being honored, but with Navalny imprisoned his opportunity for real-world peace-making may be considered too small.\n\n“It’s a prize that is to be awarded not for how great you are, but for how great the things you’ve done are,” Smith said.\n\nBelarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya is also generally seen as a strong contender. The dissident was forced into exile in Lithuania after running against strongman leader and Putin ally Alexander Lukashenko in an August 2020 election denounced by the international community as neither free nor fair.\n\nA joint win for Tsikhanouskaya and Navalny is predicted by Henrik Urdal, the director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, who draws up a shortlist of frontrunners for the prize annually.\n\n“Both Tsikhanouskaya and Navalny are vocal critics of the Russian invasion of Ukraine,” Urdal wrote this year. “A shared Nobel Peace Prize between them would be seen as a clear protest of the Russian aggression and the assistance by Belarus, and as support of democratic and non-violent alternatives to Lukashenko and Putin.”\n\nBelarusian opposition politician Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya on a visit to Denmark to receive the Politiken Freedom Prize in 2020. EMIL HELMS/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images\n\nA surprise is possible\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize is not always a reactionary award, and a strong possibility remains that the committee will look beyond the current geopolitical climate and highlight another field.\n\nSome suggested the Covid-19 pandemic, which has rocked global security for the past two years, would factor into the mindsets of Nobel decision makers over the past two years – but instead, awards in 2020 and 2021 highlighted food insecurity and threats to press freedom, respectively.\n\nThis could be the year that efforts to end the pandemic are recognized – but it would set a drastic precedent since no previous awards have specifically focused on the arena of public health, Smith said.\n\nWhen there are few obvious individuals expected to win, global institutions have frequently benefited. The United Nations, and several of its related humanitarian bodies, have earned the trophy, most recently the World Food Programme in 2020.\n\nUrdal has suggested the International Court of Justice (ICJ) as a winner this year, should the committee decide to highlight conflict resolution.\n\n“While a Nobel Peace Prize to ICJ would largely be seen as uncontroversial, on March 16 the court ordered Russia to ‘immediately suspend the military operations’ in Ukraine. The Nobel Committee could emphasize this ruling as an attempt to stop the illegal war,” he wrote.\n\nThe prize has honored the fight against climate change in the past, and it is a theme the decision-makers could return to. Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images\n\nUrdal also suggested Indian human rights activist Harsh Mander as a winner, and raised pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong and figures resisting China’s suppression of Uyghurs as other names worthy of recognition.\n\nThe committee may alternatively return to the theme of climate change if they struggle to find a peace-making accomplishment achieved in the past year. Teenage campaigner Greta Thunberg is perennially raised as a contender, along with several other climate activists.\n\nBut there remains a high likelihood that the name – or names – read out on Friday will be little-known to experts or viewers.\n\n“One thing the peace committee has been quite good at doing, when it wants to, has been to really surprise us all,” Smith said. He raised Nadia Murad’s win in 2018 for working to end sexual violence as one such example.\n\n“Perhaps they will take somebody who has been working quietly and without a lot of visibility for peace – maybe at a community level – and focus attention on that,” he suggested. “I quite admire them for the way that they do that.”", "authors": ["Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/10/nobel-peace-prize-2019-greta-thunberg-among-favorites-win/3919704002/", "title": "Nobel Peace Prize 2019: Greta Thunberg among favorites to win", "text": "The Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the winner, or winners, of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize Friday in Oslo, Norway.\n\nThe prize is awarded annually to the person or organization that has \"done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\"\n\nLast year, the five-person Norwegian committee awarded the coveted prize to Denis Mukwege from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nadia Murad from Iraq for their work to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict.\n\nThe announcement of the prize’s winner follows Thursday’s 2018 and 2019 literature prize, which was suspended last year after sex abuse allegations.\n\nAccording to the Nobel Institute, there are 301 candidates for this year’s prize, out of which 223 are individuals and 78 are organizations.\n\nThe names of Nobel Peace Prize nominees aren't revealed until 50 years after the prize is awarded, however, these are a few predicted frontrunners:\n\nGreta Thunberg\n\nThe teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg led millions of people around the world in the biggest climate strike in history. An estimated total of 4 to 7.6 million people participated in September's Global Climate Strike, which took place before the 2019 UN Summit. At the congregation, the 16-year-old Swede berated world leaders for not doing enough to stop climate change.\n\n\"We are in the beginning of mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?” she said.\n\nHer first address to the UN took place in Poland at the United Nations COP24 Climate Summit last year, where talks culminated to nearly 200 nations agreeing to rules that will govern the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nLast month, Thunberg won the Right Livelihood award, often referred to as the \"Alternative Nobel,\" for \"inspiring and amplifying political demands for urgent climate action reflecting scientific facts.\"\n\nJacinda Ardern\n\nNew Zealand's 40th prime minister Jacinda Ardern was catapulted into the international spotlight after a mass shooter terrorized two Christchurch mosques, killing 50 people and injuring dozens more in March.\n\nIn weeks after the attack, she led lawmakers to vote 119 to one to ban most automatic and semi-automatic weapons. She simultaneously promised her nation's parliament that she wouldn't promote the shooter's notoriety and refused to repeat his name.\n\nArdern is New Zealand's youngest leader in decades and was the second elected leader to give birth while still in office.\n\nAbiy Ahmed\n\nThe Ethiopian prime minister clinched a peace deal last year that ended 20 years of military stalemate between his country and their northern neighbor Eritrea. According to TIME, at least 70,000 people were killed since the border disputes began in 1998, five years after Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia.\n\nAlthough thousands of political prisoners have been freed since Ahmed took office in April 2018, Ethiopia's internal issues still divide the country.\n\nReporters without Borders\n\nReporters without Borders (RSF) is the largest non-government organization that specializes in defending media freedom. They were at the forefront of voices who spoke out against Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi's brutal murder inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last year.\n\nRSF has organized a petition that calls on the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to release the 28 journalists and bloggers that are currently detained. According to their website, the number of imprisoned journalists has doubled in Saudi Arabia since the crown prince was appointed in 2017.\n\nRaoni Metuktire\n\nRaoni Metuktire, an indigenous chief from the Kayapó tribe in Brazil, was nominated by a number of environmental activists for his work protecting the Amazon rainforest, according to Reuters.\n\nThe 89-year-old, first introduced to the world in the late 1980s by British musician Sting, resurfaced to the limelight this year as the Amazon rainforest was on fire. The Brazilian chief met twice with French president Emmanuel Macron, Reuters reported, who stemmed the international campaign to bring awareness to the burning rainforest.\n\nAlexis Tsipras and Zoran Zaev\n\nThe Nobel committee could also choose to acknowledge the joint leadership of Greece's Alexis Tsipras and North Macedonia's Zoran Zaev. The two prime ministers put 30 years of acrimony between their neighboring countries behind them when they agreed that the former Yugoslav republic should officially be renamed from Macedonia to North Macedonia and Greece should drop its objections to its neighbor joining NATO.\n\nContributing: Associated Press.

Last year's prize was scooped by the European Union.\n\nJustifying its decision, the committee said: \"The conventions and the work of the OPCW have defined the use of chemical weapons as a taboo under international law. Recent events in Syria, where chemical weapons have again been put to use, have underlined the need to enhance the efforts to do away with such weapons.\"\n\nHowever, the committee underlined the point that the award was not directly linked to the group's recent work in Syria, but a result of its long-standing efforts to eradicate the use of chemical weapons that have threatened battlefields since World War One.\n\nThere was some light wrist-slapping in the statement, too. \"Certain states have not observed the deadline, which was April 2012, for destroying their chemical weapons. This applies especially to the USA and Russia,\" the committee said.\n\nAnalysts were equivocal about the decision.\n\nPaul Schulte, senior visiting fellow in the Centre for Defense Studies at King's College London, said: \"It's motivational rather than for what the organization has already achieved in Syria. It's a good thing, I think, because it will improve its legitimacy and standing in the world. But the OPCW has not yet faced a major test.\"\n\nAbdulwahab Sayed Omar, a Syrian opposition activist based in London, said: \"Any effort to eliminate weapons of mass destruction, whether it be chemical or otherwise is an effort worth praising.\" However, \"Nobody in Syria is celebrating this recognition at the moment, because while chemical weapons are a major threat, what are we doing to prevent conventional weapons being used against people on a daily basis?\"\n\nAhmet Uzumcu, the OPCW's director-general, told Norway's NRK broadcaster — the media group predicted, correctly, that the OPCW would win this year's prize — that it is \"an acknowledgement of our staff's efforts, who are now deployed in Syria, who have been, in fact, making a very brave effort there to fulfill their mandate.\" He said also that the award confirmed work the group has done for over a decade.\n\nSpeaking in the Hague, Uzumcu said recent events in Syria were a reminder that there was \"much work to be done.\"\n\nIt is not clear what the OPCW intends to do with the $1.2 million prize money.\n\nPakistani teen Malala Yousafzai and Denis Mukwege of the Congo, a gynecologist and surgeon, were favored to win the prize.\n\nImmediately following the announcement, Razi Baloch, 19, a student in Quetta, Pakistan, said: \"I feel that Malala never needed a Nobel Peace Prize rather the Peace Prize needed her,\" adding, \"Her courage and determination have made us stand strong against the ills of our society where women are treated as mere objects.\"\n\nA tweet that was sent out in Malala's name from the Malala Fund's Twitter account congratulated the OPCW on its work.\n\nThe OPCW has been working to eradicate chemical weapons for the past 16 years and has carried out thousands of inspections of chemical weapons in over 80 countries. It has 189 members — who fund the group — and was formed in 1997 to enforce the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\nSyria is expected to be the 190th member of the OPCW when it joins, possibly as early as Monday.\n\nIn an amusing twist, the Nobel committee was initially unable to reach the OPCW to inform it of the news.\n\nOther contenders for the annual prize included Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning, the Army private sentenced to 35 years in military prison for leaking classified documents; and Maggie Gobran, the founder of a children's charity in Cairo, sometimes referred to as the 'Mother Teresa' of Egypt's slums.\n\nKim Hjelmgaard reported from London; Naila Inayat reported from Lahore, Pakistan; Jesse Singal reported from Berlin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/10/05/nobel-peace-prize-denis-mukwege-nadia-murad/1531727002/", "title": "Nobel Peace Prize: Denis Mukwege, Nadia Murad win 2018 accolade", "text": "A Congolese doctor who has been a fierce critic of his government's treatment of victims of sexual violence and a Yazidi Kurdish activist who was held captive and raped by members of the Islamic State group are the winners of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said Friday.\n\nDenis Mukwege, 63, and Nadia Murad, 25, were jointly awarded the accolade for \"their efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict.\"\n\nMukwege is a gynecologist who has treated thousands of women with extreme sexual injuries perpetrated by rebel groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The aim was to exterminate them. Murad was held by Islamic State militants for three months before escaping. They threatened her with execution if she did not convert to their version of Islam. Hundreds of people from her village were massacred. Since her escape, Murad has chosen to speak openly about the sexual abuses she suffered.\n\nMurad now lives in Germany after arriving there as a refugee.\n\n\"For myself, I think of my mother, who was murdered by DAESH (the Arabic term for Islamic State), the children with whom I grew up, and what we must do to honor them,\" she said in a statement. \"Persecution of minorities must end.

After Amini's death, Iran passed a new \"hijab and chastity\" law that comes with fines and lengthy prison terms for breaking it.\n\nIranian state news agency Fars dismissed the significance of the peace prize, saying that Mohammadi had \"received the prize from Westerners\" and that she was jailed because of her \"acts against national security.\"\n\nWho is Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi?\n\nMohammadi has been imprisoned almost continuously since 2010, though she has managed despite those circumstances to continue her work highlighting rights abuses in Iran.\n\nHer husband and children live in exile in France.\n\nShe is the vice president of Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran, a banned organization in Iran that was co-founded by Shirin Ebadi, another peace prize recipient − Iran's first, and the first female laureate from the Islamic world − in 2003. Ebadi is a human rights lawyer and Mohammadi's mentor.\n\nMohammadi is being held at Tehran's notorious Evin Prison, known for overcrowding and other abusive conditions and whose inmates include political prisoners and those with Western ties, including several Americans who were recently freed as part of a prisoner exchange with Iran.\n\nAmericans freed from Iran:Here are their stories\n\nShe has been a target of Iranian authorities for more than 25 years.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nIt was an all-male lineup of laureates for last year’s Nobel Prizes in medicine, physics and chemistry, awards which grant the recipients entry to the most prestigious club in science.\n\nThat none of the 2021 winners in those categories were female was, for some critics, more evidence of systemic bias in science, with women already less likely to be given credit or named as lead author on scientific papers despite more and more women participating in scientific research.\n\nHowever, others say last year was a blip in a broadly positive trend, pointing to a lag effect that results from the Nobel committee typically honoring advances that happened three or four decades ago, when there were fewer women in senior positions in scientific fields.\n\nDavid Pendlebury, a senior analyst at Clarivate, analyzes how often a scientist’s key papers are cited by peers, which he says is an indicator of whether a person will win a Nobel Prize.\n\n“Two decades ago it would be rare than I would find a woman, for example, to designate as a citation laureate, but as we move forward in time, we find there are more women… in the top ranks of researchers,” he said ahead of the 2022 Nobel Prize announcements next week. A citation laureate is someone considered likely to win a Nobel Prize. “That’s why I say it’s inevitable that the Nobel Prize is going to be given to more and more women.. and it will be geographically more diverse.”\n\nIn 2020, two women, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna, won the Nobel Prize in chemistry, for the development of the CRISPR method for genome editing, while Andrea Ghez was part of a trio that won the Nobel Prize in physics for the discovery of a supermassive blackhole. Winners in 2019, when the Nobel committee asked nominators to consider diversity in gender, geography and field, were all men, while 2018 saw the first female winner for physics since 1963, Donna Strickland.\n\nIt’s notoriously tricky to predict who will win a Nobel Prize, an honor established by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel more than a century ago. The short list is secret, as are the nominators, and documents revealing the details of the selection process are sealed from public view for 50 years. However, there’s no shortage of worthy female candidates to be the next science laureates. Here are five female scientists and the life-changing discoveries they have made.\n\nMary-Claire King, right, the American geneticist who identified a gene that increases vulnerability to breast cancer when in its mutated form in Jerusalem, Sept. 7, 2014. Rina Castelnuovo/The New York Times/Redux\n\nCancer-causing genes: In the 1970s, while it was understood that cancer sometimes ran in families, cancer research was focused on viruses. With a background in researching the genetic differences between humans and chimpanzees, Dr. Mary-Claire King, now a professor of medicine and of genome sciences at the University of Washington School of Medicine, took a fresh approach. She discovered the role a mutation of the BRCA1 gene played in breast and ovarian cancer. The discovery has enabled genetic testing that can identify women who are at increased risk of breast cancer, as well as steps to reduce their risk, such as additional screening and preventive surgeries.\n\nKatalin Kariko played a key role in the development mRNA vaccines. Hannah Yoon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nVaccine breakthrough: Dr. Katalin Karikó, a senior vice president at BioNTech based in Germany, won a 2021 Lasker award, an honor which is often seen as a precursor to the Nobel prize. Along with Drew Weissman, a professor in vaccine research at the University of Pennsylvania, she pioneered a method of using synthetic messenger RNA to fight disease that involves changing the way the body produces virus-fighting material. While their paper received little attention when first published in 2005, their research is now the basis of two widely used Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nAcclaimed Northern Irish astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell Burnell discovered the pulsar.

However, it was her supervisor Antony Hewish, who shared the Nobel Prize in physics in 1974, who got credit for the discovery. In interviews, Bell Burnell has been magnanimous about being overlooked, saying she was proud the stars she observed had convinced the prize committee. “My contemporaries were more upset about the Nobel than I was not to be recognised. One of them labelled it the ‘No-Bell’ prize!” she said in an interview. In 2018, she was awarded a Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, for which she received 2.3 million pounds. She donated the money toward helping people from underrepresented groups become physicists.\n\nCarolyn Bertozzi, a chemist at Stanford, at the Grace Science headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., Nov. 17, 2019. James Tensuan/The New York Times/Redux\n\nRevolutionary chemistry: Dr. Carolyn Bertozzi, a professor at Stanford University, has pioneered a new field called bioorthogonal chemistry, which focuses on chemical reactions within living cells that can be conducted without interfering in innate cellular processes. She sought to understand why cells are coated in sugar and how these sugar molecules contribute to conditions such as cancer, inflammation and bacterial infection. Modifying these cells through biorthogonal chemistry has led to new ways to treat many diseases. She won this year’s Wolf Prize for chemistry and is also an active campaigner for LGBT rights.\n\nThe work of Dr. Marilyn Gaston, left, ensured that children are screened for sickle cell disease at birth. Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nPreventing sickle cell disease: Dr. Marilyn Hughes Gaston dedicated much of her life to understanding sickle cell disease, an inherited condition in which the body is unable to produce normal hemoglobin. Affecting children, it results in tissue damage, causing weakness and even death. Gaston became interested in the condition while interning at Philadelphia General Hospital in 1964. In 1986, she published the results of a groundbreaking national study that proved the effectiveness of giving children with sickle cell disease long-term penicillin treatment to prevent septic infections resulting from the disease. As a result of Gaston’s work, every child is screened for sickle cell disease at birth. She was also the first African American to direct the US Bureau of Primary Health Care.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine will be announced on Monday, followed by the physics prize on Tuesday and the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday.

It is the largest strike in the RCN’s 106-year history.\n\nBut it comes after several years of hardship for employees of Britain’s National Health Service (NHS), a revered but beleaguered institution that is straining due to staffing shortfalls, sky-high demand and stretched funding.\n\n“I went into nursing to care for patients, and over the years my capacity to provide the level of care my patients deserve has been compromised,” Andrea Mackay, who has worked as a nurse for seven years at a hospital in southwest England, told CNN on her reasons for striking Thursday.\n\n“The reality is, every day, nurses across the UK are walking into understaffed hospitals,” Mackay said. “The NHS has been running on the compassion and goodwill of nurses for years … It is unsustainable.”\n\n“It’s about paying staff what they’re worth so they can pay the bills,” Jessie Collins, a pediatric nurse preparing to join the strike, told CNN, adding that staffing pressures have crippled the emergency department she regularly works in. “During one of my worst shifts I was the only nurse to 28 unwell children … it’s not safe and we cannot deliver the care that these children need at times,” she said.\n\nPamela Jones, on the picket line outside Aintree University Hospital in Liverpool, told PA Media: “I’m striking today because I’ve been nursing for 32 years; within those 32 years the changes have been astronomical.\n\n“I feel really sorry for the young girls who are now trying to get into the profession, they have to pay for their training. The public need to understand the pressures that everyone’s under. You’ve only got to come into A&E and see the queues, there’s no beds.\n\n“We want to save our NHS, we don’t want it to go, and I think this is the way forward, it’s the only way we can put our point across. We don’t want to be here. I was really torn about striking because it’s not something I’ve ever, ever thought in my lifetime I’d ever had to do, but yet the government has pushed us to this.”\n\nShe added: “I hope the government listens, because none of us want to be here, we just want a fair pay rise.”\n\nEmma Sudol, a nurse at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, told PA Media how since she qualified three years ago the situation had worsened and described the working conditions in her department as “scary” and “dangerous” for both staff and patients.\n\n“It’s definitely scary. It’s scary for us because our registrations are on the line and we’re being put in a position where it isn’t safe,” Ms. Sudol said.\n\n“We can’t give the care we want to, or should be giving, and I feel like it’s dangerous for us and it’s dangerous for the public.\n\n“Because of the conditions, more people are leaving nursing and they’re not replacing them, so the problem is snowballing.”\n\nThe NHS has come under increasing pressure in recent years. Victoria Jones/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nYears of disputes\n\nThe strike is taking place on two days – Thursday and next Tuesday – and not every NHS Trust will take part. But it marks one of the most dramatic uses of industrial action in the 74-year history of the NHS, and has intensified debate over the state of Britain’s public services.\n\nThe RCN is calling for a pay rise of 5% above retail inflation, which on current figures amounts to a 19% hike, and for the government to fill a record number of staff vacancies that, it argues, is jeopardizing patient safety. Steve Barclay, the UK’s health secretary, told CNN in a statement earlier this week that their demand is “not affordable.”\n\nThe standoff follows years of disputes over the level of pay for NHS employees. Nurses’ pay dropped 1.2% every year between 2010 and 2017 once inflation was taken into account, according to the Health Foundation, a UK charity that campaigns for better health and health care. For the first three of those years, their pay was frozen.\n\nThe number of patients waiting for care has meanwhile sky-rocketed, a years-long trend that has been exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nA record 7.2 million people in England – more than one in eight residents – are currently waiting for treatment, according to the British Medical Association. Seven years ago, the figure was 3.3 million.\n\n“I work alongside some amazing (nurses) who have come in early, left late, worked through breaks and lunch, agreed to come in on their days off for an overtime shift to make sure their patients are kept as safe as we can manage,” Mackay told CNN.\n\n“I don’t have all the answers and I understand that there is a limit to the money available, but unless the government prioritize health, patient safety, (and) strengthening the workforce then the NHS is going to collapse,” she said.\n\nThe NHS, which is free at the point of care, forms a central part of Britain’s national psyche and third rail of the country’s politics. During the early weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic, thousands of Britons stood outside their homes to applaud NHS workers, in a weekly ritual championed by the government.\n\nBut that has since been criticized as an empty gesture by disgruntled employees, who say the government’s pay offers to staff have not represented the same spirit.\n\nBritons applauded NHS workers during the early weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic. Christopher Furlong/Getty Images\n\nEarlier this year, the RCN rejected an offer by the government to increase nurses’ pay by a minimum of £1,400 ($1,707) a year, which amounted to an average rise of 4.3%, well below the rate of inflation.\n\n“I have nursed patients who can remember life before the NHS. They know how precious it is because they have seen what went before,” Mackay said.\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer attacked Rishi Sunak on the strike during Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, telling him that “the whole country would breathe a sigh of relief” if he halted the strike by striking a deal with the RCN.\n\nThe industrial action was a “a badge of shame for this government,” Starmer said.\n\nA winter of discontent\n\nMost of the nurses taking part in Thursday’s action will be striking for the first time in their lives. But they are joining workers across Britain’s public services in walking out of work and demanding increased pay and conditions, furthering a swelling tide of strikes unlike any seen in the UK for decades.\n\nEmployees on Britain’s railways, buses, highways and borders are taking industrial action this month, bringing various forms of travel essentially to a standstill. Teachers, postal workers, baggage handlers and paramedics are all also due to strike in December.\n\nIt has left the government scrambling to respond. Members of Britain’s armed forces were being trained to drive ambulances and firefight in the event of strike action, ministers said earlier this month. On Tuesday, the Police Federation said it opposed a request to have police officers drive ambulances.\n\nAnd unions have threatened more action in the New Year, when a cost-of-living crisis that has clouded Britain in recent months is expected to worsen still.\n\nA total of 417,000 working days were lost to strikes in October, the most recent month for which figures are available, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That is the highest number for any month since 2011.\n\nThe impact of those strikes has led parts of the British media to rekindle memories of the so-called Winter of Discontent in 1978 and 1979, when demonstrations brought the UK to a standstill – though this year’s level of industrial action constitutes a fraction of those months, where several million working days were lost.\n\nSunak has been accused by opposition parties of refusing to negotiate with unions in good faith, and not doing enough to prevent strikes from going ahead.\n\nBut the ongoing disputes are a thorny issue for both major parties. Labour – a party with strong historic links to trades unions – has been walking a tightrope, urging the government to do more but refusing to explicitly support the demands of picketers.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/10/02/kaiser-permanente-labor-strike-update-2023/71035191007/", "title": "Why are Kaiser Permanente workers going on strike?

The contract ended Saturday and the two sides have not reached a new deal despite talks in recent days.\n\nThe unions accuse Kaiser executives of bad faith bargaining, which they say interferes with solutions to Kaiser's staffing crisis. Unless the two sides reach an agreement, workers will organize strike lines Wednesday morning at Kaiser hospitals and medical offices in the six states and Washington, union officials said.\n\nThe strike will involve a range of positions, including vocational nurses, nursing assistants, emergency department technicians, radiology technicians, ultrasound sonographers, respiratory therapists, X-ray technicians, dietary services, behavioral health workers, surgical technicians, pharmacy technicians, transporters, home health aides, phlebotomists, medical assistants, teleservice workers and housekeepers. About 400 registered nurses at Kaiser's Moreno Valley Medical Center location in Southern California plan to strike as well, according to Renée Saldaña, a spokeswoman for SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, one of the unions.\n\nKaiser Permanente officials said the two sides have made progress in certain areas and have agreed to continue talks through Tuesday.\n\n\"We continue to make progress on key issues such as a redesigned performance sharing plan with updated payout opportunities,\" Kaiser said in a statement. \"We reached tentative agreements in four key areas: travel for continuing education, the use of temporary workers such as traveling nurses, tracking of staffing vacancies and dispute resolution.\"\n\nWhat would a strike mean for patients?\n\nKaiser said operations remain normal at hospitals and health facilities even though the contract has lapsed.\n\nShould workers strike this week, Kaiser said hospitals and emergency departments will remain open and the health provider will enact contingency plans \"to ensure members continue to receive safe, high-quality care for the duration of the strike.\"\n\nLooming health care walkout:Kaiser strike authorized by unions in 4 states; 3 more may follow\n\nWorker demands: Better pay, shared bonuses\n\nThe unions want Kaiser to improve staffing levels that worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic and address demands on wages and benefits, union officials told USA TODAY.\n\nThe Kaiser unions seek a four-year contract with pay hikes of 7% during the first two years and 6.25% in years three and four. The unions want workers to be eligible for an annual performance bonus that would equal a percentage of their annual wages if goals are met. In past years, workers have been eligible for bonuses of up to 3% of wages if all performance goals are met.\n\nIn an earlier statement, Kaiser said it has proposed a minimum bonus payment \"to protect our employees from receiving no payout.\" Bonuses are based on performance measures such as quality, patient safety and financial performance. Over the past three years, Kaiser said it paid $276 million in bonuses and another $800 million in housing and child care aid and COVID-19 paid leave for illnesses and exposure.\n\nWhat to know about COVIDas hospitalizations go up and some places bring back masks\n\nKaiser and the unions formed a labor-management partnership about 25 years ago after contentious bargaining and strife in the 1980s and 1990s, with the goal of smoother negotiations. That partnership worked well for years, said Dave Regan, president of SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, but front-line workers say the partnership has deteriorated over the past five years.\n\nThe union proposed managers and front-line workers annual bonuses be evaluated on similar criteria. Over the past year, managers received bonuses while front-line workers did not, union officials said.\n\nOn Labor Day, nearly two dozen union members were arrested and released after a march and protest that ended at Kaiser Permanente hospital in Hollywood. The union members were calling attention to what they describe as unsafe staffing levels.\n\nKen Alltucker is on X, formerly Twitter, at @kalltucker, or can be emailed at alltuck@usatoday.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/10/04/kaiser-workers-plan-strike-over-pay-staffing-concerns/71047871007/", "title": "Kaiser Permanente strike: Why over 75K workers walked off the job", "text": "More than 75,000 Kaiser Permanente health care workers and support staff walked off the job Wednesday in several states and Washington, D.C., picketing outside dozens of facilities in a three-day action union officials were calling the largest health care employee strike in American history.\n\nKaiser is one of the nation's largest insurers and health providers, with 39 hospitals nationwide.\n\nThe Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions said the walkout is to protest \"unfair labor practices and unsafe staffing levels\" at hundreds of Kaiser hospitals and facilities.

The contract ended Saturday, and the two sides had not agreed on a new deal by Wednesday morning.\n\nEarly Wednesday, employees formed strike lines to picket outside Kaiser hospitals and medical offices in California, Colorado, Washington and Oregon during the planned three-day action, union officials said. Workers in Virginia and Washington launched a one-day strike.\n\nIn California, Kaiser's largest market, workers picketed at more than two dozen facilities from Los Angeles to the San Francisco Bay Area. In Los Angeles, workers raised their hands and fists while others waved signs with slogans such as \"respect and value health care workers\" and \"Kaiser: Put patients first.\"\n\nTami Chew, a 17-year Kaiser veteran, joined colleagues picketing in front of the Roseville, California, hospital as motorists honked their horns in support of the workers. Chew is a senior health plan representative, consulting with patients and doctors to help navigate health care options.\n\nOver the past four years, Chew said, her department's staff of 13 has been trimmed to six, and three satellite offices in neighboring communities have closed. The cuts mean patients wait longer for her department to process cases, Chew said.\n\n\"Kaiser executives made the decision to close three of the offices, and we only have one now,\" Chew said. \"So access is a problem for our patients.\"\n\nThe strike involves a wide range of health care and support workers a patient might encounter during a visit: vocational nurses, certified nursing assistants, emergency department technicians, radiology technicians, ultrasound sonographers, respiratory therapists, X-ray technicians, optometrists, dietary service workers, behavioral health employees, surgical technicians, pharmacy technicians, transporters, home health aides, phlebotomists, medical assistants, dental assistants, call center and teleservice workers and housekeepers.\n\nAbout 400 registered nurses at Kaiser's Moreno Valley Medical Center location in Southern California planned to strike as well, according to Renée Saldaña, a spokeswoman for SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, one of the unions organizing the walkout.\n\n\"Given the urgency of Kaiser’s staffing crisis, front-line health care workers are ready to sit down with Kaiser executives whenever they’re ready to bargain in good faith,\" Caroline Lucas, executive director of the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions, said Tuesday. \"However, no agreement can be made until Kaiser executives stop bargaining in bad faith and committing unfair labor practices.\"\n\nKaiser Permanente officials said the two sides had negotiated through the night, and they remained hopeful a deal was still possible.\n\n\"There has been a lot of progress, with agreements reached on several specific proposals late Tuesday,\" Kaiser said in a statement early Wednesday. \"We remain committed to reaching a new agreement that continues to provide our employees with market-leading wages, excellent benefits, generous retirement income plans, and valuable professional development opportunities.\"\n\nWhat does the strike mean for patients?\n\nIn the days before the planned walkout, Kaiser said hospitals, emergency departments and other health facilities remained open.\n\nWithout a deal, Kaiser said, it would enact contingency plans \"to ensure members continue to receive safe, high-quality care for the duration of the strike.\"\n\nExperts not affiliated with the nurses unions or Kaiser say hospitals typically rely on staffing agencies to fill shifts with contract health care workers during work stoppages. Some non-emergency appointments or operations probably will be delayed or rescheduled as the hospitals seek to maintain staffing levels, experts said.\n\nKaiser spokesman Wayne Davis said that if appointments need to be rescheduled, patients will be contacted directly.\n\n\"Our facilities will continue to be staffed by our physicians, trained and experienced managers and staff, and, in some cases, we will augment with contingent workers,\" Kaiser said in a statement.\n\nDuring a typical hospital strike, critical procedures such as cancer treatment or emergency surgeries normally continue, but hospital managers might seek to delay non-emergency operations, said Richard Ricciardi, a nursing professor and executive director for the Center for Health Policy and Media Engagement at George Washington University.\n\n\"You certainly don't want to put a patient at risk when they don't have to be at risk,\" Ricciardi said.\n\nUnion demands: Better pay, bonuses, health reimbursement\n\nThe unions want Kaiser to improve staffing levels that became stretched during the COVID-19 pandemic and address cost of living increases in their wages and benefits, union officials told USA TODAY.\n\nThe Kaiser unions are seeking a four-year pact with pay hikes of 7% during the first two years and 6.25% in years three and four. The unions want workers to earn a minimum performance bonus of $1,500, even if Kaiser does not meet its financial goals.\n\nOther workers demands include:\n\n∎ A minimum wage of $25 an hour across Kaiser.\n\n∎ Preserving existing health benefits and a fund of $2,500 per year for healthcare reimbursement accounts.\n\n∎ Fixed retirement plans with no new loopholes or plan changes.\n\nThe unions accuse Kaiser executives of bad faith bargaining, which they say interferes with solutions to Kaiser's staffing crisis.\n\nIn a statement, Kaiser said it pays more than peers and has proposed wage increases from 12.5% to 16% over four years. In addition, the nonprofit health provider proposes a minimum wage of $21 an hour in Washington state, Oregon, Colorado, Virginia, Maryland, Hawaii and Washington, D.C.

Small businesses struggled to restock their shelves and hospitals had a hard time securing supplies, according to New York Times reporting at the time.\n\nConsumers could face that and more if the Teamsters union and management cannot reach a new contract deal by the end of the month.\n\nIf a strike does occur, “it will be very disruptive,” said Jason Miller, interim chairperson for the Department of Supply Chain Management at Michigan State University. \"The consumer is going to be much more affected getting just everyday products that we buy online.\"\n\nUPS strike update:Strike not off the table\n\nWhat will happen if UPS workers go on strike?\n\nWhile the 1997 strike threw a wrench in the supply chain, a 2023 stoppage could have an even greater effect on consumers now that the U.S. economy is even more reliant on e-commerce.\n\nCensus data shows that less than 1% of total retail trade sales came from e-commerce in 1999, the first year the data was reported. At the beginning of this year, it was 15%. The Teamsters Union has also grown since its last work stoppage, from about 185,000 members to 340,000. If a strike does take place, it would be the largest single-employer strike in U.S. history.\n\nEven a short-lived strike could have “huge” consequences for consumers, according to Terry Esper, a logistics professor at The Ohio State University.\n\n\"They have a large network,” he said of UPS, which delivers nearly 25 million packages daily and about a quarter of all U.S. parcel volume. “Taking that kind of capacity out of the market, even for a day, will have significant ripple effects.”\n\nHere's what consumers can expect during a strike, according to experts:\n\nSlower delivery times\n\nLonger wait times are to be expected during a strike as shipping carriers like FedEx and the United States Postal Service deal with an influx of packages from UPS customers. Esper said this would be especially noticeable in rural areas and among smaller retailers, which may rely more heavily on UPS as their delivery service provider.\n\nFedEx last week said it will prioritize existing customers amid any industry disruptions, which means UPS customers switching over may have a harder time getting packages sent through quickly.\n\n\"We might be looking at three to five days of longer delivery lead times in certain areas as other carriers try to handle the additional capacity,\" he said. \"It's really a matter of how long this will last, if it does happen, and where consumers are in the market.\"\n\nBig-box retailers are expected to weather the impacts of a UPS strike more easily since they use a diverse mix of delivery service providers, according to Esper.\n\nSupply chain disruptions\n\nMiller said spare parts for motor vehicles – which rely on shipments from wholesalers to dealerships – may be harder to get if there’s a strike. The health care supply chain could also take a hit since the wholesale companies that manufacture medical devices and supplies heavily rely on companies like UPS.\n\nOther industries with dealers that rely on getting spare parts from wholesalers via UPS, including farming and construction, could also face supply chain issues.\n\n“Consumers are not only going to be affected by stuff not showing up at their houses,” Miller said. \"It would be “a new shock to a (supply chain) system that has largely reverted to pre-COVID levels.”\n\nHigher shipping costs\n\nA strike could also raise the cost of shipping. Even if delivery companies don't increase their rates amid a stoppage, UPS customers may need to turn to higher-priced alternatives from competitors or pay for expedited shipping amid lengthened delivery times.\n\nIt may not be \"an immediate change in prices, (but) it is maybe leaning into some direct payments for more expedited shipping in order to support the delivery of really important and key things like medications,\" Esper said.\n\nWhat can consumers do?\n\nMiller said consumers who are planning to shop online should do it now, especially if they know the product is being shipped by UPS. If you do need to shop online during a strike, shopping in larger batch quantities can help you avoid delivery lags. Buying from companies that don't rely on UPS can also help cut down wait times.\n\nOther shoppers should consider shopping in person or ordering pick-up to avoid delayed deliveries, a feat that should be easier to accomplish amid the warmer summer months.\n\n\"A blessing in disguise is the fact that this is summer,\" said Kingshuk Sinha, a supply chain and operations professor at the University of Minnesota. \"We can go out and do our shopping and have that shopping experience.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/11/12/surprise-vacation-yard-sale-reprieve-teacher-sick-day-news-around-states/114862294/", "title": "Surprise vacation, yard sale reprieve: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State health officials are urging people to serve up a heaping side of precaution at Thanksgiving, as the holiday comes amid a national surge in COVID-19 cases. Officials say people should skip large family gatherings in favor of scaled-back events. “We all want to see our family at holiday time, and yet this is a special year. This is a year unlike any we’ve ever had,” Alabama State Health Officer Scott Harris said. “Many things maybe could be done virtually, which is not nearly as much fun but certainly safer.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines. Suzanne Judd, an epidemiologist from the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s School of Public Health, said Thanksgiving is particularly problematic because it’s a holiday celebrated by family gatherings indoors. “Gatherings greater than 10 people pose a substantial risk of one of the people being COVID-positive and not knowing,” Judd said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The spread of the coronavirus at the state’s largest prison has accelerated beyond an initial outbreak, with 110 inmates testing positive for the virus as of Monday. Goose Creek Correctional Center first announced a virus outbreak at the facility Nov. 2, when the Alaska Department of Corrections said 22 inmates and five staff members tested positive, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The prison west of Wasilla near Point McKenzie housed 1,317 pretrial and sentenced prisoners as of Monday, department spokeswoman Sarah Gallagher said. Staff are required and inmates are strongly encouraged to wear masks, she said. The outbreak began in one of the prison’s housing units, known as mods. Each mod has 64 prisoners, indicating the outbreak has expanded beyond a single unit, Gallagher said. Each mod continues to operate as a “family unit” in order to minimize the risk of further transmission, Gallagher said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With the state reporting a daily average of 1,900 new COVID-19 cases over the past week, Gov. Doug Ducey has urged residents to be careful. In a video posted Tuesday, Ducey urged Arizona residents to wear face coverings, wash hands, practice social distancing and stay home when sick. “Gatherings of families and friends from outside your household are no safer than going to the grocery store,” he said. Ducey, a Republican, has not implemented a statewide masking requirement, while many local governments in the state have done so. He announced no new virus prevention initiatives in the video posted on social media and his office’s website. He cited past moves that included increasing testing and providing money to hospitals for protective gear, staffing and ventilators. Ducey said he wants to protect public health “keep our economy safely open and moving, We know that both are important to the health and well-being of Arizonans.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations again hit a new high Tuesday, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson resisted calls for new restrictions on businesses or gatherings to combat a surge in coronavirus cases. An outbreak of the virus among state legislators also grew to 11 on Tuesday, with a lawmaker testing positive. The Department of Health reported 24 more people were hospitalized because of COVID-19, bringing the state’s virus hospitalizations to a new high of 810. The state’s confirmed and probable virus cases rose by 1,424 to 124,235. “The numbers aren’t good, the trend is not good, and we have a lot of work to do here in Arkansas and across the nation,” Hutchinson said at his weekly news briefing on the virus. The state’s COVID-19 deaths rose by four to 2,112. The Republican governor said many of the state’s cases are coming from smaller gatherings at homes that he said can’t be regulated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city will study the feasibility of using its enormous convention center as a temporary shelter for the increasing number of homeless people living on the streets. City Councilman Curren Price introduced a motion Tuesday seeking a report on what it would take to transform the 720,000-square-foot LA Convention Center in his downtown district. The property has not been used for conventions since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, the pandemic has forced more people into homelessness, Price said. With more than 60,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, encampments have gone up throughout the region on sidewalks, in empty lots and under freeway overpasses. “We’re in a panic situation along with a pandemic situation. Folks on the streets are just suffering,” Price told the Los Angeles Times. “We have to do a better job of housing individuals who are homeless.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Department of Public Health and Environment has routinely deleted emails related to the coronavirus pandemic even though the state archives has asked that they be saved, a newspaper has found. The Denver Post reports it discovered that emails sent and received by state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy were deleted after the newspaper requested documents. The department said it would provide some records, including emails. But it said emails “from May would have already been auto-deleted unless otherwise preserved, or they were previously deleted by Dr. Herlihy as part of a normal business process,” said Monica Wilkerson, the department’s records and legal services liaison. As of last year, the department deleted most employee emails after 90 days. The policy mirrors similar practices by the state government. The Colorado State Archives posted a notice in June asking agencies to “keep all records related to COVID-19.” Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition Executive Director Jeff Roberts said it is important to keep records so that journalists can report on a crisis affecting the health and safety of residents.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Canaan: More than 350 students and 20 teachers in a wealthy suburb are in quarantine after a new round of coronavirus testing turned up 15 infections, according to the local school district. New Canaan schools on Tuesday reported 13 students and two teachers tested positive, days after all 540 tests of students came back negative, the Stamford Advocate reports. There were also 26 new positive tests last weekend, First Selectman Kevin Moynihan said. “We continue to see cases spread from gatherings, dinner parties, out-of-town caregivers, house cleaners and, not unexpectedly, within families,” Moynihan said. “This rapid case increase over the weekend illustrates how fast community transmission spreads and accelerates.” The most recent testing resulted in quarantines for 213 students at New Canaan High School, 70 at Saxe Middle School and 70 at three elementary schools. People in quarantine are told they must stay home for 14 days.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Attorneys for a cleric say they’ve reached a settlement with Gov. John Carney over the coronavirus restrictions he imposed on worship services. The Rev. Christopher Allan Bullock filed a lawsuit in May claiming Carney’s restrictions were unconstitutional and discriminatory. Carney then rescinded many of the restrictions, and his lawyers argued Bullock’s claims were moot. But Bullock’s attorneys asked for an injunction prohibiting the governor from imposing similar limitations in the future. Lawyers representing the New Castle County pastor and community activist said Wednesday that the settlement requires the governor to treat houses of worship in a neutral manner in any future emergency. Among other things, if certain businesses or activities are considered essential, that definition will include churches. Attorney Thomas Neuberger said the state also agreed to pay the plaintiffs $150,000 in lawyer fees and $7,200 in court costs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. reported 206 new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday – its highest single-day total since late May, WUSA-TV reports. Daily test data lags behind and is only available up to Nov. 7, so it’s unclear what, if any, connection to the weekend’s celebrations these numbers may have. The city is now averaging more than 100 new cases a day for the first time since May 30.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: More than a dozen Miami nurses and front-line health care workers are finally getting a well-deserved break. The group was scheduled for an upcoming, mandatory – aka boring – 48-hour training but was instead surprised with an island vacation to the Florida Keys. Jackson Health System supervisors were asked to choose staff who went above and beyond during the pandemic. Many of the staff, including respiratory therapists and lab techs, have not been able to take any time off during the pandemic to relax or spend time with their loved ones and have been working tirelessly treating COVID-19 patients, the hospital said. The 50 workers were told they had to attend a two-day training, but when they gathered at the hospital Tuesday, they were handed gift boxes with gift certificates. Hawks Cay Resort in the Florida Keys donated two-night stays to its island on Duck Key, surrounded by sparkling waters and swaying palm trees, as part of its Heroes Salute program.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is again hitting a new peak in public high school graduation rates. The state Department of Education said Tuesday that 83.8% of seniors graduated on time in the spring. That’s the highest level recorded since Georgia began calculating according to current methods, which require a student to graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma, and rose from 82% in 2019. The state says part of the increase came from a waiver allowing the state to count students with significant cognitive disabilities, about 1% of students overall, as graduating on time even if they take more than four years to complete high school. Because of the pandemic, many high school students did not have to take end-of-course exams last year, which would have counted for 20% of their overall grade. Most students take the courses that require the exams before their senior year, so it’s unclear whether the lack of tests influenced Georgia’s graduation rates.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Bankruptcies declined in October for the eighth time in 10 months as state unemployment reached a national high of 15.1% and as tourism was in the beginning stage of reopening after a major economic downturn. There were 125 bankruptcy filings in October, a 22.6% decrease from the 162 during the same period in the previous year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Data provided by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Hawaii, showed bankruptcy filings were down 9.8% to 1,274 for the year through October compared to 1,412 during the same period in 2019. Chapter 7 liquidation filings, the most common type of bankruptcy, fell 19.8% in October to 93 from 116 in the year-earlier period. Chapter 13 filings, which allow people with regular income sources to establish installment payment plans to creditors over three to five years, dropped 27.3% to 32 from 44 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge dismissed a case against a woman who was cited for holding a yard sale authorities said violated the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order. Judge Van Valin on Friday dismissed the case brought by officials who said the yard sale was not an “essential business,” The Idaho Statesman reports. Valin ruled the yard sale conducted in April by Christa Thompson of Rathdrum was not a business. Defense attorney Edward Dindinger said in a statement that the judge ruled the language of the stay-at-home order issued in response to the coronavirus pandemic did not apply to Thompson. The Rathdrum Police Department said in April that the event was a “large nonessential yard sale” that filled the front yard and spilled into the back yard of her home. Thompson held the sale “to liquidate her late father-in-law’s estate,” Dindinger said. Thompson faced a possible sentence of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state set another single-day record for coronavirus infections Tuesday, pushing the total number of people who have tested positive in the state since the pandemic began past 500,000. Gov. J.B. Pritzker presented statistics to show that hospitalizations are nearing their spring peak, when the initial wave of infections had officials scrambling for hospital beds and professionals to tend them. State public health officials reported 12,623 newly confirmed cases of the virus, nearly 15% higher than the previous record set Saturday, when cases also topped 12,000. In Chicago, officials reported a daily average of 1,686 new cases, roughly four times higher than a month ago. “There are no signs of slowing,” Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said. Hospitalizations jumped 7.5% in one day to 4,742. The seven-day average of 4,207 in hospital beds is creeping toward the 4,822 average hit May 5.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is continuing its record-setting increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations and new infections, health officials said Tuesday as the state once again surpassed 4,000 new cases and reported 63 more deaths. The newly reported deaths raised Indiana’s pandemic death toll to 4,731, including confirmed and presumed coronavirus infections, the Indiana State Department of Health said in its daily statistics update. The 4,879 infections reported Tuesday were Indiana’s second-highest daily count of newly reported coronavirus cases and marked the sixth straight day the state reported more than 4,000 new cases. Indiana’s seven-day rolling average for newly confirmed cases rose to 4,490, according to Tuesday’s daily update of the state’s coronavirus dashboard. That is the highest level Indiana has seen during the pandemic and more than five times the seven-day rolling average of 858 newly confirmed cases the agency reported Sept. 22.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two more state prisons are reporting outbreaks of coronavirus infections, according to the Iowa Department of Corrections. Recent testing has revealed outbreaks at prisons in Clarinda, where 377 inmates and 16 staff members are positive, and Rockwell City, where 254 inmates and four staff members are positive, a DOC report updated Sunday shows. The Clarinda prison has about 900 inmates, and Rockwell City has 426. The department released data Friday showing an outbreak at the Anamosa prison, and the updated numbers show 485 infected inmates of the 982 inmates at the prison. An additional 50 staff members tested positive. Additional smaller prison outbreaks are reported at Mount Pleasant, where 18 inmates and five staff members are positive, and the women’s prison in Mitchellville, where four inmates and 10 staff members are positive.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s largest public school district, in Wichita, has scrapped plans to allow its middle and high school students to attend some in-person classes, and three counties have imposed new restrictions inspired by the coronavirus pandemic. The moves by local officials come as the state works to expand its overall testing capacity so under a “unified” statewide strategy announced by Gov. Laura Kelly in late September. The strategy calls for regular testing of at-risk populations, including first responders, prison inmates, nursing home residents, and K-12 students and staff, as well as more aggressive testing in virus hot spots. The state plans to spend at least $53 million in federal coronavirus relief funds on contracts with private laboratories. But Kelly said Tuesday during a Statehouse news conference: “It won’t work if people are not abiding by the other safety protocols, particularly wearing masks and avoiding large gatherings.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentuckians should avoid large Thanksgiving gatherings as a safeguard to protect extended family and friends from a surging COVID-19 outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. Instead, in-person get-togethers should be limited to people from the same household, he said. While the health guidelines might be tough to swallow, the guidance can save lives as Kentucky struggles with its worst outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the Democratic governor said. “That person that you may think that you will really miss sitting across the table from you this year, I want to make sure is across the table from you next year,” Beshear said at a news conference. “And this right now is the most dangerous time we’ve had in this virus.” The Thanksgiving guidance came as the state reported 2,120 new virus cases – its highest total for a Tuesday and fifth-highest day overall, Beshear said. He also reported 14 more virus-related deaths.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Shoppers will see state sales taxes suspended for two days this month, under a bill passed by lawmakers in their latest special session and signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, a Gonzales Republican, sponsored the measure to help residents and businesses recovering from hurricanes Laura and Delta and coping with the coronavirus pandemic. The state sales tax holiday will be held Nov. 20-21. Louisiana’s 4.45% state sales tax will not be charged on the first $2,500 of a purchase. The holiday doesn’t cover car, truck and other vehicle purchases. And it doesn’t apply to local sales taxes. The state is estimated to lose $4.5 million in sales tax collections because of the tax holiday, according to a nonpartisan financial analysis of the bill.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers plan to hold their first legislative sessions at the Augusta Civic Center instead of the Statehouse as coronavirus cases grow. The city-owned, 49,000-square-foot civic center, about 3 miles from the Statehouse, is typically used for events such as concerts, agriculture conventions and conferences. It would provide more space than the Statehouse, and that would make it easier to observe social distancing, a spokeswoman for outgoing Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon told the Portland Press Herald. The full Legislature last met in March. The top priority for lawmakers will be crafting a new, two-year state budget at a time when Maine’s finances have been stressed by the pandemic. New Hampshire lawmakers took a similar approach in June when they met in the University of New Hampshire Whittemore Center Arena.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will reduce indoor operations for bars and restaurants from 75% to 50% in response to rising coronavirus cases and increased hospitalizations, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday. The new limits took effect Wednesday. “Last week, I said that the warning lights were starting to blink on the dashboard and that it appeared we were approaching a critical turning point in the fight. Today, I’m reporting that we have now crossed over into the danger zone,” Hogan said at a news conference. “Too many residents and businesses have COVID fatigue and have begun letting their guard down.” State health officials also have issued a public health advisory effective immediately to strongly discourage indoor gatherings of 25 people or more at family gatherings or house parties. Contact tracing data has shown an increase in cases resulting from such gatherings.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases could force the state to once again open field hospitals to care for a possible overflow of patients as intensive care units fill up, Gov. Charlie Baker warned Tuesday. Hospitals are also prepared to make an additional 400 beds available for COVID-19 patients by converting acute care beds to ICU beds to deal with an expected rise in cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus during the fall and winter, Baker said at a press conference. “The trends obviously are going in the wrong direction and show no signs of changing,” he said. When and where field hospitals might be set up depends on space and need, Baker said. Massachusetts residents had done a good job controlling the virus after an initial spike in the spring but are getting careless and allowing the virus to get a toehold again, leading to a second surge, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state on Tuesday posted a record number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases, near 6,500, and reported 59 deaths within the previous 24 hours – its deadliest day in six months. COVID-19, which subsided over the summer after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer imposed sweeping stay-at-home and other restrictions, has rebounded this fall. Asked if she might again order people to stay home, the Democrat said she was talking with the state health department about potential next steps. Mask requirements and gathering limits remain in effect despite a “confusing” state Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a law she used to issue orders, she said. Whitmer said she will not see extended family in person for Thanksgiving and said it is “inherently dangerous” to have more than one household in an enclosed space without ventilation and open windows. The state’s latest average positivity rate is 9.4%, up from 4.9% two weeks ago.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials reported a record 56 new deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said. Walz told Minnesota Public Radio the daily report shows positivity rates above 20%, an important measure of how fast the disease is spreading. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Minnesota has nearly doubled over the past two weeks from just under 7% on Oct. 27 to nearly 13% on Tuesday, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. The governor made the comments a day after warning Minnesotans that the state is approaching the worst phase of the pandemic and that conditions will get dramatically worse unless people start changing their behavior. He said it won’t be unusual for people to open their newspapers and see 50 to 60 new deaths. “This is just inevitable if we do not change our behaviors and take some mitigation efforts.” Walz told MPR. Minnesota’s previous record was 36 deaths, reported Friday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that he, his wife and their three daughters are in isolation after the youngest tested positive for the coronavirus. Maddie Reeves, 8, attends a private elementary school in Jackson. The Republican governor said in a social media post: “She feels OK, but could still use prayers! Please pray for her momma too!” Reeves also said everyone in his family is being tested for the virus. The governor announced his daughter’s infection shortly after he canceled his coronavirus news conference that was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. An executive order issued by Reeves requires children and teachers to wear masks in public and private schools. Sixteen of Mississippi’s 82 counties have been under a mask mandate that was set to expire Wednesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Twenty-eight employees of an election board have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent weeks, and a director believes they most likely got infected from voters, though local health officials aren’t convinced. The Jackson County Election Board’s Republican director, Tammy Brown, said Tuesday that eight full-time and 20 part-time employees tested positive for the virus in the past 21/ 2 weeks. Most are doing well and recovering at home, but two are hospitalized, including one in intensive care, Brown said. Jackson County is Missouri’s second-largest county, behind St. Louis County. While Kansas City is part of Jackson County, the city has its own election board. The Jackson County board handled votes cast by nearly 200,000 people. Jackson County Health Department spokeswoman Kayla Parker said community transmission is so widespread that determining the source would be next to impossible.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, the state’s chief epidemiologist said the spread of the coronavirus has stressed medical services to the brink, and he predicted the situation will get worse as winter sets in. “We’re kind of preparing for the worst here,” Jim Murphy said. “We have pretty spooky numbers for COVID, going into a fall respiratory season. It’s not a position that anybody would like to be in.” Murphy said the increase in cases across the state has led to a shortage in health care workers, in addition to a shortage in hospital beds. “You can have a lot of beds. But if you don’t have the staff to support those beds, that’s a problem,” he said. U.S. officials have dispatched a team of nearly 30 physicians, nurses, paramedics and other health care workers to Montana’s largest city. The National Disaster Medical System team arrived Friday and will work in Billings for two weeks, The Billings Gazette reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to set records with the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, and health care providers expect that to continue because of the recent surge of cases. Cliff Robertson, CEO of CHI Health, said his group of 14 hospitals in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa is preparing for COVID-19 cases to keep increasing over the next three to four weeks. He said COVID-19 patients already account for about 25% of all the patients in his hospitals. “We highly encourage folks to take this seriously because … this virus is rampant in our community right now,” Robertson said. The steady increase in cases raises the concern that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed, said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases specialist at Nebraska Medicine in Omaha. “In three weeks’ time, our hospitals will be overwhelmed, and we will no longer be able to deliver optimal and effective care for COVID, and we will also no longer be able to deliver appropriate care for everyone who comes in with a heart attack or a stroke.”\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Although the coronavirus is spreading at record rates, the state will not need to tighten restrictions if individuals commit to preventive measures like mask-wearing and working from home, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday. For the third time in three weeks, the governor referred to “alarming trends” and said Nevada was almost at the point where stricter measures would be necessary. But unlike in the past, when he has hesitated to commit to benchmarks or timelines, he provided a deadline: If Nevada doesn’t show signs that it’s containing the virus in two weeks, he will be forced to tighten the state’s prevention measures. “If you don’t have to go out, don’t go out. Reduce your time in public to what is necessary, and limit any and all exposures to those outside your household,” Sisolak said. “Think about changes like ordering groceries for delivery instead of going into the store, or picking up dinner curbside.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAmherst: Officials say an Election Day voter at a polling place tested positive for the coronavirus, but the town had safety precautions in place. WMUR-TV reports town officials in Amherst said they were notified by the state that a voter tested positive for the virus. They said the infected person was at Souhegan High School between 10:15 a.m. and 11:15 a.m. on Election Day. Amherst town moderator Steve Coughlan said it wasn’t crowded. The town is now contacting election volunteers who may have had direct contact with the voter. Coughlan said plexiglass shields separated voters from election workers. Volunteers had to wear masks, but voters did not. “I think we provided a very safe environment,” Coughlan said. “It would be crazy for us to have thought that there would be zero infected voters out of everyone coming in. So we took precautions that were appropriate.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The family of the state’s first law enforcement officer to die from COVID-19 has filed a claim to sue Hudson County, saying he did not receive any masks or other personal protective equipment while working at the county jail. Bernard Waddell Sr., a corrections officer with 32 years of experience, was forced to work within close proximity to inmates who he believed were infected, said family lawyer Paul da Costa. “Up to his last day on the job, he was not provided with any PPE,” da Costa said. The virus devastated the jail in Kearny. Along with Waddell, it claimed the lives of two nurses, a commissary director and another corrections officer. Waddell, 56, died April 1. The Jersey City resident is survived by his wife and two sons. Around the time of his death, New Jersey was experiencing a severe shortage of face masks and gowns, prompting hospitals to ask the public for donations.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Santa Fe Public Schools is ending a short-lived soft opening of in-person learning as the coronavirus pandemic hobbles the state. “I am announcing today a hiatus of our volunteer hybrid program due to the rampant rise in COVID-19 cases in Santa Fe County and New Mexico and SFPS’ philosophy to always prioritize the safety and well being of our students and staff,” Superintendent Veronica Garcia said. The volunteers included 58 teachers who went to work despite the pandemic, enabling about 200 elementary students to attend school in person at least part of the week. The program started Oct. 26 and will hold the last day of classes Nov. 20. “If parents are able to keep their children home next week, I urge them to do so,” Garcia said. The announcement comes as the state sets records for COVID-19 cases amid dwindling space in hospitals and as students are failing classes at much higher rates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants, bars and gyms will have to close at 10 p.m. across the state in the latest effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday. He said people will also be barred from hosting private gatherings with more than 10 people. Cuomo said the new restrictions, which go into effect Friday, are necessary because new coronavirus infections have been traced to those types of activities. Businesses can reopen each morning. “Bars, restaurants, gyms, house parties – that’s where it’s coming from, primarily,” Cuomo said. The governor spoke as rates of coronavirus infection continued to rise. He said 1,628 people were hospitalized across the state for COVID-19 on Tuesday, and 21 people died. “What we’re seeing is what they predicted for months,” Cuomo said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state will remain paused in its current reopening plan for an additional three weeks, with indoor gathering limits reduced from 25 people to 10 people starting Friday. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced the tightening of gathering restrictions during a Tuesday news conference. The decision not to further reopen ahead of Thanksgiving comes at a time when the state is concerned about increases it has seen in COVID-19 cases and the percentage of coronavirus tests coming back positive. “The science shows that the transmission of this virus is much greater indoors, and the more people are gathered, the easier this virus can spread,” Cooper said. Cooper, who won reelection last week, noted that churches and restaurants would be unaffected by the updated guidance. The executive order will remain in place until Dec. 4.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state continues to lead the nation in daily new coronavirus cases per capita, with 1 in 83 residents testing positive in just the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. In the past two weeks, there were 2,265 new cases per 100,000 people in North Dakota, which ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project. State health officials reported a dozen new deaths due to complications from the coronavirus Wednesday, down from a record 30 deaths Tuesday. The deaths reported Wednesday increased total fatalities to 696 since the pandemic began. The report said 123 deaths have occurred in November, matching all of September. October has been the deadliest month so far in North Dakota, with 292 deaths. State health officials reported 1,039 new coronavirus cases Wednesday and a daily positivity rate of more than 18% for the second straight day.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine beseeched Ohioans on Wednesday to take the surging coronavirus spread seriously, issuing new orders on mask enforcement in businesses, limiting gatherings across the state, and threatening to close bars, restaurants and fitness centers if cases continue to rise. “Throughout our country’s history, each generation has faced unique sacrifices,” DeWine said in the statewide address. “Today, we all must do something far less dramatic but very important: Wear a mask so your friends and family members can live.” DeWine shifted the authority of mask enforcement from the local counties to the state. The Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation will be responsible for inspections across the 88 counties. If a business receives more than one violation, it will have to close for 24 hours. “We must do this to protect our front-line workers,” DeWine said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of people hospitalized with confirmed and probable coronavirus in the state shattered the previous one-day record by nearly 200 on Wednesday, and more than 2,100 new cases were reported, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The department reported 1,248 hospitalizations to surpass the previous record of 1,055 set last Thursday. The department reported 2,177 new cases and 19 additional deaths since Tuesday for totals of 142,334 cases and 1,470 deaths since the pandemic began in March. The true number of infections is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the seven-day average of the percentage of people who tested positive has risen from 9% to nearly 16% in Oklahoma, and the average number of new cases each day increased from 1265.8 per day to 1,947.3.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown and state health officials warned Tuesday of the capacity challenges facing hospitals as COVID-19 case counts continue to spike. The Oregon Health Authority recorded a record 285 confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospitals Tuesday – a 57% increase in just the past week and an 83% increase in the past four weeks. “There are limitations to what Oregon’s health care system can handle,” said Dana Hargunani, the health authority’s chief medical officer. “Even with regional planning and the hard work of all of our hospital partners, we cannot handle ever-growing high daily case counts and widespread hospitalizations.” Currently out of Oregon’s 703 listed intensive care unit beds, 27% are available, and about 18% of non-ICU adult hospital beds in the state are available, based on data on from the health authority’s website. “Our fear that this virus would spread out of control as the colder months set in is now becoming a frightening reality,” Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city’s public school students will continue to attend classes virtually for the foreseeable future, district officials announced Tuesday. The announcement came on the same day Philadelphia public health officials saw a peak in confirmed virus cases and increased hospitalizations. The school district had planned to begin bringing back younger students for a hybrid in-person instruction model starting Nov. 30, with plans to phase in instruction for students with complex instructional needs and then older students next. “We hope to see these students back in school before the spring,” Philadelphia district Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. said, adding that it would ultimately depend on health experts and infection trends. About one-third of parents with students who would have been eligible to return had opted for in-person, part-time instruction that would have put students in classrooms two days a week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Employees of the state Senate are being told to work from home after three workers tested positive for the coronavirus, state officials said. The Senate’s roughly 50 workers were instructed to start working remotely Monday after three staffers tested positive over the weekend, The Providence Journal reports. They were told to work remotely for two weeks. The directive came from Gov. Gina Raimondo. Senate spokesman Greg Pare said the Senate president is “following that guidance and wants to do all he can to keep Senate staff members safe.” The House said it has no plans to shift to remote work. The new cases in the Senate were reported as the General Assembly looks for ways to gather for its first full sessions since July. Democratic Senate President Dominick Ruggerio previously said he is exploring whether meetings can be held at the Rhode Island Convention Center.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials in the state’s largest school district say the number of students who received an F in at least one class tripled this year, as the district adjusted learning because of the coronavirus pandemic. First-quarter report cards show a little more than 16,000 students in Greenville County Schools had an F. That compares to roughly 5,300 students with at least one failing grade in the first quarter last year. The pandemic has limited in-person teaching for the district’s 75,000 students, and Associate Superintendent of Academics Jeff McCoy said that likely was a factor in the jump in Fs. He also cited the stress of the crisis on families and the emergency shutdown of schools in the spring. Still, the district wasn’t expecting such a big increase in the number of struggling students. McCoy said the report cards show a much larger proportion of virtual students are receiving failing grades compared to in-person students.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The mayor cast the tie-breaking vote that defeated a proposed mask mandate in the state’s largest city Tuesday night. After more than two hours of public comment, Mayor Paul TenHaken rejected the mandate after the City Council tied 4-4 on the ordinance. The mandate would have required face coverings to be worn by people in most indoor public places where 6-foot social distancing was not achievable. Violations carried a $50 fine. “I believe the small uptick we’ll see in compliance is not worth the community division that this will create,” TenHaken said as he ended debate. Councilor Greg Neitzert said he did not want to live in a city where people are calling the police because someone isn’t wearing a mask. “It’s not just about health,” Neitzert said. “We also have to look at principles.” The Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce opposed it. Several faith leaders in the city supported the mandate.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that he’s looking to include “meaningful” teacher pay raises in next year’s budget despite facing financial crunches brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lee had originally proposed funneling an additional $117 million to K-12 teacher salaries earlier this year before the virus outbreak began rippling across the state. If approved, the starting minimum annual salary for teachers would have increased from $36,000 to $40,000 over the next two years. Yet months later, Lee was forced to strip the teacher funding boost, as well as many other budget initiatives, as officials braced for funding shortfalls. However, Tennessee’s revenues have come in slightly higher than originally projected over the past three months, allowing Lee’s administration to remain slightly optimistic that it will be able to fund some new measures rather than have to dip into rainy day funds.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state has become the first with more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases as the nation continues to face a surge of infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University early Wednesday. The nation’s second-most populous state has recorded 1,010,364 coronavirus cases with 19,337 deaths since the pandemic began in early March, according to the count on the Johns Hopkins website. Texas recorded 10,865 new cases Tuesday, setting a new daily record that surpassed by 74 cases an old mark set July 15, state officials said. According to state figures Tuesday, an estimated 132,146 cases are active, the most since Aug. 17, and 6,170 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, the most since Aug. 18. There were 94 new deaths Tuesday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Meanwhile, cases of the coronavirus are surging in the Laredo area, health officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A group of teachers has organized an event to encourage educators across the state to call in sick and use the day off to get tested for the coronavirus amid a surge in confirmed infection cases. “There are no testing requirements for teachers or students currently,” Granite School District teacher Lindsay Plummer said. Some teachers believe the “test out” planned for Thursday will prompt state leaders to do more to limit the spread of COVID-19 and increase safety protocols in classrooms, FOX13 reports. Plummer said the group was inspired to act following remarks made by Republican Gov. Gary Herbert on Sunday, when he put in place a statewide mask mandate. “The goal of doing something like this is we want to push them to do more,” she said. The Utah Education Association said it is aware of event but is urging teachers to be patient. Herbert’s office has said all teachers have universal access to testing.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state on Tuesday suspended a program that allowed people from across the Northeast to visit Vermont without quarantining if they come from a county with a low rate of coronavirus infection. Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that the number of counties eligible – listed on a map that uses red, orange and green to indicate eligibility – has continued to shrink. As of Tuesday only two counties between Maine and Ohio were listed as green. “The fact is, along with social gatherings, travel to and from other states without the proper quarantine continues to be one of the common denominators in our rising case counts,” Scott said. Essential travel – such as work, school, medical care, personal safety, shared child custody or buying groceries – is not affected, but people should only do what they need to do and then return home, he said. Vermont determined eligible counties as those with virus rates of less than 400 cases per million residents.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, Gov. Ralph Northam on Tuesday announced plans to significantly increase statewide testing capacity and to launch a media campaign in southwest Virginia, which has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past month. The moves came three days after Virginia reported 2,103 new cases – its biggest single-day increase in new cases since the start of the pandemic. On Tuesday, the state reported 1,435 new cases. The state’s seven-day moving average of new cases is 1,462. The seven-day testing positivity rate has also climbed from just under 5% a few weeks ago to 6.2% on Tuesday. Since the start of the pandemic, the state has recorded a total of 194,192 cases, with 3,726 deaths. Northam said he is focusing on mitigation efforts and continuing to encourage people to wear masks and practice social distancing. He said he is not currently considering ordering new restrictions.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two hospitals near the city are struggling with COVID-19 outbreaks within the facilities. The Auburn Medical Center reported at least five employees and eight patients tested positive for the coronavirus, after an outbreak on a fourth-floor unit. The hospital said in a statement Tuesday that one patient died after the outbreak was detected late last week, The Seattle Times reports. The MultiCare hospital system, which owns the hospital, tested all 40 patients in the unit and 212 staffers who had worked there in the two-week period before the first positive test was reported, officials said. At St. Michael Medical Center in Bremerton, at least six people have been infected since early November. CHI Franciscan, the hospital system that owns St. Michael, announced Tuesday that four patients and two employees have been infected to date. State health officials have reported 350 outbreaks in health care settings, including hospitals, since Oct. 24, a statewide outbreak report said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a new high of 642 coronavirus cases Wednesday and seven deaths as the pandemic continued its march into rural enclaves. There are 277 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, slightly down from the peak of 290 last week. A total of 553 deaths have been linked to COVID-19. Virus-related deaths have increased 45% in the past month. The daily positivity rate is up to 5.9%, the highest it has been in about two months. “The enemy is at our borders, and the enemy is coming at us right now,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a press briefing. Twenty-five counties had the most severe designation of virus spread, with 25 or more cases per 100,000 residents. Justice said all options are on the table for bringing new travel and business restrictions, but nothing is planned yet. “Legally, I can’t go out and start arresting people” for not wearing masks, Justice said in urging people to follow guidelines and get tested for the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers renewed his pleas Tuesday for people to stay home to avoid the coronavirus in an unusual prime-time speech hours after the state set new records for infections and deaths. The governor announced he was advising people to stay in their houses and businesses to allow people to work remotely, requiring masks, and limiting the number of people in stores and offices. He said projections show that if nothing changes, deaths could double to 5,000 by January. Evers has been imploring people to stay home and wear masks for months during twice-weekly afternoon news conferences to little avail. This time his office streamed his remarks live on his Facebook page and YouTube channel. “So I want to be clear tonight: Each day this virus goes unchecked is a setback for our economic recovery,” Evers said. Republicans and their conservative allies have worked to block every Evers initiative to stop the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The son of a state representative who opposed COVID-19 public restrictions said his father was positive for the coronavirus when he died. Roy Edwards, 66, died Nov. 2 at Wyoming Medical Center in Casper after being hospitalized for more than a week with illness that was not immediately disclosed, The Gillette News Record reports. Edwards continued to oppose public restrictions resulting from the pandemic during his recent campaign to retain his House seat. He was reelected the day after he died. Mitch Edwards said his father initially experienced minor virus symptoms. He was told by a medical professional that he had sinusitis, an inflammation of the sinuses, and did not need to be tested for COVID-19. Roy Edwards was not advised to quarantine, but he did so as a a precaution, Mitch Edwards said. His symptoms worsened, and he had trouble breathing Oct. 23, when he again sought medical attention.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/11/09/hospital-wedding-howard-celebrates-home-order-news-around-states/114749772/", "title": "Hospital wedding, Howard celebrates: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: An organization for teachers is expressing concern that children are being allowed to return to school before completing required COVID-19 quarantine periods, potentially putting the health of students and school employees at risk. The Alabama Education Association sent a letter Thursday to the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners saying it had learned some doctors are writing excuses for students to return to school before mandated quarantine periods expired. Theron Stokes, associate executive director of AEA, said doctors should be aware of the guidelines and follow them. “When students return to school having not completed the entire 14-day quarantine period, they are placing their fellow students and their schools’ employees at risk. For students and school employees who have underlying health conditions, these decisions can be deadly,” Stokes wrote. The group said it is gross negligence to ignore the quarantine guidelines and threatened possible legal action.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s largest city plans to boost enforcement of an expanded mask mandate and restrict gathering sizes in a bid to curb coronavirus cases, officials said Friday. The changes take effect Monday, with masks to be worn, with a few exceptions, in indoor public settings or communal areas and outdoors when distancing from non-household members is not possible. In some cases, such as for individuals with disabilities who cannot tolerate a mask, face shields will be allowed unless wearing one would be impossible, the order says. Masks are to be worn by school-age children older than 5, those who exercise or work at gyms, and athletes, players, coaches and officials who participate in organized sports, according to the municipality directives. Athletes must keep a mask on for indoor sports, but one is not required while “exercising vigorously outdoors,” the directives state.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A top hospital official urged Arizonans to help curb the spread of the coronavirus by considering alternatives to traditional Thanksgiving get-togethers. “Congregating in large groups and close contact with others outside of your immediate household put you and those around you at risk,” said Dr. Marjorie Bessell, chief clinical officer of Banner Health. “I know we are asking a lot of you.” Banner operates 23 hospitals in Arizona and several in other states. Arizona health officials on Sunday reported 1,880 new COVID-19 cases and 17 additional deaths. State Department of Health Services officials said the latest figures increase Arizona’s totals to 259,264 cases and 6,164 known deaths since the coronavirus pandemic began. Cases and hospitalizations have been steadily increasing in Arizona since late September and throughout October after bottoming out in August after the state was a national hot spot in June and July.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state hit a record one-day increase in coronavirus cases Friday for the second day in a row, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he was growing concerned about hospital capacity. The Department of Health said the state’s probable and confirmed virus cases rose by 1,870. The state’s previous one-day high came Thursday, when it reported 1,548 new cases. On Saturday the department reported 1,598 new cases and 12 additional deaths for totals of 120,828 cases and 2,068 deaths since the pandemic began. The department reported 722 hospitalizations, 16 more than Friday’s then-record high. “Today’s numbers show we are not in a good position as we head into the colder months,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Friday. “I ask all Arkansans to take this virus seriously and to take necessary precautions. Our number of new cases is growing at a rate that worries me in terms of our hospital capacity.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: Republican former U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa was victorious Saturday in his race to return to Congress, where he once headed the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and became a GOP favorite for launching a string of investigations of the Obama administration. The former nine-term congressman and ardent supporter of President Donald Trump trailed early in the San Diego-area 50th District. But as more votes were counted after Election Day, he overtook Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar. The latest vote count update gave him about 54% of the votes and a 23,000-vote lead. Issa already had declared victory in a statement posted to social media Friday night. Campa-Najjar, a 31-year-old former Obama administration official, was making his second bid for the seat. He received more votes than he did in 2018 and thanked his supporters for “giving a Latino-Arab American a chance to do something special.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: City officials are urging residents to stay home between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. in an effort to stem the tide of coronavirus cases, which could overwhelm area hospitals by the end of the year. Mayor Michael Hancock said during a virtual news conference Friday that the “Home by 10 Order,” which will last for at least 30 days, is necessary to avoid another citywide stay-at-home order. He also urged residents not to gather or mix with other households. “I’m not going to mince any words here when it comes to the spread of the coronavirus,” Hancock said. “We’re on a very dangerous path. We’re seeing rapid, significant increases in the numbers of people getting sick, and many of those people ended up in the hospital.” The mayor shied away from calling the order a curfew because he said enforcement would only target the most egregious violations – not, for instance, someone walking their dog or going for a run after 10 p.m.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: Several colleges and universities have added new restrictions for students as coronavirus cases continue to rise in the state. Quinnipiac University announced it is instituting a two-week quarantine after recording 155 positive tests on campus since Wednesday. The quarantine means residential students must stay in their rooms, except to pick up takeout meals from the dining hall, and students living off campus can only return for testing. Students in isolation who have tested positive for the coronavirus will have meals delivered to their rooms each night. At Yale University, students residing in Davenport, Hopper, and Saybrook Colleges were ordered to quarantine because of positive coronavirus tests. In Fairfield, Sacred Heart and Fairfield universities have instituted curfews. The state reported Friday that 22 more people were hospitalized with COVID-19, bringing the total to 402, the highest total in five months.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: For the Rehoboth Beach Film Society, the show (or shows) must go on. The 23rd annual Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival is taking place as scheduled this month with a few modifications for health concerns. Only five films will be shown inside the society’s Cinema Art Theater, with 10 more available to stream at home. “We had the opportunity to carry out this event with the safety of our viewers as a priority,” said Rehoboth Beach Film Society Executive Director Sue Early. “They can watch films at home this year. It’s not the same experience, but there’s some great films to see. And in our theater, we could be showing at 60%, and we’re only going to use 30 out of 104 seats, which is just under 29%. They are well-spaced and cleaned after every screening. So it’s really safe.” Tickets are on sale now for the festival, which runs Nov. 5-15.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Hundreds of people gathered on the campus of Howard University on Saturday to celebrate their sister Kamala Harris after her announcement as vice president-elect, WUSA-TV reports. “When you come to Howard University, that is a very distinct choice,” said Niambi Carter, associate professor of political science at Howard University. “You are choosing a legacy and a lineage that is great in so many aspects.” A large group of Alpha chapter members of Alpha Kappa Alpha gathered in front of the sorority’s plot on the yard to cheer for Harris’ election. “I’m so proud of Kamala, and I’m so proud to stand on the grounds where she walked,” alumna Kenya Sumner said. Harris graduated from Howard with a degree in political science and economics in 1986, the same year she became a member of the Alpha chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first historically black sorority, founded on Howard’s campus.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrange Park: Eight weeks after being admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, Henry Bell and his longtime fiancee decided the time was right for a wedding. So the day before his anticipated release from the inpatient rehab center at Orange Park Medical Center, Bell, 63, and Antionette Brown, 48, said their vows in the parking lot Thursday. Brown’s uncle performed the ceremony. “His condition was deadly,” Brown said. “We decided to do it now because we feel they (the hospital staff) are like family and wanted to share the life they gave us back.” Bell was admitted to the hospital Sept. 13 and immediately put on a ventilator. Brown and the couple’s seven grown children could only wait and hope for his condition to improve. He spent weeks in intensive care. He entered the hospital’s rehab center Sunday, and his recovery has included learning how to walk again.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Athens-Clarke County plans to rent space for jury trials and grand jury proceedings. Grand juries and trials have been on hold in the state since March 14, when state Supreme Court Chief Justice Harold Melton declared a statewide judicial emergency because of the coronavirus threat. In subsequent renewal orders, Melton amended them to allow for court proceedings if they could be conducted safely. The best option for holding court proceedings in Athens-Clarke County is by using the Classic Center, said a committee tasked with deciding the issue. The county will pay the Classic Center up to $350,815 to rent space for the proceedings. The price Athens-Clarke will pay includes daily cleaning of the rooms used for trial proceedings, including space to conduct actual trials and a jury deliberation room. The $350,815 amount is based on the cost of 30 jury trials that last an average of five days each.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Land and Natural Resources reopened a popular scenic spot on Oahu that has been closed to visitors since the outbreak of the coronavirus. The Nuuanu Pali State Wayside, popularly known as Pali Lookout, was closed to the public at the outset of the pandemic because of budgetary constraints and crowding concerns. There were challenges in maintaining physical distancing at the lookout, State Parks Administrator Curt Cottrell said. Officials announced the park, which is among the most visited spots on Oahu, reopened Wednesday with daily hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The gates to the park’s access roads will be unlocked and secured daily by the Honolulu Police Department. The state set new parking fees of $7 per vehicle for nonresidents. Hawaii residents are not subject to parking and entry fees at any state parks. Tour buses are largely absent from the lookout, making the volume of visitors much lower.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A state panel of medical experts is asking the governor for a statewide mask mandate, and hospitals are running out of space for COVID-19 patients, after a week marked with record numbers of new cases and deaths. At least 671 Idaho residents have died from the coronavirus, and a record high of 1,290 new COVID-19 cases were reported on Wednesday alone, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, followed by 1,265 new cases Thursday. More than 69,500 residents have been confirmed to have the illness since the pandemic began. Idaho hospitals have reported more than 200 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 every day since Oct. 12. On Nov. 2, the most recent data available, there were nearly 300 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Jeanie Gentry, CEO of Steele Memorial Medical Center in Salmon, told the Idaho Statesman the facility is short about 40% of its staffers because they’ve been exposed or sickened.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has tested negative for the coronavirus after learning he may have been exposed during a meeting to someone who tested positive. Members of Pritzker’s staff who attended the meeting last Monday also tested negative for the virus, his office said Saturday in a news release. Pritzker had self-isolated Friday while awaiting test results. They were the second negative test results for Pritzker and staff members who also underwent weekly tests Wednesday, according to his office. Meanwhile, 12,438 newly confirmed and probable cases of the virus and another 76 deaths were reported Saturday by the Illinois Department of Public Health. More than 10,370 new cases and 49 deaths were reported Friday. Illinois has had nearly 478,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 10,150 deaths since the start of the pandemic.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: The University of Notre Dame’s Faculty Senate formally expressed disappointment in the school president’s failure to wear a face mask at a White House event days before he tested positive for the coronavirus. The Faculty Senate voted 29-13 on Thursday for a resolution expressing disappointment in the Rev. John Jenkins’ failure to wear a mask and practice social distancing at a Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett, a Notre Dame law professor confirmed last month as a U.S. Supreme Court justice. The Faculty Senate was originally expected to vote on a no confidence resolution, but that was amended. Jenkins tested positive for the coronavirus days after the Rose Garden ceremony, where President Donald Trump introduced Barrett as his nominee to the high court. Jenkins was seen without a mask, and he shook hands and sat shoulder-to-shoulder with others.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State prison officials reported Friday that a coronavirus outbreak has infected nearly half of the inmates at a prison in Anamosa. Testing last week revealed 476 inmates among 985 at the prison tested positive for the virus, said Cord Overton, a spokesman for the Iowa Department of Corrections. A report provided by the department indicates 37 staff members also tested positive. Across the nine institutions the department manages, 601 inmates were infected as of Friday afternoon. The report shows coronavirus has been active in the prison system since testing began in March with more than 21,000 tests administered to inmates. It said 1,252 inmates have recovered, an indication they have at one time tested positive but are no longer symptomatic are believed to be contagious. Four Iowa inmates have died during the pandemic, the report said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state saw most of a projected budget shortfall melt away Friday with a fiscal forecast that is less pessimistic about the economy and tax collections than a dire estimate issued this spring during a statewide lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic. The forecasting group boosted the state’s forecast for tax collections by $463 million, or 6.3%, for the 2021 budget year that began July 1. The group also issued its first calculations for the 2022 budget year that starts in July 2021, and while the forecast predicts a drop in tax collections of 2.1%, or $166 million, that’s due largely to the end of a temporary, pandemic-induced move to help income taxpayers. The Legislature’s nonpartisan research staff now projects a $153 million budget shortfall for the state’s 2022 budget year, an amount that almost can be covered by an internal shuffling of government funds that Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly already has proposed.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s bar and restaurant operators are getting a break from alcoholic beverage renewal fees in a cost-saving step as they struggle with revenue losses from the pandemic. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is granting a 12-month fee renewal waiver to license holders, Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday. Bar and restaurant operators who haven’t submitted the renewal fee this year won’t have to pay until 2021, he said. Those who have paid this year will have their fees waived in 2021, he said. “This has certainly been a difficult year for our bars, restaurants and venues, and they deserve this innovative support as we face what could be a very painful winter,” Beshear said. Bars and restaurants have endured capacity limitations to help contain the coronavirus. The fee waiver doesn’t apply to producers, distributors, wholesalers and others able to continue operations throughout the virus-related state of emergency.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: In response to complaints that family and clergy were barred from hospitals and nursing homes amid the coronavirus pandemic, legislators have rewritten state laws to lessen visitation restrictions during public health emergencies. The bills passed unanimously in the special session that ended last month and were signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. They still will give discretion to the Louisiana Department of Health to decide just how wide-open the visitation can be and what safety protections will have to be followed. One measure by Sen. Robert Mills, a Minden Republican, calls on the health department to create rules requiring inpatient health care facilities to allow pastors, priests and other members of the clergy to visit patients during a public health emergency, if the patient asks for the visit.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Officials on Friday recommended caution at more schools in the state because of the rise in coronavirus cases. The state uses a color-coded system to categorize the level of precaution schools should use. The administration of Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said it’s adding schools in Knox County and Franklin County to the “yellow” category, which is an intermediate level. Those counties join Somerset and Washington counties in the yellow category. All other counties in the state are in the “green” category, the lowest level, though officials said they’re closely monitoring schools in Waldo and Kennebec counties. The state recommends that schools located in counties in the yellow category consider hybrid instruction models to reduce the number of people in schools and classrooms. The change in category for some schools came as cases surged around the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city is tightening restrictions on restaurants and indoor and outdoor gatherings in response to rising cases of the coronavirus, Mayor Bernard “Jack” Young announced Friday. The changes will take effect Thursday at 5 p.m. Young said numbers of people in restaurants, religious facilities, theaters and malls will be limited to 25% capacity. Young said food service establishments must close indoor dining at 10 p.m. Bars that don’t have a license to sell food will be closed. “I am instituting these restrictions for the public health and to save lives in Baltimore city,” Young said. Also, the city’s health commissioner revised an order to require masks to be worn in public at all times, whether people are inside or outside. Dr. Letitia Dzirasa’s order is effective immediately. “Over the past month Baltimore city has seen our data trends move in the wrong direction,” she said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State officials on Friday urged more schools to return to full, in-person instruction, saying that only communities with the highest COVID-19 rates should be using any form of remote learning. Under previous guidance, schools were told to shift among remote learning, in-person learning or a mix of the two depending on their area’s infection rate. Areas with moderate spread were advised to use remote or hybrid learning, while only those with the lowest rates were encouraged to bring students back full time. But speaking at a news conference, Gov. Charlie Baker said there’s growing evidence that schools are not a significant source of spread and that keeping students at home hurts their learning and mental health. “We continue to see too many communities with children learning in remote-only models,” he said. “We all know that losing a week, a month, a quarter or more in the life of a kid’s education has real consequences.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Joe Biden reclaimed the Wolverine State for Democrats with a surge of support in urban regions like Detroit and Grand Rapids, offsetting high turnout in rural and exurban areas for President Donald Trump. Biden’s 146,000-vote margin, 2.7 percentage points, was powered by gains in big, vote-rich counties such as Oakland near Detroit and Kent, which includes Grand Rapids – amid a record 5.5 million people casting ballots statewide. Biden won Oakland by 14 points, besting Hillary Clinton’s 8-point edge in 2016. He carried Kent by almost 6 points after Trump netted it by 3 points four years ago. Trump again won traditional bellwether Macomb County outside Detroit, by roughly 8 points – less than his 11-point margin in 2016, however. Biden became just the second Democratic presidential candidate to carry Kent in more than 50 years, after Barack Obama did it in his first run.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: COVID-19 is sweeping across the state at an unprecedented pace, breaking records for new cases and daily deaths and raising concerns about the ability of hospitals to keep up. The Star Tribune reports Saturday’s tally of 4,647 new cases – a figure that would have easily set a record during the first eight months of the pandemic – wasn’t even close to the biggest single-day count of the past week. For the seven-day period ending Saturday, Minnesota reported more than 25,000 new COVID-19 cases, or more than 10% of the state’s cases since March. The Minnesota Department of Health reported another 34 deaths Saturday, bringing the week’s total to 168, the second-highest one-week count since the start of the pandemic. Hospitals, meanwhile, are scrambling to treat more COVID-19 patients even as the virus threatens to sideline more health care workers.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Health has been working around the clock to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Now, the agency will be responsible for starting a statewide medical marijuana program within the next nine months. Uncertified election results showed 74% of Mississippi voters approved the ballot measure that allows doctors to prescribe up to 5 ounces of marijuana per month for people who have at least one of more than 20 serious medical conditions. “This vote shows minds are changing,” said Jaqueline Temple Rudder, a homemaker from Madison County who lost her father-in-law to cancer and voted for Initiative 65. “We don’t want our sick suffering.” Both Gov. Tate Reeves and state’s top health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, opposed the initiative. Officials with the Department of Health will have until August to begin licensing treatment centers and certifying eligible patients.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Local health departments in the state don’t have enough staffers to conduct contact tracing for all the COVID-19 cases popping up, so they have been prioritizing the ones they try to trace back to their sources, officials said. The state’s rate of positive tests over the past two weeks is more than double the national average, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Larry Jones, who heads the Missouri Center for Public Health Excellence, said local health departments are struggling to keep up with contact tracing, which helps determine how a disease is spreading. Missouri on Sunday reported 4,131 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and three more deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Missouri has risen over the past two weeks, from about 1,789 new cases per day Oct. 24 to about 3,126 as of Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A nursing facility in Butte has reported 10 COVID-19-related deaths in less than two weeks, and Gallatin County on Friday enacted stricter measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. Montana has hit a record for hospitalizations, and the confirmed number of infection cases was closing in on 38,000, state officials said. The state health department confirmed 986 more cases of COVID-19 on Friday, bringing the total for the past week to 6,040, or an average of 863 cases per day. Over the previous week, the daily average was 779. Montana has reported 418 deaths, which may not include all 10 deaths tied to the outbreak at the Continental Care & Rehabilitation nursing facility in Butte. The Gallatin County health board on Friday said bars, restaurants and casinos must close by 10 p.m. instead of 12:30 a.m. They must also limit group sizes at tables to six adults plus children who are with a parent or guardian.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to report record numbers of new coronavirus cases and people hospitalized with the virus. Health officials said the surge in cases over the past month continued Friday with 2,681 new cases and 748 people hospitalized with the virus. Both those were new records, and the state’s rate of new cases was the seventh-highest in the nation. The state said 27 new deaths were reported Friday to give Nebraska 701 deaths. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has increased over the past two weeks from 836.71 new cases per day Oct. 23 to 1,408.86 new cases per day Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Also Friday, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said nine more staff members had tested positive for the virus to give it a total of 225 staff members who have been diagnosed with the virus. The department said the ill staffers are all isolating themselves at home.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Democrats successfully won reelection in the swing state’s two battleground congressional districts. First-term Rep. Susie Lee won reelection to a second term by defeating former professional wrestler Dan Rodimer in the 3rd District. Republicans believed the Las Vegas-area district offered them their best chance at unseating an incumbent. Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford was reelected in the state’s other battleground district, defeating Republican former Assemblyman Jim Marchant. Lee and Horsford’s victories cement a six-year hold on Nevada’s swing districts, which Democrats have won in the three most recent elections, and helps Democrats hoping maintain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, where many races remain too early to call with votes left to be counted. The result sends Nevada’s existing delegation back to Washington, D.C.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth-Hitchcock is again putting strict limits on visitors to its hospitals and outpatient clinics in response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Effective Friday, visitors are banned under most circumstances. Limited exceptions will be made for pediatric patients, women giving birth, patients at the end of life and those in a few other circumstances. The return to more restrictive policies applies to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon as well as the health system’s outpatient clinics and facilities. Officials said their decision was based on the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in both New Hampshire and Vermont. Meanwhile, the state’s court system said it is suspending in-person hearings for a few days after Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Day to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday named his associate counsel to lead the commission that will oversee the state’s new recreational marijuana marketplace. Dianna Houenou, who serves as legal counsel to Murphy’s administration, will chair the Cannabis Regulatory Commission. Before working in Murphy’s administration, Houenou was policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union in New Jersey. Murphy, a Democrat, made the announcement just days after New Jersey voters approved a constitutional amendment legalizing recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. The amendment goes into effect at the start of next year and calls for state regulators to set up a marketplace for the legal sale of the drug. It’s unclear when marijuana will be ready to hit retail shelves in the state. Advocates for legalization said the soonest they expect it could happen toward the end of 2021.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State officials have the power to impose civil penalties when enforcing public health orders that call for businesses to restrict their operations amid a public health emergency, the state Supreme Court said Friday. The unanimous written opinion details the legal reasoning for an oral decision made by the court in August in a case brought by businesses that challenged health orders issued as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had petitioned the court to resolve the dispute. Lujan Grisham has warned that more restrictions could be imposed as early as this week as infections, hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase. She also said she has been disappointed in enforcement, pointing to businesses and country clubs in Albuquerque and elsewhere that hosted Halloween parties despite the ban on gatherings.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Restrictions in some New York City pandemic hot spots will be rolled back, even as the state prepares to combat coronavirus flare-ups upstate, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday. The governor said he’s considering imposing additional social distancing restrictions in “microcluster” zones in the Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse areas because of rising infection rates. The addition of more of those zones upstate reflect the shifting state strategy as COVID-19 becomes a worsening problem beyond New York City, once an epicenter of the pandemic. The governor also said the National Guard will increase its presence at airports to help make sure travelers from non-neighboring states can provide proof of a negative coronavirus test. “In general, downstate New York is doing better than upstate New York, which is a total reversal from the first phase of COVID,” Cuomo said during a telephone briefing.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republicans pressed state election officials Friday to make public more information about the number of outstanding ballots from last week’s election that could be counted. Nearly a dozen Election Day races in North Carolina, including those for president and U.S. Senate, remained too early to call because as many as 172,000 ballots had either yet to be counted or rejected, or could trickle in before this week’s deadline to receive mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day. The actual number of ballots that will arrive is likely to be less, however, because many people who requested absentee ballots ended up voting on Election Day or perhaps didn’t vote at all. And past elections show a significant portion of the 41,000 provisional ballots cast Tuesday will be rejected.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A child with COVID-19 has been confirmed to have a rare condition that causes inflammation in different parts of the body, state health officials said Friday. The child, who was discharged from the hospital and is resting at home, is the first confirmed case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in the state. “This development is an unfortunate reminder that COVID-19 can impact people of any age, even children,” Dr. Joan Connell, Department of Health field medical officer and pediatrician, said in a statement. “The best way to help prevent your child from getting MIS-C is to take action to avoid exposure to the COVID-19 virus and teach your child how to do the same.” MIS-C – short for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children – can inflame the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs. Children with it have experienced persistent fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes and fatigue. Long-term effects are unknown.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The number of coronavirus cases in the state has continued to spike despite pleas from the governor for people to help slow the spread. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Ohio has risen over the past two weeks from 2,084 new cases per day Oct. 22 to 3,748 new cases per day Thursday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in the state has also risen over the past two weeks from 4.96% on Oct. 22 to 7.93% on Thursday, according to the tracking hub. The Health Department on Friday reported 5,008 probable and confirmed cases, another daily record high. Ohio has reported more than 240,000 probable and confirmed cases to date, including 5,494 deaths. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday that he planned to announce additional measures soon to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of newly reported coronavirus cases in the state Saturday more than doubled the previous one-day record, and the Department of Health said a backlog of cases and possibly duplicate reporting were the reason. There were 4,741 new cases, bringing the total to 136,492 since the pandemic began, the department said. The previous one-day record of 2,101 new cases was recorded Thursday as cases in the state have surged in recent weeks. “We have reason to believe that our normal case count would have continued on an upward trajectory without the backlog and duplication,” which is due to a transition from a manual to electronic reporting system, according to a health department statement. In a statement, Gov. Kevin Stitt called on residents to wash hands often, socially distance and voluntarily wear masks at indoor public places.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Following a record-breaking day of COVID-19 cases in the state, officials announced new restrictions Friday that will be implemented in at least five of the state’s counties as part of a two-week pause on social activities. The updated safety measures, which begin Wednesday, include halting visitations to long-term care facilities, reducing the capacity of indoor dining at restaurants to 50 people, encouraging all businesses to mandate working from home, and urging Oregonians not to gather with people who do not live in their household – but if they do to limit it to six people. If people have multiple get-togethers, which is discouraged, it should be the same social circle of six people. “Let me be clear, we cannot allow this disease to continue to spread so rapidly in our communities. Lives are at stake,” Gov. Kate Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Bail has been set at $750,000 each for two men authorities said were armed with loaded handguns when they were arrested near the city’s convention center where votes were being counted. Joshua Macias, 42, and Antonio LaMotta, 61, traveled from the Virginia Beach, Virginia, area in a Hummer and did not have permits to carry the weapons in Pennsylvania, police said. They were charged with carrying a concealed firearm without a license and carrying a firearm on a public street. The men were stopped Thursday about a block from the vehicle, Macias with a .40-caliber Beretta handgun inside his jacket and LaMotta with a 9 mm Beretta in a holster, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. An AR-style rifle and ammunition were found inside the vehicle, Outlaw said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: Protesters gathered near a prison that houses federal detainees Friday, denouncing the facility’s contract with U.S. immigration authorities and pointing to a surge in coronavirus infections among detainees. Demonstrators blocked roads leading to the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, where authorities say more than 150 detainees have tested positive for COVID-19. Activists have repeatedly called for Wyatt’s closure, saying conditions are subpar. The publicly owned but privately operated lockup has about 540 inmates in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In April, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal class-action lawsuit seeking the release of dozens of detainees, saying the virus was spreading “uncontrollably.” More than two dozen detainees subsequently were freed.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two days after his opponent proclaimed victory in South Carolina’s 1st District, freshman U.S. House Rep. Joe Cunningham conceded defeat Friday, saying he was proud of the work he had done in his single term in Congress and pledging to continue to work toward bipartisan progress as a private citizen. Standing in front of the U.S. Customs House in Charleston, Cunningham told supporters that he had called Republican Nancy Mace to offer support and congratulations. “She’s now my representative,” Cunningham said. “I’m rooting for her.” The Associated Press called the race for Mace early Wednesday morning, but Cunningham did not concede, citing scanning issues with absentee ballots in one of the district’s counties. In her victory, Mace, 42, becomes the first Republican woman elected to Congress in South Carolina and only the second-ever woman from the state elected to a full House term.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: More than 100 state residents have died of complications due to the coronavirus in the first eight days of November, health officials said Sunday. The Department of Health confirmed 13 deaths in the past day, for a total of 111 this month and 536 since the start of the pandemic. The overall death count is the 24th-highest per capita in the country in the past two weeks, Johns Hopkins University researchers said. The state reported 1,426 positive tests for COVID-19 since Saturday. South Dakota ranks second in the country behind North Dakota in the number of new cases per capita in the past two weeks. The top five counties with the most cases per capita in that time are Bon Homme, Dewey, Buffalo, Potter and Sanborn, according to the COVID Tracking Project. There are 546 people being treated in hospitals in the state, up 31 in the past day. Of those, 96 are in intensive care units, and 69 are using ventilators.\n\nTennessee\n\nJohnson City: Health officials in northeastern Tennessee say they do not have enough nurses to combat COVID-19 inside the region’s hospital system. “There are no longer enough nurses to fill the need that we have,” Ballad Health Senior Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer Lisa Smithgall told WJHL-TV. According to Ballad Health, the hospital system is looking to hire 350 registered nurses to fill its nurse shortage. “In the last eight weeks, we’ve had more than 900 patients admitted to COVID-19,” said Ballad Health Chief Administrative Officer Eric Deaton. After hitting 200 inpatients last week, the health care system has adjusted its COVID-19 surge plan to receive 300 inpatients. “These numbers represent lives; they’re non-encouraging,” Deaton said. “In fact, it’s really becoming a tragedy in the increased rates that we’re seeing.”\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: A district judge on Friday upheld an order from El Paso County’s top elected official shutting down businesses while the region fights an alarming surge in COVID-19 cases. The decision from Judge Bill Moody of El Paso’s 34th District Court came as federal military medical teams deployed to the border region at the request of the state. The county’s top elected official, El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, ordered a two-week shutdown of nonessential activities late last month. In making his decision, Moody pointed out that during the Spanish flu pandemic in the early part of the 20th century, city and county elected officials had authority to respond as they “thought was necessary to protect the health and financial interests of their individual communities.” Chris Hilton, an attorney with the Texas attorney general’s office, said the state would appeal.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s largest teachers union called for the governor to move all public secondary schools in high coronavirus transmission areas to remote learning Friday as the state reported a single-day record of 17 COVID-19 deaths. The Utah Education Association also called for Republican Gov. Gary Herbert to suspend all extracurricular activities that can’t comply with social distancing guidelines in high transmission areas from the Thanksgiving holiday throughout winter break. “We are now seeing multiple schools repeatedly shift back and forth from in-person to at-home learning due to outbreaks,” the union wrote in a statement. “This cycle is obviously not helping to control the virus spread and, as educators, we can unequivocally state the continual interruptions are not in the best interest of student learning.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Republican Gov. Phil Scott said Friday that comments by President Donald Trump casting doubts on the integrity of the election process are hurting society. Scott said all legal votes cast in the 2020 election need to be counted, including mail-in votes. Scott’s comments came a day after President Donald Trump made baseless claims of fraud in the ballot-counting process for the presidential election. Scott said that the president’s comments are “inciting a lot of rhetoric” and that many of his followers take him at his word. “I don’t believe any of the statements he made last night are true, and I do believe it is hurting our society and our ability to work together,” Scott said. After voting Tuesday, he said he had cast his presidential ballot for former Vice President Joe Biden. He said he had never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate before but had to put “country over party.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Freshman Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger has kept her seat in a competitive congressional race in the Richmond suburbs. The former CIA operations officer defeated Republican challenger and state House delegate Nick Freitas in a close race that was called Sunday. Spanberger is considered one of Congress’ more moderate Democrats and was part of a wave of women who helped Democrats retake the U.S. House in 2018. But Freitas had tried to tie Spanberger to her party’s leadership and said it was out of sync with constituents. Spanberger spent nearly a decade with the CIA, working on counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation cases. She is one of two moderate Virginia Democrats who held on to U.S. House seats they flipped from red to blue two years ago, as Democrats’ strength in the Old Dominion continues to grow.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state set a daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 1,777 new confirmed cases announced Saturday, and the state Department of Health warned that COVID-19 cases are spreading in the Puget Sound region. In a statement, the health agency said the high numbers the state has seen over the past week reflect an overall surge that started in mid-September. King, Snohomish and Pierce counties are currently the hot spots in the region, officials said. “COVID-19 is currently spreading very quickly in Washington state,” said Secretary of Health John Wiesman. “We are very concerned that disease transmission will only grow over the next few weeks with the holidays coming up. The threat to overwhelming not just our hospital systems, but our ability to do contact tracing, is real. We need everyone in Washington state to take action now to stop the spread.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported surging COVID-19 case numbers Saturday along with 15 newly reported deaths from the virus. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources reported 655 newly reported cases as of 10 a.m. Saturday for a total of 27,742 total cases and 502 deaths since the pandemic reached the state. The daily case count set a record for the state, a day after West Virginia saw a new peak of 540 cases over 24 hours. On Friday, several government staff and officials including Gov. Jim Justice were tested for the virus after a staffer in the Capitol building tested positive Friday morning. The attorney general’s office later said the employee believed to have the virus tested negative Friday night. Justice said he was tested for the virus minutes before a noon news conference Friday, where he announced the record high of new cases. He also urged West Virginians to get tested at sites around the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: State health officials reported a new daily high of more than 7,000 new COVID-19 cases – another new daily record. Saturday’s total of 7,065 confirmed infections is more than 900 cases higher than the previous record, set Friday with 6,141 cases, according to the state Department of Health Services. The state first passed 6,000 daily cases Friday, and Tuesday and Wednesday of this past week also saw record-setting numbers of new cases. The 7,065 positive cases made up 37% of the 18,928 test results reported Saturday by the state health department. The seven-day average of new cases also rose again, hitting 5,394, which is the highest weekly average to date, according to DHS. The state health department also reported 45 more people have died, bringing the state’s death toll to 2,301.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: State health officials reported 646 new coronavirus cases Sunday, the second-highest single-day total of the pandemic in the state. The Department of Health listed 966 new cases Friday, the highest single-day total. The Casper Star-Tribune reports at least 114 people have died of the coronavirus, and more than 14,690 people have tested positive. The new totals come amid a rapid surge in the numbers of cases in Wyoming and throughout much of the U.S. Gov. Mark Gordon has said he is not considering implementing a statewide face mask order but has urged residents to wear masks. Albany County, which includes Laramie; the Wind River Reservation; and Teton and Laramie counties have implemented mask mandates under which residents must wear facial coverings when outside their homes, with some exceptions.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/08/health/health-care-work-force-recovering/index.html", "title": "Health care work force on track to recover from pandemic -- with a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe health care work force in the US had huge turnover at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic but seems to be getting back to prepandemic levels, although it’s not there yet, according to a new study.\n\nThe study, published Friday in the journal JAMA Health Forum, found that the recovery has largely been uneven.\n\nResearchers from the University of Washington and the University of Minnesota compared turnover rates between April-December 2020 and January-October 2021, using records from the US Current Population Survey, along with records from the US Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They looked at records on 125,717 health care workers.\n\nWhen hospitals postponed elective surgeries and clinics closed during the first peak of the pandemic, about 1.5 million health care workers lost their jobs, other research has showed. Most jobs returned by fall 2020. But by the next year, the health care employment rate was still 2.7% below prepandemic levels.\n\nThe researchers note that because of the way they did this study, they weren’t able to directly link work force exits to Covid-19.\n\nTurnover rates peaked in the first part of the pandemic, but the work force largely recovered in the second period studied, with the exception of doctors and people who worked in long-term care facilities.\n\nTurnover rates also varied by demographics. More health care workers – men and women – with young children left the work force. The rate was higher among women.\n\nThe turnover rates among American Indians, Alaskan Natives and Pacific Islanders were higher than among other races. Black and Latino workers experienced the slowest job recovery rates in the second period studied. The people least likely to leave were White workers.\n\nTurnover also varied by position, with aides and assistants most likely to leave their jobs throughout the pandemic.\n\nThe researchers were unable to address specifically why people were quitting, but study co-author Janette Dill, an associate professor in the Division of Health Policy and Management in the School of Public Health at the University of Minnesota, had some ideas.\n\nWages may a part of the problem. She points to the high turnover rates in long-term care as an example.\n\n“Long-term care is a sector that is largely paid for by Medicaid, and Medicaid has pretty low reimbursement rates, and so consequently, the wages in long-term care are pretty low. So there are lots of reasons people would want to leave long-term care,” Dill said.\n\nProblems in that part of the health care industry predate the pandemic, but the pandemic made them much worse, she said.\n\n“I interviewed a worker recently who told me that she could get a job at Target that paid $2 more an hour than her health care job. Who could blame her for leaving?” Dill said. “Long-term care has a lot of pressure from retail right now that just pays better.”\n\nThe Biden administration also raised the amount of money people could get while on unemployment, which may also have played a role in people leaving jobs that didn’t pay well.\n\nIt may also be an issue of risk.\n\nBlack and Latino workers tend to work more as aides and assistants, Dill noted, occupations that are at significant risk of infection and had far less access to protective gear, particularly at the start of the pandemic. Those communities also have had a disproportionate number of Covid-19 cases.\n\nWhite workers were more concentrated in technician, therapist, physician and registered nurse positions, where people were a little better able to protect themselves.\n\nBurnout and a lack of child care may also be to blame.\n\nApril Kapu, president of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, said her group has been following the work force issue closely.\n\nTurnover and retention have been a serious concern, she said. “I think the pandemic really highlighted much of what was already there,” said Kapu, who was not involved in the new research. “We have a lot of work to do in the area of mental health and supporting the mental health of our health care workers.”\n\nThe Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act, which President Biden signed into law in March, is one step in that direction, she said. It authorizes grants for programs that offer behavioral health services for front-line health care workers.\n\nThe act was named for a New York City emergency room doctor who died by suicide in 2020. She had been working 18-hour days and treating an onslaught of Covid-19 patients at the start of the pandemic.\n\nKapu said more funds are also needed to increase the work force in general and to pay for education so more people can go into the health care profession.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOne of the study’s findings that may not be able to be explained by wages is the high level of physicians who left their jobs. The rate is lower than any of the other positions, but the number of doctors leaving the health care sector has stayed high, compared with 2019, and it is unusual.\n\n“Physicians rarely leave their jobs,” Dill said. “It does seem to indicate that there is some dissatisfaction in the physician work force and the work force is not recovering to the same levels of the prepandemic period.”\n\nTracking turnover in health care is going to be critical to determining where retention efforts should be focused.\n\n“Waiting too long to understand these issues may further elongate the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic,” the study says.", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/21/uk/uk-strikes-explainer-ambulance-nurses-railways-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "UK strikes: Paramedics and nurses have joined Britain's wave of ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nAnother day, another round of strikes in Britain.\n\nAs the Christmas holidays approach, railway workers have brought the transport network to a standstill. Border Force staff are preparing to walk out. Postal workers, bus drivers and civil servants are either in the middle of strike action or threatening to strike.\n\nThis week, nurses staged their biggest walkout in decades. And on Wednesday, paramedics are on strike in many parts of England, in a particularly bitter dispute that will bring further turmoil to an already ravaged public health system.\n\nThe public have been urged to only call ambulances if they absolutely need to. ‘Don’t get so drunk that you end up with an unnecessary visit to A&E,” Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, told the BBC.\n\nBut Wednesday’s strike heaps further pressure on the government, which has been accused of disregarding the calls of workers. Health Secretary Steve Barclay told the Daily Telegraph that ambulance workers have “taken a conscious choice to inflict harm on patients,” comments that drew the ire of workers and unions.\n\nA collection of individual disputes across various sectors have coalesced into a broader sense that something has gone very wrong in Britain, with workers saying that their pay, conditions and ability to provide essential services have been compromised by years of cuts and underinvestment.\n\nHow have things got to such a nadir?\n\nWho is on strike?\n\nThursday’s strike by ambulance workers, who are demanding a pay rise in line with inflation, comes after thousands of nurses walked out on 15 and 20 December.\n\nIt is not just health and emergency services that are affected; virtually all forms of travel have been affected in some ways by strike or are expected to be in coming weeks – along with education, the criminal justice system, the postal service and a host of other fields.\n\nRailway strikes have been raging for several months and frequently dominate front pages in the UK. The RMT union, which mostly represents guards, ticket examiners and maintenance staff, has called a series of walkouts, including over the Christmas period. ASLEF, which represents train drivers, has also planned action in January. Railway workers want better pay and increased job security.\n\nPostal workers with Royal Mail, which is now a private company, are taking action in the run-up to Christmas, affecting deliveries during the busy festive stretch.\n\nBorder Force workers in the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) are striking for eight days during the holiday period. The strikes will impact London Heathrow airport, as well as hubs at London Gatwick, Manchester, Birmingham, Cardiff and Glasgow. Baggage handlers have also walked out on some dates.\n\nBus drivers in London planned a series of strikes throughout December.\n\nSeveral teachers’ unions are consulting their members about striking, after pay offers were rejected. There is already a national teachers’ strike set for Scotland next month.\n\nCriminal barristers went on strike earlier in the winter, before voting to accept a pay offer and end the action.\n\nWhy are strikes sweeping Britain?\n\nEach workforce has complaints specific to their sectors that have brought them to the picket line. But the wave of strikes must also be viewed in light of the UK’s long-running economic and societal stagnation, which has left workers desperate for a better deal.\n\nA cost of living crisis and soaring inflation have left Britons worse off this year. When adjusted for inflation, wages in the UK have fallen at one of the sharpest rates since records began in 2001, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nAnd Britain’s public sector workers in particular are bearing the brunt; average pay growth in the private sector was 6.9% in the middle of 2022, compared to 2.7% for the public sector – the ONS said this gulf is “among the largest differences between the private sector and public sector growth rates we have seen.”\n\nStill, for many striking workers, anger can be traced back further than the current economic crises.\n\nSince former Prime Minister David Cameron’s austerity program saw budgets for public services slashed, employees have complained of a decline in many of Britain’s local agencies and institutional safety nets.\n\nFunding for local councils and schools slumped over the course of the 2010s, a decade of decline that critics say has held Britain back, leaving a gaping wound in the services parents, children and citizens rely on every day.\n\nThe aftershocks of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic further tightened the purse-strings and complicated a cautious effort to emerge from the tight-fisted approach that defined the 2010s.\n\nMore recently, instability at the heart of government – Britain is on its fifth Prime Minister in six years – and a disastrous financial program unveiled by shambolic ex-PM Liz Truss have dashed many Brits’ hopes that the public sector will get a boost in the near future.\n\nBritish railways have been severely disrupted by strikes for months. CARLOS JASSO/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHow desperate is Britain’s NHS?\n\nStrikes in the National Health Service – a pillar of Britain’s national identity and one of the world’s most lauded governmental programs – are rare.\n\nUntil this month, the UK’s largest nursing union had never called a walkout in its 106-year history. Wednesday’s ambulance strike is the first such action since 1990.\n\nThere are some concerns about the level of service that will continue during the strike. Members of the armed forces are being deployed in an effort to relieve the impact, and health minister Will Quince suggested on BBC Radio that people should avoid contact sport or other “risky activity” while ambulance services are disrupted, comments that were roundly criticized as flippant.\n\nBut workers in the NHS have been pushed to the brink in recent years, with a staffing crisis, low pay and skyrocketing waiting lists leaving hospitals and wards crammed full and staff exhausted.\n\nBrits must now wait an average of one hour for an ambulance if they’ve reported a suspected heart attack, stroke or other similar issues, despite an 18-minute national target. The wait for a “Category 1” call, which relates to immediate threats to life, is up to 10 minutes, despite a seven-minute target.\n\nConditions do not always improve while a patient arrives in hospital, where waiting times are at record levels. Every day, across the country, ambulances can be seen lined up outside emergency departments, waiting to discharge their patients.\n\nIn the West Midlands area of England, one person died after an ambulance delay in the whole of 2020. In the first nine months of 2022, that figure had soared to 37, according to the BBC’s Newsnight program, which obtained the figures through a Freedom of Information request.\n\n“The reality is, every day, nurses across the UK are walking into understaffed hospitals,” Andrea Mackay, who has worked as a nurse for seven years at a hospital in southwest England, told CNN on her reasons for striking last week.\n\n“During one of my worst shifts I was the only nurse to 28 unwell children,” added Jessie Collins, a pediatric nurse. “It’s not safe and we cannot deliver the care that these children need at times.”\n\nHas this happened before?\n\nThis wave of strikes is the biggest to hit Britain in a decade, and the sheer number of services being affected has drawn comparisons to the so-called winter of discontent of 1978 to 1979.\n\nThat period followed bitter pay disputes between the government and both the public and private sector; following her 1979 election victory, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher waged a largely victorious battle with many of Britain’s unions, severely diminishing their power.\n\nIn reality, the strikes of 2022 have caused a fraction of the impact that those did.\n\nA total of 417,000 working days were lost to strikes in October, the most recent month for which figures are available, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) – a far cry from the several million days lost at the end of the 1970s.\n\nBut October’s figure is the highest number for any month since 2011, and virtually all pay disputes seem far from resolved, stoking fears that next year will be one of mass disruption.\n\nWhat do the strikes mean for the government?\n\nThe government of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says it cannot afford the pay demands being made by the public sector unions. In the case of railway strikes, it has said the onus is on private train companies to resolve the disputes – despite the fact that the government controls the purse-strings, having bailed out the network during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut the ongoing disruption is a major headache for Sunak, who took over from Truss with the promise of a sensible and restrained approach to Britain’s stuttering economy.\n\nOpinion polls show the government is shouldering much of the blame for the spate of labor unrest, and that the public is generally sympathetic towards striking workers.\n\nMinisters have repeatedly taken a firm line, refusing to bow to the demands of any one union – opening itself up to criticism that it is not making enough effort bring an end to the strife.\n\nRishi Sunak has resisted unions' demands, but has been accused of not doing enough to end the strikes. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nOpposition Labour leader Keir Starmer attacked Sunak on the nursing strike in Parliament last week, telling him that “the whole country would breathe a sigh of relief” if he halted the strike by striking a deal with the RCN.\n\nThe industrial action was a “a badge of shame for this government,” Starmer said.\n\nHis party, which has historical links to several unions, is walking a delicate line on the strikes; Starmer has refused to explicitly support unions’ demands, but has pointed to their walkouts as evidence that the Conservatives have stalled the economy.\n\nThose arguments will be tested even further over the Christmas period and in the New Year, and public opinion will be vital in strengthening the government’s hand or forcing them to the negotiating table.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/komando/2023/04/30/how-enable-life-saving-settings-your-iphone-and-apple-watch/11747387002/", "title": "How to enable life-saving settings on your iPhone and Apple Watch", "text": "Kim Komando\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nI was a Boy Scouts leader (long story), so I know you always need to be prepared.\n\nOn your smartphone, the right apps can make a world of difference.

Steadiness\n\nWith your iPhone in your pocket, the Health app uses custom algorithms to assess your balance, strength, and gait. You can set up a notification if your level of steadiness drops. That’s important because that could mean you’re more at risk of falling.\n\nHere’s how to set up Steadiness Notifications:\n\n• Open the Health app and tap your profile at the top right. If you don’t see your picture or initials, tap Summary or Browse at the bottom, then scroll back to the top.\n\n• Tap Health Checklist.\n\n• Tap Set Up for Walking Steadiness Notifications and follow the onscreen instructions.\n\nIs carrying your phone in your pocket (guys) or your bra (ladies) safe? Here’s my answer.\n\n2. Heart rate variability\n\nHeart rate variability, or HRV, measures time intervals between heartbeats when you’re at rest. Your Apple Watch checks for irregular rhythms, sends you a notification and records the data in the Health app.\n\nIrregular rhythms could indicate atrial fibrillation (Afib), where the heart’s upper chambers beat out of sync with the lower chambers. Seriously dangerous stuff.\n\nHere’s how to check up on your HRV data:\n\n• Open the Health app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap Browse in the bottom right corner.\n\n• Tap Heart > Heart Rate Variability.\n\n• At the top, choose to view your data by day, week, month, half-year, and year.\n\nHere’s how to enable irregular rhythm notifications:\n\n• Open the Health app.\n\n• Tap Browse in the bottom right corner.\n\n• Tap Heart > Irregular Rhythm Notifications.\n\n• Once enabled, turn irregular rhythm notifications on or off in the Apple Watch app on your iPhone:\n\n• Open the Apple Watch app, tap the My Watch tab, then go to Heart > Irregular Rhythm.\n\nA nursing student said an Apple Watch notification helped detect a rare abnormality. Amazing stuff.\n\n3. High and low heart rates\n\nYour Apple Watch checks for low and high heart rates that could indicate an underlying condition. You can be notified when your heart rate goes above 120 bpm or drops below 40 bpm while inactive for 10 minutes.\n\nYou can turn on heart rate notifications when you first open the Heart Rate app on your Apple Watch or at any time from your iPhone:\n\n• Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap the My Watch tab, then tap Heart.\n\n• Tap High Heart Rate and choose a BPM.\n\n• Tap Low Heart Rate and choose a BPM.\n\n4. Respiratory rate\n\nYour respiratory rate refers to the number of times you breathe in a minute. This goes up as you exercise and down as you sleep. When you wear your Apple Watch to bed, it automatically measures and records your respiratory rate.\n\nWhen your respiratory rate is significantly higher or lower than usual while you sleep, it could indicate illness or a health condition.\n\nTo track your respiratory rate, you’ll need to set up the sleep features on your iPhone:\n\n• Open the Health app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap Get Started under Set Up Sleep and tap Next.\n\n• Follow the onscreen prompts.\n\n• Turn on Track Sleep with Apple Watch. This option is available during setup if you’ve paired your Apple Watch with your iPhone beforehand.

Critics have chided Bezos for not signing the Giving Pledge, a promise by hundreds of the world’s richest people to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Exclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now 01:50 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, said the couple is “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”\n\nAsked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: “Yeah, I do.”\n\nBezos said he and Sánchez agreed to their first interview together since they began dating in 2019 to help shine a spotlight on the Bezos Courage and Civility Award, granted this year to musician Dolly Parton.\n\nThe 20-minute exchange with Bezos and Sánchez covered a broad range of topics, from Bezos’s views on political dialogue and a possible economic recession to Sánchez’s plan to visit outer space with an all-female crew and her reflections on a flourishing business partnership with Bezos.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nThat working relationship was on display Saturday as Bezos and Sánchez announced a $100 million grant to Parton as part of her Courage and Civility Award. It is the third such award, following similar grants to chef Jose Andrés, who has spent some of the money making meals for Ukrainians — and the climate advocate and CNN contributor Van Jones.\n\n“When you think of Dolly,” said Sánchez in the interview, “Look, everyone smiles, right? She is just beaming with light. And all she wants to do is bring light into other people’s worlds. And so we couldn’t have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly, and we know she’s going to do amazing things with it.”\n\nThe throughline connecting the Courage and Civility Award grantees, Bezos said, was their capacity to bring many people together to solve large challenges.\n\n“I just feel honored to be able to be a part of what they’re doing for this world,” Bezos told CNN.\n\nUnity, Bezos said, is a trait that will be necessary to confront climate change and one that he repeatedly invoked as he blasted politicians and social media for amplifying division.\n\nHow to give it away\n\nBut the couple’s biggest challenge may be figuring out how to distribute Bezos’ vast fortune. Bezos declined to identify a specific percentage or to provide concrete details on where it would likely be spent.\n\nDespite being the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos has refrained from setting a target amount to give away in his lifetime.\n\nBezos has committed $10 billion over 10 years, or about 8% of his current net worth, to the Bezos Earth Fund, which Sánchez co-chairs. Among its priorities are reducing the carbon footprint of construction-grade cement and steel; pushing financial regulators to consider climate-related risks; advancing data and mapping technologies to monitor carbon emissions; and building natural, plant-based carbon sinks on a large scale.\n\nThough Bezos is now Amazon’s (AMZN) executive chair and not its CEO — he stepped down from that role in 2021 — he is still involved in the greening of the company. Amazon is one of more than 300 companies that have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by 2040 according to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bezos said, though Amazon’s (AMZN) footprint grew by 18% in 2021, reflecting a pandemic-driven e-commerce boom. Amazon’s (AMZN) reckoning with its own effect on the climate mirrors its outsized impact on everything from debates about unionization to antitrust policy, where the company has attracted an enormous level of scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and civil society groups.\n\nBezos compared his philanthropic strategy to his years-long effort constructing a titanic engine of e-commerce and cloud computing that has made him one of the most powerful people in the world.\n\n“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said, implying that even as he gives away his billions, he is still looking to maximize his return. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.”\n\n“There are a bunch of ways that I think you could do ineffective things, too,” he added. “So you have to think about it carefully and you have to have brilliant people on the team.”\n\nBezos’ methodical approach to giving stands in sharp contrast to that of his ex-wife, the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recently gave away nearly $4 billion to 465 organizations in the span of less than a year.\n\nThe economic downturn\n\nWhile Bezos and Sánchez plot out their plans for Bezos’ immense wealth, many people of more modest means are bracing for what economists fear may be an extended economic downturn.\n\nLast month, Bezos tweeted a warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.”\n\nThe advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview, suggesting that individuals should consider putting off buying big ticket items they’ve been eyeing — or that companies should slow their acquisitions and capital expenditures.\n\n“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Keep some dry powder on hand…. Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”\n\nMany may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within Bezos’ lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.\n\nBezos and Sánchez’s partnership\n\nSánchez said the couple make “really great teammates,” though she laughed, “We can be kind of boring,” Sánchez said. Bezos smiled and replied, “Never boring.”\n\nSánchez, the founder of Black Ops Aviation, the first female-owned and operated aerial film and production company is a trained helicopter pilot. She said in the interview that they’ve both taken turns in the driver’s seat.\n\nBezos has credited his own journey to space for helping to inspire his push to fight climate change. Now, it is Sánchez’s turn.\n\nSánchez told CNN she anticipates venturing into orbit herself sometime in 2023. And while she did not directly address who will be joining her — quickly ruling out Bezos as a crewmate — she said simply: “It’ll be a great group of females.”\n\nWashington’s NFL team\n\nBezos may be adding NFL owner to his resume. CNN recently reported that Bezos and Jay-Z are in talks on a potential joint bid on the Washington Commanders.\n\nIt is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team, about the possibility.\n\nBut during the interview on Saturday, Melas asked Bezos if the speculation was true.\n\n“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smile.\n\nSánchez chimed in with a laugh, “I do like football. I’m just going to throw that out there for everyone.”\n\nBezos added, “I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid … and it is my favorite sport … so we’ll just have to wait and see.”\n\n– CNN’s Chloe Melas contributed to this report", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}]}

Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has roiled the House in chaos. The move to oust McCarthy – known as a motion to vacate – had the support of a handful of hard-right lawmakers who have expressed anger at McCarthy for working with Democrats to avert a government shutdown.\n\nHere's what you missed after a chaotic day in Washington.\n\nGaetz led a group of eight Republicans who voted to remove the speaker, joined by 208 Democrats who at times giggled at the GOP’s infighting.\n\nRepublicans weren't laughing, however, as the civil war has cast a shadow over their majority.\n\nDuring the debate some accused Gaetz of grandstanding and hurtling the House into chaos without a clear plan as to who, if anyone, would take the job.\n\nCatch up with USA TODAY's coverage of the speaker fight in the halls of Congress.\n\nMcCarthy yet to speak with Biden\n\nKevin McCarthy said Tuesday he has not spoken to Joe Biden in a \"long long time.\"\n\n\"I've been thinking about that. It's been a long long time,\" McCarthy said.\n\nMcCarthy says he had respect for the president despite their different philosophies, but wished the president was more \"hands on.\"\n\nThe timeline raised some eyebrows in Washington, considering Congress last week voted to temporarily avert a government shutdown that would have impacted millions of Americans. But House Republicans have also launched an impeachment inquiry into Biden, claiming he benefitted from his family's business dealings.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nPelosi, McCarthy says, vowed to back him up\n\nDuring his pursuit of the speakership that lasted 15 votes earlier this year, one of McCarthy's key concessions was allowing a single member of Congress to file a motion to vacate.\n\nMcCarthy counseled his fellow Californian and former Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for advice.

He said there could be about eight lawmakers in the running.\n\n“Members have whispered in my ear,” Burchett said.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nRepublican lawmaker: ‘Much different than the speaker’s election’\n\nRep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., told reporters that the vote to oust McCarthy was “much different than the speaker's election where one wins, one loses,” despite the group of Republicans seeking to remove him from the leadership office.\n\n“It’s certainly a disappointment, and I think those responsible for coordinating reflect on it and I think if they do…I don't think they'll ever think they made the right call, but that's up to them,” Cole said.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWho will be the next speaker of the House? Patrick McHenry?\n\nRepublican Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina is temporarily leading the House after Kevin McCarthy was ousted. McHenry, one of McCarthy's closest allies, is known as the speaker pro tempore.\n\nThe speaker pro tempore has far more limited powers compared to a speaker of the House, but he will preside over the lower chamber until a new speaker is elected.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWho voted against Kevin McCarthy\n\nIn a historic turn of events, McCarthy has been ousted as speaker, leaving the House in turmoil as lawmakers must elect a new permanent speaker.\n\nEight GOP lawmakers voted to eject McCarthy from the speakership, they are:\n\nRep.

House Democrats, who voted against the motion to table, joined the conservative hardliners in ejecting McCarthy from the speakership. The vote to oust McCarthy was 216-210.\n\nMcCarthy, even though he was ousted, is still able to run again as speaker if nominated by a lawmaker. In the meantime, an acting interim speaker must be named, but they will have limited power.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nIn sign of hope for McCarthy, one GOP vote flips in his favor\n\nIn a glimmer of hope for McCarthy’s speakership, Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio., who voted against the motion to delay Gaetz’ effort to oust him, also voted against the motion to vacate.\n\nDavidson’s vote is a sign there could be more conservative hardliners who flip in favor of McCarthy.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHouse starts roll call vote to decide Kevin McCarthy's fate\n\nAs the House starts voting on whether or not to eject McCarthy from the speakership, a sense of deja vu has fallen on the House floor, as lawmakers are voting through voice vote, similar to how lawmakers voted during the speaker election back in January.\n\nIt will take a while. Each lawmaker has to be called one-by-one to declare their vote.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMatt Gaetz calls Biden impeachment inquiry ‘failure theater’\n\nGaetz, making his case to oust McCarthy, slammed Republicans’ impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden as “failure theater.”\n\nIn the first impeachment inquiry hearing targeting Biden last week, three expert witnesses invited by Republicans each told the House Oversight Committee no evidence has emerged that Biden committed an impeachable offense. It was a setback in Republican efforts to impeach Biden.\n\n“It’s hard to make the argument that oversight is the reason to continue when it looks like failure theater,” said Gaetz, responding to comments earlier by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who defended McCarthy.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nGOP yells ‘Shame!’ at Gaetz for fundraising off motion to vacate\n\nOne of Kevin McCarthy’s top lieutenants, Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., defended the speaker in an impassioned speech, also lambasting Matt Gaetz for fundraising off of his efforts to oust McCarthy as speaker.\n\n“Using official actions to raise money, it’s disgusting,” Graves said.\n\nWhen Graves held up his phone displaying one of Gaetz’ fundraising messages, GOP lawmakers yelled “Shame!” at Gaetz.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nGaetz met with silence as he debates McCarthy allies\n\nIn a display of just how much power a handful of conservative hardliners wield over the the House, Matt Gaetz has responded to nearly every Kevin McCarthy ally speaking on the California Republicans’ behalf on the House floor.\n\nThe contrast between the two factions couldn’t be any more clear.\n\nWhile McCarthy allies including Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., and Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C. has received overwhelming applause from GOP lawmakers after their remarks, Gaetz’ speeches have been met with silence.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat happens if McCarthy is ousted?\n\nIf the House votes to oust McCarthy, then someone would have to fill his position temporarily until an election is set and the next speaker is chosen in the lower chamber.\n\nThat temporary replacement would be chosen from a succession list McCarthy submitted in January. According to Rule one, clause 8 of House rules, the next person on the list “shall act as Speaker pro tempore until the election of a Speaker or a Speaker pro tempore.”\n\n“Pending such election the Member acting as Speaker pro tempore may exercise such authorities of the Office of Speaker as may be necessary and appropriate to that end,” the House rules say.\n\nThe rules don’t specify how long the person would temporarily fill the speaker’s spot. It is unclear when the House would choose to hold an election for the next speaker if McCarthy is removed.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMcCarthy nearly expressionless as House Republicans debate his fate\n\nWhile House Republicans debate on McCarthy’s fate as speaker, the California Republican, sitting in the second row from the front of the floor, has been nearly expressionless, only occasionally chatting with Rep. Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz., who is seated next to him.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nIs GOP hostage to right-flank of party?\n\nThe 11 Republican lawmakers who joined Democrats to vote against a procedural vote delaying the motion to vacate now leads to a final vote on the House floor to oust McCarthy.\n\nThese 11 Republicans include some of the most ultra-conservative members of the Republican conference, including members of the House Freedom Caucus like Reps. Bob Good of Virginia, Ken Buck of Colorado, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Matt Rosendale of Montana and Eli Crane of Arizona.\n\nDespite comprising a minority of the Republican caucus, these ultra-conservative members, with help from the other side of the aisle, may be the reason McCarthy is removed from his speakership.\n\nSome, like Good, listed their grievances with McCarthy as speaker. Good called it a “totally avoidable situation.”\n\n“We need a speaker who will fight for something, anything, besides just staying or becoming speaker,” Good said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nDemocrats stand aside as House Republicans debate among themselves\n\nWhile Kevin McCarthy's allies and the conservative hardliners against the speaker debate on the House floor over his speakership, Democrats have stayed on the sidelines watching House Republicans quarrel amongst themselves.\n\nAs the rest of the House GOP conference cheered on McCarthy's allies and jeered at Gaetz, House Democrats remained silent, reflecting Jeffries and leadership's intention for House Republicans to settle the matter within their own conference.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nRepublican calls McCarthy ouster 'totally avoidable situation'\n\nRep. Bob Good, R-Va., who voted against tabling the motion to vacate against McCarthy, spoke on the House floor after the vote listing his grievances with McCarthy and calling it a “totally avoidable situation.”\n\nGood said back in January during the votes that made McCarthy speaker, he persuaded five of his colleagues to vote present in the final vote that allowed McCarthy to win his leadership role. He claimed he continued to work with McCarthy and persuade some of his ultra-conservative colleagues to support McCarthy’s priorities throughout the year.\n\nThe Virginia lawmaker claimed McCarthy made a promise to bring 12 spending bills to the floor individually this year, which did not happen as Congress lurched toward a government shutdown this weekend. Good said he reluctantly agreed to vote for a short-term solution to avert a shutdown, despite the promise McCarthy made\n\n“We need a speaker who will fight for something, anything besides just staying and becoming speaker,” Good said.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nMcCarthy ally: ‘This is a very sad day’\n\nSpeaking on behalf of McCarthy and his allies on the House floor, Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., chair of the House Rules Committee, praised the California Republicans’ leadership through multiple tough votes that put McCarthy’s speakership into question, including negotiations over the debt ceiling earlier this year and the recent government shutdown crisis.\n\n“We were on the verge of a government shutdown,” Cole said. “He put his political neck on the line … to do the right thing.”\n\n“He did the right thing for our party,” Cole added, earning a standing ovation from the majority of the House GOP conference.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWho will serve as speaker if Kevin McCarthy is ousted?\n\nThat's not clear.\n\nIf McCarthy is removed from his leadership role a temporary speaker would lead in the House. McCarthy submitted a succession list to the House clerk in January, though the document is private.\n\nBut who's likely on that list? Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., the House majority leader, is a likely option. So is Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., the majority whip, another crucial leadership position.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTexas Republican concerned about upcoming vote to remove McCarthy\n\nThere is not a clear name for McCarthy’s successor, should the speaker be ousted, said Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-TX.\n\n“There’s not really an option. Another reason this is very silly,” he said.\n\nThe Texas congressman said he’s worried about the message today’s events will send to voters about the GOP.\n\n“It’s clear that there’s just a group of people that don’t want conservatives to win,” Crenshaw said. “And they label themselves as the most conservative, which is not possibly true.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nPresident Joe Biden stays out of Kevin McCarthy speakership fight\n\nThe White House is staying out of the fight over McCarthy’s speakership – seemingly more than happy to watch Republicans beat up each other.\n\n“We’re just not going to get involved,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday, deferring to House Democratic leaders who have vowed they won’t help McCarthy.\n\nJean-Pierre said it is “nothing new” for the White House not to weigh in on congressional leadership decisions.\n\n“Is there chaos in the House Republicans? Absolutely. That is something that they have to deal with,” Jean-Pierre said.\n\nOn Sunday, President Joe Biden said, “I don't have a vote on that matter. I'll leave that to the leadership of the House and the Senate.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\n'Get a time machine'\n\nWhen asked whether there was anything McCarthy could do to change anything, Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., told reporters that he could “get a time machine and bring us all back to the table like I suggested two months ago and keep his word.”\n\nBurchett added that “everything’s always chaos..this country was built on chaos” and said he was more concerned about the dollar collapsing and the economy failing.\n\n“It scares me a lot worse,” Burchett said.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\n11 GOP lawmakers vote against McCarthy in setback to his speakership\n\n11 GOP lawmakers voted against the motion to table the effort to oust McCarthy in a massive setback for the speaker. The House will on the motion to vacate McCarthy, which is the formal vote that will decide his speakership.\n\nThe members that voted against McCarthy are:\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.\n\nRep. Ken Buck, R-Colo.\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.\n\nRep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz.\n\nRep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.\n\nRep. Bob Good, R-Va.\n\nRep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C.\n\nRep. Cory Mills, R-Fla.\n\nRep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont.\n\nRep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMotion to table fails: McCarthy’s speakership closer to the brink\n\nKevin McCarthy faced a severe setback when a handful of conservative hardliners and House Democrats voted against a procedural motion – known as a motion to table – to discard Gaetz’ efforts to oust the California Republican as speaker. The vote failed by 208-218\n\nThe House will immediately vote now on the motion to vacate to determine whether McCarthy stays in his post.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhite House vows US support for Ukraine won’t waver if McCarthy loses job\n\nThe White House expressed confidence Tuesday that Congress will continue to support aid for Ukraine if House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is ousted from his speakership.\n\n“Regardless of what happens in the House of Representatives,” said John Kirby, a White House spokesman on national security issues, “all the House leadership is supportive of continuing to help Ukraine and the vast majority of House members on the Republican side are in support.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden is pushing Congress to approve additional aid to help Ukraine fight Russia after Congress passed a continuing resolution to avert a government shutdown for several weeks that lacked Ukraine funding to appease hardline Republicans. A growing number of far-right Republicans in the House oppose continued support of Ukraine.\n\nMcCarthy, whose speakership is in jeopardy, has backed Ukraine funding in the past but said he wants future financial support for Ukraine to be tied to additional security on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n“We don't believe they should be tied, or one dependent on the other, but both are important,” Kirby said.\n\nBiden held a phone call with NATO allies Tuesday in which he “reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes as it,” the White House said.\n\n“As winter fast approaches, it is imperative that we help them take advantage of every single day,” Kirby said. “A lapse of support for even a short period of time can make all the difference on the battlefield.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nDonald Trump: Why are Republicans 'always fighting among themselves'?\n\nWhile attending his bank fraud trial in New York for a second day, Donald Trump found time Tuesday to weigh in on the drama surrounding McCarthy - sort of.\n\nTrump did not mention McCarthy or Gaetz by name in a Truth Social post, nor has he taken a public position on their dispute, but he did criticize GOP in-fighting.\n\nSaid the former president: \"Why is it that Republicans are always fighting among themselves, why aren’t they fighting the Radical Left Democrats who are destroying our Country?\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nNancy Pelosi says Democrats aren't taking up speaker fight\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, shared in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \"In this Congress, it is the responsibility of House Republicans to choose a nominee & elect the Speaker on the Floor.\"\n\n\"At this time there is no justification for a departure from this tradition,\" she added.\n\nHer comments come as House Democrats have vowed not to step in and save Kevin McCarthy from a rebellion from his fellow Republicans.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nPolitics:Will Kevin McCarthy be forced out as Speaker of the House? Here's how it could happen.\n\nAbsences could save McCarthy\n\nAhead of the procedural vote to suspend Gaetz’ motion to vacate against McCarthy, the California Republican could be saved due to absences.\n\nThe procedural vote – referred to as a motion to table – requires just a simple majority rather than an absolute majority. That means McCarthy does not technically need 218 votes to table the motion to vacate, but rather just more votes to table the motion than against it.\n\nBoth House Republicans and House Democrats are seeing absences that could factor into McCarthy’s survival.\n\nIt is unclear how many absences there are on each side, but House Democrats are currently voting by hand in an unrelated vote series likely to buy more time for their rank and file members to make it to the crucial vote on McCarthy’s fate.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\n‘We’ll see what happens’: Lawmakers enter House chamber for votes\n\nAs lawmakers file into the House chamber, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., took a swipe at Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., when asked about the upcoming vote against McCarthy. Greene has long supported the speaker.\n\n“Are we all gonna be dressing like John Fetterman here pretty soon when we don’t have a speaker and don’t have rules,” Greene said. “We’ll see what happens.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nWho's trying to oust Kevin McCarthy? Matt Gaetz, Freedom Caucus members\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., introduced a motion Monday night to remove Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., from the top position in the House.\n\nHis motion came after a contentious week of negotiations to avoid a government shutdown, during which Gaetz had previously threatened to oust McCarthy if the Speaker looked across the aisle for support.\n\nBut Gaetz is joined in the push by several members tied to the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, including Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs.\n\nWhat happens if there's a government shutdown and no speaker of the House?\n\nIf McCarthy is ousted by his fellow Republicans, and Democrats refuse to step in and help him, a temporary speaker would lead in the House. McCarthy submitted a succession list to the House clerk in January, though the document is private.\n\nThat means the House could continue with its important business, as lawmakers have just weeks to compromise on a slate of spending bills to avoid a government shutdown.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat happens if Congress ousts McCarthy?\n\nIf the House decides to remove McCarthy as speaker, then someone from a private backup list provided by McCarthy at the beginning of the year will fill his slot until a new election is held.\n\n“There's a little disagreement amongst Hill procedural experts about how much power that temporary Speaker would actually wield,” Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told The Washington Post.\n\nHowever, McCarthy can choose to run as speaker again. It is unclear when the House would hold that vote.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMotion to vacate history: Has a speaker of the House ever been removed?\n\nThe last time the House voted on a motion to vacate was 1910 against then-Speaker Joseph Cannon, R-Ill. In 2015, then-Rep. Mark Meadows filed a motion against Speaker John Boehner, but it never made it to a floor vote.\n\nA House speaker has never been removed via a motion to vacate. Boehner resigned months after Meadows' motion amid continued dissent in his party.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nCapitol Hill in turmoil\n\nThe move to oust Kevin McCarthy has consumed the House in turmoil as lawmakers strategize over how to approach the conservative rebellion against the California Republican.\n\nMcCarthy, exiting a closed-door weekly conference meeting, told reporters firmly he wouldn't entertain working with Democrats to save his speakership and conceded that \"I'm out\" if a handful of Republicans decide to boot him from the speakership.\n\nIn their own extended closed-door conference meeting to discuss strategy, to prevent leaks, House Democratic lawmakers were barred from bringing in their phones to the meeting as leadership decided on whether or not to bail McCarthy out.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHouse Democrats will vote to remove Kevin McCarthy\n\nIn a lengthy letter sent to House Democrats, Jeffries said leadership will vote to vacate McCarthy from the speakership.\n\n\"It is now the responsibility of the GOP members to end the House Republican Civil War. Given their unwillingness to break from MAGA extremism in an authentic and comprehensive manner, House Democratic leadership will vote yes on the pending Republican Motion to Vacate the Chair,\" the letter reads.\n\nHouse Democrats have for days said they will vote in line with their leadership. Jeffries' statement means that McCarthy's speakership will hinge on uniting enough House Republicans behind him to defeat the conservative rebellion.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat state does Kevin McCarthy represent? How long has Kevin McCarthy been in Congress?\n\nKevin McCarthy was sworn in as a member of the House of Representatives in 2007. He represents California's 20th House District, which includes parts of Kern, Fresno, Tulare and Kings counties.\n\nCongress voted to make McCarthy speaker of the House in January, after a marathon 15 rounds of votes. He faced objections from some of the same hard-right lawmakers in January during his bid to become speaker that he faces now as they seek to remove him.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nIs McCarthy being impeached?\n\nNo, Kevin McCarthy is facing what's known as a motion to vacate, which could remove him from his role as speaker of the House, a role that's in line behind the vice president to succeed the presidency, if needed.\n\nImpeachment is a process designed to remove presidents from office, along with other federal officials. House Republicans have opened up an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, but they haven't approved any formal articles of impeachment against him.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat is a motion to vacate?\n\nA motion to vacate is a congressional procedure initiated by a House member that calls for the removal of a sitting House speaker and the election of a new one, according to Ballotpedia.\n\nWhile the motion can be brought forth by one person, there must be a majority vote in the House to remove the top leader.\n\nUnder House rules, the motion must be voted on in two legislative days.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Democrats help McCarthy?\n\nThe answer is likely no.\n\nAs of noon on Tuesday, it appears Democrats will remain unified and vote to remove McCarthy from his role as speaker of the House.\n\n“House Democrats are going to continue to push people over politics,” House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters Tuesday.\n\n“We are ready to find bipartisan common ground,” he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. \"Our extreme colleagues have shown no willingness to do the same. They must find a way to end the House Republican Civil War.”\n\nOther lawmakers made clear they support House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. call to “end the House Republican Civil War.”\n\n“I hope everybody votes no on the motion to table. I expect everybody to be unified,” Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said Tuesday after leaving a Democratic caucus meeting.\n\nThe New Democrat Coalition also stands unified behind Jeffries.\n\n“New Dems are proud to stand with our leader and our caucus to deliver progress for the American people,” Rep. Annie Kuster, D-N.H., chair of the coalition, said in a statement.\n\n– Rachel Looker and Ken Tran\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nAmong one of the key concessions McCarthy made to conservative hardliners in his bid for the speakership in January was allowing a single lawmaker to initiate a motion to vacate.\n\nPrevious speakers set parameters on how lawmakers could try to oust these leaders, from only allowing party leadership to attempt to eject the speaker or requiring multiple lawmakers to agree on a motion to vacate.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has repeatedly flirted with ousting McCarthy since Republicans took control of the House but the Florida Republican finally followed up on his threats after McCarthy worked with Democrats to avert a government shutdown over the weekend.\n\n“I believe the basis for the motion to vacate is Kevin McCarthy’s repeated breach of the agreement that he made in January,” Gaetz told reporters Monday after formally filing the motion to oust McCarthy, alleging the speaker broke an agreement – that was never released on paper – he made with hardline conservatives in January.\n\n– Ken Tran", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/12/matt-gaetz-threatens-kevin-mccarthy/70833252007/", "title": "Rep. Matt Gaetz threatens to remove Kevin McCarthy as House ...", "text": "WASHINGTON − Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz on Tuesday threatened to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., from his position as Speaker of the House.\n\n\"I rise today to serve notice − Mr. Speaker you are out of compliance with the agreement that allowed you to assume this role,\" Gaetz said on the House floor.\n\nGaetz cited several reasons for his threats, including McCarthy not holding votes on issues like term limits for lawmakers or balanced budgets. He also criticized McCarthy for not releasing the full security tapes from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.\n\nGaetz on Tuesday denounced McCarthy for what the Florida lawmaker called insufficient accountability for President Joe Biden's family and the lack of subpoenas filed against Biden's son, Hunter Biden.\n\nThreats from individual lawmakers to remove a House speaker hold more weight now. McCarthy agreed earlier this year to House Freedom Caucus demands to allow a single member to call for a vote, known as a motion to vacate, to oust the leader of the lower chamber. The vote needs a simple majority in the House to pass.\n\n\"The path forward for the House of Representatives is to either bring you into immediate, total compliance or remove you pursuant to a motion to vacate the chair,\" Gaetz said.\n\nGaetz: McCarthy didn't put House 'in position to succeed' on shutdown\n\nGaetz said on the House floor Tuesday that McCarthy did not put the House in a position to succeed as the government approaches a looming Sept. 30 shutdown date and still needs to pass 11 appropriations bills.\n\nThe Florida lawmaker called on McCarthy to hold votes on individual spending bills instead of a continuing resolution, a short-term extension GOP leadership has been considering to avert a shutdown. Gaetz said he will move to oust the speaker if a vote is held on the stopgap measure.\n\n\"Sept. 30 is rapidly approaching and you have not put us in a position to succeed. There is no way to pass all the individual appropriations bills now and it's not like we didn't know when Sept. 30 was going to show up on the calendar,\" he said.\n\n'Baby step': Gaetz calls for McCarthy to ramp up impeachment efforts\n\nGaetz was not impressed with McCarthy's Tuesday morning announcement that the House Oversight, Judiciary and Ways and Means committees will lead a formal impeachment inquiry against Biden.\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus member urged McCarthy to do more to subpoena Hunter Biden and other members of the Biden family after House Republicans have claimed that Biden financially benefited from his son's foreign dealings.\n\n\"This is a baby step following weeks of pressure from House conservatives to do more,\" he said of the endorsement.\n\nGaetz floated ousting McCarthy last spring\n\nThis isn't the first time Gaetz has floated the idea of introducing a motion to vacate that would remove McCarthy.\n\nMcCarthy faced a rebellion in the spring from the right flank of his party over his deal with President Joe Biden to suspend the debt ceiling.\n\nGaetz previously said if McCarthy failed to get at least half of House Republicans to vote for the agreement and relied on Democratic support for passage, it would be grounds for a motion to vacate McCarthy's speakership.\n\nIn January, Gaetz was one of several GOP detractors who voted against McCarthy's speakership at the beginning of the 118th Congress. Gaetz nominated and voted for Trump several times during the marathon 15 rounds of votes for speaker before voting \"present\" in the final tally that allowed McCarthy to cinch the role.\n\nMany of McCarthy's detractors rallied around him in exchange for concessions, some of which were never disclosed.\n\n\"Mr. Speaker, dust off our written January agreement. You have a copy. Reflect on the spirit of that agreement and build on the start that we had moments ago. Begin to comply,\" Gaetz said Tuesday.\n\n\"I know that Washington isn't a town where people are known for keeping their word, well Speaker McCarthy, I am here to hold you to yours,\" he added.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/politics/nancy-pelosi-house-speaker-democrats-future/index.html", "title": "Nancy Pelosi announces she won't run for leadership post, marking ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday that she will relinquish her leadership post after leading House Democrats for two decades, building a legacy as one of the most powerful and polarizing figures in American politics.\n\nPelosi, the first and only woman to serve as speaker, said that she would continue to serve in the House, giving the next generation the opportunity to lead the House Democrats, who will be in the minority next year despite a better-than-expected midterm election performance.\n\n“I will not seek reelection to Democratic leadership in the next Congress,” said Pelosi in the House chamber. “For me, the hour has come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect, and I’m grateful that so many are ready and willing to shoulder this awesome responsibility.”\n\nPelosi, 82, rose to the top of the House Democratic caucus in 2002, after leading many in her party against a resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq. She then guided Democrats as they rode the waves of popular opinion, seeing their power swell to a 257-seat majority after the 2008 elections, ultimately crash to a 188-seat minority, and then rise once again.\n\nHer political career was marked by an extraordinary ability to understand and overcome those political shifts, keeping conflicting factions of her party united in passing major legislation. She earned the Speaker’s gavel twice – after the 2006 and 2018 elections – and lost it after the 2010 elections.\n\nOf late, she has conducted a string of accomplishments with one of the slimmest party splits in history, passing a $1.9 trillion pandemic aid package last year and a $750 billion health care, energy and climate bill in August.\n\nHer legislative victories in the Biden era cemented her reputation as one of the most successful party leaders in Congress. During the Obama administration, Pelosi was instrumental to the passage of the massive economic stimulus bill and the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which provides over 35 million Americans health care coverage.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the California liberal has been relentlessly attacked by Republicans, who portray her as the personification of a party for the coastal elite. “We have fired Nancy Pelosi,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Fox News on Wednesday, after Republicans won back the chamber.\n\nIn recent years, the anger directed toward her has turned menacing. During the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, pro-Trump rioters searched for her — and last month, a male assailant attacked Paul Pelosi, the speaker’s husband, with a hammer at the couple’s home in San Francisco, while she was in Washington.\n\nPelosi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper this month that her decision to retire would be influenced by the politically motivated attack. Paul Pelosi was released from the hospital two weeks ago after surgery to repair a skull fracture and injuries to his arm and hands.\n\nAfter thanking her colleagues for their well-wishes for Paul, the House chamber broke out into a standing ovation.\n\nDemocrats now look to finally choose Pelosi’s successor\n\nPelosi’s long reign became a source of tension within her own party. She won the gavel after the 2018 elections by promising her own party that she would leave her leadership post by 2022.\n\nMassachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, who previously tried to oust Pelosi, told CNN it’s time for a new chapter.\n\n“She’s a historic speaker who’s accomplished an incredible amount, but I also think there are a lot of Democrats ready for a new chapter,” said Moulton.\n\nBut some Democrats praised Pelosi and said they wished she would remain leader. Asked about her decision, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer clutched his chest and said he had pleaded with her to stay.\n\n“I told her when she called me and told me this and all that, I said ‘please change your mind. We need you here,’” Schumer said.\n\nHouse Democrats appear likely to choose New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, 52, to succeed Pelosi as leader, though Democrats won’t vote until November 30.\n\nAfter her speech, Pelosi wouldn’t tell reporters who’d she support. But House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn announced they would also step down from their leadership posts, and endorsed Jeffries to succeed Pelosi. Hoyer said Jeffries “will make history for the institution of the House and for our country.” Clyburn added that he hoped Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Pete Aguilar would join Jeffries in House Democratic leadership.\n\nBefore Pelosi’s announcement, Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, told CNN that she expects her caucus to throw their support behind Jeffries, and help him become the first Black House Democratic leader.\n\n“If she steps aside, I’m very clear that Hakeem Jeffries is the person that I will be voting for and leading the Congressional Black Caucus to vote for,” said Beatty.”I don’t always speak for everybody, but I’m very comfortable saying I believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries.”\n\nRetiring North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield, a former CBC chairman, told CNN that Jeffries “is prepared for the moment” if Pelosi steps aside. Butterfield said he thought Jeffries would run.\n\nThe longtime Democratic leader told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday that members of her caucus had asked her to “consider” running in the party’s leadership elections at the end of the month, adding: “But, again, let’s just get through the election.”\n\nAny decision to run again, Pelosi said, “is about family, and also my colleagues and what we want to do is go forward in a very unified way, as we go forward to prepare for the Congress at hand.”\n\n“Nonetheless, a great deal is at stake because we’ll be in a presidential election.

But the conservative hardliners are emboldened by the likelihood of a narrow House GOP majority and are threatening to withhold their support – something that could imperil his bid or force him to make deals to weaken the speakership, something he has long resisted.\n\nRep. Chip Roy of Texas told reporters that “no one currently has 218” votes for speaker, which is the magic number McCarthy would need to secure the speaker’s gavel on the House floor in January, and said he wants McCarthy to list in greater detail his plans for a wide array of investigations into the Biden administration. And Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona complained that McCarthy seemed to backpedal on whether he’d be willing to launch impeachment proceedings into President Joe Biden or members of his Cabinet.\n\n“I’ve heard from multiple of my constituents who question the wisdom of proceeding forward with that leadership,” Biggs said, adding that there needs to be a “frank conversation” about who they elect for the top job.\n\nMembers of the group are also pushing to make it easier for lawmakers to call for floor votes on ousting a sitting speaker. That is something that McCarthy is adamantly against and was wielded over former Speaker John Boehner before he eventually resigned.\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado said it was a “red line” for her, but not everyone in the Freedom Caucus is united on whether to make that a hard line.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus, a group that includes dozens of hardline members, have been meeting in Washington, DC, this week for their new member orientation, where they have begun to plot out their strategy for the speaker’s race. With a slimmer-than-expected majority, they see an opportunity, and are planning to use their leverage to get more power in a GOP-led House.\n\nBut the group’s push to extract concessions from McCarthy has exacerbated tensions inside the party. Said one senior GOP lawmaker: “They are a bunch of selfish, prima dona a**holes who want attention for themselves. They are trading effectiveness for the warm embrace of their social media followers.”\n\nMcCarthy, who has been working the phones locking down support from across the conference and received former President Donald Trump’s endorsement on Monday, still remains a frontrunner for the job, and no serious challenger has emerged. And two would-be challengers, Reps. Jim Jordan and Steve Scalise, have lined up behind his speakership bid.\n\nMcCarthy also has time to win over critics. The GOP’s internal leadership elections, where he only needs a simple majority to win his party’s nomination for speaker, are next week, but the floor vote where McCarthy needs a majority of the entire House is not until January.\n\nHis ability to round up 218 votes for speaker will ultimately depend on two things: the size of his majority and whether he’s willing to cut deals with the conservatives that he assiduously courted after they denied him the speakership in 2015. So far, however, McCarthy has not made any promises or given in their demands, with sources saying he has just been in listening mode with potential holdouts.\n\nCNN has yet to project which party will have control of the House of Representatives, though as of Friday morning, CNN has projected that Republicans have 211 seats to Democrats’ 198.\n\nRep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina said McCarthy personally called and asked for his support for speaker, but Norman wouldn’t commit. He told McCarthy there’s a group of them that wants to meet in person, which he said McCarthy was amenable to.\n\nNorman said the group hopes to formalize a lengthier list of all the rules changes they are seeking. They are also pushing to delay next week’s internal leadership elections, though there is no indication McCarthy plans to do so.\n\n“I’m not supporting anybody until I know what the blueprint is,” Norman said.\n\nWhen asked whether McCarthy should get credit for delivering the majority, Norman responded: “The taxpayers that voted the representatives in deserve the credit.”\n\nRep. Bob Good, a member of the Freedom Caucus, told reporters that McCarthy “has not done anything to earn my vote” for speaker.\n\nThe Virginia Republican also predicted that “there will be a challenge to (McCarthy) as a speaker candidate,” a possibility that CNN first reported was under consideration by the group.\n\nSuch a challenge would be more of a protest candidate than a serious one. The group just wants to show McCarthy during next week’s internal GOP leadership elections that he doesn’t have the floor votes for speaker, in hopes of forcing him to the negotiating table.\n\nBut there is at least one member who has said there is nothing McCarthy could do to earn his vote. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida said on his podcast that not only was McCarthy not his first choice to lead, he was not “even in my top 100”.\n\n“With a slim majority, we shouldn’t be starting the C team,” Gaetz said. “We need to put our star players in a position to shine brightest so that we can attract more people to our policies and ideas.”", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona Manu Raju", "Melanie Zanona", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/01/06/speaker-of-the-house-congress-kevin-mccarthy-live-updates/10989644002/", "title": "Republican McCarthy wins House speaker on 15th ballot: recap", "text": "WASHINGTON – Rep.

Hakeem Jeffries handed over the speaker’s gavel to McCarthy after officially welcoming members to the 118th Congress and emphasizing the unanimity of the Democratic Congress.\n\n“That was easy, huh?” McCarthy said as he took the podium following chants of \"U-S-A\" from his caucus. “I never thought we’d get up here.”\n\nMcCarthy touched on spending, inflation, the national debt, jobs and immigration in his first speech as speaker.\n\n“My father always told me, it’s not how you start, it’s how you finish and now we need to finish strong for the American people,” he said.\n\n“It’s night time here in Washington, but in some ways it’s also like a new beginning, a fresh start,” he added.\n\n-- Rachel Looker\n\nWhat is inflation?:Understanding why prices rise, what causes it and who it hurts most.\n\nJeffries hands gavel to McCarthy\n\nBefore House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries passed the gavel to newly elected Speaker Kevin McCarthy, he excoriated Republicans for a weeklong fight to elect their majority leader.\n\nHe said the change from a Democratic-held House to a Republican-led House means a shift from “a year of accomplishment to a year of ambiguity.”\n\nJeffries called McCarthy’s predecessor, Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a “defender of democracy” and a “no-nonsense negotiator” who will go down as the “best speaker of all time.”\n\nHis introduction to McCarthy sounded at times like a campaign speech, and the longer it went on the more Republicans called on him to wrap it up, eventually booing.\n\nJeffries said of Democrats in the new Congress: “We will not compromise our values.”\n\nSome Republicans in the chamber retorted: “Neither will we!”\n\n--Candy Woodall\n\nMoney and politics:These House lawmakers received campaign money from Kevin McCarthy, then voted against him\n\nBiden congratulates McCarthy and challenges him to work together\n\nPresident Joe Biden quickly issued a statement congratulating newly elected House Speaker Kevin McCarthy – and just as quickly issued a challenge.\n\n\"The American people expect their leaders to govern in a way that puts their needs above all else, and that is what we need to do now,\" Biden said in a statement released by the White House.\n\nBiden promoted his economic record and said he is prepared to work with Republicans \"when I can.\" He added: \"And voters made clear that they expect Republicans to be prepared to work with me as well.\"\n\nMcCarthy and the Republicans made Biden the issue during last year's campaign to win control of the House.

Without those votes, McCarthy is short of the votes needed to win the powerful position.\n\nDemocrats have remained united around leader Hakeem Jeffries, all 212 voting in his favor in all 10 votes.\n\nThe situation has left Congress stymied, since no member of the House of Representatives can be sworn in and no rules can be adopted until someone is selected for the role.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nWhat to expect on Day 4\n\nWhen the House gavels in at noon Friday, it will become evident if Thursday negotiations were fruitful for House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy who has lost 11 consecutive votes for speaker.\n\nLawmakers and political analysts in both parties discussed last night the possibility of a deal that could appease 20 rebels in his right flank and whether at least 16 of them would be swayed to McCarthy’s side.\n\nOn the fourth day of a new Congress without a speaker and sworn-in members, all eyes will be on the competing GOP factions of McCarthy and his 200 allies and his 20 detractors led by Reps. Matt Gaetz, Chip Roy, Scott Perry and Andy Biggs.\n\nThe math allows McCarthy to lose four of the 20 in his bid for speaker. But after days of a cumbersome process, any movement to his side would be seen as a huge momentum shift for the caucus leader.\n\nIt’s possible a historic 12th vote could begin at noon, or some members could push for an adjournment until Monday, leaving Congress without a House speaker or sworn-in representatives for the weekend. McCarthy is not in favor of adjourning for the weekend and has said the House shouldn't leave if its work isn't done.\n\n“Progress” has been the magic word all week, with both McCarthy allies and opponents telling reporters an agreement was near.\n\nFriday could prove them right or wrong.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nHouse to honor Jan. 6 anniversary\n\nBefore the House reconvenes Friday, Democrats and Republicans will remember the Jan. 6 anniversary in press conferences to honor those who were killed, injured and impacted by the violent attack two years ago.\n\nAt 9:30 a.m. on the House Triangle, Democratic Reps.

Andy Biggs of Arizona, a conservative hardliner who is challenging McCarthy to be the most powerful member of Congress, doubled down on his commitment to stop the California Republican’s ascension.\n\n“I’m not bluffing,” Biggs told CNN on Thursday when asked if he would drop out.\n\nWith the increasing likelihood that the speaker’s race could go to multiple ballots – something that hasn’t happened since 1923 – McCarthy’s allies and foes alike are starting to quietly game out the next steps if he can’t get the necessary 218 votes on the first round and they move into uncharted territory.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Bash asks Pelosi if McCarthy has what it takes to be House Speaker. See her response 02:37 - Source: CNN\n\nMcCarthy’s supporters are vowing to keep voting for him on multiple ballots, and GOP sources said there are early discussions about a floor strategy for that potential scenario, including whether to recess the House or let the votes keep rolling – no matter how long it takes.\n\nTo prevent that from happening, McCarthy and his team have been engaged in serious talks with a group of conservatives, including over potentially giving them influential committee assignments and more power to drive the legislative process. GOP sources said those negotiations are still early in the process and could ultimately end up giving the group some aspect of what the hardliners desperately want: additional power to seek a sitting speaker’s ouster with a vote on the floor.\n\nAsked if he would drop out of the race if he doesn’t get 218 votes on the first ballot, Biggs refused to say.\n\n“I’m not going to talk about hypotheticals,” said Biggs, who lost his conference’s nomination to become speaker last month after securing 31 votes.\n\nBut in the case of a doomsday scenario – where neither McCarthy nor Biggs can get 218 votes on January 3 and neither drops out – some pro-McCarthy Republicans are signaling support for a different approach. Some said they would be willing to work with Democrats to find a moderate Republican who can get the 218 votes to clinch the gavel – a long-shot idea that underscores the uncertainty looming over the speaker’s race.\n\n“Our initial plan is vote for Kevin and let him fight this out repeatedly. … But if they think they’re going to use this to infinity to drive him out, well, we’re not going to bend to their will,” said Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican.\n\nBacon added if GOP hardliners don’t bend, then he would be willing to work with Democrats to find another more moderate Republican to secure the 218 votes to become speaker.\n\n“If a small group refuses to play ball and be part of the team, then we’ll work across the aisle to find an agreeable Republican,” Bacon said. “But I hope we don’t get there.”\n\nMcCarthy’s detractors don’t buy it.\n\n“There are very significant rules, changes being discussed that would open the House up, that would be transformative, that would give us the ability to actually legislate and represent our constituents,” said Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Republican from Florida who said he’s a “hard no” on McCarthy. “And whoever is speaker is going to have to agree to those rules, I think. And I don’t think that person will be Kevin McCarthy because Kevin McCarthy won’t have 218 votes.”\n\nGaetz added: “I think the person who is ultimately going to be the speaker isn’t even the candidate yet.”\n\nIndeed, the small group of Republicans known as the “Never Kevin” movement – confident that Biggs could not win a majority of the House – has been trying to recruit a viable alternative, and claim “several” Republicans have privately told them they would be interested in running if McCarthy drops out. Their goal with voting for Biggs is to show that McCarthy is weak on the first ballot, which they hope would inspire other candidates to jump in.\n\n“How many members vote for someone else will show the strength (of the anti-McCarthy group),” Rep. Bob Good, a Virginia Republican who is a “hard no” on McCarthy, told CNN. “I think the second ballot is going to have more candidates. … There are already Republicans letting us know they’d like to be considered.”\n\nEven House Republicans who are supporting McCarthy predicted that a number of lawmakers would run if McCarthy withdrew his name, with some saying that House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, McCarthy’s top deputy, would emerge as the front runner in that case.\n\n“If at some point, if Kevin did take his name out, then you would have good people (running). Scalise would probably be the guy,” one GOP lawmaker said.\n\nScalise has repeatedly vowed to support McCarthy and refused to speculate on whether he would jump into the race if the GOP leader can’t get the votes.\n\n“No, I’m not going to get into speculation,” Scalise told CNN. “Obviously, our focus is on getting it resolved by January 3. And there’s a lot of conversations that everybody has been having, Kevin, surely, with the members who have expressed concerns.”\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, the conservative set to become the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, went even further, ruling out jumping into the race even though Gaetz and other hardliners have urged him to seek the speakership.\n\n“No,” Jordan said when asked if he’d run if McCarthy couldn’t get the votes. “I want to chair the Judiciary Committee.”\n\nMcCarthy’s weighs more concessions\n\nWith 222 GOP seats next year, McCarthy can only afford to lose four Republican votes and still win the speakership. But he and his team are still hopeful he can win on the first round as he has been working both publicly and privately to win over holdouts. So far, at least five Republicans have promised to oppose him on the floor – but in a positive sign for McCarthy, one of them has shown he’s gettable.\n\n“I will vote for Andy for speaker, subject to what we’re discussing,” said Rep. Ralph Norman, a South Carolina Republican after leaving a meeting in McCarthy’s office on Wednesday. He later added: “All this is positive. We’re having good change, regardless of what happens. And you’ll see more of it.”\n\nIn addition to those five, a new group of seven Republican hardliners on Thursday laid out a list of conditions to earn their vote, although they did not specifically threaten to vote against McCarthy if their demands aren’t met.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback GOP lawmaker explains why he won't vote for McCarthy to become House Speaker 03:08 - Source: CNN\n\nTheir list of demands – which shows the work McCarthy needs to do to get to 218 – includes a promise that leaders won’t play in primaries, restoring the motion to vacate the speaker’s chair, placing more conservatives on key committees, giving members at least 72 hours to read bill text before a vote, and committing to using the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip to demand more spending cuts, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN.\n\nMcCarthy has already begun brokering some rules changes to empower rank-and-file members, created a new select committee on China, vowed to boot some Democratic lawmakers from their committees, and sketched out in greater detail his investigative plans – including a potential impeachment inquiry into Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nBut McCarthy still has additional levers he could pull. Conservative hardliners are pushing for more representation on the powerful House Rules Committee, a leadership-aligned panel that decides how and when bills come to the floor. In one private meeting with a member of the House Freedom Caucus, McCarthy was urged to take a harder public stance on the coming policy issues for next year, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAnd the anti-McCarthy group is also still pressing for a process that would allow any single member to hold a floor vote on ousting the sitting speaker, which was wielded over former Speaker John Boehner before he was forced out of the job by the far right in 2015.\n\nMcCarthy has been adamantly opposed to restoring the “motion to vacate the chair,” and a majority of the House GOP voted against the idea during a during a closed-door meeting last month. When asked by CNN on Thursday if he would visit the issue, McCarthy laughed and refused to answer.\n\nBut McCarthy’s detractors said it’s an issue very much still on the table and think he may end up needing to embrace it if he still doesn’t have the speaker votes by January 3. GOP sources told CNN there’s potential room to negotiate to give members more power to call for a vote to oust the speaker – perhaps by allowing the vote to occur if a certain number of members call for one, rather than allowing a single lawmaker to call for a vote as the hardliners want.\n\n“A competent secure leader is not threatened by (the motion to vacate),” Good said. “And so, yeah, that I think that’s central to many members.”\n\nYet others said what Good and his allies are seeking is a recipe for chaos — and are calling on their colleagues to fall in line.\n\n“I think that’s one of the reasons that we didn’t see a red wave … the idea that people are sick and tired of the noise, and they’re sick and tired of the fighting,” Rep. David Joyce, an Ohio Republican, said of the impact of a January 3 floor fight. “And I know I get that wherever I go in my district is, ‘why can’t you guys just get things done?’”\n\nAs McCarthy scrambles to lock down speaker’s votes, he also delayed the GOP’s internal elections for committee chairmanships. There was some speculation that one of the members competing for a gavel, Rep. Vern Buchanan of Florida, may retire early if he doesn’t win, which would make McCarthy’s math problem even tougher. But Buchanan vehemently disputed the notion.\n\n“It’s ridiculous, laughable,” he told reporters. “I’m doing everything I can to help get Kevin to 218.”\n\nMcCarthy could also try to convince Democrats or his GOP detractors to vote present or not show up to the floor proceedings, which would lower the threshold he needs to become speaker. But McCarthy promised his GOP colleagues he would not court Democratic votes.\n\nCould Democrats join Republicans and select a speaker?\n\nIn recent weeks, part of McCarthy’s pitch to his critics has been warning that if they don’t unify, then Democrats could theoretically band together and peel off a few Republicans to elect the next speaker.\n\nSome Democrats have said they would entertain the idea, including Rep. Henry Cuellar, a moderate Democrat from Texas who told CNN some of his GOP colleagues have approached him “informally” about it.\n\nJoyce also said some members have reached out to him about potentially running, but he dismissed it. “At the end of the day, Kevin’s going to be the new speaker.”\n\nNew York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the next House Democratic leader, said, “there are no behind-the-scenes conversations” that he has had with Republicans to put up an alternative candidate. But he refused to rule out a scenario where his caucus would help elect the next speaker if McCarthy couldn’t get the votes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear if Hakeem Jeffries would be willing to help Kevin McCarthy 02:25 - Source: CNN\n\n“Democrats are in the process of organizing the Democratic Conference,” Jeffries told CNN on Thursday. “Republicans are in the process of organizing the Republican Conference. Let’s see what happens on January 3.”\n\nSome of the potential consensus picks that have been floated included retiring Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan and John Katko of New York, who both voted to impeach Donald Trump for inciting the Capitol insurrection; Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, co-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus; and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, a veteran lawmaker and incoming head of the House Rules Committee.\n\nBut that would require agreement from every single Democrat and the help of five Republicans – no easy feat. Upton said he has no plans to be in Washington that day, telling CNN: “I’ll be skiing.”\n\nAnd progressives like Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York said they would never vote for a GOP speaker candidate, no matter how moderate.\n\n“No,” Bowman said, indicating he’d be voting for Jeffries on every ballot on January 3. “It’s going to be Hakeem.”\n\nBut Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman said this has happened before – nearly a decade ago in his state where minority Democrats in the Arkansas legislature joined forces with a handful of Republicans to elect a GOP speaker of their choice. Westerman privately made this case to his colleagues at a closed-door meeting this week.\n\n“I’m concerned about January 3 getting here and us not being able to form a Congress and organize committees and getting delayed in pushing the policy objectives that we want to push,” Westerman said.\n\nWesterman added that the discussion over changing House rules is good for the party. But he added: “I’m not really excited about any type of destructive movement.”", "authors": ["Manu Raju Melanie Zanona", "Manu Raju", "Melanie Zanona"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/10/04/mccarthy-ousted-who-is-speaker-of-the-house-who-is-running/71055124007/", "title": "McCarthy ousted: Who is speaker of the House now? Who is running?", "text": "WASHINGTON - House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., made history Tuesday after a handful of conservative hardliners and Democratic lawmakers ousted him from the top leadership post in the chamber.\n\nHis removal, after 269 days on the job, raises multiple questions, such as who will take his spot now that the seat is vacant and whether the House will be able to resume its normal duties.\n\nThe fallout comes days after a stopgap measure was passed in the House and Senate to temporarily fund the government until mid-November, when another potential shutdown looms.\n\nHere's a quick look at lingering questions:\n\nWhy was McCarthy ousted as speaker?\n\nThe push to oust McCarthy began with Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who followed through on a threat and introduced a resolution Monday vacate the speaker.\n\nGaetz had pressured McCarthy not to work with Democrats to avert a shutdown, but the former speaker did anyway and said he chose what was best for America − not his job.\n\n\"I think we need to rip off the Band-Aid,\" Gaetz said in a Sunday interview on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"I think we need to move on with new leadership that can be trustworthy.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Gaetz also cited several reasons for why McCarthy should be ousted, including McCarthy not holding votes on issues like term limits for lawmakers and balanced budgets, and not releasing the full security tapes from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.\n\nIn a letter sent to House Democrats on Tuesday, Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said leadership would vote to vacate McCarthy from the speakership.\n\n\"It is now the responsibility of the GOP members to end the House Republican Civil War. Given their unwillingness to break from MAGA extremism in an authentic and comprehensive manner, House Democratic leadership will vote yes on the pending Republican Motion to Vacate the Chair,\" the letter read.\n\nThe 8 Republicans who voted to oust McCarthy\n\nEight Republican lawmakers and 208 Democratic lawmakers voted to oust McCarthy. The list of eight includes:\n\nRep. Andy Biggs of Arizona\n\nRep. Ken Buck of Colorado\n\nRep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee\n\nRep. Eli Crane of Arizona.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz of Florida\n\nRep. Bob Good of Virginia\n\nRep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina\n\nRep. Matt Rosendale of Montana\n\nCan the House function without a speaker?\n\nFormally, yes. But politically it can be complicated, experts said.\n\nMcCarthy had provided a succession list to the House Clerk earlier this year in case his seat became vacant. Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., was chosen to be acting House speaker from that list.\n\nAccording to House rules, the person chosen from the list “shall act as Speaker pro tempore until the election of a Speaker or a Speaker pro tempore.” McHenry is the interim, or temporary, speaker.\n\n“So, the House can function in the narrow sense of meeting, voting, etc.,” Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told USA TODAY.\n\nHowever, he added that without a speaker, there is no one with the political authority to speak on behalf of the majority and to engage in difficult negotiations on difficult issues, noting that “that’s the bigger issue here.”\n\n“The speaker is not only a constitutional officer, but the speaker is also the leader of the majority party and represents the majority in complicated political negotiations—with the President and the Senate, especially,” Stewart said.\n\nDavid Bateman, a professor of policy and government at Cornell University, agreed, noting that “McHenry does not have the clear authorization of the majority, and so his ability to set the agenda is limited politically.”\n\nWho is Patrick McHenry?\n\nMcHenry is serving his 10th term in Congress and represents the 10th congressional district in North Carolina.\n\nHe is a McCarthy ally and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, where he advocates for conservative fiscal policies.\n\nPrior to that, he was appointed in 2015 by then House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., to serve as the Chief Deputy Whip where he helped Scalise build agreement around a conservative policy agenda for the House Republican Conference.\n\nMark Harkins, a senior fellow at the Government Affair Institute at Georgetown University, told USA TODAY, that “McHenry has been an important asset to former Speaker McCarthy, having helped broker the deal with rebels in January to allow McCarthy to become Speaker.”\n\n“In addition, he was one of two Republican members McCarthy tapped to negotiate the debt limit deal with administration officials earlier this year,” he said.\n\nWho is running for speaker of the House?\n\nRight now, some names are being floated, but there isn’t a clear nominee yet.\n\nAfter a closed door conference Tuesday night following the vote to oust McCarthy, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., told reporters that Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., would make a “great speaker,” according to CNN.\n\n“Steve Scalise has been a friend for a long time,” Emmer said.\n\nOthers say Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, or Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Florida, whose names were tossed out in January, could once again emerge as nominees.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is also being named a potential speaker, but Trump has said he's focused on his 2024 bid for the White House.\n\nCan former President Donald Trump become speaker of the House?\n\nYes, Trump does have a shot at being speaker.\n\nThere is no requirement for the speaker to be a member of Congress, according to Bateman. But speakers have always been members because their interests are most aligned with Congress.\n\n\"That's best achieved by having the speaker be another elected representative,\" Bateman said. \"That's not a requirement though.\"\n\nContributing: Ken Tran, Rachel Looker, Phillip Bailey", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/10/04/republicans-voted-remove-kevin-mccarthy-list/71057240007/", "title": "Here are the 8 Republicans who voted to remove Speaker Kevin ...", "text": "Republican Kevin McCarthy made history Tuesday as the first speaker of the house to be ousted from his position.\n\nSeven Republicans joined Matt Gaetz of Florida and 208 Democrats to bring the votes that kicked McCarthy from the seat he struggled to obtain in January.

He is currently under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for allegations of sexual misconduct, campaign finance violations, taking bribes, and using drugs.\n\nGaetz played a central role in ousting McCarthy, bringing the motion to vacate to the house and helping to organize a small group of Republicans to join him in crossing the partisan line. In doing so, he has proved his ability to put provocative statements into power, fueling rumors of a run for the Governor's seat in 2026.\n\nAndy Biggs\n\nRepresents Arizona's 5th District, outside of Phoenix.\n\nElected in 2016.\n\nIn December 2022, he was trying to make a longshot run for Speaker of the House, during which he was referred to the House Ethics Committee for failing to comply with a subpoena from the committee investigating Jan. 6.\n\nBiggs was critical of McCarthy's deals to prevent a shutdown before Tuesday's vote, saying that McCarthy was ineffective at achieving some Republican goals. “This is a lawless Biden regime. They will not enforce border laws,” Biggs said before noting his vote to vacate McCarthy.\n\nKen Buck\n\nRepresents Colorado's 4th District, covering most of the state's rural eastern plains.\n\nElected in 2014.\n\nBuck is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, making him a part of the most conservative lawmakers.

He is also a long-time supporter of term limits.\n\nBurchett supported McCarthy all the way through his speakership votes in January and was torn on ousting him until the last minute, according to The Hill. But it was a condescending comment from McCarthy that pushed Burchett to oust him.\n\n\"Then the first thing out of his mouth on the phone was something very condescending. I thought, ‘Well, I’m gonna listen to him. I’m glad he’s calling. I’m sorry it’s right here at the last hour, but I’m gonna listen to him.’ And it was something condescending about my religious beliefs, and I just thought, I don’t need that,\" he told The Hill. \"And that answered my question right there.

He also voted \"present\" during McCarthy's bid for Speakership in January.\n\n\"I ran for congress to make sure the voices of we the people weren't steamrolled by the status quo. We need to change the ineffective and dishonest way this town works,\" he wrote in a statement on X. \"I'm prepared to support a speaker who agrees.\"\n\nBob Good\n\nRepresents the 5th District of Virginia, a large portion of the state southeast of Richmond.\n\nElected in 2020.\n\nA member of the House Freedom Caucus, Good is considered an ultra-conservative congressman. He voiced opposition to McCarthy while he was going for the speaker's seat in January, telling Politico “He doesn’t have anything that I want.” McCarthy supported Good's opponent in Virginia's 2020 congressional race, Rep. Denver Riggleman, whom Good was challenging after the opponent officiated a same sex wedding, the outlet reported.\n\n\"We need a speaker, ideally someone who doesn't wanna be speaker and hasn't pursued that at all costs for his entire adult life, who will meet the moment and do everything possible to fight for the country,\" Good said before casting his vote to vacate.\n\nNancy Mace\n\nRepresents South Carolina's 1st District, a coastal region of the state including Charleston.\n\nElected in 2022.\n\nMace has previously broken from the party on abortion issues.

In interviews with WABC radio and the New York Post – the first times Santos has spoken publicly about the controversy – he acknowledged that he had fabricated some facts.\n\n“I am not a criminal. Not here, not abroad, in any jurisdiction in the world have I ever committed any crimes,” Santos said in an interview with WABC radio host John Catsimatidis.\n\n“To get down to the nit and gritty, I’m not a fraud.

CNN confirmed details of that reporting, including about his college education and employment history.\n\nCNN’s KFile also reported last week that claims by Santos that his grandparents “survived the Holocaust” as Ukrainian Jewish refugees from Belgium who changed their surname are contradicted by sources including family trees compiled by genealogy websites, records on Jewish refugees and interviews with multiple genealogists. A lawyer for Santos had declined to comment to CNN.\n\n“I never claimed to be Jewish,” Santos told the Post. “I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background I said I was ‘Jew-ish.’”\n\nSantos had said he was “very proud” of his “Jewish heritage” as recently as a late November 2022 appearance with the Jewish News Syndicate.\n\nCNN has reached out to House GOP leadership and the National Republican Congressional Committee in the wake of Santos’ admissions. House GOP leadership was silent amid last week’s revelations.

Durham is accused of inappropriate conduct with at least 22 women and remains under investigation by state and federal officials.\n\nThe proceeding and Durham's attendance caught some off guard, as GOP leaders had to call a quick break for an emotional plea from House Speaker Beth Harwell for support to prevent anyone from publicly identifying the women accusing Durham of sexual misconduct.\n\nAfter lawmakers yelled at Durham and questioned him about issues ranging from sexual harassment to an FBI inquiry, the embattled lawmaker brandished a folder, threatening to reveal some information. He blasted the allegations and suggested he could reveal details about the 22 women and others in the Attorney General's investigation, but then abruptly left the chamber before his colleagues voted to oust him. The women were referred to only as Jane Does in the report because they had requested anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\n\"It's amazing what people say, as long as it's not happening to them. I can't vote for their bills anymore,\" Durham told a crowd of reporters as he left the capitol, after initially refusing to answer questions.\n\nThe Tennessean's ongoing scrutiny of Durham prompted a Tennessee attorney general investigation into his behavior and calls for his resignation.\n\nDrew Rawlins, executive director of the state Bureau of Ethics and Campaign Finance, said the state's investigation into Durham's finances will continue. The status of the federal investigation is unclear.\n\nThe attorney general found 22 women who said Durham had acted sexually inappropriate with them. The report includes an array of allegations, from lewd comments and inappropriate hugs to giving beer to and having sex with a 20-year-old \"college student/political worker\" in his legislative office and home.\n\nGOP, Democrats react to expelling Jeremy Durham\n\nHarwell, R-Nashville, said after the vote: \"I'm very pleased that the House made the decision it did today. This was good for the taxpayers of the state. It was good for the victims of the state.\"\n\nAfter a speech that lasted nearly 13 minutes, Durham said the attorney general report was \"anonymous hearsay\" and that it was an unethical investigation. Much of Durham's speech focused on the mechanism of the investigation, not the substance of the allegations.\n\n\"I ask that you vote for due process,\" Durham said.\n\nDurham previously has denied sexually harassing anyone, calling the investigation unconstitutional and an attempt to remove a conservative stalwart. He sent a letter to colleagues Monday outlining his critiques of the investigation and other allegations, and threatened to release a document naming the women who accused him of inappropriate conduct.\n\n\"No matter how guilty you think I am, there are aspects of this situation that should bother you,\" Durham said.\n\nDurham appeared ready to leave after his speech when Rep. William Lamberth, R-Cottontown — a former prosecutor — asked him to return to the podium to answer questions.\n\nLamberth, who was clearly bothered, had already made a motion that no one speaking about the report could identify anyone by name. He thundered away at Durham, asking him to respond to numerous allegations outlined in the report, including whether Durham had sex in his office with a 20-year-old woman.\n\n“I mean, I’m a father, I’m a husband, I’m a son. I feel violated that any one of our members would treat anyone in the fashion that the allegations in the report lay out,\" Lamberth said after the expulsion vote.\n\n\"I will also tell you that having personally known Rep. Durham for four years, I felt betrayed. If any one of those allegations is true, it is completely unacceptable behavior by an elected representative of this state.”\n\nHouse Democratic Caucus Leader Mike Stewart, D-Nashville, also walked Durham through a series of questions about the attorney general's report and investigation. When Stewart asked him to point out in the report which allegations were true, Durham refused.\n\n\"I'm not going to go one by one. I really don't think these witnesses would want me to,\" Durham said. \"It would be much more fun to talk about the ones that are false. Some of the text messages that they've sent me and some of the things that I know. But I'm not going to go down that road.\"\n\nDurham later pointed to a black binder he'd brought with him that contained a letter previously written by his attorney Bill Harbison, along with other undisclosed information which he suggested could be damaging to others in the House.\n\n\"I assure you, you don't want me releasing some of the things that are in this binder,\" Durham said. That remark came less than an hour after he'd criticized the media for reporting that Durham had threatened to name accusers.\n\nDuring his questioning by Stewart, Durham did admit some wrongdoing. \"There were some things I did wrong, there’s no question about it. There’s things I should not have said.\"\n\nStewart, reflecting on his questioning of Durham, later said, \"I wanted to cross-examine him to make it clear, although he talks about fairness, he's not willing to do his part.\"\n\nDurham repeatedly argued that an ouster procedure should be treated like a criminal hearing or trial. But Rep. Jon Lundberg, R-Bristol, noted earlier in the day that court procedure has nothing to do with the House expelling a member. No complaint or formal charge is required to remove a member from the House, according to House rules and the state Constitution.\n\nRep. Rick Womick, R-Rockvale, and a handful of other lawmakers disagreed. Womick argued, as he's done repeatedly, that the investigation didn't afford Durham the necessary due process and violated constitutional principles, setting up the legislature for a lawsuit from Durham.\n\n\"Anyone can file a lawsuit anytime. I don’t think he has any standing,\" Harwell said after the vote.\n\nAt one point during the House discussion — and amid questions from his colleagues — Durham abruptly left the chamber, with reporters in pursuit as he briskly left the building ahead of the chamber's vote.\n\nHouse leadership once thought they would get as many as 80 votes to expel Durham. Fourteen Republicans and two Democrats voted present or did not vote. Reps. Courtney Rogers, R-Goodlettsville, and Terri Lynn Weaver, R-Lancaster, were the sole members to vote no on expelling Durham.\n\nHouse Republican Caucus Chairman Glen Casada, R-Franklin, said the narrow vote was because \"members thought we were a court and they viewed it in that process.\"\n\nRep. Charles Sargent, R-Franklin, said Durham's expulsion allows the voters of Williamson County to have closure.\n\nThe move to expel Durham comes nearly eight months after leading Republicans, including Gov. Bill Haslam, and Democrats called for Durham to resign in the wake of an ongoing Tennessean investigation which started in January. The Tennessean's coverage set off a firestorm of scrutiny for the once-rising star.\n\nIn the aftermath of The Tennessean investigation, Durham resigned from his House Whip leadership post, left the House Republican caucus and took a two-week hiatus from the legislature. At the time, Harwell also began exploring the process for expelling Durham while calling for Attorney General Herbert Slatery to open an independent investigation. At one point during the probe, Durham's legislative office was relocated because Slatery found the lawmaker posed a \"continuing risk to unsuspecting women.\"\n\nSlatery's six-month investigation culminated in a scathing report issued in July, which was released only after a Davidson County judge nixed an effort by Durham and his attorney Bill Harbison to stop its release. The day after the report was released, Durham denied most of the accusations but announced he would suspend his re-election campaign.\n\nThe attorney general also sent information from a former Durham employee to state election officials. The former employee said Durham told him to put money from his campaign finances into his personal business. Durham has denied the allegation, arguing the state has also cleared him on this particular issue.\n\nThe state registry of election finance did say that a payment from Durham's campaign to the former employee \"appears to have not been paid directly from Rep. Durham's campaign account,\" although a payment was listed to the employee in Durham's election finance report. The registry is still investigating a $191,000 discrepancy between Durham's campaign report and his bank account. In his letter to colleagues, Durham said the discrepancy is due to investments but didn't elaborate.\n\nA federal investigation also still appears to be underway. Peter Strianse, a Nashville criminal defense attorney recently hired by Durham, recently told The Tennessean that the U.S. attorney issued two subpoenas for records related to campaign finances and a possible tax violation. Durham also closed his title company recently.\n\nBefore Tuesday's expulsion vote, the session was halted after Casada called for a recess that lasted almost 45 minutes.\n\n\"I'm asking the speaker if I can go into recess to remind the caucus that it is paramount to protect the Jane Does — the innocent women who are brave enough to come forward,\" Casada said moments before the start of session.\n\nHer voice breaking, Harwell asked the GOP caucus to support the motion from Lamberth to protect the identities of the women in the attorney general's report who were afraid of retribution.\n\n\"Don't do this to these women. Don't you dare,\" Harwell said.\n\nLamberth also called on the press not to print the names of any victims if Durham does mention them or try to release them.\n\n\"Please, for God's sake, do not print anybody's name. It is not right,\" Lamberth said.\n\nThe Tennessean has not published the names of any women who have accused Durham of inappropriate conduct. Durham nor anyone else named the victims during the proceedings.\n\nThe caucus also debated the constitutionality of the session in general, with Rep. Andy Holt, R-Dresden, vowing not to vote on any measure to oust Durham.\n\nOthers disagreed.\n\n\"Let's go up there and flush this commode,\" said Rep. David Alexander, R-Winchester, during the caucus meeting.\n\nImmediately after the vote, Durham's name was removed from his desk on the House floor and his name was removed from the legislative website. He is no longer eligible to receive a state pension, having not served enough time in the House.\n\nThe last Tennessee lawmaker to be expelled was Robert Fisher, who was kicked out in 1980 after being convicted of soliciting a $1,000 bribe in exchange to kill a bill. Prior to that, six lawmakers were ousted during an 1866 special session after they tried to prevent Tennessee from ratifying an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to provide citizenship to slaves.\n\nReach Dave Boucher at 615-259-8892 and on Twitter @Dave_Boucher1.

In July, Francis wrote an initial response to questions posed to him by five cardinals from the U.S., Africa, Asia and Europe asking him to affirm the church's teaching on same-sex marriage, the role of women, the authority of the pope and other issues.\n\nThe cardinals' questions came ahead of a major three-week meeting at the Vatican, called a synod, where LGBTQ+ Catholics and their place in the church are on the agenda.\n\nTaking faith to the courts:How a Christian transgender man increased his faith by taking the fight over LGBTQ+ rights to religious schools\n\nAlready, LGBTQ+ rights groups are applauding the pope's unprecedented move.\n\n\"The allowance for pastoral ministers to bless same-gender couples implies that the church does indeed recognize that holy love can exist between same-gender couples, and the love of these couples mirrors the love of God,\" Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry – a Catholic LGBTQ+ advocacy group – said in a statement. “Those recognitions, while not completely what LGBTQ+ Catholics would want, are an enormous advance towards fuller and more comprehensive equality.”\n\nWhat is the Catholic Church's stance on same-sex marriage?\n\nFrancis, who became head of the Catholic Church in 2013, has supported same-sex couples receiving the legal benefits of marriage. Since his papal inauguration, over a dozen countries including the U.S. legalized gay marriage.\n\nSome Catholic priests in Europe also have blessed same-sex couples without censure from the Vatican. But the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a body responsible for promoting and defending Catholic beliefs, has said \"God cannot bless sin\" in response to same-sex marriages.\n\nMarianne Duddy-Burke, executive director of DignityUSA, said the five cardinals' letter spoke to their hope for a return to a stricter church many Catholics saw under Pope Saint John Paul II or Pope Benedict XVI, who appointed the five cardinals.\n\n\"It seemed to express a lot of fear that the synod would lead to profound changes in the church,\" Duddy-Burke said.\n\nMore:Where it's a crime to be gay: A visual guide to where LGBTQ+ rights are repressed\n\nThe five cardinals are Cardinal Walter Brandmueller of Germany, a former Vatican historian; Raymond Burke of the U.S., who was reassigned from his post on the Vatican's court on canon law; Juan Sandoval of Mexico, the retired archbishop of Guadalajara; Robert Sarah of Guinea, the retired head of the Vatican’s liturgy office; and Joseph Zen, the retired archbishop of Hong Kong.\n\nThe possible movement within the church came to a head after the five priests initially sent the pope a letter in the summer, to which he replied in July. They then revised their questions and requested a yes or no answer from Francis. Without Francis' definite stance, the cardinals published their questions with a warning to other Catholics about the possible shift in the religion on Cardinal Burke's website.\n\nFrancis' reply, hours later, urged the cardinals to not be afraid of the synod. In it, he said pastoral charity requires patience and understanding, but priests cannot become judges \"who only dent, reject and exclude.\"\n\n“For this reason, pastoral prudence must adequately discern whether there are forms of benediction, requested by one or more persons, that do not transmit a mistaken conception of marriage,” Francis wrote. “Because when a benediction is requested, it is expressing a request for help from God, a plea to be able to live better, a trust in a father who can help us to live better.”\n\nLGBTQ+ Catholics eager to learn Pope Francis' stance\n\nDuddy-Burke is one of many Catholics globally who married in the church and had the ceremony blessed by a priest. She and her wife will celebrate their 20-year anniversary this month and being able to hold their wedding in a church meant the world to them and their families.\n\nNot all LGBTQ+ Catholics can celebrate that.\n\nDuddy-Burke said Catholics consider marriage blessings to be major and critical to their lives.\n\n\"I've been to so many ceremonies where one member is Catholic and the joy their family members have is so palpable, but there's often regret it can't be held in a Catholic church and the priest can't sign the marriage licenses,\" Duddy-Burke said.\n\nDrag to church:'God welcomes you': Why a Louisville church is holding a gospel drag queen show\n\nSarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of GLAAD, said in a statement the pope's response urges Catholics to accept LGBTQ+ people.\n\nFrancis, meanwhile, has pushed leaders to not deny or punish LGBTQ+ people as anti-gay laws get passed across the globe.\n\nThe International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association found that 64 of the 193 countries in the United Nations criminalize same-sex acts through imprisonment, whippings and even death.\n\n\"Pope Francis’ leadership recognizes the lived reality that LGBTQ people exist, that we form partnerships and families, and that we need the support of our communities, including our churches,\" she said. \"This is not full marriage recognition, but it will make a significant difference in the lives of LGBTQ families and create a Catholic Church open to all, regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity.\"\n\nDuddy-Burke said the Catholic Church today is more progressive than before because of grassroots efforts by local churches.\n\nChurch leaders in the U.S., Germany and Belgium are some of many who've blessed same-sex marriages without penalty from the Vatican.\n\nThe decision to bless same-sex unions could help the church become more engaged with the world, advocates say.\n\n\"It has the protentional of opening a door that has long been shut to same-sex couples,\" Duddy-Burke said.\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard and Javier Zarracina, USA TODAY; Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/06/04/catholic-church-sex-abuse-woman-accuses-cardinal-dismissing-case/1341862001/", "title": "Cardinal Daniel DiNardo accused of dismissing sex abuse", "text": "Associated Press\n\nHOUSTON – When Cardinal Daniel DiNardo first met Laura Pontikes in his wood-paneled conference room in December 2016, the leader of the U.S. Catholic Church's response to its sex abuse scandal said all the right things.\n\nHe praised her for coming forward to report that his deputy in the Galveston-Houston Archdiocese had manipulated her into a sexual relationship and declared her a \"victim\" of the priest, Pontikes said. Emails and other documents obtained by The Associated Press show that the relationship had gone on for years –even as the priest heard her confessions, counseled her husband on their marriage and pressed the couple for hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations.\n\nShe says she was assured that the priest, Monsignor Frank Rossi, would never be a pastor or counsel women again.\n\nMonths after that meeting, though, she found out DiNardo had allowed Rossi to take a new job as pastor of a parish two hours away in east Texas. When her husband confronted DiNardo, he said, the cardinal warned that the archdiocese would respond aggressively to any legal challenge – and that the fallout would hurt their family and business.\n\nOn Tuesday, after written inquiries by the AP, the church followed through on promises to remove Rossi, announcing in a statement from his new bishop that he was being placed on temporary administrative leave.\n\nLaura Pontikes, a 55-year-old construction executive in Texas, had been at a low point in her life when she sought spiritual counseling from Rossi, the longtime No. 2 official in the Galveston-Houston Archdiocese DiNardo heads. Instead, she said, Rossi preyed on her emotional vulnerability to draw her into a physical relationship that he called blessed by God.\n\n\"He took a woman that went into a church truly looking for God, and he took me for himself,\" she told the AP.\n\nRossi's sexual relationship with Pontikes is now the subject of a previously undisclosed criminal investigation in Houston. Yet it is DiNardo's handling of the case that poses far-reaching questions for the church in the #MeToo era, when powerful men and institutions are being called to account over sex abuse.\n\n'A playbook for concealing the truth'\n\nAs the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, DiNardo will lead a meeting next week in Baltimore to address the church's credibility crisis over its failure to fully reckon with sexual abuse, 17 years after it committed to cleaning house. DiNardo is expected to present his brother bishops with new proposals to hold one another accountable for sexual misconduct or negligence in handling abuse cases.\n\nBut Pontikes' case lays bare that even leaders in the Catholic hierarchy who have vowed to do right by victims continue to fail them. Pontikes said DiNardo has been negligent by keeping in ministry a priest who \"seduced, betrayed and ultimately sexually victimized\" her, Pontikes' therapist told Texas prosecutors.\n\nThe June 11-14 meeting in Baltimore is part of the church's effort to confront sexual abuse worldwide. In a little more than a year, Pope Francis admitted he made \"grave errors\" in Chile's worst case of cover-up, an Australian cardinal was convicted of abuse and a French cardinal was convicted of failing to report a pedophile.\n\nRelated:Five Catholic priests charged in Michigan sex abuse investigation\n\nRelated:More Americans than ever are leaving the Catholic Church after the sex abuse scandal. Here's why.\n\nIn the U.S., a Pennsylvania grand jury blasted church leaders for following \"a playbook for concealing the truth,\" and attorneys general in at least 15 states are investigating sex abuse by Catholic clergy and its cover-up.\n\nThe Galveston-Houston Archdiocese acknowledged an inappropriate physical relationship between Rossi and Pontikes, but asserted that it was consensual and didn't include sexual intercourse. In a written statement to The Associated Press, it defended its handling of the case, saying Rossi was immediately placed on leave and went for counseling after Pontikes reported him.\n\nRossi returned to active ministry, without restrictions, based on recommendations from an out-of-state \"renewal\" program for clergy he completed, the statement said.\n\nPontikes filed a police report in August. Under Texas criminal law, a member of the clergy can be charged with sexual assault of an adult if the priest exploited an emotional dependency in a spiritual relationship.\n\nRossi's attorney, Dan Cogdell, said Rossi is cooperating with the investigation and has met with police. He declined further comment.\n\nPontikes' allegations against DiNardo add to questions about how he has dealt with abuse in the past. SNAP, a national group of survivors of clergy abuse, has called for him to resign as head of the bishops conference because he allowed predator priests to remain in ministry in Houston, as well as in his previous diocese in Sioux City, Iowa.\n\nAnd when law enforcement raided DiNardo's offices in November as part of an investigation into an alleged abuser, they found files locked away in a bank vault that the archdiocese had failed to turn over, according to police documents released last month.\n\nRossi previously helped handle Galveston-Houston's abuse cases for more than two decades. But in a church bulletin in February, he minimized the number of abusers nationwide, accused the media of hyping the scandal and insisted that while even one case of abuse was too many, the vast majority of accused were \"good men\" who simply made a \"terrible single decision.\"\n\nPontikes provided the AP with seven years of her email correspondence with Rossi, therapists, priests and friends, along with financial data and communications with the archdiocese. She told the Vatican in April that Rossi heard her confessions after their relationship became physical – a potentially serious crime under church law that DiNardo never asked her about. The Vatican said her complaint was under review.\n\nThe church, which has been grappling for decades with the sexual abuse of children, is now being forced to reckon with the idea that adults too can be sexually exploited by clergy. Last summer, amid revelations that ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick had preyed on adult seminarians, DiNardo used his pulpit to apologize for the leadership's failures.\n\n\"This is especially true for adults being sexually harassed by those in positions of power,\" DiNardo said Aug. 27. \"We will do better.\"\n\nThat statement gave Pontikes hope, but nothing changed, she said. She said she came forward to protect other women and expose DiNardo's handling of her case, which has left her so distraught that she can barely sleep or work.\n\n\"They're not going to play with my life like this,\" said Pontikes. \"They just can't get away with it. ... Somebody had better stand up and tell the damned truth.\"\n\nAbuse started in wine cellar, she says\n\nPontikes first met Rossi in the confessional at St. Michael the Archangel Catholic Church in December 2007. At the time, Pontikes sought to fill the void of an emotionally distant husband and mounting pressures at the family business by throwing herself into her faith, giving sizable weekly donations at Mass.\n\nRossi's easy manner and laughter broke the ice.\n\nSoon the coiffed and charismatic preacher was calling her \"Laura dear\" and attending family dinners. In 2008, while she showed him a religious painting in their downstairs wine cellar, Rossi slipped his hand under her jacket and rested it on her bare waist, she said.\n\nShe froze, embarrassed, but didn't know what to do, she said. So she did nothing.\n\nDuring a 2009 dinner, Rossi asked the couple to give to an ambitious capital campaign that included rebuilding the St. Michael rectory where the parish priests lived. Their firm built the new rectory for $900,000, more than half of which the couple donated themselves. In addition, Laura Pontikes donated nearly $250,000 in religious art and furnishings, including $20,000 for an 18th-century scroll depicting the Virgin Mary as the Good Shepherdess, according to a list of vendors provided to AP.\n\nIn all, the Pontikeses said they gave the church about $2 million over nine years, and Rossi asked for more, including $750,000 for a new school chapel they couldn't afford. The archdiocese countered that their construction firm benefited from contracts worth $24 million over that time.\n\nPontikes began seeing Rossi for regular spiritual direction in 2010, at the same time her husband was trying to get an annulment for his first marriage. The couple wanted their civil marriage of two decades to be recognized by the church.\n\nRossi married the Pontikeses in a religious ceremony at St. Michael's in August 2012. Less than four months later, during a session of spiritual counseling in his office, Pontikes said, Rossi started their physical relationship with an intimate, sexual embrace. The next day, Rossi wrote her an email with the subject line \"blessings.\"\n\n\"It was wonderful to visit with you yesterday and continue to unfold the love of God in your life,\" he wrote.\n\nShe felt blessed and special to him, but also conflicted, knowing a boundary had been crossed. That same confusion tormented her during the many times he induced her to perform sexual acts in his office during spiritual direction, she said.\n\nPontikes phoned and emailed Rossi several times a day with spiritual musings and work and family problems, and he responded with the attention she sought. In time, she was increasingly questioning her feelings for him.\n\n\"I have blocked my faith mightily over my fear of my love for you,\" she wrote him Jan. 5, 2013.\n\nRossi assured her that such feelings are common in spiritual direction and that \"holy touches\" were not only sanctioned but encouraged by St. Paul the Apostle.\n\nHouston architect Ken Newberry was dismayed at seeing his longtime friend and client fall under Rossi's spell. \"She was like someone that was hypnotized or mesmerized,\" Newberry said.\n\nNewberry recognized a process of grooming that he went through when he was abused by a Catholic priest at the age of 15. He eventually told Pontikes he couldn't bear to hear any more, because it was triggering his own trauma.\n\n\"Someone is talking to you about God,\" he says, \"and they're pulling you in and telling you that this is right. ... It is very, very confusing and overwhelming.\"\n\nConfessing to the cardinal\n\nThroughout the relationship, Pontikes said, Rossi was her confessor. On Dec. 20, 2012, about two weeks after their first sexual embrace in Rossi's office, he agreed to hear her confession: \"I would be most happy to celebrate the sacrament of reconciliation with you if you would like.\"\n\nA few months later, Pontikes was rushing to catch a flight to visit a friend whose husband had died. Guilt-ridden about her growing intimacy with Rossi, she wanted to ease her conscience with confession before leaving town.\n\nHe was not happy with her request and said he didn't have time. But she chased him down, followed him out the side chapel and made him hear her, according to Pontikes. She confessed that she had been inappropriate with her priest.\n\nHe absolved her of their sin, she said, and told her, \"Go forth and sin no more.\"\n\nThe \"absolution of an accomplice\" crime, one of the most serious in canon law, must be reported to the Vatican and can carry the penalty of excommunication. It occurs when a priest absolves someone with whom he has engaged in a sexual sin, including merely a lustful touch.\n\nThe archdiocese claims Rossi never heard Pontikes' confession during or after their physical relationship, but the emails Pontikes turned over to church officials include several references to confession.\n\nEdward Peters, a leading U.S. canon lawyer and consultant at the Vatican high court, says that \"as a matter of good governance\" the bishop in question – DiNardo – should have asked Pontikes about possible confession-related crimes. Pontikes said neither DiNardo nor his subordinates ever did.\n\nThe sexual relationship grew during a March 2013 trip to Taormina, Sicily, one of several family vacations Rossi joined at the Pontikeses' invitation and expense. The family also had begun building a guest cottage for him at their weekend retreat on Trinity Bay.\n\nGeorge Pontikes, who knew nothing of the sexual encounters with his wife, reached out to Rossi for advice after the trip. She was growing more distant, irritable and distracted, he said, and the couple was on the verge of separation.\n\n\"I don't know whether I'm asking for help or sympathy,\" he wrote on April 3, 2013. \"I know Laura listens to you.\"\n\nRossi responded that she was going through strong mood swings. \"My gut feeling is that she is on the verge of a breakdown due to the stress,\" he wrote.\n\nGeorge Pontikes reached out again two weeks later.\n\n\"Frank: Laura is close to losing it,\" he wrote Rossi. \"I want to help. She does not want it. I think you should give it a try. She trusts you.\"\n\nFour days later, on a Friday night after George had gone to bed, the priest and parishioner consummated the relationship in the pool house bathroom of her Houston home, Laura Pontikes said. It was the first of up to half a dozen such sexual encounters over more than a year, according to Pontikes.\n\n\"I wish I could have walked away from it, but I just didn't and I just couldn't,\" she said.\n\nThe archdiocese denied key portions of Pontikes' claim, saying the relationship included encounters of a sexual nature but not intercourse. It also said Rossi ended the physical relationship, but Pontikes continued sending him \"hundreds of unsolicited messages primarily by email and phone.\"\n\nAlthough Pontikes acknowledged the continued correspondence, she said she was desperate to hold onto the spiritual relationship because she believed it an essential part of her faith. Rossi assured her that their relationship was \"a blessing from God.\"\n\n\"I am praying fervently and digging deeper and deeper into my own soul,\" he wrote her in 2015, after the physical relationship had ended. \"I ache at my very core.\"\n\nShe's urged to turn him in\n\nThe turmoil tore Pontikes up so much that she sought therapy. Gradually, painfully, she came to believe that Rossi had preyed upon her. Her suspicions were confirmed when she watched him interact with other women, and she remembered seeing him touch one on the bare shoulder at her wedding.\n\nThen two friends told her about his inappropriate attentiveness to yet another woman on a Holy Land pilgrimage. It was the tipping point. She confided in her friends, and they urged her to turn him in.\n\nPontikes reported Rossi to the archdiocese April 7, 2016. She met with Auxiliary Bishop George Sheltz and Sister Gina Iadanza. They didn't ask questions, Pontikes recalled, but Iadanza wrote down everything she said, and she left them with a stack of email correspondence.\n\nThat night, as she sat in the prayer chair in her living room, she finally told her husband.\n\n\"What have you done?\" George Pontikes asked his wife in shock.\n\nOver the next few days, Laura checked herself into a residential clinic to cope with the trauma. George spoke with her therapists, read the emails between Rossi and his wife and began to realize that the priest had manipulated and betrayed them both. He was livid.\n\nLess than a month after reporting Rossi, Laura Pontikes said, she got a phone call from Iadanza. She and her husband listened together.\n\n\"She said they had completed their investigation and that a committee had determined that he must be turned over to the authorities,\" Pontikes said. \"I panicked. I did not want to ruin anyone's life, even as mine appeared to be in shambles.\"\n\nThe archdiocese maintained that it was not legally obliged to report Rossi to police at the time, and that Pontikes \"vehemently resisted\" their suggestion that she do so. However, Joe Bailey, a onetime assistant district attorney in Harris County who is now advising the Pontikeses, said Rossi's wrongdoing is clear and should have been reported immediately. The archdiocese did report the case last year, and said it is cooperating with the investigation.\n\nAn archdiocese known for secrecy\n\nFor Pontikes, this case is as much about DiNardo as it is about Rossi.\n\nDiNardo's archdiocese is known for its secrecy among victim advocates. In the November raid on the diocese, prosecutors backed by 60 members of the Texas Rangers and federal agents seized records related to the Rev. Manuel La Rosa-Lopez, who has been charged with sexually abusing minors.\n\nTwo of LaRosa-Lopez's alleged victims have accused DiNardo of downplaying their claims and keeping him in ministry, around children, until his arrest in September.\n\nDiNardo also allowed the Rev. John Keller to celebrate Mass on the same day his name appeared on the archdiocese's list of accused priests, even though allegations that he fondled a 16-year-old boy had been public since 2003.\n\nIn 2002, during his tenure as bishop of Sioux City, Iowa, DiNardo apologized for allowing the Rev. George McFadden to continue working as a priest after he molested at least 25 children.\n\nRossi, for his part, helped handle Galveston-Houston's abuse cases as vice-chancellor, chancellor and vicar general of the archdiocese. Pontikes recalls he boasted that his bosses couldn't take action against him since \"I know where all the bones are buried.\"\n\nIn 1998, Rossi signed a form letter stating that the Rev. Jesse Linam was a validly ordained priest who had been granted \"complete retirement for medical reasons,\" according to documents obtained by AP.\n\nThe letter didn't mention that Linam had been removed from ministry five years before after admitting to sex abuse. In a 2003 letter with a $2,000 loan to Linam for legal fees, Rossi wrote, \"Jesse, I realize that this has been a very difficult time for you. It has been for Bishop (Joseph) Fiorenza and myself as well.\"\n\nIn his new posting in east Texas, Rossi continues to express sympathy for accused priests.\n\n\"These men need our prayers, as they too are suffering due to the harm they know they have caused,\" he wrote in the Feb. 2-3 parish bulletin.\n\nCardinal announces his 'retirement'\n\nA month after Pontikes reported him, Rossi sent an email to the staff of St. Michael's with a letter to parishioners announcing his resignation as pastor, effective May 7, 2016.\n\n\"I am being faced with some very difficult personal issues affecting my priesthood which require my full and single focused attention;\" Rossi wrote. He vowed to return after \"a period of renewal.\"\n\nPontikes said Iadanza later told her that Rossi would never be a pastor again, and that the archdiocese was looking for a position for him as a port chaplain or in prison ministry – where he wouldn't have access to women. The archdiocese said Pontikes' account of Iadanza's comments is \"not accurate,\" but did not elaborate.\n\nThe Pontikeses found out about Rossi's return to Houston when they learned a parishioner had invited them all to the same Christmas party. George Pontikes pressed DiNardo in a subsequent meeting to hold Rossi accountable, but said he came away feeling threatened.\n\n\"He told me that this could be headed for some type of civil or criminal matter and that we should resolve this problem because 'Laura can't handle it, you can't handle it and your business can't handle it,'\" George Pontikes recalled DiNardo warning him.\n\n\"I told him, 'Neither can you.' He said, 'You're right. I'll put money, art and everything on the table. Let's have a mediation.' \"\n\nScott Allen, an attorney representing Pontikes, also thought the church was bullying the couple. After a May 31, 2017 meeting, he wrote that archdiocesan lawyer Robert Schick had tried to warn them off litigation by mentioning the \"public domain exposure to Laura, George their business\" as well as the potential for \"St. Michael's community fallout.\"\n\n\"Despite attempt at 'cordiality,' I found the tone and content purposefully vaguely & opaquely threatening and somewhat insulting,\" Allen wrote.\n\nThe archdiocese didn't respond to questions about the exchanges.\n\nRossi's \"retirement\" from the archdiocese was announced that spring, along with his new appointment as pastor of Our Lady of the Pines in Woodville, Texas, a humble parish that seats about 100 people. Laura Pontikes said Iadanza assured her Rossi would be under a strict monitoring protocol. In the meantime, DiNardo defended his actions to George.\n\n\"They started telling me things like, 'His life is ruined, George. We've already punished him,'\" George Pontikes said. \"'We've sent him out to east Texas. ... He will never ever be looking at an upward mobility anymore.'\"\n\nBy October 2017, Dr. Ken Buckle, Laura Pontikes' Catholic therapist, had outlined mediation proposals. They included a formal apology for actions by Rossi and by the archdiocese; ongoing monitoring of Rossi along with five years of therapy, with annual reports to the couple; and \"more compassionate\" policies in cases of inappropriate conduct.\n\nBut Pontikes said that during two years of mediation, the church focused exclusively on a financial settlement.\n\nMore:Church sex abuse survivors blast Pope Francis' new law on reporting\n\nOpinion: After abuse scandal, we in the pews must no longer simply pray & pay\n\nWhat happened between Pontikes and Rossi is under investigation by the Houston police department, and Harris County prosecutors have subpoenaed her therapists in the name of a grand jury.\n\nIn an affidavit seen by the AP, Buckle wrote that Pontikes was in crisis as a result of \"sexual and religious abuse\" and that the decision to relocate Rossi to another parish was \"highly distressing\" to her. Texas law states that sex is without consent if a clergyman exploits a person's emotional dependency on him.\n\n\"It's recognized that the person really can't give consent,\" said Tahira Khan Merritt, a Dallas lawyer who represents abuse victims. \"And the church knows that.\"\n\nThe archdiocese said it informed Rossi's new bishop of his violation of his vow of chastity and time in a renewal program.\n\nBeaumont Bishop Curtis Guillory didn't respond to questions about what other information or monitoring recommendations DiNardo had provided. He told AP that he accepted Rossi into his diocese as a retired Houston priest \"in good standing,\" and that he has received no allegations of misconduct in his parish. In a press release Tuesday put on the Beaumont website, he announced Rossi had been placed on temporary administrative leave pending the investigation.\n\nUntil the suspension, neither the criminal investigation nor the years-long mediation with the archdiocese appeared to have crimped Rossi's ministry. As usual, he led a 13-day pilgrimage to the Holy Land and Jordan in early November. The pews at his new parish were full on Palm Sunday, when Rossi celebrated Mass and then greeted visitors in near-perfect Spanish.\n\n\"At times, we betray the Lord, through our evil acts of sin,\" Rossi said in his homily. \"And then we regret our sins.\"\n\nRossi's parish bulletins included posts on spousal love and sexuality, including how husbands and wives should communicate. Laura Pontikes read them in disgust, seeing them as an attempt by Rossi to find women in troubled marriages who might seek counseling.\n\nShe enclosed the bulletins in her April letter to the Vatican, including one from November that read: \"Holding hands, kissing, embracing and sexual intimacy are all ways of communicating marital love. ... For a person whose primary love language is touch, physical contact with their spouse is essential.\"\n\nAP writer Nomaan Merchant contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/12/09/paula-cooper-executioner-within/93650408/", "title": "Indiana killer Paula Cooper: The Executioner Within", "text": "Robert King\n\nrobert.king@indystar.com\n\nThis 13-chapter story, told as a real-life novel, raises questions about race, justice, poverty and abuse. But it is also the story about the human capacity for forgiveness and a young woman’s struggle to find peace.\n\nStill shrouded in darkness, she sat alone in her car, parked between night and day, between this world and the next.\n\nBehind her, a family of teddy bears sat strapped in by a seat belt. In the front seat next to her was a digital recorder. And a gun.\n\nShe picked up the recorder and clicked it on.\n\n\"This is Paula Cooper.\"\n\nA short introduction, a simple statement. Even though nothing had been simple about being Paula Cooper.\n\n\"I believe today is the 26th; 5:15 will be my death.\"\n\nShe saw it clearly now, even in the pre-dawn gloom. She'd spent so much of her life searching for peace. But early on the morning of May 26, 2015, the end was in sight. She would reach it before sunrise.\n\nShe just had a few things left to say.\n\n—\n\n\"My sister. My queen. My everything.\"\n\nEvery morning she spoke to Rhonda. Why should this morning be different?\n\n—\n\n\"My mother, I felt like you didn't love me. You didn't care about me. You cut me off. You judged me. You didn't want me at your church. You hurt me about the man I loved. But I still love you.\"\n\nOthers had forgiven Paula. Yet she never felt it from the woman who mattered most.\n\n—\n\n\"To Monica, I'm so sorry. This pain that I feel every day. I walk around. I'm so miserable inside. I can't deal with this reality.\"\n\nMonica had been like a godmother in the fairy tales — someone to fill the void in the absence of a mother's love.\n\n—\n\n\"LeShon, I love you. … You showed me how to love.You showed me how to be a woman.\"\n\nLeShon looked beyond Paula's past. As if it had never occurred.\n\n—\n\n\"Michael, I'm so proud of you. And thank you for apologizing.\"\n\nMichael was her first love. She wanted a life with him; he wanted something else.\n\n—\n\n\"Meshia … you helped me when I was down, but I explained to you better than anybody how I feel.\"\n\nMeshia knew Paula's pain; she'd just been unable to stop it.\n\n—\n\nThese were the people Paula loved most. And to each one she had revealed part of herself, but never the whole. It was a select list from a life populated by characters: Her brutal father and her innocent victim; the judge who condemned her and the man who forgave her. There were friars and a bishop and a pope; jailers and journalists; people who were zealous to save her life and people eager to end it. There were too many to consider, really. And the sun would be up soon. She could wait no longer.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said in a recording that would soon become part of a police investigation. \"I must go now.\"\n\nHer coda finished, Paula stepped out of the car and into the shadows. She took a seat against a blighted tree. She felt the breeze in her hair. She felt the gun in her hand.\n\nShe was familiar with death. She'd seen it up close. She'd been condemned to it, resigned to it and reprieved from it. She had debated its merits and come to terms with it. Never had she stopped thinking of it.\n\nBut the question that would vex those she was leaving behind was maddeningly simple.\n\nWhy, after all she had endured and all she had survived, after all she had done and seemed capable of doing, had she chosen to die now?\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe garden spot in the woods — where her father grew vegetables and beat his daughters — was only an occasional venue of torture.\n\nMore often, for Paula Cooper, it happened at home.\n\nAs a child, Paula went to bed night after night next to her sister, listening to their parents argue, listening to her father make threats to come after them. Sometimes her mother would talk him out of it. Sometimes the man's wrath ebbed and they fell asleep. Sometimes they would be jarred awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, her father standing over them, ready to beat them.\n\nPaula believed there were other kinds of families out there. She watched the people on \"The Cosby Show,\" and they seemed to have such a nice family. But that was television. This was real. This was her family. And it looked as if there was no escaping it.\n\n—\n\nPaula was born in Chicago to Herman and Gloria Cooper on Aug. 25, 1969. Her sister, Rhonda, was three years older. Early on, the family lived in Michigan City, but by the time Paula was old enough for school they had moved to Gary.\n\nThe girls attended Bethune Grade School, a stone's throw from home. They went to nearby New Testament Baptist Church, where Paula sang in the choir and helped with the little children's Bible classes.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Gary's downward spiral from a midcentury boomtown was picking up speed. Manufacturing jobs were disappearing. White families were fleeing to the suburbs. Crime was rising. Like many black families still in the city, the Coopers were left in the wake of all this.\n\nGloria worked as a lab tech at a hospital. She had an assortment of health problems, none of them helped by the drugs and booze she added to the mixture.\n\n\"One day my mother be nice, the next day she be angry,\" Paula would tell Woman's Day, years later, when her story was national news. \"And the next day she be real strange-acting.\"\n\nHerman worked for U.S. Steel and worked construction, but his employment was sporadic. He had a girlfriend on the side and would be gone for long stretches. When he returned, chaos followed. Herman and Gloria were a volatile pair, drinking hard and arguing often, creating an atmosphere that was not just unstable, but dangerous.\n\nThe result, as Paula would say later, was that the girls had to \"fend for themselves.\" Sometimes, on evenings when Herman was gone and Gloria worked late, Paula took meals with the next-door neighbors, who allowed her to stick around and watch TV. Most of the time the girls had food and nice clothing. But, as Rhonda would say later, \"we hardly ever had any love.\"\n\nExcept from each other.\n\nIn the middle of all the darkness, Paula and Rhonda clung tightly to each other. They found moments to giggle together, play pranks together and share secrets.\n\nMore than just a sister, Rhonda became Paula's caregiver. Yet, through their early years, they were unaware of an important family secret: Rhonda was the child of a different father. It was a secret Gloria took great pains to hide, even though she allowed Rhonda's father, Ronald Williams, to visit occasionally. She said he was her uncle.\n\nBefore Herman came along, Ronald and Gloria were engaged. They broke it off, as Williams would later tell a courtroom, because he felt Gloria had a \"split personality.\" In short, he thought she was crazy.\n\nLiving with Herman Cooper didn't help.\n\nHerman beat everyone in the house. He beat Gloria in front of the girls. He beat the girls together. He beat them separately, sometimes in front of their mother. Sometimes Gloria seemed to egg on the violence.\n\n\"We did everything we was supposed to do, but it just wasn't never good enough for her,\" Paula told Woman's Day many years later. \"… She get mad at us and he'd beat us. 'Be a man,' she'd tell him. 'Take care of it,' she'd say. And he'd take care of it.\"\n\nThe girls grew up unable to remember a time before the abuse. When they were little, Paula would later say, Herman beat them \"for the things little kids do.\" When they were older, Rhonda remembered, he beat them for forgetting to take out the trash, for not doing the dishes and for skipping school.\n\nHerman employed an assortment of tools for punishment, whatever he could get his hands on — shoes, straps, sticks, a broom. Sometimes he used an electrical cord from an air conditioner.\n\n\"He'd triple it up and go to work,\" Paula would say later. \"It got to the point I was so used to it I didn't cry anymore.\"\n\nTo heighten the pain, Herman sometimes ordered the girls to remove their clothes before a beating. Questioned later, he denied that he ever abused the girls at all.\n\n—\n\nThis stark picture of Paula Cooper's childhood emerges from several sources; the courtroom testimony from Rhonda and her father; testimony from Dr. Frank Brogno, a clinical psychologist who discussed what he learned from examining Paula. Some of the glimpses into the darkness come from now-yellowed news clippings. Others come from anecdotes Paula shared with friends and loved ones and the few journalists she favored. Finally, there's the freshest source of insight into Paula's world — more than 100 personal letters she wrote to a treasured friend that were reviewed by IndyStar.\n\nTaken together, they amount to a catalog of horrors. Her father's beatings, Paula said, left her \"close to death so many times.\" With no apparent means of escape, she seemed to stop fearing death at all. \"I just cried,\" she wrote, \"until all my tears were gone away.\"\n\n—\n\nIn 1978, when Paula was 9, the tears were still flowing. Her parents separated, but it was often fuzzy as to when they were back together and when they were apart. Once, when Herman returned home to find the doors locked, he forced his way in. According to testimony Rhonda gave in court, Herman entered their home, beat up their mother and raped her in front of the two girls.\n\nThe incident seems to have been a tipping point. Not long after, Gloria began telling her daughters the world had nothing to offer them. Instead, she said, they'd all be better off going to heaven. On this point, Rhonda would say later, Gloria began pressuring her daughters. Eventually, the girls came to believe, like their mother, they had nothing to live for.\n\nGloria phoned Ronald Williams, Rhonda's father and steady friend. It was late. She'd been drinking and taking pills. She was crying. Herman had been giving her problems, she said, and things weren't good at work.\n\nShe was thinking of killing herself.\n\nWilliams had heard this kind of talk from Gloria before. Always, he had been able to console her, to talk her back from the precipice. He reminded her that she had Paula and Rhonda to think about. What would happen to them? His question made Gloria think. But only for an hour.\n\nShe called Williams back. Between her tears and her wailing, Gloria said: \"I finally found out what I'm going to do with the kids.\"\n\nWilliams was alarmed. He demanded to know what she meant.\n\n\"I'm going to take them with me,\" she replied. \"I'm going to let you speak to your daughter and Paula for the last time.\"\n\nThe girls took the phone in turns. They were crying, too. Rhonda said they were going to heaven with their mother.\n\n\"Don't do nothing drastic,\" Williams told them. \"Let me speak to your mother, OK.\"\n\nThe phone went dead.\n\nWilliams panicked. Gloria and the girls had recently moved. She hadn't shared their new address. He didn't know where to find them, how to stop her.\n\nHe called the operator and asked for his last call to be traced; it was no good. He called Gary police. Without an address, they could do nothing.\n\nThere was nothing anyone could do. Williams waited. For three weeks, he waited. He feared what had become of them.\n\nHad Gloria killed them all?\n\n—\n\nAfter she hung up the phone, Gloria decided not to act right away; she'd wait until morning. When she awoke, Gloria took the girls out to the car in the garage. She put them in the back seat and started the engine. The garage door remained closed.\n\nFrom there, accounts differ. Williams testified that a friend told him neighbors noticed something and called the fire department. Rhonda testified that, as the fumes gathered, the girls drifted off to sleep. They thought they were going to heaven; instead, they woke up in bed. How they got there isn't clear. Rhonda said Gloria had changed her mind. When the girls awoke, she said, their mother was coughing on the lawn.\n\nFrom then on, Williams tried to coax Gloria into letting him have the girls. Rhonda was his daughter, and he was fond of Paula, too. Gloria would have none of it.\n\n\"I'd rather see them both dead,\" she said.\n\n—\n\nThe girls survived their first brush with death. But Paula and her sister were being shaped in a world without hope. And now their mother had planted a seed: The ultimate escape was death.\n\nRhonda looked around at this nihilist world and began seeking a way out. Several times she tried to run. Soon, she began taking Paula with her. \"I couldn't take it no more in that house,\" she would say, \"and I didn't want her to, either.\"\n\nBy 1982, when both girls were teenagers, they made an unsuccessful attempt to run and were sent — together — to the Thelma Marshall Children's Home in Gary. Within a short time, they were returned to the Coopers. For Paula, it was the beginning of a cycle — of running and being returned home. For Rhonda, that cycle ended only when she learned Ronald Williams was her biological father. At her first opportunity, she left the Coopers to live with him.\n\nIf the move helped Rhonda, it had grievous consequences for Paula, then 13. Her sister had been the most stable person in her home. Now she was gone. Paula came to believe her parents blamed her for Rhonda's departure. Now that her father's anger had one less target, Paula's beatings grew more frequent and more brutal. Even as her parents divorced, Herman never quite left the picture. And his handiwork began to show.\n\nAt school, Paula revealed to an administrator a rash of injuries — a bruise on her thigh, a welt on her arm, a rug burn on her elbow.\n\nWhen a welfare caseworker visited the Cooper home, Herman and Gloria cursed at her. They blamed Paula's problems on interference from the courts, from the school psychologist and from the welfare department itself. When the caseworker recommended family counseling, Gloria said she'd rather go to jail.\n\nAt various times, Gloria and Herman seemed to vacillate between wanting Paula and considering her a curse. Paula began running away on her own. After one attempt, welfare officials wanted to send Paula home, but her mother objected. If Paula returned, Gloria vowed to leave.\n\nOn another occasion, when Rhonda made a rare visit to spend a weekend with Paula and her mother, arguments ensued and Williams returned for Rhonda. He couldn't find her there, but he found Paula. She was crying so loudly he heard her without going in. Gloria, who stood in front of the house fuming about Paula, simply said: \"I'm going to kill that bitch.\"\n\nPaula emerged and, seeing Williams, ran to him and jumped into his arms. He asked her if her mother would really hurt her.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWilliams told her to get in the car. Gloria charged out toward them and began to threaten Paula. \"I'm going to kill you and if I don't (Herman) will.\"\n\nWilliams considered it serious business to take Paula. He lived in Illinois and assumed it would be a crime to take a child across the state line without permission of the parents. He took her anyway. Gloria and other family members threatened to phone the police.\n\nAt his home, Williams asked Paula what she wanted to do. They talked about the logistics of her staying with him without her mother's permission. It would be impossible for her to go to school. Then there was the trouble Williams might face. With tears, Paula looked at Williams and said, \"It's best for me to go home … I don't want to get you in no trouble.\" Paula's respite lasted only a few hours.\n\nEven though he wasn't keeping Paula, Williams couldn't fathom returning her home. Instead, he just let her walk away. She was young, no more than 13, but Williams believed she was safer on the streets of Chicago than at home. Under scrutiny for making such a choice, Williams later told a courtroom he thought Paula was in danger there. \"I would rather see her in the street as a slut than for her mother to blow her brains out.\"\n\nFor several days, Paula survived on her own. Inevitably, she wound up back home.\n\n—\n\nBy 1983, when Paula turned 14, she stayed away from home as much as possible. She was smoking cigarettes and drinking. She smoked marijuana almost daily. Tall, but heavy, she took speed to lose weight. She tried cocaine. She skipped school routinely. She was sexually active. Years later, she would warn others against making similar choices. But for the moment, it was her life.\n\nAnd it was a rootless life. She spent six months at a children's home in Mishawaka and three months in a juvenile detention center. She was removed from one home after only six days after she threatened a staff member and another resident — with a knife.\n\nWith each new address, Paula changed schools. She attended four high schools without ever finishing the 10th grade. Her schoolwork, decent at first, nosedived. She called a teacher \"crazy,\" resulting in a suspension. She struggled to keep friends. She developed a reputation as a bully. All the while, Paula struggled to wake up in the mornings. When she was evaluated for the problem, a doctor at a local hospital asked if she ever thought of killing herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nFor that answer, she was sent to a mental hospital. Released four days later, she returned home.\n\n\"I told people I needed help and to talk, but all they did was move me from home to home,\" Paula would write a few years later. \"I didn't care about life or trouble or consequences at all.\"\n\n—\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of Paula's abuse came, ironically, after her father visited Gary police seeking advice on how to deal with a wayward child. Paula was 14, and Herman Cooper couldn't keep her reined in. Frustrated, he asked the police what he should do with her. It was a family matter, they said; he should do what he thought was right.\n\nFor Herman Cooper, that meant one thing: another beating. But for what he had in mind this time, he'd need some privacy. He took Paula to a woody patch near a spot where he kept a garden. Paula had been there before; so had Rhonda.\n\n\"If you scream where I take you,\" he told Paula, \"no one will hear you.\"\n\nSeveral times in her life, Paula thought her father was going to beat her to death. This was one of them. \"He just kept beating me and beating me,\" she would tell the clinical psychologist, for what seemed like half an hour. Instead of the cord or a broom or a stick, this time Herman beat her with his bare hands.\n\nWhen he was done, Herman put Paula in the car to take her home. But as they drove through the darkening streets of Gary, Paula knew she couldn't go back there. Not when the possibility of more punishment lay ahead in the Cooper house of horrors.\n\nAs Herman pulled the car up to the house, Paula jumped out and took off running into the night. Running and screaming. Herman gave chase, but porch lights began to click on. Up and down the street, neighbors stepped out to investigate the commotion. The neighbors had seen this show before; it never seemed to end. This time, though, Herman retreated.\n\nPaula ran until she wound up where the night had begun — at the police station. She told officers there about the beating, told them she couldn't go home. At least not while Herman was around. The state pulled her away from the Coopers. It isn't clear from the record where she was placed. But soon, she was sent back home.\n\n—\n\nIn the summer of 1984, when Paula turned 15, she felt as lonely as ever.\n\nAdrift, Paula briefly took up with a guy she hoped might offer her a haven. Later, she would tell others he was a rough character who dealt drugs and treated her poorly. The one thing he did for Paula was leave her pregnant.\n\nMany teenage girls would consider pregnancy a tragedy; Paula saw it as a blessing. She had almost forgotten how to care about anyone. She wanted a family, wanted someone to belong to. The child growing inside her represented someone she could love, someone who would love her in return.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nGloria had been dead set against the pregnancy; she wanted Paula to end it. Paula refused and ran off — perhaps to seek help from a woman she knew in Chicago. Her mother tracked her down and, as Paula would write years later in a letter and tell friends, forced her to have an abortion.\n\nPaula was several months into the pregnancy; the procedure nearly killed her. \"She took something that would have completed my life,\" Paula would write later, \"and after that I felt I had no one.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nRuth Pelke was gentle, an old woman with silvery hair and horn-rimmed glasses. As her stepson Robert and his wife pleaded for her to leave Gary, she listened.\n\nRobert pledged to do everything necessary to make her house ready for sale — the legal stuff, the touch-up jobs, whatever. She listened as they talked to her about how dangerous her neighborhood had become.\n\nBut Ruth didn't really need reminding. Her Glen Park neighborhood was still one of the better places to live in Gary, although that wasn't saying much, given the city's downward lurch. There were abandoned houses now. There were burglaries. Her own home had been hit five times in recent years, including when her husband, Oscar, was still alive. Now, at 78, she was widowed and alone, and things were only getting worse. But Ruth had been in Glen Park for 41 years; it was home. She still had some good neighbors. Just as important, she had a mission.\n\nFor decades, she'd opened her home and heart to the neighborhood children. She'd taught them the Bible using felt cutouts of Bible characters that she stuck to a flannel board. She'd given the kids candy when they memorized Scripture. She'd driven them to church. She believed these were children who needed hope, and they could find it in Jesus. No, she finally said that night after her stepson's plea — she wouldn't be leaving the home in her neighborhood.\n\n\"I'll stay here until I go there,\" she said.\n\nRuth Pelke was pointing a finger to heaven.\n\n—\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, May 14, 1985, Ruth's doorbell rang.\n\nShe answered it and found three teenage girls standing on her porch. She didn't recognize them, but she opened her door. One of the girls said, \"My auntie would like to know about Bible classes. When do y'all hold them?\"\n\nRuth wasn't up to teaching anymore, but she wanted to help the girls. \"Come back on Saturday,\" she said. And closed the door.\n\n—\n\nThe girls — Karen Corder, Denise Thomas and Paula Cooper — walked back across the alley. Sitting on a porch, April Beverly was waiting.\n\nThe foursome — all ninth- and 10th-graders at Lew Wallace High School — left school at lunchtime that afternoon with no intention of going back. The girls walked the 10 blocks or so to an arcade near 45th and Broadway where they spent what little money they had on games and candy. When their money was gone, they headed back to the house where April was staying with her sister.\n\nThey were a ragtag bunch.\n\nAt 16, Karen Corder — known to her friends as \"Pooky\" — was the oldest. More than two years earlier, she'd given birth to a baby boy whom she'd delivered in a toilet. She'd managed to keep the pregnancy secret from her parents until the child was born, according to court records.\n\nAt 15, April Beverly was seven months pregnant. She was part of a divided family with 11 children, and she bounced between two homes, her father's and her sister's. Her mother was dead, her father had remarried. On occasion, April benefited from the kindness of the old lady across the alley. She'd listened to Ruth Pelke's Bible lessons. And the old woman had brought food over to April and her siblings when she was concerned they might be hungry.\n\nAt 14, Denise Thomas was the youngest of the four and the smallest. The others were mature young women — at different places on the spectrum of teen motherhood. Denise still looked very much like a little girl. In the context of this group, some would later describe her as a tag-along.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Paula Cooper. At 15, she was only months removed from an unwanted abortion that had nearly killed her. She was tall, somewhat heavy and had the bearing of a girl beyond her years. She would be described as the \"prime mover\" of the quartet — the ringleader. But it was a label she'd never cop to.\n\n—\n\nTo date, the sum total of their illicit behavior was strictly small-time. Karen had tried her hand at shoplifting. Paula, Karen and April had pulled off a burglary a few days before that netted them $90. Mostly, the girls were truants. And on this Tuesday afternoon away from school, their immediate priority was to raise some money so they could go back to the arcade.\n\nTheir first attempt was a harebrained scheme April cooked up to get some cash from a woman up the street. All four girls had gone to the woman's door. April introduced Denise, the small one, as her daughter. April claimed the woman's husband had taken $20 from Denise and they'd come to collect it. For added zest, April threw in this detail: The woman's husband had been naked when he stepped into the street to take Denise's money.\n\nThe woman didn't go for it.\n\nAfter that failure, April turned her focus to Ruth Pelke. She seemed to recall the lady keeping a jar of $2 bills. She thought the woman might even have some jewelry. The question was how to get to it all.\n\nAs they sat on the porch at her sister's house, April asked Paula to come inside — she might know where there was a gun. For the girls, a gun crime would be a considerable step up the criminal ladder. But the gun wasn't where April thought it was; she couldn't find it. Then it occurred to April: Something else might do.\n\n\"I have a knife you could scare the lady with,\" she said.\n\nSoon, April produced a 12-inch butcher knife. It was sharp and had a curving blade that graduated to a fine point. It was a cooking tool, but also a potentially lethal instrument. Paula took the knife and hid it in her light jacket. Out on the porch, she and April explained to the other girls: This was their new weapon of choice. And Karen came up with another approach to getting inside the old lady's home: They would ask her to write down the time and place where the Bible classes would be.\n\nIn all this planning, Paula and the other girls would forever swear, the subject of killing the old woman never came up. The most they would admit, according to Corder, was that they'd knock out the woman and rob her. Still, the reality of what they were planning — to con their way into her house, pull a knife and take the old woman's valuables — was fraught with danger.\n\nAs their scheme unfolded, April stayed back again, resting on her sister's porch; she didn't want the old woman to recognize her. Karen, Paula and Denise crossed the alley.\n\nThey rang the bell, and soon Ruth Pelke appeared at the door. This time, when she answered, Karen said: \"My auntie wants to know where the Bible classes are held at. Could you write it down for me?\"\n\nRuth said she no longer taught the classes, but she knew of a lady. \"I'll look up her telephone number for you.\" She invited the girls to come in. And she turned to walk to the desk on the far side of the room.\n\n—\n\nRuth Pelke looked for all the world like the kindly grandmother drawn up in children's books. She was also a woman whose Christian faith was essential to who she was. She went to church on Wednesday nights and twice on Sundays. She visited church members who were too old or too sick to get out. She sang in the choir. She hosted missionaries in her home on their trips back from foreign lands. She took her own missionary journeys, going deeper into the heart of Gary to share her faith with children.\n\nWhat followed — recorded in statements to police, testified to in court, reported in newspaper accounts and, in brief instances, described in letters Paula would write years later — was a scene that would shock Northwest Indiana and the rest of the state.\n\nAs Ruth Pelke crossed her living room to the desk where she kept phone numbers, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck.\n\nPaula had put her jacket on the couch and run up on Ruth, grabbing her from behind. For a moment, the teenager and the old woman struggled. Ruth still tended a garden and did a little work outside the house to keep fit, but she was in no shape for a chunky 15-year-old girl who now had her in a headlock.\n\nPaula threw Ruth to the floor.\n\nOn a table nearby sat an item some would describe as a vase but others likened more to a triangular snow globe. One of the girls picked it up and hit Ruth Pelke over the head. Prosecutors would allege it was Denise Thomas; Paula took the blame.\n\nPaula demanded to know where Ruth kept her valuables. She threatened to cut her with the knife. \"Give me the money, bitch,\" she said.\n\nRuth looked up and said simply: \"You aren't going to kill me.\" She began hollering for help. Paula's anger rose now. Then she looked at Ruth's head. Blood was streaming from the place where she'd been hit with the vase. Paula saw the blood and reacted in a way she would struggle to explain for the rest of her life.\n\nTo police investigators, she would say she entered \"a blackout stage.\"\n\nTo a judge, she would say, \"Something clicked in on me.\"\n\nTo a psychologist, she said the sight of the blood altered her perception of whom she was attacking: \"I saw somebody else inside of that body.\"\n\nSeveral friends and supporters who heard similar explanations from Paula concluded that, in this moment, Paula no longer saw the meek and mild Bible teacher in front of her. They believed Paula saw the woman who watched her suffer so many beatings and did nothing to stop them, the woman who took away the baby she'd wanted to love. They were convinced that, in the defenseless woman pinned to the floor, Paula saw her mother.\n\nWhatever she saw, Paula reached for the knife. She grabbed it by the handle and began slashing. She sliced open the old woman's cheek. She stabbed at her head, without deep penetration. Ruth fell back, flat on the floor. And Paula went to work, cutting her arms and legs.\n\nThe other girls stood by in disbelief.\n\nKaren Corder, the oldest, told Paula to stop.\n\nDenise Thomas, the youngest, cried and screamed for Paula to quit. Later, she would claim she yelled, \"I'm getting out of here,\" only to be met with a withering threat from Paula: \"Leave and you're dead.\"\n\nPaula's barrage was relentless. She stabbed the old woman in the belly and, finally, thrust the blade deep into the side of Ruth's chest. With that, Paula stopped; she pulled back from the carnage.\n\n\"I can't take it no more,\" she said.\n\nPaula looked at Denise; she told her to come hold the knife. But Denise refused. She looked at Karen, communicating the same message. Karen knelt beside the wounded woman. The blade remained lodged in her chest. And Karen held it in place.\n\nApril Beverly, who concocted the robbery scheme, initially held back. After the others went inside, she had come up to Ruth's porch and acted as lookout. Now she entered the house. The old woman was lying on her back, her dress covered in blood, her arms and legs still moving. Karen, she noticed, held the knife as it protruded from the woman's side. To April, it appeared that Karen wasn't just holding it: She was wiggling the knife back and forth. Out of some morbid curiosity, she would tell police later, Karen pushed the blade farther into the hole to see how deep it would go. At one point, she concluded, \"The bitch won't die.\"\n\nKaren estimated she held the knife in Ruth Pelke's side for upwards of 15 minutes; Paula thought it closer to 30.\n\nRuth Pelke moaned through most of this. The old woman's torn and tortured face was too much for the girls to bear. One of them went to the bathroom and got a towel to cover Ruth's face — and try to smother the last breaths of life from her. Paula and Denise said it was Karen; Karen said it was Paula.\n\nIn her dying moments, Ruth Pelke managed to share a few last words. Denise heard her saying the Lord's Prayer.\n\n\"Our Father, which art in heaven …\"\n\nPaula had stalked in and out of the room, and the last words she heard from Ruth were something else. Words that would haunt her the rest of her life.\n\n\"If you kill me,\" she heard Ruth say, \"you will be sorry.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula and Denise began tearing the house apart, rifling through drawers, ripping items off shelves and upending furniture.\n\nFor Paula, it was a mad search for some reward for the awful business she'd just concluded. There had to be some money somewhere. Maybe some jewelry. But as she continued her desperate search, a nervousness began to grow inside her. Whether it was regret for the killing or the chilling final words of her victim, she felt uneasy. And she didn't like it. As they were going through the upstairs rooms, Paula tried to pull herself away. But the only place to go was back downstairs, where the source of her angst lay dead on the floor. She resumed the treasure hunt and soon managed to turn up some cash — all of $10. She came across a key and thought it might start the old woman's Plymouth in the garage. She ran out to give it a try. Nothing.\n\nApril joined in the search and quickly turned up another key. This time when Paula tried it, the engine stirred to life. April went inside to fetch the other girls.\n\nBy then, Karen and Denise were alone with Ruth Pelke's body. Karen had watched the rise and fall of the old woman's chest until it grew shallower. Finally, it stopped. Maybe April sensed some new panic; she sternly warned the other girls: \"If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThe girls had spent roughly an hour in the old woman's house. They hadn't found a jar of $2 bills. They hadn't found a trove of jewelry. But it was time to go. Someone might come looking. Before they could leave, Karen grabbed one last item.\n\nShe knelt down again beside Ruth. The butcher knife was planted firmly in the left side of her chest, just below her breast. Karen grabbed the handle. She pulled it out. As they headed out to the car, Karen carried the knife at her side. She climbed into the back of the car and dropped it to the floor. The blade was still coated in blood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper was 15. She was too young to drive. But with her three accomplices as passengers, she managed to steer Ruth's car out of the neighborhood and onto 45th Avenue. They were just down the street from Lew Wallace High School. School was out now and, almost immediately, they saw a classmate walking along the street. Almost reflexively, they waved to Beverly Byndum. And Beverly waved back.\n\nThis was the paradox they now faced. They were teenagers in possession of a car, the apex of adolescence. Yet they had acquired it in the most horrific way imaginable. Years later, Paula would say things just \"got out of control.\" But here she was — a killer. Now that the deed was done, now that they had a few bucks, Paula and the others seemed in no mood to enjoy it.\n\nBefore they arrived at the video arcade, Karen asked Paula to let her out of the car; she wanted to go back to April's house. Paula let her go, but not before asking her to perform a little task: Go back to the old lady's house and get the jacket Paula had left inside.\n\nNext, Denise said she wanted to go home. She asked Paula to let her out at a convenience store and she would make her way from there.\n\nWhen Paula and April pulled up to Candyland Arcade, they were alone. For a few minutes, they just sat there, talking about what they'd done. April hadn't witnessed everything that went on inside the house. It's not clear how many of the missing details Paula shared.\n\nPaula said she needed to use the restroom, and she ventured into the arcade. When she returned, five girls from school were standing around the car. One of them was Beverly Byndum, whom they had passed on the street. Her sister, Latesha, asked where they had come by the car. Paula said it was her sister's.\n\nWithin minutes, Karen walked up to the arcade out of breath, as if she had been running to catch up with the crew. Wherever she had been, she hadn't stayed long. Paula pulled her aside and asked if she'd gone back to the house, if she'd picked up the jacket. No, Karen replied. It was probably the last place on Earth she wanted to go. And she didn't hang around long enough to talk further about it. In a few minutes, she caught a bus for home.\n\nWhether Paula remembered it or not, she had left more than her jacket in the house. Inside one of its pockets was a newly filled prescription for birth control pills — her pills. She had picked them up earlier that morning before school. It was just one of the clues she had left for investigators to find.\n\nPaula and April looked around at the girls and asked if anyone wanted a ride home. Eagerly, their friends piled into the Plymouth. Latesha Byndum was among those who jumped into the back. As she did, she felt her foot brush across something on the floor. She reached down to pick it up. It was a knife. And there was blood on it. There was also blood on her shoe. Latesha looked at Paula and April in the front seat and asked, \"What you all do? Just kill somebody?\"\n\nThe girls looked back at Latesha.\n\nNo, they replied.\n\nAnd, in a response that would reverberate across the community, Paula and April laughed.\n\n—\n\nPaula and April dropped off their passengers at various addresses around Gary. But details about where and how they spent their next two days are choppy and imprecise.\n\nProsecutors would characterize their time in the car as a joy ride. But from this point on, Paula and April seemed to have a different sense of what to do next.\n\nApril wanted to go to a park in Hammond; she wanted to see her brother Tony; she wanted to see her boyfriend. When she found $40 in Ruth Pelke's glove box, she wanted to spend it. When they picked up April's boyfriend and he brought some alcohol, she drank it.\n\nPaula wanted to go to a girl's home where she had lived for a time; she wanted to pick up some friends there. But she quickly decided she and April needed some time to focus on what to do next. When April found the money, Paula thought they should save it for gas. While April got drunk, Paula wanted nothing to drink. She was too nervous.\n\nMost symbolic of their division, perhaps, is what happened to the money from Ruth's glove box. The girls wrestled over it, and one of the $20 bills was torn. Paula gave up the fight. April could keep the money and do with it what she wanted.\n\n—\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day after the crime, Robert Pelke phoned Ruth's house to check up on her. She didn't pick up the phone, and he decided to check on her in person. Just three days before, he and a large portion of the extended Pelke family had taken Ruth out for a Mother's Day dinner. Just two days earlier, Robert and his wife had pushed Ruth to think about selling her house and leaving Gary. Robert rang the doorbell, with no idea how prescient that conversation had been.\n\nThere was no answer, so Robert opened the mail slot on the door and called inside. There was only silence. But through the mail slot, something caught Robert's eye: The dining room was torn apart. He went to fetch a spare key Ruth kept hidden outside. Looking around the place, he noticed Ruth's car was missing from the garage, and he assumed Ruth must be gone, too.\n\nHe found the key, unlocked the door and stepped into the house. The place appeared to have been ransacked. Pictures that had adorned the walls were now scattered about the floor. Cushions from the couch had been pulled up and cast about. And then his eyes turned to the dining room floor.\n\nThe cloaked figure of a woman lay there motionless. Her dress was caked in blood. Her arms were slashed. A towel masked her face.\n\nRobert knelt down next to her. He pulled the towel away and called her name. Still, there was no movement. He touched her, and the body was cold. He knew she was dead.\n\nRobert got up and went for the phone. In an age when every phone was a landline, Ruth's had been ripped from its place on the wall. He stepped outside and began going door to door, looking for someone who would let him use their phone. But at house after house, he found nobody. Finally, Robert looked farther up the street and saw a man and a woman getting out of a car. He approached them and asked them to call the police.\n\nHis stepmother had been murdered.\n\n—\n\nRobert's son, Bill Pelke, arrived home just after 3 o'clock from his shift at Bethlehem Steel and soon received a phone call. It was one of his uncles. Nana, he said, was dead.\n\nNana was the term of endearment everyone in the family used for Ruth. Bill had grown up listening to her Bible stories. He'd loved her flannel board tales of the three men in the fiery furnace, of Noah and the ark and his favorite — Joseph and the coat of many colors.\n\nEven as a 37-year-old man, he still loved to go to Nana's house for the holidays, to warm himself beside her fireplace and congregate there with the rest of the family. His grandfather had passed almost two years before, but Nana was still a magnet. She could still bring the family together. And now, suddenly, she was gone.\n\nAt such moments of shock, the brain's processor goes into hyperdrive. And some key facts rushed through Bill's head: Nana had been 78; she was the oldest Pelke; she'd had a good life; it must have been her time. But that instant of comfort evaporated quickly. He sensed something else in his uncle's voice that was borne out in his next words: There'd been a break-in at Nana's house. He didn't know if there was a connection.\n\nBill hung up and turned on the television, wondering if there might be some news about it. Sure enough, his father appeared on camera. He was saying something about it being a terrible murder. For Bill, everything else was a blur; he had to go. He had to be with his family.\n\nAs it turned out, Ruth Pelke had been dead for a full day.\n\n—\n\nBy that spring of 1985, crime was a painful reality in Gary. Its murder rate was among the highest in the country. It was on its way to becoming the murder capital of the United States.\n\nGary was a city in decline; poverty was growing like a cancer. But the violence was being spread through an influx of gangs with names such as The Family and the Black Gangster Disciples.\n\nYet as accustomed to crime as the city had become, the murder of Ruth Pelke shocked and angered people in a whole new way. There was the innocence of Ruth herself — the elderly Bible teacher. As one observer put it, she was a grandma to the neighborhood. The killing's effect also might have been amplified because it happened in Glen Park, which a prosecutor later described as a \"last bastion\" of the white population in a city from which white residents had disappeared.\n\nOn the day after the discovery of Ruth's body, The Post-Tribune in Gary devoted two front-page columns to the story: \"Bible teacher, 77, murdered in her home.\" It had her age wrong, but the dominant image on the page was a picture of Ruth — silver-haired and smiling behind her horn-rimmed glasses from another era.\n\nThe newspaper reported that neighborhood children \"were visibly upset and shaken by the murder.\" They spoke of Pelke as \"meek and mild,\" serving cookies during summer Bible classes and giving out boxes of candy to the children who memorized Scripture.\n\nAs for who might be responsible, the initial story carried some important nuggets: Police were searching for a 15-year-old girl who'd been seen driving Pelke's blue Plymouth. They weren't releasing her name, but the girl was a student at Lew Wallace High and lived in Gary's Marshalltown neighborhood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper lived in Marshalltown.\n\nAs they combed through Ruth's house, police found the jacket with the prescription in the pocket. Eyewitnesses had seen Paula and the other girls in a car that matched the description of Ruth's missing Plymouth. And on the day Ruth's body was discovered, Gloria Cooper phoned police to report her 15-year-old daughter missing; she'd been missing since the day before.\n\nThe ink was barely dry on the newspaper stories when Karen Corder, walking around school on Thursday, two days after the crime, began looking for someone on whom she could unload her conscience. She had opted out of the joy ride and gone home and had a couple of restless nights' sleep. She found a gym teacher who'd been nice to her and said they needed to talk; she'd witnessed a murder. Soon, police were at the school. They took Karen and Denise into custody. And Karen was telling her story about the crime.\n\nIn the two days since the killing, Paula and April — with April's brother, Tony — had driven aimlessly from Gary to Hammond and to various parts of Chicago's South Side. They'd had no real sense of direction.\n\nTony pressed on in Ruth's Plymouth until the gas needle dropped well below empty. Then he pushed it some more. Finally, the car died. Their money gone, they found a phone and called April's sister. Thursday night, with the police dragnet closing around them, she took the girls to see the Gary police.\n\n—\n\nDetective William Kennedy Jr. had been looking for Paula Cooper and April Beverly for the better part of two days. When his phone rang around midnight, the news was good: They'd turned themselves in.\n\nIn addition to being a cop, Kennedy worked security at Lew Wallace High School. He'd seen Paula Cooper walking the halls. He never knew her name, but they'd exchanged hellos. Now, he was tidying up the loose ends of a case for murder against her.\n\nWhen he arrived at the station, Paula's parents were waiting. Kennedy asked Herman and Gloria Cooper if Paula could make a formal statement about the crime. Herman, speaking for everyone, declined. They were interested in talking to a lawyer, and he seemed annoyed at the article in the morning paper, which he felt pointed a finger at Paula even if it didn't name her.\n\nThe Coopers met briefly with Paula, then returned to the waiting room. Soon, Rhonda arrived at the station. She'd read the papers. She knew Paula was in jail. And she was upset. She wanted to see her sister.\n\nGloria was OK with that but urged her to persuade Paula to talk about what she'd done. When the police wouldn't let Rhonda see her sister without a parent, Gloria agreed to go with Rhonda.\n\nAfter so many years of turmoil and strife, Gloria and her two daughters were together again — for a moment alone in a police interrogation room. What they said isn't clear. But when Kennedy, the detective, rejoined them, Gloria gave Paula a nudge.\n\n\"Say something,\" she said.\n\nPaula hesitated. She said she didn't want anyone looking at her. So Kennedy turned 45 degrees and looked at a wall. Paula began to speak. She kept speaking for 15 minutes. She laid out the essential elements of Ruth Pelke's murder, described the girls' desire for money and a car, described how they came up with the Bible class as their way in. She described how she got the knife and stabbed the old woman more times than she could remember. She talked about the aftermath, when they took the car and gave rides to their friends. At one point, according to the account the detective would later make from his \"mental notes,\" Gloria Cooper asked Paula in front of the detective: Were you and Karen basically responsible for the lady's death?\n\nPaula's answer: \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWhen Paula was done, Kennedy left the room. Her mother and her sister left, too. As Paula stood alone in the interrogation room, April Beverly was giving a statement in a room nearby. When Kennedy returned to Paula, she was newly animated. She began unloading a rapid-fire addendum to her confession to the detective.\n\n\"April is lying. She's lying on me, so I'm going to tell you where the murder weapon is. It's at the McDonald's in Hammond on Calumet Avenue, next to the police station. Her brother threw it out the car right by the drive-thru window side. It was by a tree right there.\"\n\nFor Paula, this was the start of one of the great grievances of her life — her claim that the other girls lied. A few details aside, their stories largely matched up. But in the discrepancies, Paula saw injustice. And correcting the narrative to fit her exact version of the truth would become an obsession.\n\nThe legal ramifications of what she'd shared, in her two statements, were that Paula had essentially confessed to the key elements of the murder. She had gift-wrapped a case for the authorities. She also had put herself in the cross hairs of a zealous prosecutor. She had no idea just how precarious her own life had become.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nJack Crawford — with a swooping, blow-dried haircut that gave him an appearance not unlike the televangelists of the era — came before a bank of reporters with material certain to make a splash.\n\nA rising star in Indiana's Democratic Party, Crawford had swept into the Lake County prosecutor's job years before, having pledged to get tough on crime. Since then, he had pursued the death penalty more than any other prosecutor in the state. In the first five months of 1985, he'd already won four death penalty convictions.\n\nNow, flanked by a pair of cops, Crawford came before the gathered media with an announcement sure to make headlines: For the first time in Lake County, his office was charging four girls with murder. He would seek the death penalty against the oldest — 16-year-old Karen Corder — and if the other girls were moved out of juvenile court, he'd likely seek death for them, too.\n\n\"I've been a prosecutor for seven years,\" Crawford told the media, \"and we've never had a case like this before.\"\n\nAs zealous as he was, Crawford privately acknowledged that same day that his chance for death sentences had already taken a big hit. That's because the clerk's office announced that the judge handling the Ruth Pelke cases was Superior Court Judge James C. Kimbrough Jr.\n\nKimbrough was a former public defender and NAACP lawyer who'd grown up in the civil rights heartland of Selma, Ala. More important than all of that, everyone around the courts — from prosecutors and public defenders to reporters and clerks — knew Kimbrough hated the death penalty. Hated it for its unfairness. Hated it for its inability to deter crime. And in a county where other judges had shown themselves willing to brandish the ultimate weapon, Kimbrough hadn't sent anyone to the electric chair during 12 years on the bench. Only once had he come close: Kimbrough sentenced a man to death who had been convicted of a double murder. Soon, though, the judge reversed himself and gave the man a new trial. Eventually, he was set free.\n\nSo, at word of Kimbrough's assignment, Jack Crawford and his team murmured that the path to a death sentence was a steep one. \"We certainly thought we had an uphill climb,\" he would say later.\n\n—\n\nIn the Lake County Juvenile Detention Center, Paula Cooper's life behind bars was getting off to a rough start.\n\nShe was no stranger to jail, having spent three months in the same detention center two years earlier after she ran away from home. She was a bit weepy then, even tender, the guards remembered. But this 15-year-old version of Paula Cooper was angrier, explosive and cocky. She acted as if she owned the place. She was a handful.\n\nTwo weeks after the crime, Paula took a seat next to two of her friends in the jail during \"quiet hour.\" Soon they grew noisy. A guard told them to shut up and disperse; Paula refused. The guard ordered her back to her cell. But as she stepped into the hall, Paula struck the guard across the bridge of the nose. She fought until reinforcements arrived to pull Paula off. As they were dragging her away, Paula issued a warning: They'd better transfer the guard or she would get a knife and come after her.\n\nThe dust-up prompted a transfer for the girls — from the juvenile center to the Lake County Jail. It also made the local papers, which didn't help the cause of saving their lives.\n\nBy the end of July 1985, the cases against all four girls were formally moved to adult court. Crawford, after sifting through the ample evidence, made his purpose clear: He would seek the death penalty against all four.\n\nThe case had pricked the public's consciousness of crime at a new level.\n\nCrawford's decision made news on the Chicago television stations; it made headlines across Indiana. The public defender assigned to represent Paula, Kevin Relphorde, was incredulous. \"They must be the youngest females in the country facing the death penalty,\" he told reporters.\n\nBy then, Paula and Karen, sharing a cell in the Lake County Jail, had been locked up two months. They began telling jail staff they were considering suicide. On cards they were given to report health problems, they wrote things such as \"Give me the electric chair\" and \"Give me that shock. I want to die.\"\n\nAs a precaution, jail officers took their personal belongings and stripped them to their underwear; they were on suicide watch.\n\nPaula and Karen responded by banging on the bars and making noise. To calm them, a nurse broke out the oral sedatives. Karen took hers; Paula refused. The guards teamed up to hold down Paula so the nurse could give her a shot. But as they tried to restrain her, Paula jumped up and hit one guard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Oh you tough, huh?\" the guard replied. \"You stabbed an old lady.\" It was less than professional, but it was a gut reaction.\n\n\"Yeah, I stabbed an old lady,\" Paula replied. \"And I'd stab that bitch again. I'd stab your fucking grandmother.\"\n\nThe jail incidents were part of a pattern to be repeated in years to come. Paula didn't respond well to restraints; she bucked authority. In such instances, she could be aggressive and hostile. A psychologist noted her tendencies and something else plain to see: Battered and badgered as a girl, she was now mistrustful and suspicious.\n\nSoon, Paula's interaction with the jail staff would grow more complicated. By August 1985, about the time she turned 16, Paula began receiving a series of private visitors. Two were male corrections officers. Another was a male recreational therapist. They weren't visiting just because of their jobs.\n\nThey were coming for sex.\n\n—\n\nOutside the jail, the stories about the angry young prisoners seemed only to add to the public's contempt. And as the details of their crime emerged, they were already easy to hate. Especially the girl who had wielded the knife — Paula Cooper.\n\nPaula had not just killed Ruth Pelke; she had stabbed her 33 times, according to the coroner. Some of the cuts on her arms looked like saw marks, as if the knife had been pulled back and forth. In other instances, the 12-inch knife had been wielded with such ferocity that the tip of the blade went through Ruth's body, pierced the carpet on which she lay and chipped the wood flooring beneath. Worst of all, it appeared Ruth Pelke survived the torturous assault for more than 30 minutes. The Post-Tribune called it \"possibly the most brutal killing in Gary history.\"\n\nIf all that wasn't bad enough, two of the girls had bragged about the killing at school. As defendants go, they were about as unsympathetic as they come. With guilt hardly in doubt, letters began appearing in the Gary newspaper debating the punishment. Some asked for mercy; others wanted severe justice. One letter directed at Paula appeared under the headline, \"She should pay.\"\n\nAll of it left Kevin Relphorde, Paula's lawyer, searching for a viable strategy to save Paula's life. The evidence was overwhelming, and the prosecutor was determined, which made a plea deal unimaginable. Paula's childhood had been bad, but it didn't seem to add up to an insanity plea. Her youth and relatively clean prior record were assets, but they looked meager compared to the brutality of the crime. Then there was the jury. Any panel drawn from across Lake County would be mostly white. And Paula was a black teenager who had killed an old white woman. All of it added up to a grim outlook.\n\nAs best as Relphorde could figure, the only thing Paula had going for her was the judge. Relphorde knew of Kimbrough's opposition to the death penalty. Ultimately, he suggested to Paula a stomach-churning strategy: Plead guilty.\n\nRelphorde was a part-time public defender who'd never handled a death penalty case. But he figured Paula's chances were better in the hands of a liberal judge than with 12 angry jurors.\n\nAs risky as it sounded, Relphorde wasn't the only person who sized things up the same way. David Olson, who was Karen Corder's attorney, came to a similar conclusion. He'd had a nightmare about Karen, he told the Post-Tribune in March 1986, and awoke fearful of \"losing her.\" His fears were amplified when he attended the trial of Denise Thomas, the first suspect to answer for the death of Ruth Pelke.\n\nJust before the case against Thomas went to trial, in November 1985, prosecutors withdrew the death penalty charge, concluding she'd been more of a bystander to the crime.\n\nBut that didn't stop the jurors from reacting strongly to the horrific details of Pelke's death. They quickly found Denise guilty. Olson didn't want to risk that with death on the line for his client. So in March, 10 months after the crime, Karen went before Kimbrough with a guilty plea. Her sentencing would follow two months later.\n\nHow well Paula understood the risks of her plea — and how much say she had in it — is now a matter of dispute. Relphorde said he met with Paula regularly to talk strategy and that the plea was ultimately her decision. Years later, Paula would recall only three brief meetings with her attorney, who she said assured her the judge opposed the death penalty and would be sympathetic to a black girl. If she pleaded guilty, she said she was told, she wouldn't get a death sentence.\n\nOn April 21, 1986, Paula appeared in court to plead guilty to murder.\n\nHerman Cooper came to the courtroom that day; so did Paula's sister, Rhonda. But Gloria Cooper, Paula's mother, was nowhere to be found. She had moved to Georgia and stopped answering the calls of Paula's attorney.\n\nWhen the hearing began, Kimbrough asked Paula more than once if she knew she could be sentenced to death. Each time, Paula answered yes. To the most important question — How do you plead? — she never hesitated: Guilty.\n\nFor the record, Paula retold the story of the crime — the scheme to get into the house; what she did to Ruth; how the girls took the car.\n\n\"We went to commit a robbery, you know,\" she told the judge.\n\nWas there any discussion in advance about what you'd do with Mrs. Pelke? he asked.\n\n\"No. It wasn't a discussion to go and kill anyone, you know.\"\n\nKimbrough accepted the plea. Paula's life was now in his hands. But she would have to wait months for an answer. Relphorde left convinced Paula had made her best play: \"We were basically throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court.\"\n\nPaula's strategy seemed to appear sound when, in May 1986, Kimbrough spared Karen Corder's life, giving her 60 years in prison. In fact, three of the girls had escaped with their lives. Denise Thomas, found guilty at trial, received a 35-year sentence. April Beverly, who conceived the robbery but waited outside during the killing, pleaded guilty in exchange for a 25-year prison term.\n\nOnly Paula's fate remained unresolved.\n\nLost in the news of Corder's reprieve, perhaps, was some language the judge used in reference to Paula. It seemed ominous. Kimbrough said it had been \"conceded by all that Paula Cooper was the leader of this group of four young ladies. That Paula Cooper was the dominant factor in the crime.\" He said Corder was \"operating under the substantial domination of Paula Cooper.\" Despite such words, the prevailing view in legal circles was that Kimbrough would spare Paula's life.\n\n—\n\nAs her judgment approached, there were hints that Paula Cooper's case was starting to resonate beyond Indiana. Jack Crawford's first clue came when his secretary stepped into his office with an unusual message: \"There's a man outside who says he's from the Vatican. He's dressed like a monk and wants to talk to you about Paula Cooper's case.\"\n\nCrawford took a look. Sure enough, in a brown tunic bound at the waist with a cord, there stood a Franciscan friar. He told Crawford he was from Rome. He offered a letter validating his credentials. And he brought a simple message: Pope John Paul II and the Vatican weren't pleased with Crawford's decision to seek the death penalty.\n\nCrawford was Roman Catholic. He'd gone to Notre Dame. He knew the church's opposition to the death penalty. But, as he explained to the friar, this was a legal decision, not a religious one. The friar left unsatisfied. He would not be the last Franciscan to stand with Paula.\n\nMore surprising than the friar's appearance was the visit Crawford received in June 1986 from Paula's attorney, Kevin Relphorde.\n\nIt was just weeks before Paula's sentencing, and Relphorde had few cards to play in Paula's defense. This time, though, it appeared he might have a game changer.\n\n\"You can't execute Paula Cooper,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, why is that, Kevin?\" Crawford asked.\n\n\"She's pregnant.\"\n\n—\n\nThe sex scandal at the Lake County Jail erupted in June 1986.\n\nFor months, corrections officers Vernard Rouster, 25, and Parmaley Rainge, 27, had been coming to see Paula for sex, officials discovered. So, too, had Michael Dean Lampley, a recreational therapist from a mental health center. Their encounters occurred even as a 40-year-old female corrections officer and a police patrolman were supposed to be maintaining security for the state's highest-profile murder suspect.\n\n—\n\nOne of the guards admitted the sex began when Paula was still a week shy of 16 — the age of consent in Indiana. That people working in the jail were having sex with a captive wasn't illegal in Indiana in 1986. After the revelation, the jail workers resigned their jobs and the therapist was fired, but no one was prosecuted. Supervisors on the jail floor were suspended — for 15 days.\n\nFor all of its tawdriness, the scandal had the potential to affect Paula's case. State law prohibited the execution of a pregnant woman; punishment would have to wait. And while a death penalty appeal was certain to outlast a pregnancy, the strange episode raised the possibility of a sentencing delay.\n\nKimbrough ordered a medical exam for Paula. Quickly, the matter was put to rest: She wasn't pregnant. But, in a sign of the times, public discussion about the scandal seemed to focus less on the culpability of the jailers than on the promiscuity of the 16-year-old girl in jail.\n\nJames McNew, a deputy in Crawford's office who prosecuted the case, told the Post-Tribune he suspected Paula Cooper tried to get pregnant to stir up sympathy and avoid death.\n\nHowever it came about, the sex scandal prompted a change in state law: It became a crime for jailers to have sex with their prisoners. Soon, though, the jailhouse sex scandal would become little more than a footnote before a judgment heard around the world.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nBill Pelke sat on the wrong side of the courtroom.\n\nHis grandmother was the murder victim. Unwittingly, Bill took a seat on the side of the murderer. He was unfamiliar with the trappings of the courtroom. And unlike some in the community — in his own family — Bill carried no blood lust into the chamber. He thought people who committed murder should die. And Paula Cooper had killed his beloved Nana. But he wasn't fuming about it.\n\nBill had stayed away from the previous court hearings, but decided this was one he shouldn't miss. It was July 11, 1986. And for Paula Cooper, it was judgment day.\n\nCourtroom 3 of Lake Superior Court was a small space. The gallery, oriented outside a circle where the business of the court was conducted, had seats for just 43 onlookers. This day, it was packed to overflowing. People stood, straining to hear, just outside the public entrance. Lawyers and other court personnel did the same just outside the doors normally used by the judge and juries. All wanted to know the fate of a 16-year-old girl who faced a potential death sentence.\n\nInto this cauldron, Paula Cooper entered under the escort of a jail matron. She didn't need to look around to see she had few friends in the room. Her sister and her grandfather were there, but neither of her parents was present. Her mother had moved to Georgia, her father to Tennessee. As Paula entered, the matron said something that made the young defendant smile. The gesture surprised Bill Pelke; it struck him as unbefitting for the moment. When this day is done, he thought to himself, she's not going to be smiling.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor James McNew began the proceedings by calling Bill's father to testify. Robert Pelke hadn't missed a hearing — for Paula or any of the other girls. He had been the family spokesman, and he wanted a death sentence for Paula. He described going to Ruth Pelke's home when she hadn't answered the phone, finding her home in disarray and her body on the floor. He described her bloody dress and the towel wrapped around her head. When the attorneys finished questioning him, Robert asked to read a statement to the court.\n\nThis, Robert Pelke said, was a crime that deserved the maximum sentence the law would allow. He quoted the Bible about submitting to authorities and God's vengeance and punishing evildoers. He said Paula gave Ruth no second chance, and he saw no reason to give Paula one.\n\n\"Paula reveled in her doings and enjoyed it,\" he said. He spoke of ridding society of those who would prey upon the innocent. \"This is a tragedy that should never have happened,\" he said, \"and a tragedy that family and friends will never forget.\"\n\nNext, one of the girls from Lew Wallace High School testified about seeing Paula and the others on their joy ride and about finding the bloody knife on the floor of the car.\n\nA crime lab technician discussed grisly photos from the scene — pictures of Ruth Pelke, of the knife-torn carpet and the gouge marks in the hardwood floor.\n\nThe prosecution introduced into evidence the autopsy report, which expressed the damage done by the 33 stab wounds. There was also an anatomical diagram noting the points where Ruth had been wounded — so many it looked like a star chart.\n\nJailers who had been attacked and threatened by Paula detailed her bad behavior; they recounted her admission about stabbing \"an old lady.\"\n\nEntering into evidence the grisly details of the crime and the accounts of Paula's callous behavior was part of the prosecution's effort to build a case that the only just punishment was death.\n\nIn Paula's defense, only three witnesses spoke.\n\nRhonda Cooper gave a picture of how she and Paula grew up terrorized in the home of Herman Cooper. She testified to the beatings, to their father's raping their mother in front of them, to their mother's suicide attempt and to their attempts to run away.\n\nRonald Williams, Rhonda's biological father, testified that he wanted to take Paula away from the misery, but her mother refused. He spoke of Gloria's threats against Paula and of the suicide attempt.\n\nDr. Frank Brogno, a Gary psychologist who examined Paula, described how Paula's abuse left her angry and confused, depressed and hostile. He said she was prone to confusion and bizarre thinking, even drifting into fantasies. Still, he said, Paula knew right from wrong. There was still hope for her, but also a real danger she could become a sociopath.\n\nMcNew, on cross-examination, ripped into the doctor. He pointed out how Brogno had testified in Karen Corder's case that Paula was the \"prime mover\" in the crime.\n\n—\n\nRelphorde made a plea for Paula's life, saying she had gone to Ruth Pelke's home to rob, not kill. He said the other girls were intensely involved in the crime and their lives had been spared. The death penalty, he said, was applied at the whim of prosecutors. He said Ruth Pelke, a woman of faith, wouldn't want Paula to die. In the end, he said, Paula was the handiwork of an abusive home and a system that failed her.\n\n\"I don't think Paula was born violent,\" he said. \"I think Paula was a product of what was done to her.\"\n\nMcNew, closing the prosecution's case, checked all the boxes needed for a death sentence: Paula wasn't crazy. She wasn't doing someone else's bidding. She'd struck the death blows. She had a criminal record, as far as a juvenile goes, for skipping school and running away from home. And Paula's abusive childhood? To use that for an excuse, McNew said, was to insult everyone who has endured similar treatment and found a way to overcome the horrors. Giving Paula the death penalty, McNew said, would have a sobering effect on others who might be considering crime. But McNew said there was one reason, above all, for a death sentence.\n\n\"I am not seeking a deterrence to crime when I ask the death penalty on Paula Cooper. I seek justice for the family of Ruth Pelke.\"\n\n—\n\nWith the attorneys done, Kimbrough asked Paula if she had anything to say. And Paula did not shrink from the moment.\n\nShe hadn't wanted a trial, Paula began; she only wanted to tell the truth. \"Now my family life, it hasn't really been good. … Nobody understand how I feel.\"\n\n\"This man,\" she said, pointing to the prosecutor, \"sit here and say he want to take my life. Is that right? I didn't go to Mrs. Pelke's house to kill her. It wasn't planned. I didn't go there to take somebody's life. It happened. It just happened. Something. It wasn't planned. We didn't sit up and say we was going to go and kill this innocent old lady. I didn't even know the lady. But everybody put the blame on me.\"\n\nShe said Jack Crawford had described her in the newspaper as the ringleader. \"I wasn't the ringleader. I didn't make those girls go,\" she said. \"They went on their own.\"\n\nLooking around at the people in the courtroom, Paula seemed disgusted. \"Well, where was all these people at right here when I needed somebody? Where was they at? They turned their backs on me and took me through all this. All I can say is now, look where I am now, facing a possible death sentence.\"\n\nShe pointed at the Pelke family and repeated her plea that killing wasn't her intention. \"I hope you all could find some happiness in your hearts to forgive me. And I know your mother was a Christian lady, and she is in heaven right now. I read my Bible. How do you think I feel? I can't sit here and tell you I understand how you feel because I don't.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"sorry\" would never be good enough.\n\nPaula looked to Judge Kimbrough. But, as Bill Dolan would report in the Post-Tribune the next day, the judge \"didn't return her gaze.\" \"I don't know what the decision is going to be today, or whenever you make your decision. I know justice must be done. And whatever the circumstances, or whatever your decision is, I will accept it, even if it is death.\" She acknowledged she couldn't change what happened: She hoped to get out one day and start life over, maybe even finish school.\n\n\"Will I have a chance?\" she asked. \"Will I get a chance?\"\n\nFor a couple of minutes, Paula rambled. She repeated that she hadn't forced the other girls to act; she felt it important everyone know she wasn't a gang member. Then she reined it back in for one final thought: \"I am sorry for what I did. And I know my involvement in this case is very deep. But all I can ask you is not to take my life. That is all I can ask you. That is all I can ask is to spare my life.\"\n\nSuddenly, a commotion broke out in the courtroom. There was shouting in the gallery. \"My grandbaby, my grandbaby.\"\n\nBill Pelke looked at the wailing man near him and saw the tears run down his cheeks; the visage burned into Bill's memory. He watched the man as the bailiff escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nIt was Paula's grandfather, making one final plea on Paula's behalf.\n\nNow it was up to the judge.\n\n—\n\nJudge James C. Kimbrough had been wading through the sordid details of Ruth Pelke's murder for more than a year. He'd parsed the depressing narrative, and people had speculated whether he had a death penalty in him, especially for a girl. Now they were about to get their answer.\n\nThere was no doubt about Paula Cooper's guilt. Kimbrough dispatched that with his first breath. The murder had been disturbing: Paula had inflicted the 33 stab wounds in the body of 78-year-old Ruth Pelke.\n\nThose were the strikes against her.\n\nBut the defendant had no prior criminal history, and she was 15 at the time of the crime.\n\nThose were factors to consider on her behalf.\n\nThe other requirements for the death penalty, Kimbrough said, didn't work in the defendant's favor. She acted of her own free will. She wasn't under the influence of drugs. Her mental problems didn't rise to the level of incompetence. But all those things, Kimbrough said, were legalities. Ultimately, he said, death penalty cases boil down to a \"political utterance.\"\n\n\"This case has received an unusual amount of publicity,\" Kimbrough said. \"There is worldwide interest in the outcome of these proceedings today. And the court is certainly aware of that interest.\"\n\nWhen he left law school in 1959, Kimbrough said, he had been \"totally against\" the death penalty — and most of the country shared the view.\n\nNearly 30 years later, he said, public sentiment had changed, perhaps because of the violent activities of people such as Paula Cooper. Now, the vast majority of the public favors the death penalty, Kimbrough said, Normally, he wrote out his sentences in advance. But this case had challenged him to the point he'd been unable to do so.\n\nKimbrough praised the deputy prosecutor for speaking \"eloquently\" — he said McNew brought the matters into focus \"better than all of the turmoil that I have been through in the last several months.\"\n\nHe criticized state law for being too general when it came to giving minors the death penalty. It left him unsure what to do on that fundamental question. \"I don't know what the right political answer to that question is.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough, in a moment of vulnerability judges don't always reveal, showed some insight into his restless mind. \"I don't believe I am ever going to be quite the same after these four cases. They have had a very profound effect on me. They have made me come to grips with the question of whether or not a judge can hold personal beliefs which are inconsistent at all with the law as they were sworn to uphold. And for those of you who have no appreciation of it, it is not a simple question. It is not a simple question for me.\"\n\nKimbrough interrupted his confessional to take issue with something Robert Pelke said: \"I do not believe the failure to impose the death penalty today would be unbiblical. … I don't profess to be an expert in religion. But I know the Bible has passages which are merciful, and do not demand or mandate an eye for an eye.\"\n\nReturning to his inner turmoil, Kimbrough said he'd concluded that a judge must decide a case based on facts, regardless of whether it satisfies him. \"I will tell you, very frankly now, on the record, that I do not believe in the death penalty.\"\n\nThis seemed to launch Kimbrough on a rant. \"Maybe in 20 years, after we have had our fill of executions, we will swing back the other way and think they are unconstitutional. Maybe.\"\n\nAt about this point, Jack Crawford, sitting at the prosecutor's table, was ready to give up hope for a death penalty. He turned to McNew, he remembered later, and whispered into his ear.\n\n\"He's not going to give it.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough directed his eyes to the girl awaiting his judgment.\n\n\"Stand up, Paula.\"\n\nShe had stabbed Ruth Pelke 33 times, he said. He was concerned about her background. She had been \"born into a household where your father abused you, and your mother either participated or allowed it to happen. And those seem to be explanations or some indication of why you may be this type of personality that you are.\"\n\n\"They are not excuses, however.\"\n\nHowever.\n\nThat word caught Crawford's attention. So did the fact that Kimbrough's shoulders seemed to slump, as if the weight of the moment was getting to the judge. Crawford leaned in and whispered again to McNew.\n\n\"I think he's going to give it. I think he's going to give it.\"\n\nKimbrough continued.\n\n\"You committed the act, and you must pay the penalty,\" Kimbrough said. Briefly, he trailed into some legalese about the charge. Then he gathered himself for the final judgment.\n\n\"The law requires me, and I do now impose, the death penalty.\"\n\n—\n\nThe courtroom erupted.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\nPaula Cooper looked at Kevin Relphorde for help; amid the chaos, she wasn't sure what had just happened. She looked back for the judge; he had already left the bench. She asked Relphorde what had happened. He delivered the verdict again: He gave you the death penalty.\n\nThe smile Paula wore into the courtroom was gone, indeed. Bill Pelke took note of that. Instead, he saw a river of tears streaming down her cheeks. As she was led from the courtroom, the tears soaked the top of her blouse.\n\nJust like that, Paula Cooper — at 16 years, 10 months and 16 days — became the youngest person ever sentenced to death in Indiana; she was now the youngest female on death row anywhere in the United States. In this age before the cellphone, news reporters from national outlets raced out of the courtroom to the nearest bank of pay telephones. It took a few hours, but the verdict soon circled the globe.\n\nIn the hallway outside the courtroom, Rhonda Cooper yelled in anguish at members of the Pelke family and the prosecutors nearby.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\nThey seemed satisfied.\n\nStrangely, one of the most unsatisfied people in the building was the source of the commotion: Judge Kimbrough.\n\nAfter delivering the verdict, he darted out of the courtroom and into the hallway leading to his chambers. There, between the two rooms, he spotted William Touchette, a public defender who handled appeals. Kimbrough told Touchette to follow him.\n\nTouchette (pronounced TOO-shay) had been among those outside the courtroom straining to hear the proceedings. Like so many local lawyers, he was friendly with the judge; they'd socialized outside of work. He followed Kimbrough into his chambers.\n\nThe judge was angry. As angry as Touchette had ever seen him. Angry that the defense hadn't given him enough to spare Paula Cooper's life. Then Kimbrough uttered seven words Touchette would never again hear from a judge.\n\n\"I want you to get me reversed.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula Cooper's death sentence was one of Indiana's biggest news stories in 1986. It garnered network television news coverage. Once it hit the international news wires, it was picked up by newspapers in Europe, where it inspired protests.\n\nBut Monica Foster, working for a nonprofit death penalty defense group in Downtown Indianapolis, somehow missed all that. To her, it was as if the Paula Cooper case had never happened.\n\nIt wasn't that Foster was uninterested in current events or that she was dull. In fact, Foster was a wunderkind. She'd graduated from high school at 16, college at 19 and law school at 22. She'd come to work for the Indiana Public Defender Council, researching and offering advice to lawyers with death penalty cases, even before finishing her law degree. But at 27, she had a tendency to get absorbed in her work. And when that happened, the outside world ceased to exist.\n\nSo when William Touchette, the Lake County attorney preparing Paula Cooper's appeal, called the council looking for some help, Foster knew nothing of the case. Without hesitation, Foster agreed to be Touchette's local connection to Paula, who was being held at the Indiana Women's Prison on the city's east side. Foster even said she'd donate her time, seeing the client on evenings and weekends, as a sideline.\n\nFoster didn't realize she'd just signed on to the case that would become the most noteworthy of her career.\n\nWhen the case file arrived in her office, Foster began reading about Paula Cooper. Right away, she was puzzled.\n\nHere was a black girl from Gary who had been sentenced to death by a black judge whom even Foster knew to be one of the most liberal, anti-death penalty jurists in the state. The girl had brutally murdered an elderly woman during a robbery, but Foster told the people in her office that to get a death sentence from this judge Paula Cooper had to be some kind of rabid animal.\n\n\"She must be frothing at the mouth.\"\n\nFoster decided to go to the prison and see Paula Cooper for herself.\n\n—\n\nPaula had arrived at the Indiana Women's Prison — America's oldest women's prison — five days after her sentencing.\n\nEstablished shortly after the Civil War, it was originally in the countryside east of Indianapolis. Over time, brick storefronts and wood-frame houses sprang up around the prison's series of boxy brick buildings — situated around a grassy courtyard — and now the prison was landlocked in the middle of an urban neighborhood.\n\nAwaiting Paula was a cell tucked away on the second floor of the segregation unit. It was stark: block walls and tile floor; aluminum sink and toilet; a desk and a chair; all of it packaged in a space slightly bigger than a walk-in closet.\n\nShe had one window to the outside world. Depending on which side of the hallway she was assigned at the time, it featured either a view of the courtyard or, just beyond a fence topped by razor wire, the backside of a row of decaying houses.\n\nPaula's cell had two metal doors. One was made of bars, the other was solid. Most of the time, the solid door remained open, allowing her to talk through the bars to passing guards and nearby prisoners. But when the solid door was closed, it was as if she was locked in a vault. Worse, the prison had no air conditioning. As summer temperatures outside climbed into the 90s, the only air moving through the wing was pushed by a floor fan at the end of the hall. Most of the time, the place felt like the inside of a cook stove.\n\nHere, Paula Cooper spent 23 hours a day. In the remaining hour, she had 30 minutes to shower and 30 minutes for recreation, which meant a short walk to a larger room where she could play Ping-Pong or cards with other prisoners. Meals were delivered to her cell.\n\nShe was 16 years old and, in the grand scheme of things, set apart from the rest of the human race.\n\nThe treatment was harsher than what Paula's three co-defendants in the murder of Ruth Pelke faced. They were housed elsewhere in the prison, with the general population. They had greater freedom of movement, time outdoors and an ongoing interaction with other people. Paula was allotted 10 hours of visits per month, but she wasn't sure who would fill the time. Her sister had moved to Minnesota. Her mother had moved to Georgia. Her father had moved to Tennessee. Paula was as alone as she could be.\n\nYet she faced a struggle greater than isolation and heat. She lived in fear that the executioner was coming for her any minute. Whatever she'd been told about the appeals process hadn't registered. She thought she was about to be taken away and killed. She existed moment to moment, in dread the guards were about to drag her away to the electric chair. In letters, she would describe her situation in the bleakest of terms — \"a mental hell.\" Paula needed hope. She needed a friend. But who?\n\n—\n\nMonica Foster entered the security checkpoint at the Indiana Women's Prison and was shown to the glass-walled consultation room. In short order, she watched as a guard escorted her client in to meet her.\n\nPaula Cooper was nothing like she expected. Monica came looking for the heartless killer who had murdered an old woman in cold blood, fought the guards at the county jail and been given a ticket to the chair by the most liberal judge in Lake County.\n\nInstead, Foster found a girl, sobbing uncontrollably, who had been on suicide watch. Foster tried to calm her. After some questioning, she gathered the reason for the emotional meltdown: Paula thought they were coming any time now. To kill her.\n\nFoster's blood boiled. She realized that, since the sentencing, no one had explained to Paula the years of appeals; the good chance for a reprieve; and, should all else fail, the notice she would receive well ahead of an execution. Foster felt sorry for Paula. She explained the process. Above all, she told Paula she'd never be ambushed by the executioner.\n\nPaula went back to her cell in a little better shape, but Foster left the prison rattled. She couldn't believe how she had misjudged her client. She realized that her role in this case was about more than legal counsel. She would need to offer her client a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen.\n\nFoster began going to the prison on weekends, sitting and talking with Paula for hours. She listened to Paula talk about being depressed, and she tried to buck her up. She listened to Paula's troubles with the prison administration and offered advice on ways to get along. She listened to Paula describe the abuses of her childhood, and Foster shared some of the tougher aspects of her own. The conversation wasn't always heavy. Sometimes they talked about places they dreamed of going and about men Foster was dating. Paula, in particular, was quick with a jab about Foster's romantic failures. Even in a maximum security prison, with one of them facing death, they spent a good deal of time laughing. And Foster found Paula's laugh to be infectious. That she could laugh at all impressed Foster. The girl seemed to have some kind of resiliency. After a while, Foster could deny it no longer: She liked Paula Cooper.\n\n—\n\nBill Pelke felt no such affection.\n\nIn the 18 months since Paula Cooper killed his grandmother, Bill had lost the ability to think of Ruth Pelke as the sweet person she'd been; he could only see the murder victim. He couldn't remember the warmth of Ruth's home; he could only think of it as a crime scene. When Paula Cooper received her sentence, Pelke felt justice had been served. His father, Robert Pelke, warned him that the justice wouldn't last. On a trip to Florida they took to get away from it all, Robert Pelke said Paula would probably never see the electric chair. \"Some do-gooder will probably come along and help get her off death row,\" he'd said. Bill struggled to imagine it; he just tried to get on with his life.\n\nBut moving on wasn't easy. And at 39, Bill already had other things on his mind that bothered him. He'd dropped out of college and wound up in Vietnam during the height of the war. As a radio operator, he was supposed to take cover during the fighting and call in air support. But he still carried shrapnel in his side from the wounds he suffered. Worse than that, he carried memories of the Army buddies who'd never come back. The experience left him sick of death. When he returned home, he'd married and started a family, but his marriage failed. So many things in his life hadn't gone as he'd planned. One afternoon in November 1986, all of this seemed to coalesce in Bill's mind.\n\nBill worked in a steel mill as a crane operator. He sat 50 feet above the manufacturing floor in the cab of his crane, moving heavy loads as the need arose. But on this Sunday night shift, things were slow; his mind began to drift. He wondered why life was so hard, why God had allowed Ruth to suffer such a horrendous death. He wondered why his family — his good family — was made to suffer in the wake of the crime. It was an unlikely perch for prayer, but Bill closed his eyes and began seeing images in his mind. He saw the courtroom where Paula had been sentenced to death. He remembered the outburst of her grandfather and the tears streaming down the man's face. He remembered Paula's reaction and the tears streaming down hers, how they soaked her blouse.\n\nA hard realization hit Bill: Ruth wouldn't have wanted these things. She had invited Paula and the girls into her home to help them find faith. It occurred to Bill that Ruth would be more interested in Paula's salvation than her execution. He was certain, too, that Ruth would have hated seeing Paula's grandfather in anguish.\n\nBill thought of the Bible stories Ruth had taught and the lessons he'd learned from a lifetime in church. He remembered Jesus taught that you shouldn't forgive someone just seven times, but 70 times seven — in other words, forgiveness should be a habit. He remembered being taught that the measure of forgiveness we show others is the measure by which we shall be judged. He remembered hearing about Jesus on the cross, offering salvation to the man dying next to him, offering grace to those who sought his death. \"Forgive them,\" Jesus had said, \"for they know not what they do.\"\n\nAnd then Bill realized something: Paula hadn't known what she was doing. Nobody in their right mind would take a 12-inch butcher knife and stab someone 33 times. It was crazy. Senseless.\n\nIn his mind, Bill began to see a new image: It was the picture of Ruth, the one published countless times since her death — silver hair, horn-rimmed glasses, sweet smile. Except now, he saw her face in the picture with tears running down her cheeks. Bill felt certain Ruth wanted someone from her family to show love to Paula and hers. Bill wasn't capable of it right then, but he thought he should try. He was a blue collar guy — a steelworker — and now he was at work crying a river of his own tears. From his seat in the cab of the crane, Bill prayed: \"God, give me love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family.\" In return, he promised God two things. First, Bill would give credit to God for giving him the ability to forgive Paula whenever success came his way. Second, he'd walk through whatever door opened as a result of forgiving Paula.\n\nEventually, the sweet memories of Ruth would come back to Bill. He would be able to put aside the horror story. First, though, he felt he had to take a greater leap of faith. He had to get in touch with his grandmother's killer. He had to reach out to Paula Cooper.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe next day, Bill phoned Paula's attorney. He wanted her prison address, and he was willing to do whatever it took to help save Paula's life. Kevin Relphorde's response wasn't encouraging: \"It's kind of late for that.\"\n\nUndeterred, Bill took the address and sat down at a desk in his Portage home to write perhaps the most intense letter of his life. He told Paula he had forgiven her; he wanted to visit her; there were Bible verses his grandmother would want him to share. He also wanted to meet her grandfather, he of the tearful courtroom outburst.\n\nBill dropped the letter in his mailbox and, at some level, thought that would be the end of it. But in the days following, he found himself checking his mailbox almost daily. Ten days after he sent his letter, an envelope showed up. The return address said: \"Ms. Paula Cooper.\"\n\nThe envelope was thick. Inside, he found a letter dated Nov. 10, 1986, six pages of a teenage girl's loopy cursive, written in pencil, on pink stationery. The contents were far from a schoolgirl's bubble gum dreams. It was a snapshot of Paula's mind on death row. Her thoughts darted back and forth — between apologies and self-pity, between empathy for those who hated her and preachiness about why they should forgive her. Much of the letter was frenetic. Sentences ran on and on like the transcriptions of a nervous talker. Her misspellings and limited punctuation seemed to reflect the erratic schooling of someone who'd been on the run since eighth grade. But it also bore the hallmarks of a mind in overdrive, overloaded with conflicting emotions. Here are some excerpts. Periods have been added for clarity.\n\nBill 11/10/86\n\nHello how are you? fine I truly hope. me I'll survive, I received your letter today & it was nice of you to write me. one of Ms Pelkes friends wrote me also, I answered it back also. Im not the mean type of person your family thinks I am but I can except that. I really do. your cousin Robert was something else & what he said about not knowing if Ms Pelke would forgiving me. Ive read my bible & I know it says the way you judge others the Lord will judge you the same way. Ive prayed for your family. a lady in a wheel chair use to visit me at the jail. she said God would be pleased if I prayed for all of you, I am doing fine. They treat me ok & I am always isolated 23 hrs a day. thats how it is on death row, it is a mental hell because no one cares except for themselves. I am thankful to the Lord for them letting the others have a little time, because I've had hell all my life. so it really doesnt matter if I live or die because Im ready any time they come …\n\nIn his initial letter, Bill expressed a desire to save Paula from her death sentence. But in her reply, Paula told Bill he need not write, travel or speak on her behalf; she just wanted his forgiveness. She seemed proud of her performance in court — how she looked his family in the face and apologized. She seemed to excuse her parents for missing her sentencing. Although they had beaten and neglected her, Paula said, her actions affected them, too.\n\nAt various times, her words ranged from fatalistic to self-pitying:\n\nI cant stay here like this & I don't want to be here, I deserve a chance one that Ive never had before. but one day Ill be free even if its when Im dead…\n\nI cry every time I think of your grand mom. the others think it's a joke because you all let them be free. Im not an evil person, or what ever you think of me to be, Im just some one who is real angry, angry with life & all the people around me …\n\nIve never done anything wrong before except ask for help, I was turned away & introduced into a life of drugs, sex & crime, but now its too late for help. Im dying inside because of this but I only hope for the best for others.\n\nIn closing, she made it clear she wanted more interaction with Bill, even if she was passive about it. She would put him on her list of allowable prison visitors; she would write him whenever he wrote her; she offered her grandfather's phone number and address. In a dark world, it was as if she had seen a flicker of light.\n\nWell, Ill go now, Ill continue to pray for all of you.\n\nTake care\n\nPaula\n\nTheir first exchange was the start of a surprising correspondence that would span years and delve into the core themes of Paula's life — searching for forgiveness; grappling with remorse; her closeness with death; her search for peace.\n\nThe letters also chart the course of a relationship that many people would struggle to understand, especially Bill Pelke's father.\n\n—\n\nAfter a second exchange of letters with Paula, Bill felt compelled to share with his parents the news of his surprising correspondence: His father had once warned of a do-gooder who would get Paula off death row. Now it appeared Bill wanted to be that do-gooder.\n\nAt first, his parents were speechless. \"We don't understand why you are doing this,\" his mother, Lola, said. Surprisingly, his father acquiesced.\n\n\"Do what you got to do,\" Robert said.\n\nBill wrote Clarence Trigg, the superintendent of the Indiana Women's Prison, a letter that spent most of a page describing Ruth Pelke's faith and her commitment to sharing it. He concluded with a request:\n\nClarence, if Ruth Pelke could speak with you right now, I am sure she would say, \"Please let Billy see Paula.\"\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\nIn the name of Jesus and His Love\n\nWilliam R. Pelke\n\nBut the prison doors weren't about to open to Bill anytime soon. Corrections officials didn't know what to make of his request — a murder victim's grandson seeking an audience with her killer. They suspected he had another motive, such as revenge.\n\n—\n\nThe aftermath of Paula's case was confounding in other ways. Since giving Paula a death sentence, Judge James C. Kimbrough had been very public about his discomfort with his own ruling. Based on the law and the case in court, he said Paula qualified for the death penalty. But he hadn't been able to square it with his own opposition to capital punishment. The decision was costing him sleep. In an interview with the (Gary) Post-Tribune, published Aug. 4, 1986, a reporter noted the judge's nervous appearance.\n\nHe fidgeted in his chair. His gaze varied — at times less steady and slanted toward the desktop. He removed his glasses, toying with them.\n\nFriends who knew Kimbrough said the judge was different than he'd been before the Paula Cooper sentencing. The man they knew as friendly and jovial, even gregarious, was more reclusive, less outgoing. \"It weighed heavily on his mind,\" said Earline Rogers, a state legislator and a friend. \"That was something he felt legally he had to do but, personally, he would not have taken that path.\"\n\nSome in the legal community began to think there was a good chance Paula's death sentence would be overturned. But Kimbrough wouldn't live to find out.\n\nOn April 30, 1987, less than a year after his judgment of Paula, Kimbrough drove his car into the back of a semi and was killed. He had been drinking. The tragedy cast a pall over the Lake County courts, but it also landed hard at the Indiana Women's Prison. When Monica Foster told Paula her judge was dead, Paula was inconsolable. Days later, in a letter to Bill Pelke, she shared her thoughts about the judge.\n\n\"all I could do was cry, even though Kimbrough sentenced me to die. I felt a closeness to him as if he were my father. I have been sentenced to die many times by a lot of people and it's only words. We are all on Death Row and the last day of April his death sentence was completed & it should teach a lot of people we all have a date that is already planned & the way it will happen.\"\n\nPaula's own father had been cruel; at least Kimbrough had agonized over the punishment he gave.\n\nThe letter about Kimbrough was the 20th she'd written to Bill Pelke in less than six months. She was surprising herself at her output: \"I didn't even know I had a good handwriting or a great vocabulary until I was locked up.\"\n\nBy then, she was 17 and a condemned killer with hours to contemplate her past, present and future. Several themes recurred in her writing.\n\nLife on death row. She struggled to sleep, to breathe, to deal with the noise. \"To be on death row is worst than when I was in a mental hospital. At least it was quiet.\" She had ailments from toothaches to a bad back. Mostly, she was confused and on edge. Life on the row made her feel like \"a walking time bomb.\"\n\nMemories of the murder. Her thoughts were plagued by it. She described what she did to Ruth Pelke as \"awful.\" She wished she could erase it. \"Every day,\" she said, \"I see my nightmare.\"\n\nDeath. It was constantly on her mind, whether by execution or by her own hand. She alternated between dread of the electric chair — \"I hope it never happens to me\" ­— and anticipation of it — \"sometimes I wish they would just go ahead & do it. They continue to put this death threat on my life and I'm tired of it.\"\n\nSuicide. She seemed to ponder the merits of killing herself. She wasn't sure what it would solve but, in words that seemed to echo from her mother, she said, \"there isn't anything here for me.\" She talked about hanging herself but acknowledged she couldn't follow through. \"I know that if I do that I might go to hell (and) I don't want that to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, people from across the country wrote her. Some, including a death row inmate in North Carolina, wanted a romantic relationship. Some wanted answers to the plague of juvenile crime. Others sent her Bibles and tried to save her soul. Yet her faith — another frequent topic — had grown cold. As a child, she read her Bible often, she said, but \"my faith started to shatter because of a lot of feelings, hopes and unanswered prayers. I love the Lord but we aren't rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/society/956617/inside-adelaide-cottage-prince-william-kate-middleton-home-royal", "title": "Inside Adelaide Cottage: Prince William and Kate's new home 'away ...", "text": "Sign up to our 10 Things You Need to Know Today newsletter A free daily digest of the biggest news stories of the day - and the best features from our website Name: Your Email Address Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Thank you for signing up to TheWeek.

In the past, she tended to use Windsor Castle only at weekends or during Easter and Royal Ascot week, with Buckingham Palace being her official home.\n\nThe monarch appears to have started a trend. Prince William and Kate Middleton are now set to relocate to Windsor, along with their three children: George, nine, Charlotte, seven, and Louis, four, in the “coming two or three weeks”, said The Telegraph.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The property is thought to have been refurbished as recently as 2015, and is located in the 4,800-acre Windsor Great Park.\n\nAdelaide Cottage was home to Princess Margaret’s infamous boyfriend Peter Townsend in the 1940s (Image credit: Wikimedia Commons)\n\nOver the years, Adelaide Cottage has been used as a “grace and favour” residence for royal friends including Peter Townsend, the Battle of Britain pilot and equerry to King George VI who became the divorced lover of the Queen’s sister, Princess Margaret, between 1944 and 1952.\n\nPrincess Margaret reportedly spent “many Sunday visits” at the residence while Townsend lived there with his first wife, Rosemary. The princess \"played with the children on the lawn and Peter Townsend, off duty, sat back in a deckchair”, according to a 1950 newspaper report, republished The Sun.\n\nIt was “also known to be a favourite home of Queen Victoria”, said the Daily Mail, and she “frequently enjoyed taking her breakfast there”.\n\nThe property most recently hosted Simon Rhodes, son of the Queen’s cousin and best friend Margaret Rhodes, who died in 2016, said English in the Daily Mail. It is thought to boast “original features including a marble Graeco-Egyptian fireplace and a principal bedroom with a coved ceiling featuring gilded dolphins”.\n\nAlong with being used for royal friends, the cottage was famously favoured by Queen Victoria, “who would often have tea or breakfast in this quaint location”, said Women and Home magazine.\n\nThe house is “much smaller” than the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s other two homes, said Hello! magazine. Anmer Hall boasts ten bedrooms while their Kensington Palace apartment “also features living quarters for staff”.\n\nFort Belvedere and Frogmore House, both in Windsor, have also been slated as potential new homes for the Cambridges, but it was thought that the latter would “require significant renovations to become a suitable home”.\n\nThe Cambridges are reportedly “very keen for a modest home” when they move to Windsor, a source told The Sun. The pair believe that Adelaide Cottage “fits the bill because it is a four-bedroom home and they do not need any more as they have no live-in staff”.\n\nThey are “adamant they didn’t want anything too showy or anything that needed renovating or extra security so as not to be a burden on the taxpayer”, a source told the paper. “The added bonus is they can send George, Charlotte and Louis to school together locally. The three children will enjoy running around and playing in the gardens, which is the kind of life they enjoy so much when at Anmer Hall.”\n\nA ‘new era’\n\nAs the family “continue to cement their place among the most influential members of The Firm”, said the Daily Mail, the move will “usher in a new era for the Cambridge clan”, said The Telegraph. The three children will “no longer have their nanny, Maria Borrallo, “on hand 24/7”, making the move to Windsor a “significant change”.\n\nBorrallo, a Spanish Norland nanny, “has been a regular fixture at the family’s side” since she was first hired in 2014. She will remain in full-time employment with the Cambridges, but will “live elsewhere” along with a “handful of other support staff”.\n\nThe move “is in keeping” with the wishes of Princess Diana, William’s late mother, “who is said to have strived for a ‘normal life’ for him and his brother”, said the Mail.\n\nKate’s uncle, Gary Goldsmith, told The Sun this month that she and William would have their “hands full this summer”, as they prepare for the move, but said he believed they “are ready for the next chapter in their lives”. A source told The Mirror that the couple are “extremely excited” about relocating.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "The Week Staff", "Harold Maass", "Jamie Timson", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/asia-pacific/955731/neo-sakoku-japan-border-experiment-covid-19", "title": "'Neo-sakoku': how has Japan's border experiment worked? | The ...", "text": "Sign up to our 10 Things You Need to Know Today newsletter A free daily digest of the biggest news stories of the day - and the best features from our website Name: Your Email Address Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Thank you for signing up to TheWeek.

This is in spite of Japan having one of the world’s oldest populations: the average age is almost 46 and nearly 30% of the nation is over 65, according to Bloomberg.\n\nStruggle to contain Omicron\n\nIn recent months, however, Japan has struggled to contain the highly infectious Omicron variant, reporting in late January that daily nationwide infections had topped 70,000 for the first time since the pandemic began.\n\n“Because this virus is an unknown we must throw in all our resources,” said Kishida after the first Omicron case without a link to foreign travel was reported in Osaka in December. “In a crisis, it’s better to do too much than too little, too late.”\n\nA survey carried out in early December by the Yomiuri newspaper found that almost 90% of Japanese citizens backed the prime minister’s decision to tighten travel restrictions and that support for Kishida had risen six percentage points to 62%.\n\n‘Neo-sakoku’\n\nJapan’s strict zero-Covid policy has been dubbed “neo-sakoku” – a reference to the “sakoku” policy the country adopted between the 17th and 19th centuries, when it severed almost all contact with the outside world.\n\nMeaning “chained country”, sakoku was enforced by Japan’s military Tokugawa shogunate government. It imposed strict guidelines including the “death penalty to those who had contact with the outside world”, explained History 101.\n\nThe period lasted for almost 200 years and was only overturned when the leadership was forced to establish relations with the US.\n\nAlienating allies\n\nJapan has been warned that its “neo-sakoku” policy risks alienating its allies, with the recent tightening of restrictions branded “‘unscientific’, discriminatory against foreign nationals and out of step with other G7 democracies”, said Ben Ascione, an assistant professor at Waseda University in Tokyo, in the Australian Financial Review.\n\nBusiness leaders are saying that this isolationist approach has undermined Tokyo’s efforts to become a global financial centre, as it has made it impossible for the country to attract international talent and conduct global deals face-to-face.\n\nChristopher LaFleur, a special adviser and former chair of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan, told the FT that companies had found it a struggle “to fully maintain their business operations in Japan”.\n\nImpact on education\n\nThe number of international students in Japan has also dropped significantly during the pandemic, from over 312,000 in 2019 to less than 280,000 in 2020, according to the East Asia Forum.\n\nAround 150,000 international students enrolled in Japanese universities remain “locked out” of the country, with an exception given by the government to just 400.\n\nA public letter published on Go Petition last month called on Japan’s government to open its borders to foreign students and scholars.\n\nThese students are “few in number, and they invest a large amount of time and effort to become familiar with Japan’s language, culture, and society”, read the letter, which was signed by more than 100 educators and policymakers with links to Japan.\n\n“They become the bridges between Japan and other societies,” it added. “They are future policymakers, business leaders, and teachers. They are the foundation of the US-Japan alliance and other international relationships that support Japan’s core national interests.”\n\nOlympic exception\n\nOne of the only times that Japan has relaxed its borders to foreign visitors since the pandemic began was during last summer’s 2020 Tokyo Olympics, when tens of thousands of people arrived to participate in and report on the games.\n\nA widespread outbreak driven by the Delta variant was linked to the games, but the strict measures imposed are thought to have curbed transmission relatively successfully.\n\nThe controversial decision to hold the Tokyo Olympics during the pandemic is thought to have contributed to Yoshihide Suga’s downfall. The former prime minister ended up not seeking re-election as leader late last year.\n\nMatthew J. Wilson, the dean and president of Temple University in Tokyo, told the Japan Times he was concerned the government’s mixed messages regarding tight restrictions and hosting the Olympics had created the wrong perception that “Japan does not value education”.\n\n“Olympic athletes can come in, you have people that are associated with those folks, but we can’t get students in,” he said.\n\n“The Japanese government needs to protect health and safety. But it’s possible to protect health without completely shutting the door to an important component of society in terms of future leaders like students.”", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson", "Anahi Valenzuela", "Rafi Schwartz", "Becca Stanek", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Peter Weber", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Staff", "Devika Rao"], "publish_date": "2022/02/11"}]}

The images do not show dramatic development, but rather the continued progress of fortifying and expanding an area analysts say is of vital importance to Russia’s defensive strategy, at a time of great strain on Moscow’s resources.\n\nAccording to Maxar, the images demonstrate continued work on the radar stations at the Olenegorsk site, on the Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia, and at Vorkuta, just north of the Arctic circle. They also appear to show work moving ahead to complete one of five Rezonans-N radar systems at Ostrovnoy, a site located by the Barents Sea, near Norway and Finland in Russia’s west. The Rezonans-N are claimed by Russian officials to be able to detect stealth aircraft and objects.\n\nSatellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies At Tiksi air defense site, towards the East of Russia's arctic region, satellite imagery shows three radomes (which protect radar systems) have been built up between this October and last. The remote Russian military Arctic base is located on the coast of the Laptev Sea. Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies\n\nThree new radomes, the weatherproof enclosures used to protect radar antennas, were completed this year at the Tiksi air defense site, in the far northeast, according to Maxar’s images and analysis. There are also improvements to a runway and parking apron at Nagurskoye air base – Russia’s northernmost military facility – and runway improvements at ‘Temp’ air base, on Kotelny Island, in the northeast of the country.\n\nRussia has been bolstering its defenses in the far north for years, refurbishing a series of old Soviet bases with modern designs and equipment.\n\nIts Arctic region has long been key to its oil and gas sector, but also to its nuclear defenses, with a significant proportion of its sophisticated nuclear weaponry and submarine facilities in that area.\n\nSatellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies On the arctic Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia, change is visible at the Olenegorsk Radar Station, including a new building compared to the imagery from June last year. Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies\n\n“That deterrence has always been ready,” said a senior Western intelligence official. “It’s never down to low readiness; it’s a high status all the time,” the official said.\n\nAt the start of the war with Ukraine in February some submarines were repositioned to signal “this is a real capability,” the official added, but they soon returned to standard high readiness.\n\nNATO chief Stoltenberg reasoned: “The shortest way from Russia to North America is over the Arctic North Pole. So the strategic importance of these areas has not changed because of the war in Ukraine.”\n\n“We see Russia reopening old Soviet bases, military sites,” he said, noting that it is also “testing novel weapons in the Arctic and the high north.”\n\nSatellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies Build-up continued between August this year and last at the Ostrovnoy site located by the Barents Sea, near Norway and Finland in Russia's west. One of five new Rezonans-N radars, which Russia claim can find stealth jets, is located here. Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies\n\n“It is significant that they have managed to shelter this area from the impact of the Ukrainian war”, said Malte Humpert of the Arctic Institute, who has written extensively on the development of the Arctic.\n\n“They are prioritising energy resources in the Arctic, but another aspect is to project power. Yet this is also economic. About 20% of Russia’s GDP comes from the Arctic area, and that may be more in the future. There is a lot of money involved in the area for them.”\n\nThe war in Ukraine has led to a major adjustment in Russia’s troop strengths in the region, the senior Western intelligence official said. “They’re down to somewhere between 20 and 25% of their original land forces up there. But then the naval component is totally untouched by the war,” they noted.\n\nFollowing strikes earlier this month on two key airfields deep inside Russia in Ryazan and Saratov, Russian military jets and bombers have been dispersed across the country and the Arctic north, the official added. Moscow has blamed the strikes on Ukraine, while Kyiv has offered no comment on the explosions at the Russian bases.\n\nThe Arctic is also vital to Russia because its melting ice is rapidly opening up new shipping routes from Asia’s southeast to Europe, using a much shorter path along the Russian coast.\n\nAt Russia's northernmost military facility, the runway at Nagurskoye airfield has visibly progressed over the last year despite Russia's war on Ukraine. Nagurskoye is one of several \"trefoil\" bases featuring a three-pronged building in the colours of the Russian flag. The base, located in Alexandra Land far up in the Arctic Circle, was built by the Soviets in the 50s, and has been refitted since 2015. Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies\n\nThe Northern Sea Route could cut around two weeks off the current journey time across the Suez Canal. Russian state TV has reveled in the launch of several atomic-powered icebreakers, designed to boost Russian influence and power in the region. Critics say Moscow is seeking to exert outsized control over a route that should be equally accessible to all nations.\n\nSpeaking via videolink at the launch of a new nuclear-powered icebreaker in St. Petersburg last month (November 22), Russian President Vladimir Putin said the development of the “most important” Northern Sea Route “will allow Russia to fully reveal its export potential and to establish effective logistics routes, including to southeast Asia.”\n\nAt the same time, the war in Ukraine has boosted NATO’s presence in the region. Once Finland and Sweden join the block, as is widely expected, seven out of eight Arctic states will be NATO members.\n\nThe alliance has also ramped up its military clout in the region. In August, Norway released the first images of US B52 bombers flying over its territory escorted by Norwegian F35 jets and 2 Swedish JAS Gripen.\n\nIncreased signaling by NATO included a recent test of the new weapons system, the Rapid Dragon Palletized Munition Deployment, involving a complex drop by US special forces of a normal supply pallet from the back of a C130 cargo craft.\n\nThe pallet contains a cruise missile, which launches as the pallet falls by parachute. The display was designed to show the United States can launch these powerful weapons systems from the back of an ordinary cargo plane. The test took place in Norway, not far from the Russian border.\n\nNATO has also become increasingly concerned about the potential sabotage of Norway’s oil and gas infrastructure. Now Russian energy is subject to sanctions, Norway’s natural gas makes up more than 20% of Europe’s supply, according to some analysis.\n\n“Since the sabotage in the Baltic Sea,” Stoltenberg said, “we have doubled our presence, with ships, with submarines, with maritime patrol aircrafts in the Baltic and North Seas, partly to monitor, to have better situational awareness, but also to send a message of deterrence and readiness to protect this critical infrastructure.” The NATO head was referring to the blasts at the Nord Stream pipeline in September, which were caused by an act of sabotage, according to Swedish prosecutors, after evidence of explosives was discovered at the sites.\n\nThe senior intelligence official said, however, that a recent Norwegian review of its infrastructure security concluded no major attempts to attack it had occurred and that “the oil infrastructure is well secured now.”", "authors": ["Nick Paton Walsh Sarah Dean", "Nick Paton Walsh", "Sarah Dean"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}]}

Aside from court decisions, \"it's the impact she had on the greater culture.\"\n\nIn 2013, Ginsburg became known as the Notorious RBG, a reference to the late rapper the Notorious B.I.G., after her fiery dissent against the landmark 5-4 Supreme Court ruling in Shelby County v. Holder. That decision ended a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe new Forever stamp pays tribute to Ginsburg’s significance as a legal scholar who wrote stinging and passionate dissents to court rulings and her unexpected rise to cultural significance, marked by numerous media appearances including a workout with Stephen Colbert and comical \"Saturday Night Live\" parodies.\n\nThe Postal Service will print 32 million Ginsburg stamps, says Jonathan Castillo, a Postal Service senior public relations representative.\n\nWhich Supreme Court justices are on stamps?\n\nGetting on a US stamp is harder than you think\n\nThough Ginsburg was a well-known justice and a common presence in social media, an RBG commemorative stamp was never guaranteed. That's because it's difficult and time-consuming to get an image on a U.S. postage stamp – and thousands of requests are made every year.\n\nTo be considered, \"subject matter suggestions should be submitted three or more years in advance of the proposed stamp,\" Castillo says.\n\nThe approval process starts with the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee, a panel of 11 people from various professions who are appointed by the postmaster general. It was established in 1957 and examines all recommendations surrounding postage stamps.\n\n\"It's a very deliberative process,\" Snee says. \"The committee sifts through literally thousands of requests. They go through all of those, every single one of them, and select approximately 30 subjects for consideration for each year's stamp program.\"\n\nThe postmaster general makes the final decision.\n\nNotorious RBG isn't the first Supreme Court justice on a stamp\n\nGinsburg is the 14th Supreme Court justice to appear on a commemorative stamp.\n\nChief Justice John Marshall, who was the court's longest-serving member at 34 years, was the first, in 1894.\n\nMarshall has appeared on four stamps over the span of nearly a century. Of the 14 justices on stamps, six were chief justices and the other eight were associate justices.\n\n\"Each stamp design is approached with the concept of creating the most compelling design based on the specific stamp subject,\" Castillo told USA TODAY.\n\nFor notable people or historical figures, \"the Postal Service does its best to capture the person’s likeness in a flattering and appropriate fashion,\" Castillo says.\n\nAside from the justices themselves, a depiction of the Supreme Court building has appeared twice.\n\nHow was the Ginsburg stamp designed?\n\nGinsburg died Sept. 18, 2020, at age 87. She was the second woman, after Sandra Day O’Connor, to join the Supreme Court and served as an associate justice for 27 years. The stamp comes 30 years after her nomination to the court.\n\nThe justice became known for wearing her signature special neckpieces, collars or jabots for announcing court opinions. Some were used for majority opinions, others for dissents. Her stamp image depicts her with a white beaded collar from South Africa.\n\nThe stamp evolved with three images:\n\nBermingham, who started collecting stamps as a kid, says this is the first time his work is being used on a stamp. He took the photograph in Ginsburg's court chambers in September 2017.\n\nDuring the photo session, \"I probably took about 100 photos altogether,\" Bermingham says. \"But I knew that was the one.\n\n\"I think it's the eye contact,\" he says. \"Look at those eyes – it's like you're looking into a soul.\"\n\nKessler researched Ginsburg and reviewed hundreds of photographs for a suitable stamp image, the Postal Service says.\n\nAfter finding Bermingham's photo, \"we believed that a painted portrait based on the photo would not only add gravitas to the stamp, but also a sense of eternity – perhaps something like that of presidential portrait,\" Kessler told the Postal Service.\n\nMichael J. Deas of New Orleans, a renown artist and illustrator whose work graces two dozen postage stamps, including James Dean and Marilyn Monroe, was commissioned to paint the Ginsburg portrait.\n\nAside from the stamps, you've seen Deas' work, which includes a number of magazine and book covers. Moviegoers will recognize his 1991 redesign of the familiar Columbia Pictures logo.\n\nThe Ginsburg stamp is being issued as a Forever stamp in sheets of 20. Forever stamps are designed to always be equal in value to the current First-Class Mail 1-ounce price, which is now 66 cents.\n\nWhy only 14 Supreme Court images on stamps?\n\nCongress authorized U.S. postage stamps in 1847. Since then, the Postal Service has printed stamps for thousands of subjects, Snee says.\n\nBut \"there haven't been a whole lot\" of Supreme Court images, says Daniel Piazza, chief curator at the Smithsonian National Postal Museum.\n\n\"Until recently, Supreme Court justices weren't that well known,\" Piazza says. \"They were obscure figures. Go back 40 years and justices generally weren't on speaking tours or on television.\"\n\nBut people pay more attention to the court these days, and justices are higher-profile. \"I think public perception of the court has changed,\" Piazza says. \"The public now sees the court as more relevant to their everyday lives.\"\n\nUS postage stamps come in two flavors: Commemorative and definitive\n\nThe Ginsburg stamp is a commemorative first-class stamp edition, the type that honors people, events or subjects of cultural importance.\n\nCommemorative stamps are typically printed in runs of 20 million to 30 million and sold for about a year, Snee says.\n\nDefinitive stamps are much more common and longer-lasting. They're usually chosen for everyday use, including mass mailings. They come in a range of denominations for a variety of postal needs.\n\nDefinitive stamps \"are the ones printed in huge quantities, 500 to 700 million, up to a couple billion or so,\" Snee says. Examples include stamps with American flags, flowers, natural scenery and the like. \"These are the ones that most people use on their mail,\" he says.\n\nDefinitive stamps can be available as long as stocks remain, sometimes for years.\n\nAs a rule, the Postal Service doesn't issue stamps that commemorate living people, though stamps that recognize specific events sometimes include living people.\n\nYou'll need a stamp to give the Postal Service a stamp idea\n\nYou'll have to mail the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee a real, stamped letter with your idea for a commemorative stamp. The committee doesn't accept submissions by email or other means.\n\n\"It's kind of a nod to the past,\" Snee says.\n\nWill the Ginsburg stamp be collectible?\n\nThough the Ginsburg stamp stands out among the relatively few Supreme Court editions, it'll probably spark more interest among the general public than stamp collectors.\n\n\"In terms of stamp collectors and postal historians, it's a pretty straightforward issue,\" Piazza says. \"There's nothing particularly unusual or noteworthy about it from the collecting end.\n\n\"I think it's the non-collectors and general public who will take more notice of the stamp.\"\n\nWhat's the bestselling commemorative stamp?\n\nThe King of Rock 'n' Roll is the bestselling U.S. commemorative stamp to date, the Postal Service says.\n\nWant to know more?\n\nLinn's Stamp News: Weekly news and marketplace information for stamp collectors.\n\nSmithsonian National Postal Museum: For historical information on stamps and the Postal Service.\n\nU.S. Postal Service: For new stamp and postage news.\n\nPhilip Bermingham Photography: The photographer who took the portrait.\n\nMichael J.

Her studio became a must-see attraction for American tourists, the USPS added.\n\nEdmonia Lewis, here in an An undated photo, was the first Black and Native sculptor to gain international fame. Science History Images/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nMany of her sculptures dealt with themes involving her Native American and Black heritage in the years after the Civil War and the end of slavery.\n\nOne of her best known works is The Death of Cleopatra, her 3,000-pound 1876 marble sculpture depicting the Egyptian queen after her suicide by the bite of a venomous asp. The work was presumed lost for over a century but was ultimately rediscovered at a salvage yard in the 1980s, and it is now on display at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington DC, the institute said.\n\nThe Death of Cleopatra by Edmonia Lewis depicts the moments after the Egyptian queen died from the bite of a poisonous asp.

Or a top-hatted skeleton gazing out at creditors?\n\nThat type of artwork by Edward Gorey could potentially be stuck on letters, cards, bills and solicitations all over the country, if supporters are successful in convincing the U.S. Postal Service that the late Yarmouth Port illustrator and writer should get his own stamp.\n\nThe ideal timing would be 2025, marking what would have been Gorey’s 100th birthday.\n\nThe campaign to convince federal officials of that was launched on Gorey’s Feb. 22 birthday (the palindromic 2/22/22) in the first joint project by the Edward Gorey Charitable Trust in New York City and the Edward Gorey House museum that's in his former 8 Strawberry Lane, Yarmouth Port residence.\n\nMusic, art, coffee, a dog and swapping seeds:13 things to do on Cape Cod March 4-10\n\nThe process from proposal to stamp unveiling typically takes about three years, so the two organizations are getting the ball rolling now.\n\n“Not a moment to lose,” said Gorey House curator Gregory Hischak.\n\nOfficials from both organizations are asking fans to write letters — paper letters are required — explaining why Gorey should get a postage stamp. They’ve set a submission deadline of March 31. (For details on how to create a letter, see below.)\n\n“We would like to see (the 100th birthday) celebrated with a U.S. postage stamp recognizing (Gorey) as one of America’s most inventive and influential cultural figures,” the online plea from the Charitable Trust reads. “And, we need your help!”\n\nArts news:Singing telegrams, a live-stream breakthrough, a Broadway baby plus more\n\nIt’s been done before. In June 2021, for example the U.S. Postal Service celebrated the art of Emilio Sanchez on the centennial of his birth with four new stamps featuring his colorful architectural lithographs and paintings.\n\nHischak said artist-oriented stamps usually have four designs, plus a photo and information on the artist on each pane of stamps.\n\nThe Postal Service issues 25 to 30 commemorative stamps each year, said its senior public relations representative Sue Brennan — but that’s from 25,000 to 30,000 annual requests related to “stamp subjects that celebrate the American experience.”\n\nWhy should Edward Gorey be on a stamp?\n\nGorey fans seem to be excited by the stamp idea, based on response to social media posts and some letters already sent, according to Hischak as well as Charitable Trust archivist Will Baker and trustee Eric Sherman.\n\n“We’ve been pleasantly surprised,” Baker said of the response on Facebook and Instagram, and said they were told of more than a dozen letters sent in the first week and have gotten “a lot of nice little emails of encouragement about what we're doing.”\n\n“It's so heartening to see the outpouring of support for Edward Gorey and the willingness of his fans, who are really loyal fans, to actually sit down and take out a piece of paper and write something down and then put it in an envelope and put a stamp on it and send it out,” Sherman said. “That’s not like dashing off an email, which requires a lot less effort. So we've been really touched by the support we've seen and we hope it continues.”\n\nOn stage:Reviews & more: Cape Cod theaters show never-seen plays, and why you should watch 'Our Town,' 'Shirley Valentine'\n\nThe letter sent from the Gorey House, Hischak said, explains more about why Gorey might merit the national honor and “acknowledgement of his influence in American arts and culture today.”\n\nIn part, it reads:\n\n“There are few artists who have left a mark in such varied fields as Children’s Literature, young adult works, and gothic horror — as well as in film and stagework as Edward Gorey. Communities as diverse as graphic novelists, fabric artists, animal welfare groups and transgender communities all embrace Edward as their own. Few artists have managed to build such universal appeal while remaining distinctly American as Edward Gorey.”\n\nGorey illustrated more than 100 books and stories, including many he wrote himself, with favorites including \"The Gashlycrumb Tinies,\" \"The Doubtful Guest\" and \"The Wuggly Ump.\"\n\nHis distinctive, usually amusing but macabre, pen-and-ink drawings were filled with minute details, intricate shadings and often old-fashioned people in desperate situations. He was known for his unusual wordplay and language, and a humor that some might consider ghoulish.\n\nGorey-influenced fiction:More winter reading: 5 new books by Cape Cod authors\n\nGorey’s work gained a wider audience through anthologies like 1972’s “Amphigorey,” through his dark illustrations to introduce the PBS “Masterpiece Mystery!” series, and through his sets and (Tony Award-winning) costumes for “Dracula.” That show began as a production on Nantucket and went on to Broadway in 1977 starring Frank Langella.\n\nGorey’s “Dracula” royalties allowed him in 1979 to buy the Yarmouth Port home close to where he’d long spent summers with his family, according to a short biography by Karen Wilkin on the Charitable Trust website. Gorey worked with several Cape theater companies on “entertainments” and puppet shows, and lived in the Cape house full-time for nearly 20 years before his death in 2000, at age 75, according to the biography.\n\nGorey’s ‘mail art’\n\nThe idea to seek a Gorey stamp came from Patrice Miller, an artist, collector and member of the Gorey House board of trustees.\n\n“We were trying to think of something to do for Edward’s centennial, at least for a start, and this seemed to be the perfect project to sink our teeth into,” Hischak said.\n\n“This project fits very nicely within the mission of the Trust, which is to honor Edward's creative and philanthropic legacy through promoting his literary and artistic works,” Sherman said. “So I think this will hopefully introduce him to a much larger audience.”\n\nHe mentioned a 2013 Google doodle on Gorey’s birthday that attracted a new group of “admirers and fans,” noting the stamp idea “is in that same spirit.”\n\nGroundbreaking:'Shift the lens': Black diplomats during the Cold War, PBS documentary by Cape Cod native\n\nAnd Gorey actually had a connection to mail — which may or may not carry weight with the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nHe illustrated the envelopes of his correspondence — some of which are at the Gorey House, more in the archives of the Charitable Trust, and some held by his correspondents. The 2011 book “Floating Worlds” details the friendship between Gorey and author Peter Neumeyer through letters, and includes images of 38 of Gorey’s illustrated envelopes to his friend.\n\nWhile “mail art” was first widely recognized and coined as a term in the 1960s for small artworks sent through the mail, Hischak said Gorey was ahead of his time by doing just that in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\n“He was doing it as a lark, but the illustrations on his envelopes really kind of predate a lot of the mail art movement that happened,” he said.\n\n“Along with all the other reasons why” Gorey deserves a stamp, Baker said, “as an artist, writer and animal rights advocate, for his theatrical work and all that, he was one of the people really pioneering mail art in the mid-20th century in the U.S. So that would make honoring him with a postage stamp that much more appropriate.”\n\nDo you want Edward Gorey stamps?

That presidential stamp of approval was the most significant boost to date of efforts refocusing a federal holiday that for decades celebrated Christopher Columbus' discovery of America.\n\nAlthough few Americans are arguing with the notion of being off work come Monday, Columbus Day and Indigenous People's Day have prompted political debate in states, cities and municipalities around the U.S., especially in the past decade, with some pushing against change and others favoring Indigenous Peoples Day instead.\n\nHistory of Halloween: How well do you know the holiday?\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nWhat is Indigenous Peoples Day?\n\nThe celebrating of an Indigenous Peoples Day took root in 1977 at an international conference on discrimination sponsored by the United Nations. It's grown as a day to honor Native American peoples and commemorates their histories and cultures. South Dakota was the first state to recognize the day in 1989, and the California cities of Berkeley and Santa Cruz followed.\n\nIn 1990, the International Conference on Discrimination Against Indigenous Populations in the Americas, sponsored by the United Nations, began to discuss replacing Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day. California and Tennessee observe Native American Day in September, not conflicting with Columbus Day.\n\nScott Stevens, the director of the Native American and Indigenous Studies Program at Syracuse University, said Indigenous Peoples Day is about resilience of what past cultures have endured as much as it is about honoring heritage.\n\n\"It is the recognition of our survival and, in many cases, resistance and even flourishing,\" Stevens told USA TODAY. \"There still are a lot of social and economic problems that Indigenous communities experience. There's also this idea that American Indians and Native Americans, that we're all one people. But we have diversity and our cultures are vastly different. One thing we all have in common is that our ancestors suffered because of American colonialism, so it serves as an opportunity where we can turn to each other in unity.\"\n\nHow and where is Indigenous Peoples Day celebrated?\n\nWhat states and cities celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day?\n\nOver a dozen states and more than 130 local governments have chosen to not celebrate Columbus Day altogether or replace it with Indigenous Peoples Day. Many states celebrate both. Eleven U.S. states celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day or a holiday of a similar name via proclamation, while 10 others treat it as an official holiday. The 10 states that observe the holiday via proclamation are Arizona, California, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, Virginia, Wisconsin, plus Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd the 10 that officially celebrate it are Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota and Vermont.\n\nSome tribal groups in Oklahoma celebrate Native American Day in lieu of Columbus Day, with some groups naming the day in honor of their individual tribes.\n\nMore than 100 cities have replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day, including Seattle, Los Angeles, Boston, Denver, Phoenix and San Francisco.\n\nStevens said that Indigenous Peoples Day being federally recognized paves way for more allies and a space for Americans to educate themselves on a deeper level, as adults, about atrocities throughout U.S. history.\n\n\"Having a federal holiday can serve as less of a celebration but more so a recognition to past and present experiences,\" Stevens said. \"I see (Indigenous Peoples Day) as an opportunity to have more critical discussion about our American history, more than what people learn in the fourth grade about the first Thanksgiving and Pocahontas.\n\n\"Having a day recognized or having critical discussion is not anti-American. What's anti-American is self-censoring what we've been through,\" he said.\n\nWhat's open, closed on Indigenous Peoples' and Columbus Day?:What to know about mail delivery, bank hours\n\nIs it offensive to celebrate Columbus Day?\n\nLast year when Biden issued the proclamation for Indigenous Peoples Day, he also issued a proclamation of Columbus Day, established by Congress and first recognized as a national holiday in 1934 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nIn his 2021 speech, Biden praised the role of Italian Americans in U.S. society, but also referenced the violence and harm Columbus and other explorers of the age brought about on the Americas.\n\n\"We also acknowledge the painful history of wrongs and atrocities that many European explorers inflicted on tribal nations and Indigenous communities,” Biden said. “It is a measure of our greatness as a nation that we do not seek to bury these shameful episodes of our past – that we face them honestly, we bring them to the light, and we do all we can to address them.”\n\nThough some groups argue that Columbus Day, which is still a federal holiday, celebrates Italian American heritage, many say the holiday glorifies an exploration that led to the genocide of native peoples and paved the way for slavery.\n\nStevens said celebrating Columbus Day is outdated because of the cyclical and residual hurt caused from the past: \"To have had American colonialism looked at throughout history as not being a problem and celebrated as a good thing is deeply problematic to any of us who live in a (Native-American) community or reservation.\"\n\nStevens argued some Americans have a tendency to ignore that Native Americans were \"forced to be assimilated into Euro-American culture,\" and hold a misconception that Indigenous communities are only \"set in the past.\"\n\n\"We're a minority of three percent in a land that in 1491 was one hundred percent ours,\" Stevens said.\n\nAlthough Columbus is credited as the \"discoverer\" of the New World, millions of people already inhabited the Americas. Columbus made four expeditions to the Caribbean and South America over two decades, enslaving and decimating populations and opening the floodgates of European colonization.\n\nMany groups have called for the removal of monuments to Columbus.\n\n\"For over 500 years, Indigenous people have been fighting for their survival, land and rights,” Les Begay, a Diné Nation member and co-founder of the Indigenous Peoples Day Coalition of Illinois, said last October. “Each October, when Columbus is honored, it further diminishes and erases Native people, their history and their culture.\"\n\nWhen was Columbus Day established?\n\nColumbus Day celebrations date back to 1792, when New York City celebrated the 300th anniversary of Columbus' landfall. President Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed Columbus Day a national holiday in 1934 – one of 10 official federal holidays.\n\nEditor's note: A previous version of this story published in 2021.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/25/vietnam-medal-stamps-honor/27924373/", "title": "Postal Service honors Vietnam Medal of Honor recipients", "text": "Greg Toppo\n\nUSATODAY\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON — During the annual Memorial Day Observation on Monday at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the U.S. Postal Service added one more honor: commemorating Medal of Honor recipients from the Vietnam War by issuing a set of limited-edition Forever stamps.\n\nA total of 258 Vietnam War veterans have earned the Medal of Honor, which the military calls its most prestigious decoration. It is reserved for those who distinguish themselves through \"conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty\" while in action. Nearly two-thirds of the Vietnam-era recipients received the medal posthumously.\n\nThe set of three stamps issued Monday honor 48 of the 54 living recipients. Six chose not to participate, the Postal Service said. It has ordered a printing of 30 million of the stamps.\n\n\"For me, I think that today's ceremony is an example of how our country has become more open and receptive, more willing to listen to what those of us who have gone through war have learned,\" said Medal of Honor recipient Gary Beikirch, 68, who lives near Rochester, N.Y.\n\nAnother medal recipient, Brian Thacker, 70, a retired Veterans Administration employee who lives in Wheaton, Md., said the stamps are significant, since they honor, among others, a group of soldiers who are \"a living group, living people, and that makes it very different.\"\n\nThough many of us now communicate by e-mail and text message, he said, there will always be a place for stamps, even if they don't finance the Postal Service on their own. He called postage stamps \"a very quiet reminder\" of the importance of the First Amendment. \"I think they'll be around for long.\"\n\nThe popular Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the National Mall has attracted an estimated 100 million visitors since 1982. It honors the 58,307 who died in the line of duty. Nearly 304,000 were wounded.

Pomeroy Foundation, Paddy Hill School and the site of the former Odenbach Shipbuilding Corp. in Greece now sport the distinctive blue signs with yellow borders.\n\nAnd in Bergen, Genesee County, a sign locates the house of C.E. Housel, who was convicted of fraud after the bank he owned closed abruptly in 1929. (More on that later.)\n\nAbout 450 Pomeroy Foundation markers are sprinkled throughout the state, all because William G. Pomeroy, a successful businessman from the Syracuse area with an interest in genealogy, began looking for a way to increase awareness of local history.\n\nFor years, the New York state Department of Education had marked the sites of important events and people with metal signs, but that program ended in 1966.\n\nPomeroy and his wife, Sandra, decided to pick up where the state had left off, and, through their foundation, in 2006 they began funding roadside historical makers in Onondaga County.\n\nThe program then expanded to other counties in the Syracuse area. And, in 2012, not-for-profit groups and municipalities throughout the New York state became eligible to apply. The foundation is now also giving grants in Ohio.\n\nThe foundation covers the cost of the markers — a little over $1,000 — which are cast in a foundry in Ohio.\n\n“We enjoy doing it,” says Susan Hughes, the historical grant specialist for the foundation. “It really is fascinating, and I have learned so much about New York state history. Now I drive around with very different eyes.”\n\nOdenbach plant in Greece to get historic marker\n\nShips were created in Greece\n\nHughes suggests there’s an art to get the right information on the signs. The title line allows 15 characters and the five body lines can have 27 each. That totals 150 characters, pretty much a tweet.\n\n“I think of it as poetry or putting a puzzle together,” she says. “We’ve learned over the years there are certain ways to say things that get your point across.”\n\nThus, the marker in Bergen for the C.E. Housel home, hits all the right key words: “private bank closed abruptly,” “depositors lost nearly all of their funds. C.E. Housel found guilty of fraud.”\n\nThat’s a much condensed version of a story that dominated the news in 1929 and 1930, a time when banks were crashing everywhere. It ended when Charles E. Housel pleaded guilty to receiving deposits when he knew his bank was insolvent. He was fined $1,000 and given a one-year suspended sentence.\n\n“History is messy,” Hughes says. “It wasn’t all ‘George Washington slept here. But we can see something like that (the bank crash) was part of a national story.”\n\nIn addition to raising awareness of local history, the Pomeroy Foundation has another mission. William Pomeroy survived leukemia because he received a bone marrow transplant from an anonymous donor, whom he has since met. The foundation now encourages people to register to become donors. As of August, it had 62 donor/patient matches.\n\nSad news\n\nMarge Ann Van Iseghem, who reported on Ontario and Seneca counties for the Democrat and Chronicle and the Times-Union for many years, died on Oct. 4. She was 93.\n\nOne hundred and twenty people attended Mrs. Van Iseghem’s retirement testimonial in 1976. “I wanted to tell you all how much I loved my work,” she told the crowd. “I’ve touched all your lives. I’m the one who’s been blessed.” She went to serve two terms as Canandaigua town supervisor.\n\nA new landmark\n\nIn May, I wrote about Rochester’s Calvary-St. Andrew's Church and how the Presbyterian congregation there had been dissolved. The building at 68 Ashland St. had been a center for religious and community life in the South Wedge neighborhood since 1873.\n\nBetween 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 15, an open house at the building will celebrate its designation as a city landmark. The event will feature organ music, refreshments and a talk on the church’s art and history by art historian Marjorie Searl.\n\nMore:Memmott: A chapter in Rochester religious history ends\n\nOn your marker\n\nFor information about the criteria and application process for the roadside historical-marker grants from the William G.

Panara (1920-2014): A native of the Bronx who lost his hearing at age 10, he was a poet, writer and one of the founders of the Rochester Institute of Technology’s National Technical Institute for the Deaf. In 1967, he became its first deaf faculty member, teaching English there for 20 years before his retirement. He was also a founder of RIT’s drama club and a founding member of the National Theater of the Deaf in Connecticut. A graduate of Gallaudet University and New York University, he taught at Gallaudet before coming to RIT. In 2006, the U.S. Postal Service honored him with a 2-ounce Forever stamp.\n\nRobert Panara, pioneer of deaf studies, has stamp issued\n\nPanara both inspired and popularized deaf culture", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/1993/10/10/oh-what-a-beautiful-history-surrounds-oklahoma/62446033007/", "title": "Oh, What a Beautiful History Surrounds \"Oklahoma!\"", "text": "Rick Rogers\n\nThere's probably not a single Oklahoman over the age of 10 who doesn't know that Oklahoma's rousing state song is the only such example to hail from a Broadway musical. Or that audiences traditionally leap to their feet when the cast of a new production launches into this celebrated paean to statehood.\n\nBut there are a number of other facts about this beloved Rodgers and Hammerstein musical that have remained obscure to the general public. In an effort to remedy this situation, here are some additional facts about \"Oklahoma! \" that aren't generally known.\n\nOf the nine stage musicals written by Rodgers and Hammerstein, \"Oklahoma! \" ranks as the most popular in terms of frequency of performance. According to the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization, more than 600 productions of \"Oklahoma! \" are licensed each year.\n\nWith 1993 marking the show's 50th anniversary, that number is expected to top 900.\n\nA survey of the entertainment industry would undoubtedly reveal that there are literally hundreds of performers who have appeared in productions of \"Oklahoma! \" at some point in their careers.\n\nAmong those who have followed in the footsteps of the original cast members are Harry Stockwell, Howard Keel, John Raitt, Ridge Bond, Fess Parker, John Davidson, Harve Presnell and Jack Cassidy as Curly; Florence Henderson, Nancy Dussault and Shirley Jones as Laurey; Shelley Winters, Barbara Cook and Helen Gallagher as Ado Annie; Bobby Van, Lee Roy Reams, Harry Groener and Lara Teeter as Will Parker; Spiro Malas as Jud; Reta Shaw, Margaret Hamilton, Ruth Kobart and Mary Wickes as Aunt Eller; Bert Parks and Stubby Kaye as Ali Hakim.\n\nDecca made history in 1943 when it brought the entire cast into the recording studio for what would become the first original cast album of a Broadway musical. The idea proved immensely popular and now, 50 years later, audiences unable to travel to Broadway can get a glimpse of the glamour and excitement of a night in the theater by listening to a musical's original Broadway cast recording.\n\nThat original cast album of \"Oklahoma\" also earned a place in the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in 1976. This special Grammy Award joins the show's previously earned special Pulitzer Prize and the film's two Oscars.\n\nIt may surprise some people to learn that \"Oklahoma! \" didn't win any Tony Awards. The reason: the show was produced four years before the Tonys were initiated. However, that situation was remedied in June when the musical was honored with a special Tony Award in celebration of its 50th anniversary.\n\nDuring its five year, nine-week run on Broadway, \"Oklahoma! \" tallied up an impressive 2,212 performances, which earned it the distinction of becoming the longest running musical in Broadway history. It held that honor from July 1, 1946 to July 11, 1961 when it was finally overtaken by \"My Fair Lady. \" On the list of the longest running musicals in Broadway history, \"Oklahoma! \" remained in the top 10 until just recently when a pair of popular musicals from the 1980s surpassed its original run of 2,212 performances. \"Les Miserables\" did so in August 1992 and was later followed by Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"The Phantom of the Opera\" during the summer of 1993.\n\nThe film version of \"Oklahoma! \" was released by 20th Century Fox in October 1955 and was awarded two Academy Awards the following spring. Oscars were awarded for best scoring of a musical film and for best sound recording. Because no suitable location could be found within the Sooner State, the movie was filmed near Nogales, Arizona.\n\n\"Oklahoma! \" holds the distinction of being the first Broadway musical honored with a postage stamp. In March 1993, the U.S. Postal Service helped to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the musical's debut with a special stamp day ceremony held in Oklahoma City.\n\nOn July 14, the Postal Service released three other stamps to complete a new series honoring the Broadway musical. The collection includes \"Oklahoma! \" \"My Fair Lady,\" \"Porgy and Bess\" and \"Show Boat. \" When Rodgers and Hammerstein adapted Lynn Riggs' play \"Green Grow the Lilacs\" for their musical version titled \"Oklahoma! \" the authors took some artistic liberties in the process.\n\nThe characters Laurey, Curly and Aunt Eller survived the transformation from play to musical basically intact but Riggs' villain Jeeter was renamed Jud. The characters Ado Annie and Ali Hakim were given greater prominence but to make that love triangle complete, Hammerstein invented Annie's boyfriend Will Parker, a character only mentioned in passing in Riggs' play.\n\nBefore \"Oklahoma! \" Rodgers generally wrote the music first and then submitted his melodies to collaborator Lorenz Hart. When he teamed up with Hammerstein, the process reversed.\n\nHammerstein was often known to spend weeks polishing up a single lyric but the prolific and fast working Rodgers generally finished setting the tune in a matter of minutes. Rodgers once remarked that \"when the lyrics are right, it's easier to write a tune than to bend over and tie your shoe laces. \" BIOG: NAME:\n\nArchive ID: 553690", "authors": [], "publish_date": "1993/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/events/things-to-do/2023/02/01/black-history-month-2023-louisville-events-and-celebrations/69820356007/", "title": "Here are 25+ events and ways to celebrate Black History Month in ...", "text": "Black History Month, also known as African-American History Month, is celebrated each February.

She was 93.\n\nAthough Evans may not have been as well-known among Hoosiers, her influence was deeply felt on education, literature and black culture in the state and nation.\n\nShe was honored last year with the unveiling of a 30-foot-tall mural on Mass Ave. in Downtown Indianapolis by artist Michael \"Alkemi\" Jordan.\n\nARRANGEMENTS:Funeral for famed Indianapolis poet Mari Evans will be Monday\n\nShauta Marsh, curator at the Big Car Collective and the organizer of the Mari Evans mural project, said she was inspired by Evans when she first learned about her a decade ago.\n\nShe recently worked with another artist, Carl Pope, on a wall installation — including photos of Evans and quotes from some of her writings — from November through mid-January at the Tube Factory Artspace on the city's south side.\n\n\"There's no one who can compare to her and replace her,\" Marsh said. \"I believe she has, to this day, continued to influence people. ... I felt like she did more for me than I did for her.\"\n\nMike Mather, pastor of Broadway United Methodist Church, where Evans liked to attend services for the past 15 years or so, would see her once a week on Tuesdays and remembered his close friend as being spirited and engaging — with a sharp sense of humor — up until the end of her life. She was a member of Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church for years.\n\n\"She was always feisty and smart,\" Mather said. \"She was insightful and interesting. … She wasn't afraid to share her opinion, and, like most thoughtful people, she chose her words very carefully.\"\n\nMather said Evans also loved working with and being around young people, and participated often as a judge in a national literary competition for youth writers. When she was finished judging, she would give away those books to children in the neighborhood.\n\nEvans was an accomplished artist who not only wrote poems, but also was an essayist on American culture, a playwright, an educator and a local TV personality. She also wrote juvenile fiction, including a book about teen pregnancy.\n\nBorn in 1923 in Toledo, Ohio, Evans lived in Indianapolis since 1947. She taught at Indiana and Cornell universities and Spellman College, and received an honorary doctorate from Marian College in 1975. She wrote, directed and produced \"The Black Experience\" for WTTV-4 from 1968-73. And she was even featured on a Ugandan postage stamp.\n\nDan Carpenter, an Indianapolis writer and poet and former IndyStar columnist, also was a friend of Evans and he said he first became aware of her when he read her essay \"Ethos and Creativity\" that was included in a mid-1990s compilation of works by Hoosier artists reflecting on life in Indiana. Carpenter said it was a \"powerful and angry piece of social criticism\" that decried the devastation of Indianapolis' black community on the west side with the construction of I-65 and the campus of Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis.\n\nCarpenter said Evans was well-known in literary circles on the East Coast, but he called her a \"hidden treasure in Indianapolis.\" He said her activism and pursuit of social justice were key themes in her writing and throughout her life.\n\n\"She had this unwavering sense of African-American identity,\" Carpenter said. \"She never stopped reminding people of their unique experiences — both the trials of African-Americans and their gifts, their resources and their contributions.\"\n\nEvans was a friend and contemporary of Nikki Giovanni and other black writers, musicians and artist of the 1960s. Carpenter said Evans began to receive \"pretty serious recognition\" of her achievements in the final years of her life, including the mural and a tribute to her at the Indianapolis Central Library in October 2015.\n\nDespite her renown, to many here in Indianapolis, Evans was just a special and respected person in their community.\n\nClete Ladd, a professor of education at the University of Phoenix and an educator at a local charter school, Kindezi Academy, said he only knew Evans as \"Sister Mari,\" when he was a teenager growing up in the same Indianapolis neighborhood. It wasn't until he attended a literary event with her in Chicago years later that he realized her international fame, when a woman from Russia walked up to Evans and told her how much she loved her work.\n\n\"She would do anything for us,\" Ladd recalled, including her regular donations of hats and gloves for the students at Indianapolis Public School 69.\n\n\"She wanted to make sure the kids had warm heads, warm hands and warm hearts. That's what she would always say.\"\n\nFuneral arrangements are still pending.\n\nCall IndyStar digital producer Dwight Adams at (317) 444-6532.

We still have a problem with Covid. We’re still doing a lot of work on it. It’s – but the pandemic is over,” Biden said.\n\nThe US government still designates Covid-19 a Public Health Emergency and the World Health Organization says it remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. But the President’s comments follow other hopeful comments from global health leaders.\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said in a news briefing last week that the end of the Covid-19 pandemic was “in sight,” and that the world has never been in a better position to end the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“Last week, the number of weekly reported deaths from Covid-19 was the lowest since March 2020,” Ghebreyesus said. “We have never been in a better position to end the pandemic. We’re not there yet, but the end is in sight.”\n\nLast month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adjusted its Covid-19 guidance to urge the nation away from measures such as quarantines and social distancing and instead focus on reducing severe disease from Covid-19. But the agency says some people, including those who are older, immunocompromised, have certain disabilities or underlying health conditions, are at higher risk for serious illness, and may need to take more precautions.\n\nThere were about 65,000 new Covid-19 cases reported each day over the past two weeks, data from Johns Hopkins University shows, and reported cases are dropping in almost every state. Across the United States, about 400 people are dying every day from Covid-19. Although official case counts are far from representative of true levels of transmission, forecasts published by the CDC say that new hospitalizations and deaths will hold steady for the next month.\n\nFor people hospitalized for Covid-19, the risk of dying fell to the lowest it’s ever been during the Omicron wave, according to a study published last week by the CDC. The researchers suggest that there were several contributing factors to the improved mortality risk: high levels of immunity, both from vaccination and previous infection, advances in treatments and properties of the Omicron subvariants that made them less likely to cause disease.\n\nBiden on 2024\n\nThe President told “60 Minutes” in the interview aired Sunday he had not made a “firm decision” on whether he would run for reelection in 2024 but said he intended to run.\n\n“Look, my intention, as I said to begin with, is that I would run again. But it’s just an intention. But is it a firm decision that I run again? That remains to be seen,” Biden said.\n\nThe President said: “I’m a great respecter of fate. And so, what I’m doing is I’m doing my job. I’m gonna do that job. And within the time frame that makes sense after this next election cycle here, going into next year, make a judgment on what to do.”\n\nThe President and top administration officials have maintained the President intends to run again in 2024, but Biden told ABC in December that it would depend on whether he was in good health.\n\n‘I don’t want to get myself in the middle’\n\nBiden told CBS he had not been briefed on the contents of the documents that were removed from former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence by the FBI in August, and said he did not want to interfere with any potential actions by the Department of Justice.\n\n“I have not asked for the specifics of those documents because I don’t want to get myself in the middle of whether or not the Justice Department should move or not move on certain actions they could take. I – I agreed I would not tell them what to do and not, in fact, engage in telling them how to prosecute or not,” Biden said.\n\nThe Justice Department removed 11 sets of classified documents from Mar-a-Lago while executing a search warrant for possible violations of the Espionage Act and other crimes, according to unsealed court documents.\n\nAsked what his reaction was when he saw the photograph taken by the FBI that showed an array of documents found on Trump’s property, Biden said: “How that could possibly happen? How one – anyone could be that irresponsible?”\n\n“And I thought what data was in there that may compromise sources and methods? By that I mean names of people who helped or, et cetera. And it just, totally irresponsible,” Biden said.\n\nBiden said no one has briefed him on whether important national security secrets were revealed by the storage of those documents at the former President’s residence.\n\n“I have not personally spoken to anyone on that – in that regard. I’m sure my administration is aware of all of that, and so is the National Security Council. But I have not,” Biden said.\n\nThe President also told CBS that US military personnel would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. The President was asked whether “US forces, US men and women would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion,” a prospect US officials privately fear is becoming more likely.\n\n“Yes,” Biden responded.\n\nIt’s not the first time Biden has gone beyond the US approach of “strategic ambiguity” when it comes to Taiwan. During a visit to Tokyo in May, Biden said the US would intervene militarily if China attempts to take Taiwan by force.\n\nThe White House has consistently said after Biden’s comments that US policy hadn’t changed, and “60 Minutes” reported receiving a similar response to Biden’s answers in their interview.\n\nUnder the “One China” policy, the US acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing’s claim to the self-governing island of 23 million. Biden repeated his commitment to those policies in the “60 Minutes” interview.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Kate Sullivan Jamie Gumbrecht Allie Malloy Kevin Liptak", "Kate Sullivan", "Jamie Gumbrecht", "Allie Malloy", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/19/coronavirus-more-lawmakers-self-quarantining-after-positive-tests/2873207001/", "title": "Coronavirus: FDA looking at therapies being tested against ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump has canceled a meeting of G-7 leaders that was set for Camp David this summer and will convene a video teleconference with them instead, the White House confirmed Thursday.\n\nThe decision to meet by video teleconference in June instead of in person was made “in order for each country to focus all of its resources on responding to the health and economic challenges of COVID-19,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said.\n\nTrump, who held a video teleconference with G-7 leaders earlier this week, also will convene teleconferences with them in April and May so they can continue their coordination efforts, Deere said.\n\nThe annual G-7 summit brings together leaders of world’s most industrialized countries, including the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and Japan.

Assistance for couples phases out after $150,000 and is not available to those with joint incomes of more than $198,000.\n\nThe proposal, which does not yet have a price tag, would also extend the tax filing deadline until July 15. The IRS has already extended the payment deadline until that date.\n\nMcConnell said Republicans would begin discussions with Democrats Friday, along with administration officials.\n\nSenate Democrats have priorities of their own, and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer complained Thursday that they've been left out of discussions.\n\n\"It had virtually no input from Democrats,\" Schumer said after McConnell released his plan.\n\nA few hours later, Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a joint statement saying their first impression of the proposal is that it is \"not at all pro-worker and instead puts corporations way ahead of workers.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n$1,200 cash:Senate GOP proposes coronavirus economic rescue package\n\nHillary Clinton: If Trump hasn’t used Defense Production Act, he’s ‘failing Americans’\n\nFormer Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton weighed in on President Donald Trump's reluctance to utilize the authorities granted to him by invoking the Defense Production Act.\n\nThe wartime act allows Trump to direct private companies to produce vital equipment, such as face masks, which hospitals across the country are experiencing a shortage of. He announced he was invoking the act on Wednesday and later called using it a worst-case scenario. Thursday Trump said he hoped he wouldn’t have to use that authority.\n\n“Let’s try this again, @realdonaldtrump: Hospitals are already running out of ventilators and beds. Nurses are using bandannas as masks,” Clinton said.\n\n“If you’ve already ordered more with the Defense Production Act, tell us now. If you haven’t you’re failing Americans.”\n\nTrump has been urged by Democratic lawmakers to direct private companies to produce medical equipment so the government may distribute it to hospitals slammed with coronavirus cases.\n\nAsked whether he has “pulled the trigger” on the act Thursday, Trump said he had not. “We hope we’re not going to need that.”\n\n“Governors are supposed to be doing a lot of this work, and they are doing a lot of this work. The federal government is not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items, and then shipping. You know, we're not a shipping clerk,” Trump said.\n\nBut when pressed on it, Trump said: “If we find that we need something, we will do that. And you don't know what we've done. You don't know if we've invoked it. You don't know what's been ordered.\"\n\n– Jeanine Santucci\n\nUS, Mexico consider border restrictions\n\nU.S. and Mexican officials are working on an agreement to ban \"non-essential\" travel between their border along the same lines of the deal that the U.S. announced this week with Canada, a Trump administration official said. Trade would be exempted.\n\nOfficials are hoping to make an announcement soon, the official said.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke with his Mexican counterpart, Foreign Secretary Marcelo Luis Ebrard Casaubon, earlier this week to discuss containment and mitigation efforts.\n\n“The United States continues to work closely with Mexico on the full range of foreign policy issues, among them securing our shared border,” State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in a readout of that conversation.‎\n\n– David Jackson and Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nNew law helps health care providers get masks\n\nA new law protected manufacturers of safety masks from lawsuits so that they could provide millions more masks for hospital workers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed legislation Wednesday that included the provision from a bipartisan group of lawmakers to protect manufacturers such as 3M from liability for selling industrial masks to health care providers.\n\n3M can produce 35 million of the masks each month and ramped up to capacity in January, according to Vice President Mike Pence, who visited the company as head of a coronavirus task force. Honeywell can make 120 million masks per year, he said.\n\n“Those companies have now greatly increased by the tens of millions their production of so-called N-95 masks that will give our health care workers the protection that they need to minister to those that are dealing with the symptoms or the disease of coronavirus,” Pence said Thursday at a White House news conference. “Following the signing of last night’s bill, all of those masks now have liability protection and the companies can sell industrial masks to hospitals.”\n\nJoseph Milot, president of Protective Industrial Products Inc., called the legislation “a vital measure to protect the American public and those in the medical field that will be asked to protect us all.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nState Department to Americans: 'Do Not Travel' abroad\n\nThe State Department told Americans not to travel overseas at all, the strongest U.S. alert yet as the novel coronavirus continued its steady march across the globe.\n\nThe department on Thursday issued a Level 4 \"do not travel\" advisory, its most acute warning, telling U.S. citizens “to avoid all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19.”\n\nThe State Department noted that foreign governments are closing their borders, implementing mandatory quarantines, and barring entry and exit with little advance notice.\n\n“If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be severely disrupted, and you may be forced to remain outside of the United States for an indefinite timeframe,” the agency said.\n\n\"In countries where commercial departure options remain available, U.S. citizens who live in the United States should arrange for immediate return to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period,\" the advisory said.\n\nAnd Americans who live abroad should plan to hunker down in place, the advisory said.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nConnecticut postpones primary\n\nConnecticut Secretary of State Denise Merrill announced Thursday that the state's presidential primary election is being postponed.\n\nThe election was going to be held on April 28, but is now moved to June 2.\n\n“My most important concerns are allowing every Connecticut voter to make their voice heard in the selection of the presidential candidates, and ensuring that they are able to cast their ballots as safely as possible,\" Merrill said in a statement on Twitter.\n\nMerrill added that she consulted with Gov. Ned Lamont, as well as local election officials, the bipartisan leadership in the state legislature and officials in other states ahead of her announcement.\n\n- Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump considering block grants to help states\n\nWASHINGTON — Trump told the nation's governors Thursday that he is \"very strongly\" considering block grants for states to help confront the coronavirus.\n\nTrump made the remarks from the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has $40 billion in disaster aid available after Trump declared the virus a national emergency last week.\n\nBlock grants would give states considerable flexibility to use federal money where local officials see the most pressing needs.\n\nVice President Mike Pence said industrial N95 masks can now be used in medical settings. State officials have been clamoring for the federal government to speed the distribution of the masks and other medical supplies. Earlier this week, Pence called on construction firms to donate their N95 masks to hospitals.\n\n- John Fritze\n\nLawmakers concerned after 2 House members test positive\n\nAfter two House members were diagnosed with coronavirus, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told fellow House Democrats in a letter Thursday that lawmakers would remain on a recess until the next coronavirus emergency aid package was ready and needed to be voted on.\n\nHoyer acknowledged there were new concerns from lawmakers after Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah, announced they tested positive for the rapidly spreading virus. The announcement prodded about a dozen other lawmakers to go into self quarantine.\n\nHoyer said changes were being worked out to prevent mass groups from voting at the same time on the House floor.\n\n\"I share the concerns of many Members regarding the number of Members on the House Floor at any one time,\" he said in a letter to Democrats. \"I therefore expect that the House will adjust our voting procedures in order to follow the CDC’s recommendations.\"\n\nHoyer added no decisions have been made on changes but said \"we will be discussing all options.\"\n\nSome lawmakers have argued that the House and Senate should allow lawmakers to vote remotely to prevent the spread of the virus but House and Senate leaders have so far resisted such requests. On Thursday, Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Rob Portman, R-Ohio, introduced a resolution that would allow senators to vote remotely during a national crisis.\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nTrump touts drugs' 'potential' to fight coronavirus, FDA commissioner is more cautious\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday two drugs already prescribed for other purposes have shown “great potential” for combating coronavirus, but his Food and Drug Administration commissioner offered a more cautionary view.\n\n“I think it could be a game-changer,” Trump said at a White House neconference. “We believe these therapeutics and others under evaluation right now will be able to provide relief to many Americans.”\n\nThe two drugs are hydroxychloroquine, used to treat malaria, and the antiviral drug remdesivir.\n\nRemdesivir, Trump said, has been approved “or very close to approved.”\n\nBut FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn was more cautious in his comments. He said he had “great hope” but not “false hope.”\n\nThe malaria drug, Hahn said, can be tested in “compassionate care” cases for very sick patients outside of normal trials. Beyond that, he said, its use for coronavirus needs “a large, pragmatic clinical trial.”\n\nOn remdesivir, he said, “We need to actually know about the safety and the effectiveness.”\n\n- Richard Wolf\n\nTrump signals he's open to government taking equity stake in companies\n\nPresident Donald Trump signaled Thursday that he could be open to the federal government taking an equity stake in companies that have been impacted by the coronavirus.\n\nAsked if he supported the idea, the president said: \"I do. I really do.\" But he declined to discuss specific companies. Minutes later he said the government would help the airlines, cruise and hotel industries but did not say that effort would involve buying stock.\n\n- John Fritze\n\nState Department to warn Americans not to travel abroad\n\nThe State Department will soon warn Americans not to travel abroad at all, as officials planned to issue the strongest U.S. alert yet as the coronavirus continued its steady march across the globe, according to Politico and the New York Times.\n\nThe expected \"Do Not Travel\" advisory will tells U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel, the two outlets reported.\n\nFor Americans already abroad, the State Department will advise them to either return to the U.S. – or prepare to hunker down where they are.\n\nThe Level 4 advisory – the State Department's most acute warning – will ramp up its previous advice of telling Americans to reconsider travel abroad.\n\nThe advisory is not a mandate; Americans can still leave the U.S.\n\nBut they do so at their own risk. Hundreds of Americans have been stranded overseas amid a global freeze on international travel and mass quarantines sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n- Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nMcConnell outlines Senate GOP stimulus plan\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell outlined the “four key components” of Senate Republicans’ plan to inject money into the economy as the economic impact of the coronavirus mounts.\n\nNeither text nor a cost for the final plan has been released yet.\n\nHere is what McConnell said Senate Republicans’ plan would do:\n\nProvide “hundreds of billions of dollars” of federally-guaranteed loans to help small businesses.\n\n“Direct financial help for Americans” in the form of payments that would complement unemployment insurance for laid-off Americans, Social Security for seniors, and provide “extra certainty” for Americans still working. McConnell said it would be a “form of emergency tax relief.”\n\n“Targeted lending” for “industries of national importance” like airlines that have been hard-hit by the outbreak.\n\nMore resources for “the front lines of our fight against the virus.”\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nTrump: Japan considering postponing the Olympics\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Japan is thinking about postponing the Olympics this year, but hasn't made a decision yet.\n\nTrump told reporters he discussed the issue with Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\n\"We'll live with his decision.\" Trump said of Abe. \"He has told us he has not made a decision.\"\n\n- David Jackson\n\nTrump on coronavirus illnesses in Congress: Hope they'll get better\n\nPresident Donald Trump was about the members of Congress who have tested positive for the virus, saying, “I know all of them … Hopefully they’re all going to get better. It’s one of those things – it’s Congress.”\n\nTrump praised Congress members who have self-quarantined after possibly being exposed to the virus while they await their test results. “I think Congress has behaved unbelievably well in that regard,\" he said.\n\n- Michael Collins\n\nTrump on possible travel restrictions\n\nWhen asked about reports that the State Department may advise Americans not to travel, Trump told reporters: \"We're speaking with the State Department later.\"\n\nPolitico reported Thursday that the State Department will issue an advisory that instructs Americans not to travel abroad and for Americans overseas to either return to the United States or stay where they are.\n\nThis week, the administration rolled out social distancing guidelines to be used for 15 days to combat the spread of coronavirus. When asked how likely it is that will be extended, Trump said, \"I can only tell you on the 14th day.\"\n\n- John Fritze\n\nSurgeon General: 'Give blood today'\n\nAmid all the talk of social distancing, Surgeon General Jerome Adams used a White House news conference Thursday to urge that Americans donate blood.\n\nOne donation can save three lives, Adams said. He added that blood donation centers are taking precautionary measures to ensure it is safe for donors, such as spacing donation beds six feet apart and regularly taking the temperature of staff members.\n\n“Social distancing does not have to mean social disengagement,” Adams said. “So give blood today.”\n\n- Richard Wolf\n\nPence: 3M ramping up mask production\n\nVice President Mike Pence said Thursday that Minnesota-based 3M had significantly increased production of N95 masks needed by front line health care workers, but it was unclear when those masks would make it to hospitals and medical offices.\n\nPence said 3M ramped up production to 35 million masked per month. Pressed on when those masks would get to health care workers, Pence said “they’re in the marketplace now. We’ve vastly increased the supply of medical masks.”\n\n- John Fritze\n\nFDA commissioner: new coronavirus therapies could take 'three to six months'\n\nFood and Drug Commissioner Stephen Hahn said it could take “three to six months” to develop new therapies specifically designed to address coronavirus.\n\nIn the meantime, Hahn said the agency is looking at the impact several currently approved drugs may have on patients.\n\n“They're looking at pushing that to the months period of time,” Hahn said. He estimated the approval of a vaccine at about 12 months.\n\nTrump mentioned at least two drugs that researchers are studying and that he said the FDA is focusing on. One of them, hydroxychloroquine, is a drug that has long been approved for malaria. Another drug, remdesivir, is an experimental antiviral.\n\nTrump expressed optimism about the drugs, but FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said the agency was still studying their efficacy.\n\n- John Fritze\n\nWhen will life return to normal?: 'I hope very soon,' says Trump\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he hopes American life can return to normal \"very soon\" after coronavirus defense measures have shutdown schools, offices, restaurants and many other aspects of business and social life.\n\nAsked when Americans can go back to their regular lives, Trump said: “I hope very soon. We’ll see. This is uncharted territory.”\n\n- Michael Collins\n\nFEMA in charge of coronavirus response\n\nVice President Mike Pence said Trump has put Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in charge of the coronavirus response.\n\nPence said he and Trump will hold a teleconference today with the nation’s governors from FEMA headquarters.\n\n- Michael Collins\n\nRep. Judy Chu slams Trump's use of 'Chinese virus'\n\nRep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., the chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, slammed President Donald Trump's use of \"Chinese virus\" in the coronavirus task force press conference Thursday and in his tweets.\n\n\"No matter how much he calls it the 'Chinese virus,' no matter how many hate crimes he incites, Donald Trump cannot hide from his own failure to address this crisis from the beginning,\" Chu wrote in a tweet.\n\nTrump has continued to use \"Chinese virus\" to refer to the coronavirus despite advocates' and health experts' calls to avoid using names that could stigmatize certain ethnic communities.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nAmerican prisoner in Lebanon released amid coronavirus pandemic\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday that an American imprisoned in Lebanon will be allowed to return to the United States, as his administration ramps up pressure on foreign governments to release detained US citizens amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTrump was referring to Amer Fakhoury, who has faced months of detention despite being diagnosed with Stage IV lymphoma.\n\nThe State Department said Fakhoury “is returning to the United States where he will be reunited with his family and receive urgent medical treatment. His return comes as a relief to those who have followed the case with grave concern.”\n\nTrump announced Fakhoury’s release during a coronavirus briefing at the White House on Thursday, saying release of U.S. hostages “continues to be a top priority for my administration.”\n\n- Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nTrump said he's no longer shaking hands\n\nAfter drawing criticism for shaking hands with public health officials at a Rose Garden event last week, President Donald Trump said Thursday he was dropping the practice – at least for now.\n\nTrump introduced Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn during a briefing at the White House, but said his greetings would remain verbal only.\n\n“I’d shake his hand but I’m not supposed to do that,” Trump said.\n\nTrump has been heavily criticized for not modeling \"social distancing\" medical experts have said is needed to contain the contagion. At a Rose Garden news conference last Friday, he clasped hands with an array of officials who joined him at the podium.\n\n- John Fritze\n\nTrump: FDA looking at therapies still being tested to fight coronavirus\n\nPresident Donald Trump said the Food and Drug Administration is looking at using therapies that are still being tested in the fight against coronavirus.\n\nTrump, during a news conference with the coronavirus task force on Thursday, praised FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn for \"removing barriers\" to new therapies that can help fight coronavirus.\n\nTrump continued to express optimism that the U.S. will \"win\" the fight against coronavirus\n\n\"It’s too bad because we’ve never had an economy as good as the economy we had just a few weeks ago,\" he said. \"But we’ll be back.”\n\nTrump says things appear to be going well on Capitol Hill, where the White House and Congress are currently negotiating a massive economic stimulus plan to combat the impacts of coronavirus. The plan could include checks for Americans and bailouts for major industries.\n\nWhat else was said at the briefing:\n\nTrump said Hahn, who is a member of the coronavirus task force, “has been working 24 hours a day. He has worked probably as hard or harder than anybody in this group other than Mike Pence – or me.”\n\nTrump said a U.S. prisoner in Lebanon is returning to the United States, saying the return of hostages \"continues to be a top priority for my administration.\"\n\nTrump said almost the whole world is inflicted “with this horrible virus,\" saying it \"surprised the whole world.”\n\nTrump praised Americans for pulling together during the pandemic, including lawmakers. “I think there’s a great spirit where the Democrats and the Republicans and everybody else are getting together and they’re trying to get things done.”\n\nAsked if he could guarantee that coronavirus stimulus money would not be used by companies for executive bonuses or stock buybacks, Trump said: “We don’t want that. … It’s hard to tell them not to, but I would tell them not to.”\n\n- David Jackson and Michael Collins\n\nGuard chief says 27 states have activated National Guardsmen\n\nThe chief of the National Guard Bureau on Thursday compared the coronavirus crisis to hurricanes hitting all 54 states, territories and the District of Columbia simultaneously.\n\nGovernors in 27 states have activated Guardsmen for missions including medical testing, transportation and distributing food, Air Force Gen. Joseph Lengyel said.\n\nThere are 2,050 Guardsmen called to duty because of the virus, and that number is likely to double by the weekend, he said.\n\n“This could quickly blossom in the next couple of weeks,” Lengyel said.\n\n- Tom Vanden Brook\n\nIran releases detained American amid coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe Iranian government has temporarily released Michael White, a Navy veteran from California, from an Iranian prison where he’s been held since July 2018, the State Department announced on Thursday.\n\nThe Trump administration has increased its pressure on Iran and other foreign governments to release detained Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“Michael White, who has been wrongfully detained by the Iranian regime since 2018 and is serving a 13-year sentence, was released today on a medical furlough,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. “His release on humanitarian grounds was conditioned upon him staying in Iran. Michael is now in the custody of the Swiss embassy and will undergo medical testing and evaluation.”\n\nWhite was arrested in July 2018, after reportedly going to the country to visit his girlfriend. He was charged and convicted of insulting Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and posting private information online, according to media reports.\n\nPompeo called on the Iranian government to release other detained Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic. Iran has been particularly hard hit by the disease.\n\n- Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nMnuchin offers timeline for $1,000 payments if stimulus passes\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the Trump administration wants checks of $1,000 per person and $500 per child to go out within three weeks of Congress passing a stimulus package.\n\n\"The plan is $500 billion in two tranches,” Mnuchin said on Fox Business’ Mornings with Maria. “The first one would be $1,000 per person, $500 per child,\" or $3,000 for a family of four, Mnuchin said. \"As soon as Congress passes this, we will get this out in three weeks, and then six weeks later, if the president still has a national emergency, we'll deliver another $3,000.\"\n\nBreaking down the administration's trillion-dollar proposal, Mnuchin said he also wanted $300 billion to go towards small businesses for “hiring people, keeping people on the payroll, and if they do, there will be loan forgiveness.”\n\nAnother component involved $200 billion for “securing lending to airlines, and for other critical industries.”\n\nMnuchin's plan has not been approved by Congress. Negotiations between congressional leaders and the White House are ongoing.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nPentagon reports 81 coronavirus cases\n\nThe Pentagon reported 81 cases of coronavirus Thursday, down eight cases from Wednesday. The military report includes troops, their families, civilian employees and contractors.\n\nThere was an uptick of two troops to 51 cases on Thursday.\n\nThe military continues to house 1,431 passenger in quarantine from the Grand Princess cruise ship.\n\n- Tom Vanden Brook\n\nMore lawmakers self-quarantining\n\nSeveral members of the House of Representatives announced they would voluntarily go into self-quarantine after two members of the House announced Wednesday they tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nAt least a half-dozen lawmakers said they would go into self-quarantine after Reps. Mario Diaz Balart, R-Fla., and Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, announced their positive tests Wednesday evening.\n\n'Like preparing for a hurricane':Lawmakers worry about coronavirus hitting them while helping manage response\n\nThe following lawmakers announced self-quarantines after coming into contact with lawmakers who tested positive:\n\nCongress' Attending Physician Brian Monahan updated his guidance to lawmakers after the positive tests. The attending physician's website said the offices and locations found to be \"at risk\" after contact with those infected were being cleaned and disinfected. Contact with infected lawmakers on the House floor was \"considered to be low risk exposures\" and did not require any additional action from lawmakers besides reporting illness, he said.\n\nMore:2 members of Congress, Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Ben McAdams, test positive for COVID-19\n\n\"It reflects the pace of the COVID-19 disease throughout the United States and its presence here in Washington, D.C., that it has touched the community of the U.S. Capitol,\" Monahan said in a statement.\n\nOne member of Congress, Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, D-Fla., said Congress might need to change the way it does business and reconsider remote voting as an option.\n\n\"For the safety of our communities, during this emergency, we must be able to legislate from our districts,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n\nDemocratic and Republican leaders in both chambers, however, have poured cold water on the idea.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nWorking from home? Coronavirus keeps Trump cooped up, too\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been cooped up in the White House since returning to Washington from his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, on March 9. The 10-day period is the longest uninterrupted stretch Trump has stayed inside the White House, according to a USA TODAY analysis of the president’s schedule compiled by the website Factba.se.\n\nThe president will break the streak Thursday if he keeps to his schedule in the afternoon to visit the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nTrump has appeared before reporters virtually every day during that time to update the public on the administration’s response to the pandemic, usually in a White House press briefing room.\n\nTrump’s tightened schedule has apparently left less time for events outside the White House.\n\nThe president’s last rally took place on March 2 in Charlotte, N.C. On March 6, he visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and toured tornado damage in Tennessee before heading to Florida for the weekend. He hasn’t left the White House since.\n\nTrump and first lady Melania had scheduled a dinner with Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence on March 11, but those plans were canceled when the president delivered an address to the nation about COVID-19 that night.\n\nTrump rarely goes more than a week without leaving the White House. The last time he approached such a long uninterrupted stretch in the White House was in January during the government shutdown, according to the analysis. Trump ditched his usual winter Florida sojourn to negotiate with Democrats over the impasse.\n\n- John Fritze\n\nSchumer says he's meeting with McConnell on stimulus bill\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell today as negotiations continue over a massive stimulus package that could include checks for Americans affected by the coronavirus.\n\nOne of the most important issues for Democrats, Schumer said, was expanded unemployment insurance for Americans laid off as a result of the coronavirus.\n\n\"We need to have the workers being paid during this huge crisis, where no one's showing up at the restaurants and so they're not working,\" Schumer said, noting that he told Treasury Secretary Mnuchin Wednesday night the unemployment insurance provision was needed \"probably more importantly than anything else.\"\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said on the \"Hugh Hewitt Show\" that \"the priority right now\" was \"getting money to individuals that need it to help rebuild the economy.\" Romney had pitched the idea of sending checks to Americans.\n\n-Nicholas Wu", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/09/30/michigan-flavored-vape-ban-vaping-ecigarette-vapes/2424516001/", "title": "Michigan's ban on flavored vapes: Everything to know as deadline ...", "text": "Enforcement of Michigan's flavored vaping ban begins Wednesday, which means vape and tobacco shops and online retailers will no longer be able to sell flavored e-cigarettes in the state without penalty of fines and possible jail time.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer announced the flavored vape ban Sept. 4, in response to what she said is a public health emergency among kids using vaping products, making Michigan the first state to do so.\n\nThe ban is administered by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services with direction from Whitmer and instituted through Michigan's administrative rules process, which allows state agencies to create regulations or policies that, once authorized, act as laws.\n\nHere's what you need to know as Oct. 2 approaches:\n\nQuestion: What are the rules in the flavored vaping ban?\n\nANSWER: Retailers, vape re-sellers and distributors will not be able to characterize vape products as safe, clean, harmless or healthy.\n\nThey also cannot sell, offer to sell, distribute or posses with intent to sell any e-cigarette product that has a \"characterizing flavor,\" other than nicotine. It includes any flavors related to any food or drink, such as fruit, chocolate, vanilla, honey, candy, cocoa, desserts, alcoholic beverages, mint, menthol, wintergreen, herbs or spices.\n\nIn addition, advertising for vape products will be limited so they are:\n\nNot within 25 feet of the point of sale. Where this cannot be achieved, they must be placed at the greatest possible distance from the point of sale.\n\nNot with 25 feet of candy, food or soft drinks. Where this cannot be achieved, they must be placed at the greatest possible distance from the point of sale.\n\nNot \"readily seen\" by a person standing outside the building at a distance of 25 feet.\n\nTo read the complete list of rules, go to: https://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdhhs/Emergency_vaping_rules_-_signed_by_Gov-Director_9.18.19_666139_7.pdf\n\nQ: What's the penalty for selling flavored vapes?\n\nA: Violating the rules of the ban could result in a misdemeanor, punishable by up to 6 months in prison or a fine of up to $200 or both.\n\nSales of flavored vape products will be punished on a cumulative per-item, per-transaction basis.\n\nViolations of the advertising ban are calculated daily, with each 24-hour period counting as a separate violation.\n\nQ: Is this a permanent ban?\n\nA: No. The rules are effective for 180 days, which means the ban will continue only until March 30, 2020. After that, the ban can be extended for an additional six months.\n\nAfter the time runs out, Whitmer could go through the formal rules process through the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Administrative Rules to continue the ban or ask the Legislature to enact a bill that would enshrine it in state law.\n\nQ: Wasn't selling e-cigarettes to minors already illegal prior to the ban?\n\nA: Yes. On June 4, Whitmer signed Senate Bills 106 and 155, which prohibit the sale of e-cigarettes and other non-traditional nicotine products to minors. In her signing message to the Legislature, the governor criticized the legislation for not going far enough to protect Michigan’s kids from nicotine addiction, calling the marketing, packaging, and taste of e-cigarettes a “bait-and-switch” engineered to “create new nicotine addicts.”\n\nQ: Why did the governor think that sales of flavored vapes are a public health emergency?\n\nA: In her announcement of the ban, Whitmer pointed to research that shows e-cigarettes, also known as vapor products or vapes, are the most commonly-used tobacco product in the United States. Nationally, their use rose 900% among middle school and high school students between 2011-2015.\n\nSharp increases in the use of e-cigarette products among high-schoolers were reported in Michigan from 2015-2016 and 2017-2018, with counties reporting an additional 30% to 118% increases, according to the MDHHS.\n\n\"Companies selling vaping products are using candy flavors to hook children on nicotine and misleading claims to promote the belief that these products are safe,\" Whitmer said in a statement announcing the ban. \"That ends today. Our kids deserve leaders who are going to fight to protect them. These bold steps will finally put an end to these irresponsible and deceptive practices and protect Michiganders’ public health.\"\n\nIn addition, a national outbreak of 805 e-cigarette-related lung infections are now under investigation in 46 states and one U.S. territory, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and has caused 12 deaths.\n\nThe CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, state and local health departments, and other clinical and public health partners are investigating a multi-state outbreak of lung injury associated with e-cigarette product use, or vaping.\n\nAll reported patients have a history of e-cigarette product use or vaping.\n\nAmong the 771 patients for whom the CDC has data, 62% of patients are 18 to 34 years old; 22% of patients are between 18-21, and 16% of patients are under 18 years old.\n\nThe latest findings from the investigation into lung injuries associated with e-cigarette use, or vaping, suggest products containing THC play a role in the outbreak.\n\nQ: What is causing the outbreak of lung injuries?\n\nA: The latest findings from the investigation into lung injuries associated with e-cigarette use, or vaping, suggest THC products play a role in the outbreak.\n\nMost of the people who have developed lung injury reported using THC-containing products, or both THC-containing products and nicotine-containing products, according to the CDC. Some of the patients reported using only nicotine-containing products.\n\nHealth officials have yet to determine whether one or more e-cigarette or vaping products, substances, brands or methods of use is responsible for the outbreak.\n\nThe CDC has received data on substances used in e-cigarettes or vaping products in the 30 days prior to symptom onset among 514 patients. Of them:\n\nAbout 77% reported using THC-containing products; 36% reported exclusive use of THC-containing products.\n\nAbout 57% reported using nicotine-containing products; 16% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products.\n\nQ: Can Michigan's flavored vape ban be stopped?\n\nTwo lawsuits aim to stop the ban.\n\nThe first, filed in Houghton County Circuit Court by Marc Slis, owner of the 906 Vapor vape shop, seeks a temporary restraining order be issued to stop the ban while the case is being heard.\n\nSlis contends that the state's new flavored vape rules are illegal and will force him to close his store, where 80% of his inventory is prohibited under the ban.\n\nA second legal challenge came Friday from Mister E-Liquid, a Grand Rapids-based e-cigarette manufacturer, retailer and wholesaler. It was filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan and seeks an emergency relief to stop enforcement of the ban before it takes effect.\n\nIn addition, two Republican lawmakers also have taken aim at Whitmer’s efforts to ban flavored vape products in the state.\n\nRep. Steven Johnson, R-Wayland, introduced a bill Tuesday that would stop the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services from banning the sale of flavored vapes that have a nicotine level of 2% or less.\n\nMore:Flavored vape ban faces new challenge from Michigan GOP lawmakers\n\nMore:Vaping illnesses: The difference between black market and medical marijuana dispensaries\n\nAnd Rep. Beau LaFave, R-Iron Mountain, introduced a bill last week that would prohibit the state from implementing rules that limit the production, sale or use of vaping products.\n\n“The administration’s concerns about youth vaping are legitimate, but is there a way we can address that without hurting a lot of (adult) smokers who have used vaping to quit smoking,” he said. “Most of the youth are going after the high-nicotine vapes and those who are trying to quit smoking are not using those high nicotine levels.”\n\nNeither bill will get a hearing or a vote before the flavored vape ban goes into effect.\n\nQ: How will enforcement of the ban work?\n\nA: \"MDHHS is working with local and municipal law enforcement agencies regarding enforcement of the emergency rules. Enforcement of the emergency rules is a multifaceted response involving law enforcement at both state and local level and an online complaint-based system,\" said Lynn Sutfin, a spokeswoman for MDHHS.\n\nRetailers may be subject to inspection by local law enforcement, state law enforcement or the MDHHS Tobacco Section for follow up of a complaint, she said, noting that the department has two staff members within the Tobacco Section that can provide assistance.\n\nOnline sales will be enforced in the same way as retail storefront sales, Sutfin said.\n\nQ: How will penalties be decided?\n\nA: Law enforcement may refer a violation of the emergency rules to the local prosecutor for further action, Sutfin said.\n\nWhile a jail sentence is possible under the emergency rules, prosecutors have discretion with regard to the sentence that they seek for violations of the rules.\n\nQ: Are other states banning vapes, too?\n\nA: Some are.\n\nNew York state, Rhode Island and Washington state recently announced similar efforts to ban flavored vaping products. In Massachusetts, the ban includes all vape products, not just flavored.\n\nQ: What's happening at the federal level?\n\nA: President Donald Trump's administration also has signaled that it is looking at a national ban on flavored vapes. He said in September that the federal government would act to prohibit thousands of flavors used in e-cigarettes because they appeal to underage users.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it will soon issue guidance on how to take flavored vaping products off the market, said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, a process that could take months.\n\nJuul Labs Inc., the nation’s largest e-cigarette maker, said it would stop advertising its products in the U.S.\n\nQ: What are the symptoms of the vape-related respiratory illness?\n\nA: Patients who have had the vaping-related illnesses have reported:\n\nCough, shortness of breath, or chest pain\n\nNausea, vomiting, or diarrhea\n\nFatigue, fever, or abdominal pain\n\nSome patients have reported that their symptoms developed over a few days, while others have reported that their symptoms developed over several weeks. A lung infection does not appear to be causing the symptoms.\n\nQ: What should I do if I have symptoms?\n\nA: The CDC recommends seeing a medical provider right away. You can also call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222.\n\nYou can also submit a detailed report of any unexpected health or product issues related to tobacco or e-cigarette products to the FDA via the online Safety Reporting Portal.\n\nContact Kristen Jordan Shamus: 313-222-5997 or kshamus@freepress.com.

It is spread when someone unknowingly ingests the virus – even in microscopic amounts – through eating contaminated foods or drinks or through close personal contact with an infected person.\n\nHepatitis A symptoms of can last up to two months and include fatigue, nausea, stomach pain and jaundice. While most do not have a long-lasting illness, it can also be prevented with a hepatitis A vaccination, the CDC says.\n\nHow can berries get contaminated with hepatitis A?\n\nThe investigation into Willamette Valley Fruit's berries is ongoing, and no cause has been pinpointed for the potential contamination, but the virus is generally transferred to berries in two ways, according to Ellen Shumaker, Ph.D., director of outreach for Safe Plates at North Carolina State University.\n\n\"Hepatitis A is spread through the fecal to oral route, which means that if a harvest worker who has hepatitis A is handling berries without washing their hands first, the virus is likely going to contaminate the berries,\" Shumaker said.\n\nThe other, more likely cause is contaminated irrigation water, Shumaker said. The irrigation water contaminated with human feces is sprayed onto the berries and then preserved when frozen, which makes matters worse.\n\n\"The act of freezing then also helps the virus to remain on the berries,\" Shumaker said. \"Because frozen berries are often eaten without being cooked, there is no step that is removing the virus from the berries, leading to people getting sick.\"\n\nWhat frozen berry products are recalled?\n\nProducts were distributed via the following retailers:\n\nWalmart: Great Value Sliced Strawberries, Great Value Mixed Fruit, and Great Value Antioxidant Blend distributed to select Walmart stores in Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, West Virginia and Wyoming from Jan. 24, 2023, to June 8.\n\nGreat Value Sliced Strawberries, Great Value Mixed Fruit, and Great Value Antioxidant Blend distributed to select Walmart stores in Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, West Virginia and Wyoming from Jan. 24, 2023, to June 8.

It spent $16 million on Tiberius, a high-tech system meant to not only track the shipments of the vaccines but guide local decisions of where to send them.\n\nTiberius, which took Star Trek Capt. James T. Kirk's middle name, would allow “granular planning” all the way down to the doctor’s office, provide “a ZIP code-by-ZIP code view of priority populations,” and “ease the burden” on public health officials, the federal government said.\n\nBut the system hasn’t lived up to that promise. For many states, Tiberius proved either so irrelevant or so complicated that the only incentive for them to log on each week is to check the most basic of numbers: how many doses of vaccine they're getting. That has contributed to a patchy rollout, where access depends more on where you live and how internet savvy you are.\n\nMore:US struggles to make it easier to find COVID-19 vaccination appointments\n\nThe Trump administration’s embrace of Tiberius was one part of its broader effort to project competence and planning expertise as the government took on one of the most massive and complex logistical challenges in U.S. history. The ensuing friction between Operation Warp Speed, the entity leading the federal government’s vaccine planning, and state efforts was typical of the finger-pointing that emerged as the rollout became reality.\n\nIn its draft vaccination plan from Oct. 17, Tennessee stated that its Department of Health “plans to use Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping and Tiberius functionality to locate/map all critical populations.”\n\nAsked recently whether the system had met those expectations, a Tennessee Department of Health spokeswoman wrote in an email: “No. We have not found Tiberius to be helpful in this regard.”\n\nShe continued: “We run our own allocation code and use Tiberius only for tracking allocated vaccines.”\n\nA few states reported that they are using Tiberius’s tools for prioritizing at-risk populations. The Arkansas Department of Health said in a written statement that the system “allows us to identify any gaps that need to be addressed as we determine our distribution plans for the coming weeks.” A spokeswoman for the South Carolina State Emergency Response Team wrote: “Tiberius has been very helpful in looking at several different data elements to determine priority groups, equity, essential workers.”\n\nBut most states surveyed by USA TODAY, including Maryland, Nebraska, New York, Oklahoma and Wyoming, said the data Tiberius provides on demographics and vulnerable populations is less detailed than data they already have on hand. Some also criticized the timing, saying the system came too late and was too complex to learn in time for the vaccine rollout.\n\nMany of the health officials who make the final decisions on who gets the vaccine, at the county, city and other local levels, aren’t using the system at all.\n\nEven if local officials opted to use Tiberius, “they would be giving us data that they got from us,” said Dr. Bela Matyas, deputy director of public health for Solano County, California. “Local public health officials have an immense amount of data and know their communities well. They know where the at-risk populations are.”\n\nAs major segments of the population become eligible, sorting this out is becoming increasingly important to ensure swaths of America are not left behind.\n\n“The states that have done well have built in this kind of hyper-local, detailed data that we need to replicate for the nation for a sense of equity and as we add in more vaccine candidates because it’s only going to get more complicated,” said Dr. Rebecca Weintraub, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and a practicing internist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nTiberius grew from the Trump administration’s efforts to reinvent the nation’s public health system in the midst of a pandemic. Controlled by officials from the Department of Health and Human Services and military personnel from the Department of Defense, Operation Warp Speed supplanted some of the functions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nation’s leading public health agency, which normally oversees vaccine distribution.\n\nThe rocky deployment of Tiberius exposed Operation Warp Speed’s lack of understanding of public health in America, said Dr. Julie Swann, a professor at North Carolina State University who worked with the CDC on the H1N1 response. Public health – underfunded, understaffed and struggling amid a pandemic – could not be expected to adopt a new technology within weeks of its announcement, she said.\n\nIn an emailed statement, the HHS acknowledged the system still needs work: “We are actively working, in partnership with CDC, on new functionality in Tiberius to analyze the equity of vaccine distribution at a more granular geography.”\n\nPalantir Technologies, the company that created Tiberius, said the federal government wouldn’t allow it to comment. But a source familiar with Tiberius, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the system’s main mission was less lofty than the government news releases implied: to give the federal government data on where the vaccine was going, not to decide which arms would get it.\n\nLocal health departments, the source agreed, “have the best data. ... They have data for the last mile.”\n\nNew system brought new challenges\n\nThe Tiberius system was promoted as the federal government’s unblinking eye on the nation’s COVID-19 vaccine development and rollout.\n\nAdapted from Palantir’s Foundry platform, which is software used for supply-chain data management, Tiberius promised to track doses in real time when they left manufacturing facilities; where they sat in warehouses, pharmacies and doctor’s offices around the country and how many arms they eventually ended up in.\n\nThen, Tiberius would pool vaccination administration data to give decision makers a holistic picture – like a giant, computerized game of Risk – of how the effort was going and where doses should go next.\n\nAs an added layer, Tiberius would pipe in dozens of streams of information, including the locations of hospitals and pharmacies, the rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths, demographic and employment data, population estimates for specific priority groups, and even socioeconomic vulnerability scores – all served to Operation Warp Speed officials and state health departments alike.\n\n“The jurisdictions will work inside the Tiberius platform to decide where every allocated dose will go,” said a Defense Department press release from November.\n\n“Tiberius can provide a zip code-by-zip code view of priority populations, including frontline workers and nursing home residents,” said another press release published a month later.\n\nPalantir Technologies, which went public last year after 17 years of doing business, is a major player in creating customized software for government agencies. In the past year, it reported revenues of $610 million in all government contracts, including a sophisticated system called HHS Protect that houses a multitude of data sets from hospitals about COVID-19.\n\nHHS Protect has been heavily criticized for incomplete and problematic data that doesn’t match what states and hospitals are reporting. According to a CDC evaluation of the system, there are “major flaws” in its data collection, which is managed by TeleTracking Technologies, a private company hired by the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force to take over the CDC’s role in collecting hospital data.\n\nSome also have raised questions about Palantir’s connections to the Trump administration. Peter Thiel is one of the co-founders and major shareholders of the company. The New York Times reported that Thiel contributed $1.25 million to Donald Trump’s re-election effort through secretive super PAC and other funds.\n\nRep. Bill Foster, D-Ill., said the Trump administration often assumed it could undo bad management with new technology “by calling up some big Trump donor who owns a software company that will magically fix the problem.”\n\nHowever, another co-founder and CEO of Palantir, billionaire Alex Karp, describes himself as a socialist and said in a video made public about Trump, “I respect nothing about the dude.” Federal Election Commission records on campaign donations show that the company and its employees tend to donate more heavily to Democrats.\n\nTo others watching the chaotic first weeks of the vaccine’s rollout, the mismanagement of its distribution was a failure of leadership within the Trump administration.\n\n“They literally thought their job stopped with vaccine development,” said Niall Brennan, CEO of the Health Care Cost Institute and former chief data officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “No, your job stops when the American population is vaccinated. It’s a massive abdication of job responsibility.”\n\nFoster said a better approach would be relying on those with real expertise and building on systems that already existed.\n\nFoster pointed to the annual flu vaccination effort, in which every state has a plan and system in place with the CDC through a vaccine ordering and tracking system called VTrckS, with distribution by the health care company McKesson. For the 2019-20 flu season, more than 170 million flu vaccine doses were distributed to states.\n\n“Certainly, the initial experience with Tiberius, it did not get rave reviews,” Foster said. “If they were going to set up a whole new system, they should have done it a whole lot more rapidly.”\n\nTiberius came too late, offered too little\n\nWeeks after Tiberius went live, in an effort to get states on board, Operation Warp Speed officials added 64 IT staff – for each of the states and territories, plus federal agencies and some regional managers. Hired through OptumServe Technology Services, these specialists were charged with walking health officials through the system.\n\nOne of the specialists, who spoke on condition of anonymity because those hired had to sign a nondisclosure agreement, said that two problems soon became obvious: Many of the states were ill-prepared to use the system, and the IT specialists had little knowledge of the software and of public health.\n\n“They didn’t necessarily hire people that had all the skill sets needed to do the job,” the person said. But the steep learning curve with Tiberius also was a challenge, the employee said. “It was difficult to get any of the states to buy in. Some of the states still haven’t bought in.”\n\nStates complain that Tiberius was introduced late in their planning cycle. The federal contract was awarded July 24 but states were not brought into the loop until October. That left them just over two months to get comfortable with the new system before vaccines became available.\n\n“Having unknown timeframes for when these national software applications are going to be released or what’s going to be in them has been a challenge,” Ashley Newmyer, chief data strategist for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, told USA TODAY.\n\nIn written testimony to a House subcommittee hearing on Feb. 2, the chief medical executive of Michigan’s health department said the state had “struggled with Operation Warp Speed’s Tiberius system.”\n\n“The system is very complex and required multiple staff to undergo training in a short period of time to learn how to navigate it effectively,” Dr. Joneigh S. Khaldun testified.\n\nEven if it had come sooner, though, Tiberius would not have prevented all the unevenness seen across the country over the past two months. The system offers data on the general location of the highest-risk groups but doesn’t include names, to comply with federal privacy guidelines. Health officials in some states are able to rank each person who registers for vaccination by their level of risk and directly invite those at highest risk to schedule appointments first.\n\nStarting in December, much of the early allocation of vaccines went to health care workers and nursing homes. That followed the CDC’s recommendations because nursing homes had the highest proportion of COVID-19 deaths, while health care workers are exposed to the virus daily.\n\nThe next batches of vaccine went mostly to those age 75 and older and, soon after, 65 and older, too. Some regions have moved on to essential workers, including first responders, agricultural workers, child care workers, teachers and grocery clerks. A few have shifted into vaccinating people with a long list of pre-existing conditions.\n\nGetting signed up for a vaccine begins with a confusing list of options, some of which disappear or are canceled even as people rush to complete the online forms to claim a spot.\n\nStates have asked people to either register online for the vaccine or to vouch that they were eligible. In Solano County, California, for instance, local health officials use the registry to identify the most vulnerable people and give them the shots first.\n\nIn Oklahoma, on the other hand, the registry is a first-come-first-served system among those currently eligible. Buffy Heater, assistant deputy commissioner at the Oklahoma State Department of Health, said the state also allocates doses to locations that serve people with special needs, such as dialysis centers, cancer treatment centers and transplant centers.\n\nIn some states, it’s possible to get appointments at providers or pharmacies without registering with the state, although you still have to swear that you meet the criteria for highest priority shots.\n\nNot surprisingly, problems have cropped up – which medical conditions are eligible varies widely by state, the issue of people jumping the line persists and there has been a significant lack of diversity in who is being vaccinated, with only 5.4% of vaccinations going to Black Americans, who make up 13.4% of the population.\n\nA fancy dashboard that few leverage\n\nBy necessity, Tiberius does play a critical role in allocating vaccines. Each week, state public health officials must check the system’s dashboard to learn how many doses are heading their way. States decide where the doses will go and Tiberius tracks those shipments directly to providers.\n\nTiberius also houses dozens of digital dashboards to track data associated with allocations, orders and shipments, inventory, priority groups, storage and providers. These separate screens would allow officials with enough data savvy to identify bottlenecks in vaccine supply and demand as well as how to distribute doses most equitably, considering factors like how many teachers or food service workers live near a given vaccination site.\n\nThose features were described as both duplicative and inadequate by most state officials who responded to USA TODAY.\n\n“The equity tools in Tiberius do not currently provide the level of detail needed,” Cory Portner, a spokesman for the Washington State Department of Health, said in an email. The department “has access to more detailed information on the demographics of our state.”\n\nThe biggest problem states face today is an extreme shortage of vaccines. In Maryland, for example, 2 million people are currently eligible to get the shot but the state receives only 12,000 doses a week.\n\nTiberius was supposed to help Maryland decide where to distribute those scarce doses. But the state public health department told USA TODAY that it uses its own data to make those decisions, prioritizing the highest-risk populations first.\n\nDallas County in Texas assigns each person who registers for a vaccine a vulnerability score, giving highest priority to those most at risk of being hospitalized or dying of COVID-19. The county receives about 9,000 doses of vaccine a week for the 650,000 people currently eligible to receive it. Each week, officials send out emails to the most vulnerable, inviting them to make an appointment.\n\nDallas County always runs out of vaccine by week’s end, said Dr. Philip Huang, director of the county health department.\n\nTiberius is available to states, a few major cities and counties, territories, federal agencies like the Bureau of Prisons, Department of Defense and Indian Health Service, manufacturers and pharmacy chains. It has onboarded approximately 3,000 users since its launch, a person familiar with Tiberius confirmed. Many cities, counties and providers do not yet use the system.\n\nStates like Indiana and North Carolina told USA TODAY they have contracted with other vendors or developed their own systems for vaccination prioritization instead of using Tiberius’s built-in planning tools.\n\nWhen supply finally catches up with demand, which Biden advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci predicts could happen as soon as April, there will no longer be rationing of the vaccine. Then, the focus will shift from deciding who is at the front of the line to enticing those who are reluctant or homebound as well as people who face physical or technological barriers.\n\nHealth officials say they are dealing with this by enlisting the help of leaders in diverse communities to vouch for the vaccine. The Ad Council recently launched a $500 million campaign to coax people to get vaccinated. Mobile vaccination clinics are fanning out into low-uptake neighborhoods.\n\nMore:Amid a chaotic COVID-19 vaccine rollout, states find ways to connect shots with arms\n\nWith a third vaccine authorized last weekend, more vaccines are on their way and localities are picking up the speed at which they vaccinate. More than 15% of Americans have received at least one COVID-19 shot and on average 1.82 million doses are being administered every day. A month ago, 1.3 million doses were being administered daily.\n\nThe federal government has announced several initiatives to speed up vaccinations, improve equity and access, and get doses into more locations – all things Tiberius was built to do but have proved elusive.\n\nThe Biden administration, meanwhile, says it’s working on improving the Tiberius system.\n\n“We work closely with jurisdictions and the CDC to receive feedback, continuously develop new features to enhance the system’s capabilities and improve the user experience,” the HHS statement said, pointing to recent improvements ranging from more granular data about retail pharmacies, simplified visualizations and breakdowns for each jurisdiction, and projections of vaccine allocations three weeks into the future – instead of one – so states can better plan.\n\nDr. Jesse Goodman, a former chief scientist at the FDA who led the agency’s H1N1 pandemic response, said the government should have known better than to introduce Tiberius without a long runway.\n\n“It was always a risky idea to build a brand new IT system, especially in an emergency, and then even worse to use it without apparent substantial testing in real world conditions,” said Goodman, now director of Georgetown University’s Center on Medical Product Access, Safety and Stewardship. “It probably would have been less risky and likely less expensive to try to build on or adapt existing systems.”\n\nAleszu Bajak is a senior data reporter and David Health is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team.

Abbott has recalled and held back Similac, Alimentum and EleCare products produced at its facility in Sturgis, Michigan, while enhanced safety testing is conducted.\n\nThe formula recalls have exacerbated product shortages due to supply chain issues.\n\nAs enhanced testing will take time, the FDA said it “has no objection” for Abbott to immediately release products to “individuals needing urgent, life-sustaining supplies” of certain specialty and metabolic formulas on a case-by-case basis.\n\n“The FDA is concerned that the risk of not having certain specialty and metabolic products available could significantly worsen underlying medical conditions and in some cases pose life-threatening risks for infants and individuals who rely on these products,” the agency said. “In these circumstances, the benefit of allowing parents, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to access these products may outweigh the potential risk of bacterial infection.”\n\nThe FDA stressed that products produced at the facility from late January through early March, prior to an FDA inspection, may carry a risk of contamination, and said parents seeking the formula should talk to their child’s doctor about whether the benefit of consuming the formula outweighs the risk of a bacterial infection in their child’s circumstances.\n\nIn a Friday statement, Abbott said it “is releasing limited quantities of metabolic nutrition formulas at the request of FDA that were previously on hold following Abbott’s recall of some powder infant formulas from its Sturgis, Mich., facility. The products have been tested and comply with all product release requirements before distribution. The lots being released were not included in the recall.”\n\nParents seeking the product should contact Abbott directly to request it, the FDA said.

Feinstein's seat", "text": "WASHINGTON − California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he will appoint Laphonza Butler to fill the vacant seat left by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who died Thursday night at age 90.\n\nButler is the first Black woman and mother to lead Emily’s List, an organization that helps Democratic women win elections. Before that, she was president of SEIU Local 2015 − California's biggest union representing home care and nursing facility workers − and as adviser for Vice President Kamala Harris and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's presidential campaigns.\n\nShe also has taken up other roles, including director of public policy and campaigns for Airbnb and a member of the University of California Board of Regents.\n\nNewsom said Sunday night on X, formerly Twitter, that Butler, 44, \"has spent her entire career fighting for women and girls and has been a fierce advocate for working people.\"\n\n\"She will make history − becoming the first Black lesbian to openly serve in the U.S. Senate,\" Newsom wrote. \"From her time as President of EMILY's List to leading the state's largest labor union, she has always stood up for what is right and has led with her heart and her values. I have no doubt she will carry the baton left by Senator Feinstein, continue to break glass ceilings, and fight for all Californians in Washington.\"\n\nButler, who lives in Maryland, owns a home in California and will switch her voter registration.\n\nPolitico first reported the development. Anthony York, the governor's spokesperson, told the outlet Newsom is making his appointment \"without putting limitations or preconditions on his pick running for the seat in 2024,\" meaning Butler could join the candidates vying for Feinstein's seat next year.\n\nFeinstein, who spent more than 30 years in the Senate, was hospitalized in March for shingles − which required her to step away from Congress for nearly three months − and in August after a minor fall in her home. She has also suffered from encephalitis and Ramsay Hunt syndrome, shingles-related condition that can affect facial nerves.\n\nThe decision to have Butler fill Feinstein’s seat comes as Newsom pledged to appoint a Black woman to the Senate if Feinstein were to resign in 2021 and made clear in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” earlier this month that he wouldn’t appoint anyone running for Feinstein’s seat in the 2024 election.\n\n“But you're going to abide by − it would be essentially a caretaker, an African-American woman?\" NBC's Chuck Todd asked, to which Newsom replied, “We hope we never have to make this decision, but I abide by what I've said very publicly and on a consistent basis, yes.”\n\nRep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., who is running for Feinstein’s seat, blasted Newsom for his remarks on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\n“The idea that a Black woman should be appointed only as a caretaker to simply check a box is insulting to countless Black women across this country who have carried the Democratic Party to victory election after election,” Lee said.\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus also urged Newsom to appoint Lee in a letter Sunday.\n\nAfter Kamala Harris’ rise to the vice presidency in 2020, Newsom was pressured by Black and Latino political advocacy groups to pick a person of color to fill her vacant seat in the Senate. Harris was California’s first Black senator. He ended up choosing then-California Secretary of State Alex Padilla in December of that year.\n\nIn a statement after Feinstein’s death, Newsom called her a “trailblazer U.S. Senator; an early voice for gun control; a leader in times of tragedy and chaos.”\n\n“But to me, she was a dear friend, a lifelong mentor, and a role model not only for me, but to my wife and daughters for what a powerful, effective leader looks like,” Newsom said. “She was a political giant, whose tenacity was matched by her grace.

So why aren’t we doing it?\n\nType 2 diabetes, in which the body can’t properly regulate blood sugar, has become so common it’s almost considered inconsequential. More than 1 in 10 Americans have the disease (though many don't know it) and another nearly 4 in 10 are at risk for it. The most frustrating aspect of Type 2 diabetes, experts say, is that it has long been largely preventable and controllable. To better understand why, USA TODAY's health team traveled across the country, talking to researchers, clinicians and patients. They found people with diabetes often must fend for themselves against systemic barriers and a difficult disease.

It has been updated to reflect new data in two charts: Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema’s party affiliation switch from Democrat to independent and updated race/ethnicity data for the 118th Congress from the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.\n\nCNN —\n\nA record number of women won election to the 118th Congress – but barely.\n\nThe 149 women who will serve in the US House and Senate will expand the ranks of female representation by just two members above the record set by the 117th Congress.\n\nAlaska carried women across that threshold in November when the state determined through its ranked-choice voting system that Rep. Mary Peltola, a Democrat, will represent the state’s at-large House seat for a full term after winning the special election earlier in the year, while Sen. Lisa Murkowski won reelection.\n\nWomen will break an overall record in the House, with 124 taking office in January.\n\nAnd not only will women of color break records in the 118th Congress, but within the House alone, there will also be a record number of both Latinas and Black women. Four more Latinas will serve in the House for a total of 18 – the most ever – and one more Black woman, bringing their total from 26 to 27.\n\nMore than half of the incoming class of 22 freshman women in the House are women of color, showing the increasing diversity of that chamber.\n\n“We’ve seen a pretty steady increase in the racial and ethnic diversity of women as candidates, nominees, and then officeholders at the congressional level, but more specifically, in the US House,” said Kelly Dittmar, director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers.\n\n“That diversity is still hugely lacking in the US Senate. … We’re seeing stasis there in terms of the number of women of color overall. The number of Asian and Latino women specifically will stay the same, and the number of Black women will stay the same at zero.”\n\nRep.-elect Sydney Kamlager of California is one of those new voices coming to the House. A state senator, she was elected to replace retiring Rep. Karen Bass, who will become the first female mayor of Los Angeles. Kamlager said while she is excited about the diversity of the freshman class, there is still a long way to go.\n\n“I think folks have to stop giving lip service to Black women and brown women and put the money where the mouth is. The fact remains that Black and brown women face higher barriers of entry into this work than other women and men,” the Democrat said. “When we run, our contributions are less oftentimes than men. We are held to higher and double standards,” she added, noting that female candidates are still often asked why they are not “home taking care of your husband or your children.”\n\n“Folks are OK with a mediocre male candidate but expect the female candidate to be off the charts,” she said.\n\nRep.-elect Yadira Caraveo, a Democrat, is the first Latina elected to Congress from Colorado. A state representative and the daughter of Mexican immigrant parents, she’ll also be just the second female doctor who’s a voting member of Congress. (The first, Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier, won reelection in Washington state.)\n\n“Kind of sad that it took until 2022,” Caraveo said, reflecting on both milestones.\n\nHer experience in medicine and state politics, she said, prepared her for having to work harder to get “less credit” than her male counterparts.\n\n“It is, unfortunately, something that I’ve seen throughout my time, both in medicine and in politics, and, sadly, a challenge that one gets used to, in some ways, but also, in other ways, continues to be painful,” said Caraveo, a pediatrician.\n\n“Even members of my staff, you know, as they came on board, really noted the different way in which I was treated or perceived as a woman of color compared to some of the other candidates that were able to more easily get meetings or support from different groups,” she added.\n\nMarking the milestone\n\nStill, the moment isn’t lost on these women.\n\n“In Colorado, I didn’t grow up seeing what I am now,” said Caraveo. “The idea of being the first Latina – so not just that it’s a woman but it’s a woman of color – serving in Congress, I hope is going to be make things a little bit easier for the little girls that I’ve taken care of in clinic. So that one day they don’t have to talk about being first of something, their candidacy and their ability to be in office is just a given.”\n\nAnd Caraveo, who will be representing a new district that Colorado gained in the reapportionment process, also stressed the significance of what more female representation could mean for legislating.\n\n“That sense of collaboration that we approach things with is very different than, I think, what my male counterparts often do,” she said.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Republicans will break a record with 42 women serving in Congress. Murkowski and Republican Sen.-elect Katie Britt of Alabama help bring the number of Republican women in the Senate to nine. And 33 Republican women will serve in the House next year, up from 32 this year.\n\nThe incoming class of seven House Republican freshmen includes three Latinas, bringing the total number of Republican Latinas in the House to five.\n\n“Having the diversity of thought and experience is, you know, it’s critical to our representative democracy,” said Rep.-elect Erin Houchin, who noted that she’s the first woman to represent her Indiana district.\n\n“It feels like we’re accomplishing something for the next generation,” she said. “It is meaningful for me in particular to set that example for my own daughters, for young women.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio has seen and beat plenty of records before as the longest-serving woman in the House. When she’s sworn in for another term in January, on the heels of her first competitive reelection in years, she’ll become the longest-serving woman in all of Congress, beating the record set by former Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski.\n\nFirst elected in 1982, Kaptur has been sounding the alarm about her party being dominated by leadership from the coasts, while the heartland and industrial America – and its struggling middle class – is often forgotten in Washington.\n\n“My most heart-warming achievement is that the tenure represents a voice from the working class of people – who happens to be a woman,” she said.", "authors": ["Janie Boschma Simone Pathe Maeve Reston Renée Rigdon Cnn Illustration Will Mullery", "Janie Boschma", "Simone Pathe", "Maeve Reston", "Renée Rigdon"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/politics/karen-bass-kamala-harris-inauguration/index.html", "title": "Kamala Harris to swear in Karen Bass as first female mayor of Los ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nVice President Kamala Harris will swear in Karen Bass as the 43rd mayor of Los Angeles in an inauguration ceremony on Sunday in a meeting of two Democratic women who have broken barriers in politics.\n\nBass will make history as the first female mayor of Los Angeles, also making her the first woman of color to hold the job. Harris, just the second-ever Black female US senator, made history when she became the first female, first Black and first South Asian person to serve as vice president.\n\nBass, who will succeed term-limited Mayor Eric Garcetti, will begin her mayoral term on December 12. When she takes office, the four largest cities in the US will all have Black mayors – that includes Eric Adams of New York City, Lori Lightfoot of Chicago and Sylvester Turner of Houston.\n\nBass, who was elected to the California state Assembly in 2004, made history some four years later as the first Black woman to serve as speaker of any state legislature.\n\nBass alluded to her history of firsts shortly after winning her race when she told reporters that the accomplishment of becoming the first female mayor of Los Angeles was still “sinking in.”\n\n“When you’re in a position like this – and I was in a similar position when I was sworn in as speaker – it means that you have extra responsibility. You always have to make sure that you maintain excellence in every step of the way,” Bass said. “The path that you go is laying the foundation for those that come behind you.”\n\nAfter her victory, Bass promised to solve the homelessness crisis in the nation’s second-largest city.\n\n“She is holding her inaugural ceremony on Sunday to make it easier for Angelenos to attend and to ensure her first day as mayor is dedicated to bringing unhoused Angelenos inside and making our city safer and more livable for all,” the mayor-elect’s office said in a statement announcing the ceremony.\n\nThe six-term congresswoman, who currently represents South and West Los Angeles, defeated real estate developer Rick Caruso in the general election last month. Caruso had spent more than $104 million – outspending his opponent by more than 11-to-1.\n\nDuring her campaign, Bass leaned into her experience bringing together Black and Latino community organizers in South Los Angeles in the early 1990s to address the root causes of crime and the crack epidemic. She was able to put together a winning coalition of Black voters in South Los Angeles and White progressives on the city’s west side to help overcome Caruso’s spending.\n\nThe mayor-elect began her career as a physician assistant in the emergency room in Los Angeles County.\n\nJoe Biden had vetted Bass, the then-chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, to be his running mate in 2020 as she helped lead the negotiations on legislation to create greater police accountability following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.", "authors": ["Shania Shelton Maeve Reston", "Shania Shelton", "Maeve Reston"], "publish_date": "2022/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/12/abortion-rights-black-women-midterm-elections/9674177002/", "title": "'We can never go back': Leaked opinion mobilizes Black women ...", "text": "If Roe v.

Remind folks why you do this work. Speak to your story and remind folks why government matters.”\n\nThat full circle moment came as Harris makes her final round of stops in the last stretch of days before the final ballots of the midterm elections are counted. Harris, who has had a laser focus on abortion and women’s rights issues while in office, is spending those last few days stumping for almost all women candidates in Democratic stronghold states, going to friendly territory to serve as a closer in tighter-than-expected races.\n\nHarris’ last-minute travel emphasizes the high political stakes for Democrats in a midterm election that has largely focused on the question of whether President Joe Biden’s party will be able to keep control of Congress – and if not, how much it might be able to minimize its losses. A source close to Harris says it’s also reflective of a year-long strategy to put her in front of audiences where she could build important relationships for the future.\n\n“Over the next four days, Vice President Harris will continue to do what she has been doing and that’s uplifting candidates up and down the ballot who are as equally committed to protecting reproductive rights and are committed to building on the progress the administration has been to bring the economy back,” a White House official said.\n\nThe vice president is expected to spend Monday in California, appearing with the state Democratic party for a rally on reproductive rights, according to a White House official. Los Angeles mayoral candidate Karen Bass is also expected to attend, according to a California official. On Sunday, Harris will appear with Sen. Tammy Duckworth in Illinois for an Asian American and Pacific Islanders Victory Fund event – in addition to rallying for Illinois Gov. J.B Pritzker, a day after Biden appears in the same state.\n\nThat comes after back-to-back trips to boost female candidates. Harris spent Thursday in New York stumping for Gov. Kathy Hochul, who is in a tighter-than-expected reelection race, and Attorney General Letitia James alongside former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in a high-profile rally.\n\nBoosting women and playing defense\n\nFemale gubernatorial nominees are breaking records in this year’s midterm elections, with 25 women receiving nominations by the two major parties, according to the Center for American Women and Politics. And a record number are also running for state legislatures.\n\nReferencing that record breaking, Harris told the crowd in New York, “You’ve witnessed a lot of history on this stage. A whole lot of firsts”\n\n“Yes, we may be the first, but we are committed to not being the last. And we’re going to count on you to help us see that through,” Harris added, using a line her mother often repeated to Harris throughout her career.\n\nA day before, the vice president went to the Democratic stronghold of Massachusetts to stump for Campbell and Maura Healey, who is running for governor. The vice president has also campaigned for Sen. Patty Murray in Washington, Rep. Jahana Hayes in Connecticut and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan among other women candidates.\n\nBut the places Harris hasn’t been during this midterm cycle, and the frontline Democratic women candidates locked in tight races she hasn’t stumped for, is notable. She has not campaigned in-person for Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan, Arizona gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs, Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, North Carolina US Senate candidate Cheri Beasley, California US Rep. Katie Porter or Florida Rep. Val Demings, who is running for Senate against Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\nIn many cases, campaigns must invite White House officials to appear at their events – and bringing the president or vice president can be costly as the campaign picks up the bill. Some campaign operatives previously told CNN that the increased scrutiny from Republicans that follows the first Black female vice president has hindered their willingness to bring her out.\n\nBut Harris’ absences, along with Biden’s own relatively light campaign schedule that who also hasn’t brought him to many tight races across the country, illustrate a political reality: Some endangered Democrats have sought to distance themselves from the White House.\n\nMany skipped the chance to invite either Biden or Harris make an appearance as they walk a tightrope on the economy and inflation. Biden and Harris’ frequent trips to states they easily won in 2020 also illustrates just how much Democrats are on the defense in races that are traditionally deep blue.\n\nHarris did visit Nevada, Wisconsin and California for official events – abortion rights roundtables– in the last three months, emphasizing her focus on an issue that became front of mind for some Democratic voters after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this summer. And she has done virtual events for North Carolina congressional candidates, Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, Iowa gubernatorial candidate Deidre DeJear and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo in Texas.\n\nHarris has also headlined more than a dozen DNC fundraising events so far this year, raising millions, an DNC official told CNN. Her allies argue that the strategy to stay far from tough races and instead spend time in deeply blue states shows the White House is not taking anything for granted.\n\n“I think it’s a very smart strategy,” said A’shanti Gholar, president of the organization Emerge, which recruits and then trains Democratic women to run for office. The founder of Emerge helped Harris in her first race for San Francisco district attorney.\n\n“It’s showing the voters that they matter, that their state matters, that their city matters. It’s a very holistic approach. We don’t always have to send our key principles to play defense. They can play offense too.”\n\nClosing argument\n\nHarris has centered her closing message on urging Americans to vote Democrats into office as the final stand against Republicans trying to pass restrictive abortion and voting rights bills. The former California attorney general has stressed that voters must focus on down-ballot races that could determine who controls election systems and statehouses.\n\n“We’re going to need people in the statehouse and at a local level who have the courage to stand up and push back against what is happening in our country. And then that way, who is your governor matters. Who is your attorney general matters. Who is your lieutenant governor matters. Because they will be the last line of defense with what we’re seeing happening around our country,” Harris told the crowd in New York, citing Republican threats of a national abortion ban.\n\nThe vice president’s argument runs complimentary to Biden’s closing message warning Americans that democracy itself is on a precipice, with a possibility of teetering over should election deniers win important races. Biden, his advisers and Harris have all tried to reframe the midterm elections as a choice between the two parties instead of it as a referendum on the Biden administration.\n\nThose close to Harris argue that her months-long work on abortion has been her greatest asset on the trail, providing her credibility with voters who wonder what their government has done to protect women’s rights. The vice president has held nearly 40 events in Washington and across the country on the issue, cementing herself as the administration’s lead messenger on the issue. That effort comes as the Biden administration has unilaterally deployed small measures to try to safeguard abortion access.\n\n“She started having a conversation about freedom, liberty and claiming abortion as an elected leader very early,” the source close to Harris added about the strategy, as she met with state legislatures, college presidents, labor leaders, religious leaders, students, women’s magazines, community leaders and others.\n\n“So, she was very intentional about talking to people who were going to be speaking to other people about these issues, people who are kind of conduits to congregations or communities.”\n\nHarris’ office says her midterm focus has been on women, young people and people of color.\n\n“She’s been very effective at using the vice president’s bully pulpit to help lift up state and local candidates,” Minyon Moore, a veteran Democratic strategist and an outside adviser to Harris, told CNN. “Whether it’s the last four days she’s campaigning for women, or whether it has been the last couple of months she’s been out here, crisscrossing the country. The fact is, whenever you bring a president or a vice president in there is no one better to communicate how the policies they passed impact the American people”\n\nLaphonza Butler, a former senior adviser on Harris’ presidential campaign who now is the president of Emily’s List, joked that Harris’ role this midterm is “dot-connector-in-chief.”\n\n“The subtext is always the economy whether you’re talking about abortion or labor or the environment. It all fundamentally comes back to are people going to be able to afford to live a decent life. I think that is the point [Harris] makes better than better than most,” Butler said.\n\nAnd the constituencies that Harris has intentionally rallied, from women to people of color to labor and state legislatures, are the very same she tapped into after joining the Biden’s presidential ticket in 2020.\n\nThose close to her argue that those are the very same group she’ll need again should she run again as Biden’s no. 2 or if the soon-to-be 80-year-old president doesn’t seek a second term, thrusting his vice president’s 2024 plans into the spotlight.\n\n“Women were key for them in 2020,” Butler said. “In a cycle where we have so much at stake for women like reproductive health care, it surely is of benefit no matter what 2024 looks like.”", "authors": ["Jasmine Wright"], "publish_date": "2022/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/politics/georgia-senate-herschel-walker-texas-kfile/index.html", "title": "Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker described himself as ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGeorgia Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker, facing renewed and growing questions about his residency in the final week of the runoff campaign, described himself during a campaign speech in January as living in Texas and said he decided to run for Georgia’s Senate seat while at his Texas “home,” according to a CNN KFile review of his campaign speeches.\n\nGeorgia Democrats have called for an investigation by state officials into Walker’s residency after CNN’s KFile reported last week that Walker was getting a tax break in Texas intended for a primary residence, possibly running afoul of Texas tax law and some rules for establishing Georgia residency for voting and running for office.\n\n“I live in Texas,” Walker said in January of this year, when speaking to University of Georgia College Republicans. Walker was criticizing Democrats for not visiting the border when he made the comments. “I went down to the border off and on sometimes,” he said.\n\nEarlier in the speech, Walker said he decided to run for Georgia’s Senate seat while at his Texas home after seeing the country divided.\n\n“Everyone asks me, why did I decide to run for a Senate seat? Because to be honest with you, this is never something I ever, ever, ever thought in my life I’d ever do,” said Walker. “And that’s the honest truth.

Georgia Democrats in a statement called for an immediate investigation of Walker’s residency, and Congresswoman Nikema Williams, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Georgia, also asked authorities to see if Walker lied about living in Georgia.\n\n“The Georgia Bureau of Investigations and the Georgia Attorney General’s office must immediately investigate whether Herschel Walker lied about being a Georgia resident,” Williams said.\n\nMade media appearances from his Texas home to campaign for Senate seat\n\nA CNN KFile review of some of Walker’s media appearances and events from 2021 and 2022 finds Walker appeared on Fox News and other conservative media from his Texas home at least four times after announcing his candidacy for Georgia’s Senate seat.\n\nThe interviews at his Texas home took place twice in September 2021 and in February and March of 2022.\n\nBefore announcing, all of Walker’s media appearances on Fox News and on other conservative media, around 20 in total, took place in Texas.", "authors": ["Andrew Kaczynski Olivia Alafriz", "Andrew Kaczynski", "Olivia Alafriz"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/opinions/scotus-justice-ketanji-brown-jackson-opinion/index.html", "title": "Opinion: What kind of justice will Ketanji Brown Jackson be? | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nCNN Opinion asked contributors to weigh in on President Joe Biden’s selection of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the US Supreme Court. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the contributors.\n\nFatima Goss Graves: A nomination that should unite the country\n\nNational Women's Law Center\n\nJudge Ketanji Brown Jackson is an eminently qualified public servant with distinguished experience as a federal judge, and her historic nomination promises an end to the erasure of Black women from our most sacred legal institutions. She brings extensive litigation experience at every level of the federal court system, including distinguished service as a federal public defender. As a district court judge, she ruled on over 550 cases and is renowned for her careful, methodical approach to ensuring equal justice under the law on reproductive rights, disability rights and workers’ rights.\n\nFrankly, this is a nomination that should unite the country. Diversity strengthens the integrity of the institution to the broader public and, in particular, the many Black women who face many of the harshest injustices of our system today. It’s critical for the US Supreme Court to understand the impact of its rulings in the real world, and it can’t do that until it reflects the country it governs. Jackson will move us closer to a more fair and just system for women, for Black Americans and for everyone on the side of equality before the law.\n\nIt is incumbent upon US senators to give her a fair and timely confirmation without obstruction, honoring their constitutional duty to advise and consent – and their moral duty to treat her with the respect and dignity she deserves.\n\n​​Fatima Goss Graves is president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center.\n\nElie Honig: A nominee Republicans will be hard-pressed to oppose\n\nFirst things first: it’s about time. It’s long past time. For the first time in the history of the US Supreme Court, a Black woman has been nominated as a Justice.\n\nAnd, to be clear, you will not find a more qualified nominee than Judge (likely soon-to-be Justice) Kentaji Brown Jackson. She graduated from Harvard, both undergrad and law school. She clerked for a federal district court judge and then, in a nice bit of symmetry, nabbed a mega-prestigious clerkship with Justice Stephen Breyer, who she now stands to replace.\n\nShe worked in private practice and for the US Sentencing Commission before she became a federal district court judge in 2013. Last year, she was nominated as a federal appellate judge, winning confirmation with 53 votes, including three Republicans. I have seen her in action on the bench, and I came away exceptionally impressed. In the case I covered, she was prepared, sharp, incisive and fair.\n\nSenate Republicans can act one of two ways in the wake of Jackson’s nomination. They can dig in and oppose it, but they don’t have much of substance to work with – and they’ll likely lose anyway, given the current Democratic Senate majority (which will presumably be coupled with the votes of three Republicans who supported her federal appellate judgeship).\n\nOr Republicans can pick their battles and throw their support behind Jackson, given her qualifications and the seeming inevitably of her confirmation. Maybe it seems quaint – Breyer himself was confirmed by an 87 to 9 vote back in 1994, which now seems impossible – but it also could be smart politics.\n\nElie Honig is a CNN senior legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor, and author of “Hatchet Man: How Bill Barr Broke the Prosecutor’s Code and Corrupted the Justice Department.”\n\nEd Whelan: Senate Republicans have an opportunity here\n\nEthics and Public Policy Center\n\nIn selecting Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to fill Stephen Breyer’s seat on the Supreme Court, President Joe Biden has fulfilled his campaign pledge to nominate the first female African American justice.\n\nBiden selected Jackson for additional reasons, of course. Jackson has impressive credentials, and Biden likely feels confident that Jackson will implement the results-oriented, make-it-up-as-you-go-along “living constitutionalism” that progressives espouse.\n\nBiden has already demonstrated that differences in judicial philosophy justify efforts to oppose the confirmation of the first female African American justice. Back in 2005, he even threatened to filibuster President George W. Bush’s possible nomination of DC Circuit judge Janice Rogers Brown to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe left is likely to make accusations of racism and sexism in response to any concerns expressed over Jackson’s vision of the judicial role. But if Senate Republicans assess Jackson on the basis of judicial philosophy, and don’t succumb to political pressure because of her race and sex, they will responsibly fulfill their constitutional duty to advise and consent.\n\nThe Democrats have control of the Senate, albeit slim control, so Jackson will almost certainly be confirmed. The process will probably be rather quiet. But Senate Republicans should use the opportunity to emphasize that judging is a craft that is distinct from policymaking. They can reinforce the message that the duty of a Supreme Court justice is to discern and apply the meaning that constitutional and statutory provisions bore when they were adopted, not to rewrite those provisions to advance an ideological agenda.\n\nEd Whelan holds the Antonin Scalia Chair in Constitutional Studies at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.

But what is also extraordinary is that she will be a former federal public defender – a position she held for 2 1/2 years – in a country with a legal system still aspiring to be a justice system.\n\nAs a prosecutor, I wielded a tremendous amount of power in the exercise of my discretion to pursue (or decline to pursue) charges and autonomy in the way I met my burden of proof. But like the power held by a co-equal branch of government, the power of prosecutors must be checked – not to disrupt the pursuit of justice but to further it. In a country where race and bias are far too frequently elevated above fairness, public defenders are the welcome foil to balance the system.\n\nThe relationship between public defenders and prosecutors may be necessarily adversarial, but it is always symbiotic. Prosecutors get all the credit (and blame) for ensuring accountability, as if they alone believe in it.\n\nThe public may mistakenly view those who represent the accused as soft on crime. Indeed, if past is prologue, I expect such an absurd talking point to emerge during Jackson’s confirmation hearings. But public defenders are not soft on crime – they are hard on injustice, which is precisely where we as a society must be. And precisely where a Supreme Court justice ought to be.\n\nI sincerely hope Jackson is afforded the dignity she ensured for the presumed innocent: due process, fairness, equal protection from an abuse of power and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.

Presidents think the future justice will vote one way, and they wind up voting another way.\n\nDon’t believe it. Especially in recent years, the art of picking Supreme Court justices has been refined to a science. All nine of the current justices largely vote in ways that would please the presidents who nominated them. That’s likely to be true if Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is confirmed as well.\n\nThe myth of the surprised president dates principally from the presidency of Dwight Eisenhower, who nominated Earl Warren and William Brennan to the Supreme Court and found, to his dismay, that they were both powerful and outspoken liberals.\n\nHere’s one thing to know about the Eisenhower administration: it was a long time ago. In those days, the court was not the public political battleground that it has become, and Eisenhower’s choices were motivated more by politics than ideology. (Eisenhower had promised the seat to Warren, then the governor of California, and he chose Brennan to appeal to Catholic voters on the eve of his 1956 reelection.)\n\nIt’s true that President George H.W. Bush’s appointment of David Souter in 1990 ranks as a modest surprise, but his behavior as a moderate on the court was consistent with both his own earlier record as a judge and Bush’s overall approach to social issues. Also, 1990 was a long time ago.\n\nIn recent years, though, as the court has become the focus of fights on such issues as abortion, guns and affirmative action, ideology has become the main criteria for selections. Presidents (as well as their advisers and supporters) care a great deal about the possibility of ideological mistakes. So they don’t make them. President Joe Biden wanted a judicial liberal, and that’s what he will get with Jackson. She will not surprise him, or us.\n\nJeffrey Toobin is CNN’s chief legal analyst and the author of “The Nine” and “The Oath.”\n\nA’shanti F. Gholar: An important step in addressing racial injustice\n\nMaeve Komenan\n\nJudge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination is an important step in addressing the injustices in the US judicial system, but it’s not the only step we need to take. America’s legal system has always looked different for Black women, who have historically been discriminated against. That will not change until we see more Black women jurists like Jackson in positions of legal power, and that begins with empowering Black women to be the leaders they deserve to be.\n\nJackson is the ideal role model in this regard. Her record is one that has championed equity and justice . She fought to defend the rights of incarcerated individuals, issued rulings that protected labor and women’s rights and upheld the integrity of our constitution when it was under attack by the Trump administration.\n\nAlong with her wealth of judicial expertise, she also brings with her experiences and identities that have never been enjoyed by another Supreme Court justice – and have been sorely missed in the highest court in America. I look forward to her swift approval process through the US Senate and hopefully to her being seated on a bench that doesn’t require her to bring her own folding chair.\n\nA’shanti F.

Irvine\n\nPresident Joe Biden simply could not have done better than his choice of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for the United States Supreme Court. In the world of law, credentials don’t get better than hers. A graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, she clerked for judges in the federal district court and the federal court of appeals. She was also a clerk for Justice Stephen Breyer, who she is now poised to replace. Jackson has had extensive experience in a variety of settings and has served as a federal judge since 2013.\n\nShe also brings to the court experiences and perspectives the current justices lack. Most obviously, she is the first Black woman to be nominated to the Supreme Court. If confirmed, Jackson will also be the only justice on the current court to have worked as a public defender. She has significant experience as a trial judge, something only Justice Sonia Sotomayor has among those now on the high court.\n\nAs I think about what makes for a great justice, Jackson has it all: keen intelligence, enormous experience, unquestionable integrity, a terrific judicial temperament and a vision of justice. She should be confirmed swiftly by the Senate and start what will hopefully be a long career on the Supreme Court. Many will rightfully point out the fact that she won’t change the current ideological balance of the court by replacing Breyer. But if Jackson is still a justice in 2040 and 2050, she may be a stabilizing force on a very different court.\n\nErwin Chemerinsky is dean and Jesse H.

Justice Jackson offers just that\n\nCourtesy Jennifer Rodgers\n\nJudge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden’s nominee to fill the retiring Justice Stephen Breyer’s seat on the Supreme Court, has it all. She is a highly accomplished lawyer and an experienced jurist with the sterling educational and clerkship credentials expected of someone about to ascend to the pinnacle of the legal profession. And, as a Black woman, Jackson will bring a historic perspective and important representation to the nation’s highest court.\n\nJackson shares all of the above characteristics with the other two final candidates Biden was considering: California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger and US District Judge J. Michelle Childs. All three women are also 55 or under; nominating someone relatively young has become close to mandatory in recent years for Supreme Court nominees of presidents of both parties since justices can serve for life. But what distinguishes Jackson from the others, and what very well may have led to her selection, is her service as a criminal defense lawyer, both as a federal public defender and in private practice. She offers the kind of professional diversity that has become one of the calling cards of Biden’s judicial nominations strategy.\n\nBiden is right to prioritize elevating judges who bring different backgrounds and experiences to the courts, especially to the Supreme Court, where not a single justice has Jackson’s experience defending criminal cases. The Supreme Court needs more diversity, of all kinds; hopefully Jackson will be the first step in making that become a reality.\n\nJennifer Rodgers is a former federal prosecutor, adjunct professor of clinical law at NYU School of Law, lecturer-in-law at Columbia Law School and a CNN legal analyst.\n\nElliot Williams: Jackson’s airtight resume is GOP kryptonite\n\nCourtesy Elliot Williams\n\nThe legal profession is plagued by elitism. It’s easy for me to say this, having attended Ivy League schools myself, but prestigious academic institutions do not confer much of anything that can’t be gained from other schools.\n\nOf the nine justices currently on the Supreme Court, however, eight have degrees from Harvard or Yale. If confirmed, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who has two Harvard degrees, will perpetuate the Ivies’ dominance on the Supreme Court.\n\nWhile I will be the first to argue that the Supreme Court desperately needs justices with more varied educational backgrounds, in Jackson’s case, her credentials from an elite institution are a good thing.\n\nHere’s why. Shortly after President Joe Biden announced he would fulfill his promise to put a Black woman on the court – an uncontroversial statement given past presidents’ commitments to make barrier-breaking nominations – a US senator went on the record to call the eventual nominee a “beneficiary” of affirmative action. Another senator expressed doubts about whether the nominee would know “a law book from a J. Crew catalog.” A prominent conservative took to Twitter and predicted the nominee would be a “lesser black woman.” (He later deleted the tweets and apologized, calling it “inartful.”)\n\nAt their cores, each of these statements was a manifestation of disbelief that – gasp! – a Black woman might be just as qualified as any other previous nominee to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\nBlack people face enough barriers in workplaces as it is. For instance, job applicants with “Black-sounding” names are less likely to get interviewed than their White counterparts, and Black women with natural hairstyles are seen as less professional and competent. I speak firsthand in saying that being Black and successful in America is a constant exercise in having to prove you are worthy. That struggle doesn’t end in the marble halls of the Supreme Court.\n\nIf, today, Jackson’s having two Harvard degrees and an otherwise airtight resume is what it takes to quiet at least some of the criticism, then so be it.\n\nElliot Williams is a CNN legal analyst.

Reyes: A justice who sees the basic humanity of immigrants\n\nCNN\n\nIn Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden has put forth a US Supreme Court nominee with impeccable credentials and a stellar legal background.\n\nIn addition to her degrees from Harvard College and Harvard Law School, she brings diverse professional experience to the high court; she has worked at large and small firms, as a public defender, and served on the US Sentencing Commission, where she backed a proposal to reduce federal drug trafficking sentences. This type of varied experience will serve her well on a court that often seems out of touch and has seen its public approval rating drop.\n\nAccording to Associated Press polling, the majority of African Americans say it’s very or extremely important that a Black woman serves on the Supreme Court, and the President has now delivered on a key promise.\n\nJackson will likely earn support from Latino advocacy groups as well, as our communities have much in common in the struggle for civil rights and social justice.\n\nJackson’s rulings on immigration are also important, as congressional inaction and legal challenges to immigration policy have given the Supreme Court an outsized role on this issue.\n\nAlthough in several cases she sought to protect the rights of migrants, she also denied a challenge to Trump’s border wall – so no one can accuse her of favoring “open borders.” Most importantly, whether ruling for or against migrants, Jackson has avoided using terms like “illegals” or “aliens.” As the National Immigration Law Center notes, this acknowledges the basic humanity of immigrants.\n\nThe Supreme Court holds immense power over our daily lives, on issues ranging from health care to the environment to reproductive and voting rights. At a time when many Americans have lost faith in institutions, Jackson will help restore trust and stability to the high court. Her historic nomination deserves bipartisan support.\n\nRaul A.

After a rigorous process, Jackson has proven that she has the experience and character to do this vital job.\n\nAs a Black woman, I am thrilled for what this means for me, my daughter and my community.\n\nWhile I rejoice in the historic nature of her nomination, I also want to celebrate the incredible qualifications Jackson brings to this role. A daughter of teachers, she went to Harvard Law School, has served in nearly every part of our legal system and brings that kind of well-rounded experience that we need on the highest court. It’s no wonder that she has been confirmed three times on a bipartisan vote.\n\nUnfortunately, even being an impeccably qualified nominee who has been praised by both former President Barack Obama for being an “unwavering voice for justice and fairness” and by former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who gave her “unequivocal” praise for her integrity and intellect, Jackson will almost certainly face racist and sexist comments that come with being the first.\n\nAt EMILY’s List, we have seen far too many history-makers and ground-breakers have their accomplishments questioned and their qualifications undermined. But we know what Jackson’s example proves: to be the first and to break the mold, you bring qualifications, experience and character that is unrivaled.\n\nI am proud to support her and look forward to the legacy she will hopefully create on the court.\n\nLaphonza Butler is the president of EMILY’s List, the nation’s largest resource for women in politics.

Her discussions with US senators, in visits and in the public hearing, will be an ideal forum for serious constitutional debate.\n\nJudicial nominees are rightly reluctant to prejudge issues, especially when the nominee is a sitting judge. If Jackson follows this tradition, then senators will have all the more incentive to ask her about the bigger picture: her view of the court’s role in government and its responsibility to faithfully interpret the laws as written.\n\nIn an era when the Supreme Court is enduring partisan attacks on its legitimacy, and facing dangerous threats to pack the court for partisan purposes, it is crucial for senators – and all Americans – to know that the next justice is committed to preserving the rule of law and the court’s indispensable constitutional role.\n\nAdam White is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. In 2021, President Joe Biden appointed him to the Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nMini Timmaraju: A smart choice for upholding reproductive freedom\n\nLes Talusan\n\nThe nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson – the first Black woman ever nominated to the US Supreme Court – is an historic and exciting moment.\n\nShe is an immensely qualified judge who will bring a new, much-needed and long-overdue perspective to the court. Not only that, Jackson has a demonstrated record of upholding reproductive freedom, a critical consideration with the right to abortion facing unprecedented attacks.\n\nJackson’s nomination comes at a pivotal moment for the court. Her confirmation won’t change the balance of the court or the outcome of the looming decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization – the case directly challenging Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion. However, we must seize this chance to confirm a justice who will work to protect our most cherished rights and freedoms and help to shape the future of our country in the decades to come.\n\nThe anti-choice movement and its political allies spent decades working to install their ideologues on our nation’s highest court. The confirmations of Trump’s justices to the Supreme Court cemented a majority that is unmistakably hostile to abortion, and that won’t be easily undone. But confirming justices like Jackson is how we move closer to a future in which all of our families and communities thrive – a future in which there is equal justice for all of us.\n\nWith so much on the line, we can’t leave anything on the table in our fight to confirm Jackson to the court.\n\nMini Timmaraju is the President of NARAL Pro-Choice America, an organization that advocates for abortion access in USA.\n\nPaul Callan: Timing is everything\n\nCNN\n\n​​With Russian troops on the march in Ukraine, Americans have not been sitting on the edge of their seats, waiting to see whom President Joe Biden will nominate to the US Supreme Court.\n\nInstead, they are glued to their television sets wondering if Russian President Vladimir Putin is crazy enough to trigger World War III in his quest to rebuild the former Soviet Union.\n\nBiden’s attempt to change the subject from war, inflation and the economy to the Supreme Court may hurt Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation prospects. The timing of this announcement means the White House has lost an important opportunity to rally the public behind Jackson before Republicans go on the offensive.\n\nNo doubt, Biden’s nominee is highly qualified for the position. Jackson checks all the right boxes – she holds a Harvard Law degree, clerked for federal judges and served as a public defender. She now sits as a federal appellate judge on the prestigious DC Circuit Court. She appears to be widely respected in the legal profession, and progressives have already applauded Biden’s decision to nominate her. Republicans, on the other hand, are likely to say that she is too radical for the Supreme Court.\n\nIronically, her biggest obstacle to a swift confirmation is more likely to be Putin than Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. With Americans more focused on the war in Ukraine than the Supreme Court, Jackson’s confirmation is unlikely to get the attention it deserves. Americans will need an opportunity to get to know Jackson, and the initial publicity surrounding any nominee serves an important educational purpose. Without that public support, Jackson could be more vulnerable to damaging attacks from the GOP.\n\nAnnouncing Jackson’s nomination at this moment, given the current crisis in Ukraine, is a rookie mistake for a president languishing in the polls. As a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden seems to have forgotten that even in the selection process for Supreme Court nominees, timing is everything.\n\nPaul Callan is a CNN legal analyst, a former New York homicide prosecutor and counsel to the New York law firm of Edelman & Edelman PC, focusing on wrongful conviction and civil rights cases.

Who’s talking to leadership? Who are the up-and-comers? What’s the floor action? What’s running quickly? What’s slowing down? And you need all these sort of tentacles out there, and then bringing that back every day.”\n\nBut unlike an actual conductor who is front and center of an orchestra, Terrell operates very much behind the scenes.\n\nIn fact, when we sat down for our conversation in the White House Executive Office Building, she said it was her first television interview – ever.\n\nTerrell’s years of experience in Washington have been critical to her success. She first started on the Hill over 20 years ago as a staffer for then-Sen. Biden on the Judiciary Committee. Looking back, she describes herself at the time as being just a “gal from Delaware,” in awe of the experienced legal clerks and seasoned staffers surrounding her. She quickly found her footing and thrived, going on to serve as Biden’s deputy chief of staff and later worked in the Obama administration’s Office of Legal Affairs – the very team she now leads.\n\nLouisa's children visit her in East Wing office in 2011 during the Obama Administration. Courtesy Louisa Terrell\n\nEven with her expansive resume, however, Terrell readily admits that today’s Washington is tougher to navigate than the one she first arrived in two decades ago.\n\n“The extremes have gotten extreme and I think that makes it harder,” she said. “You have to really work a lot harder to find where you can meet in the middle.”\n\nBeing able to call on the personal relationships she’s forged over the years on Capitol Hill proved critical to working across the aisle to find that middle ground, particularly given Democrats’ razor-thin majorities.\n\n“I’ll be very clear on what the president’s position is and why we want to see what we want to see done,” she said of her conversations with Republican lawmakers. “Republicans know that when this White House – and whether it’s us on our team or a senior official – gives the word, then we stand by our word. And I think that kind of credibility on the Hill has been very important to move things.”\n\nDeep relationships matter too, she said.\n\n“You get fuel from the other people you work with. And I get an incredible amount of fuel from the senior team here at the White House and just people who have years and years of experience and relationships in those matters.”\n\nIt’s the kind of work that can make or break a president, and even though it’s largely unheralded, that doesn’t mean it goes unnoticed. Following her confirmation to the Supreme Court as its first Black justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson included Terrell in her shout-outs as one of the “brilliant folks” who helped make the historic achievement possible.\n\nA lifelong Biden connection\n\nTerrell’s longest relationship in the White House is with the president himself. Though their professional relationship started when she came to Washington two decades ago, she first met Biden when she was just 5 years old.\n\n“I met Beau Biden in kindergarten,” Terrell, who is from Wilmington, recalled with a smile. “It (was) a very quick bike ride from my house to where Beau grew up. So we were childhood friends (and) stayed friends for … all our adulthood.”\n\nShe remembers visiting the Biden household as a kid, sharing with CNN a running joke from her childhood.\n\n“When we would go to Beau’s house, there was a fax machine in the living room and all you needed to know (was), do not screw up the fax machine,” she says with a laugh. “And again, this is Delaware and it was probably the first fax machine in Delaware, this is high tech equipment.”\n\nLouisa Terrell (bottom left) and Beau Biden (top left) in Wilmington, Delaware in the 1980s. Courtesy Louisa Terrell\n\nTerrell’s lifelong relationship with the Biden family means she brings a unique perspective to her work in the White House.\n\n“He knows my folks and just being connected that way,” she said. “You know where the person came from and I think that helps.”\n\n“It brings a warmth to the work and I feel very, very lucky about that,” she added.\n\nTerrell said her friend Beau, who died of a brain tumor in 2015, is always on her mind.\n\n“You want to represent what … the President wants you to do,” she said. “And then there’s always this other question of, what would Beau do? And I think of those things as kind of intertwined and they’re part of the background driver of how we do the work.”\n\nPaying it forward for women\n\nTwo years into her work on the Judiciary Committee, Terrell became pregnant. She says Biden’s office maintained a family-first culture. But as she continued her career in Washington, her kids got a bit older, and the balancing act became more complicated.\n\n“I had the job in the Obama administration when my kids were say, like, around 6 and 8 – or 4 and 6. It’s all a little bit of a blur,” she joked.\n\nShe describes her time after work as “bed, bath and beyond,” an entire “second shift” after a full day at the office. It’s something she’s extra mindful of now, as a senior woman in the administration.\n\n“I look across the White House, the women whose kids are that age, and you really have to (remember) how long their days and their nights are,” Terrell said. “And then to think about the kind of performance and the kind of 100% they’re giving at the office every day. I have so much gratitude and admiration.”\n\nWomen having a seat at the table is not just a phrase in Terrell’s office. When CNN stopped by one of her team meetings in the West Wing, the room was packed with young staffers – mostly women. Terrell says that was a conscious decision, not because of their gender, but because they were the best for the job.\n\n“(The) expectation is, be ready to contribute. And that’s kind of what I mean – be prepared and ready to play,” she said of the more junior staff. “Don’t be afraid to do that.”\n\nBut when asked what advice she would give to young women starting out in government today, Terrell didn’t hesitate.\n\n“I think that women today are way braver than I was,” she said. “It’s really impressive. So, I kind of think they don’t need my advice, actually, so, yeah, they don’t need me. I’m just happy to have drinks and coffee with them when they’ll take me,” she said with a laugh.\n\nNew challenges ahead\n\nTerrell and her team are knee-deep in negotiations for the final weeks of a Democratic House majority, which means competing priorities for the rest of the lame duck session – the most important of which is Congress’ basic function of funding the government.\n\nAs some Democrats tried to squeeze in legislation to regulate social media companies, Terrell’s stint at Facebook raised some questions among some advocacy groups, though Terrell maintains her stint at the tech giant 10 years ago doesn’t conflict with the president’s legislative agenda.\n\n“I think the president kind of came into office and campaigned on this about a very pro-competition, pro-accountability and pro-transparency in social media platforms, which obviously, what they are today is not what they were 10 years ago. So we worked really hard, I think, to promote those executive actions, the regulatory actions, the people that we brought into the administration to work on those, and worked hard on legislative pieces, and hope to continue to do that next year.”\n\nAnd though the Democratic majority in the Senate will slightly expand in January, Terrell’s office is on the front lines preparing for Republicans to take over the House and launch a wave of congressional investigations into Biden officials.\n\n“There’s obviously going to be a big piece of, ‘This is oversight’ – you’ve heard this – ‘We are watching,’ and that’s just to be expected,” Terrell says. “I think what the perspective of the president and the team here is, you can’t let that kind of swamp the boat.”\n\n“I think the president said that he’s ready to work with anyone who wants to work with him, hopes that Republicans will do this, and that they will get the people’s work done and not go down the proverbial rabbit holes of oversight.”\n\nShe insists her team’s relationships with not just Democrats but with Republicans across the aisle will pay off.\n\n“The kind of relationships you have with Republicans, we’ve been working on them the whole time,” she said. “There are folks in our shop, and again, folks here in the White House, who have some of those relationships. And so, it won’t feel like we’re parachuting in. It’ll just feel like a Chapter Two.”", "authors": ["Dana Bash Abbie Sharpe Greg Hughes", "Dana Bash", "Abbie Sharpe", "Greg Hughes"], "publish_date": "2022/12/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/10/opinions/herschel-walker-tragedy-raphael-warnock-hope-joseph/index.html", "title": "Opinion: The tragedy of Herschel Walker isn't over yet | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Peniel E.

The assumption that a Black football player whose celebrated symbolism in Georgia would be enough to split the Black vote thankfully went unrealized, but the reality that a number of White Georgians were willing to support Walker underscores the troubling questions ahead for a country mired in division and bracing for former President Donald Trump’s bid for his old office in 2024.\n\nPeniel E. Joseph Kelvin Ma/Tufts University/Kelvin Ma/Tufts University\n\nI’m relieved that Warnock, who serves as pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Sr. once led, defeated woefully unqualified Walker and claimed a full six-year term. His victory in a hotly contested race represents a triumph of substance over cynicism.\n\nWalker possessed absolutely no credentials to become the Republican Party’s Senate nominee, other than being a famous former athlete friendly with Trump.\n\nYet Walker, who starred as a running back during the early 1980s at the University of Georgia, turned this contest into a race to the bottom and ran a campaign whose toxic imprint won’t fade away so easily. Backed by Trump (who reportedly personally recruited the Heisman Trophy winner to run against Warnock) and a MAGA movement running on fumes, Walker served as an extreme manifestation of the ongoing misunderstanding and disrespect of the Black community by the Trump wing of the GOP.\n\nI grieve for the parts of America that enthusiastically embraced Walker’s candidacy. Some people are hopelessly unaware of the negative message their support of him sent to millions of Black Americans, who won’t soon forget it.\n\nThe GOP embrace of Walker represents an American tragedy. Walker’s behavior on the campaign trail included incoherent ramblings about movies and farm animals, nonsensical asides that went nowhere and dancing in front of overwhelmingly White audiences in bizarre scenes that recalled the minstrel shows of the Jim Crow era. The whiff of the Jim Crow era’s objectification of Black men as intellectually feeble but physically powerful grew stronger as Walker’s humiliating campaign continued to showcase the GOP’s failure to understand or connect with Black voters.\n\nYet the allegations that Walker serially abused women, traumatized his son Christian (who has openly criticized his father’s fitness for public office), engaged in extramarital affairs and pressured women into abortions did not prevent just over 48% of Georgians from supporting him. When pressed by reporters, Walker (who denied some of the allegations of violence against him and has cited mental health issues but hasn’t denied being violent toward his wife) rejected the abortion allegations. “You know, I’m done with this foolishness,” he told reporters. “I’ve already told people this is a lie.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear what Lindsey Graham said about some GOP blaming Trump for party losses 01:05 - Source: CNN\n\nFor too many White voters who remain enthralled by Trump, MAGA and January 6, Walker represents the only form of racial “progress” they find acceptable – and that problem wasn’t defeated at the polls the way Walker the candidate was. For too many of these voters, only a Black man who knows his “place”— as a figurehead for a Republican Party openly pursuing a policy agenda of voter suppression, educational censorship and reproductive injustice — is worthy of the support of many parts of Georgia’s electorate, a mere two years after George Floyd’s murder sent the entire nation (and parts of the world) into a period of public rebellion and private introspection.\n\nWhite support for Walker sends the exact wrong message for America at this moment in our history, not simply about political parties or ideology but also about the direction of our country. Still, I found hope in Warnock’s victory. While all the votes have yet to be counted, almost 100,000 more Georgians voted in support of a campaign whose belief in multiracial democracy represents ancestral dreams in action.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear why Marjorie Taylor Greene thinks Herschel Walker lost in Georgia 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\nBlack women in particular proved key to Warnock’s victory.

The Warnock campaign’s grassroots efforts helped to build the kind of multiracial coalition that would have made Dr. King proud.\n\nOn January 5, 2021, Warnock became the first Black person elected to the US Senate from Georgia in American history.

Trump’s election denialism and toxic rhetoric have blinkered the GOP’s political imagination and policy vision. If Warnock’s surprise win in 2021 reflected the galvanizing power of the racial and political reckoning unleashed the previous summer, this hard-fought victory represents a clear moral rejection of the kind of cynical political environment that leads to candidates such as Walker in the first place.\n\nAnd that is reason enough to fully acknowledge the pain left behind by Walker’s candidacy, and even more reason to celebrate Warnock’s win as more than a partisan victory for the Democratic Party.

Dillingham\n\nGuest columnist\n\nCol. Wayne E. Dillingham is retired from the U.S. Air Force and lives in Murfreesboro.\n\nColonial Pipeline’s operations recently ground to a halt, and a major component of our nation’s infrastructure was substantially crippled — at least temporarily. From the public’s perspective, the harm was caused by bad actors in cyberspace seeking a ransom that, according to most news reports, was eventually paid.\n\nEven if we assume the above as facts, adding nothing more, the national security implications are bone-chilling. Yet those implications are not at all new to our national security and defense communities.\n\nAs an Air Force colonel and judge advocate, I was the legal advisor at the headquarters of U.S. Space Command in Colorado Springs from 1998-2001. During that time, President Bill Clinton assigned us the newly minted Department of Defense missions of computer network attack and computer network defense. Subsequent years saw the creation of the U.S. Cyber Command to assume those missions and develop new terminology regarding offensive and defensive cyberspace operations.\n\nI’ll leave it to others to discuss authoritatively today’s roles performed by Cyber Command, the National Security Agency and others. I’ve been retired far too long for that. Instead, my purpose here is to emphasize that, at least as far back as the turn of the century, U.S. national security and defense officials contemplated cyberattacks on our infrastructure and elsewhere.\n\nEstablished rules apply to cyber operations\n\nI was among the relatively small handful of legal professionals tasked with providing a legal framework for analysis in this context. At the time, some believed cyber operations gave rise to an entirely new field of law with countless new legal issues — a “Wild West” environment. Yet most of us didn’t view it that way at all. Instead, we turned to established rules and principles within that subset of international law known as either the laws of armed conflict or the laws of war.\n\nHear more Tennessee voices:Get the weekly opinion newsletter for insightful and thought-provoking columns.\n\nIn light of current events, I returned to my unclassified PowerPoint slides from November 2000. (As I said, these concepts are not new.) During those days, I regularly lectured and taught classes on these legal issues.\n\nMy slides reminded me that, as in most legal matters, the first inquiry is factual. In this context, it’s attribution: Who did what to whom?\n\nWas a state actor involved?\n\nRegarding Colonial Pipeline, the case may have involved nothing more than a criminal element seeking a ransom payment, in contrast to an outright cyberattack on our infrastructure by a state actor (for example, Russia). Yet the factual inquiry must continue: Was there a state actor that aided and abetted or otherwise provided a safe haven for that element, perhaps knowing of these activities and turning a blind eye? If so, to what extent should we hold that state actor accountable?\n\nNext, if a state actor were involved, should we view the cyberattack as an “act of war?” Modern international law generally avoids that term, relying instead on the U.N. Charter analysis regarding the use of force. There, we focus on the threat or use of aggressive force. That gives rise to the right of self-defense, under the Charter’s Article 51, if an armed attack occurred. We may also consider the various arguments for and against our employing “anticipatory self-defense.”\n\nIn 2000, as I offered these presentations, the majority view was that “force” involved armed force. So where were we to fit cyberattacks? At the time, there was no clear consensus in international law, although I sense that may have evolved in recent years.\n\nDuring that time, the Defense Department considered that the best approach was to focus on the effects or consequences of a cyberattack — not unlike considerations of an attack using bombs or missiles. My slides offered the following examples: “death, injury, property damage, release of dangerous forces, disruption of national security capabilities during a crisis, etc.” In other words, if a cyberattack were to cause any of these or similar effects or consequences, then our legal analysis should view the attack as having used the equivalent of armed force.\n\nIn the Colonial Pipeline case, according to open news reporting, we saw a cyberattack that adversely affected our economy and threatened our national security to a very substantial degree. Therefore, using the above legal analysis, I have no difficulty in concluding it should be viewed not unlike an attack using armed force.\n\nWhat then? Having satisfied our legal analysis, the issues turn to those of policy: What — if anything — should our national decision-makers do in response? The list of underlying policy considerations in deciding seems almost limitless. Yet first, we must return to attribution: Do we know with certainty exactly who conducted the Colonial Pipeline attack, and do we know whether — and to what extent — a state actor was involved? Those answers require a tremendous capability on the part of our intelligence community. Those matters are, of course, beyond the scope of my comments here.\n\nBottom line: Don’t think that the notion of a cyberattack is new within our national security and defense thinking or that we don’t know how to analyze those issues. We’ve been doing so for years.\n\nCol. Wayne E.

They claim the Russian leader is isolated, poorly advised and lacking real intelligence on just how badly the war is going.\n\nWestern governments are preventing Putin from defining the narrative of the war – just as they did before it began, when their declassified intelligence correctly called an invasion many geopolitical experts thought was unlikely.\n\nIt is a tough position for a Russian leader who has often deployed information warfare himself, notably while meddling in US and European elections. The remarkable detail of the declassified intelligence assessments must also be especially galling to Putin, a former KGB officer and intelligence chief. And they leave open the possibility that Western intelligence agencies have the capacity to see deep into the Kremlin’s war effort and internal politics, which is likely to infuriate the Russian leader and could open further cracks in his regime.\n\nThe willingness of Western governments to be so open about what they are seeing inside Ukraine and Moscow has surprised even some veteran spies.\n\n“It makes intelligence professionals, even former ones like me, nervous, because, of course, it’s so ingrained in us to protect sources and methods,” Steve Hall, former chief of Russia operations for the CIA, told CNN’s Ana Cabrera Thursday.\n\nPart of the intrigue about the US showdown with Putin and the intelligence angle is being fed by the nature of the covert community itself. Outsiders have no way of independently assessing the full accuracy of the information being pushed into the public view by their leaders. So we don’t know where it’s all coming from or from whom. But of course, that’s the point, and it’s keeping the Russians guessing too.\n\nThe attempt to portray the war in Ukraine as a disaster for Russia is coming at a moment when Western officials are discounting Moscow’s claims that it is deescalating the conflict in Kyiv and elsewhere. Instead, they say, Putin’s forces are “repositioning” – possibly for an intensified assault in eastern Ukrainian regions where Moscow has been pummeling civilians and razing cities. Such a tactic could be designed to unite Russian-held areas with Crimea, which Putin seized in 2014, and to give Moscow a direct corridor to the Black Sea through Ukraine.\n\nThe inside story of the war\n\nIn recent days, Western officials have sketched a remarkable portrait of the war.\n\nIn Australia on Monday, one of Britain’s top spy chiefs, Jeremy Fleming, said that Putin had “massively misjudged” the war, the resistance of the Ukrainian people and his own military’s capacity, and had been poorly served by his subordinates.\n\n“We’ve seen Russian soldiers – short of weapons and morale – refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft,” said Fleming, who heads GCHQ, the UK’s equivalent of the National Security Agency. Fleming’s frankness was extraordinary coming from a leading espionage agency chief. But it is being mirrored in the United States where there were new reports on Wednesday that opened a window into the war and Putin’s inner circle.\n\nAn official told CNN’s Jeremy Diamond that Putin is being “misinformed” by advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and the impact of sanctions on the Russian economy. \\White House communications director Kate Bedingfield then said on camera that the Russian leader’s advisers were “too afraid to tell him the truth.” She said there was now a “persistent tension” between Putin and his military leadership.\n\nOn Wednesday, this new stream of declassified assessments made headlines. On Thursday, President Joe Biden was asked about them in a public setting, as officials presumably knew he would be. The sequence gave the President the chance to further amplify the US narrative.\n\n“There’s a lot of speculation,” Biden said, though of course that speculation had been driven by information that the White House had allowed into the public domain. Asked how badly Putin was being misinformed by his advisers, Biden replied, “I’m not saying this with a certainty – he seems to be self-isolating, and there’s some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers.” While Biden said that the US didn’t have that much hard evidence, his comments unleashed a whole new torrent of attention on Putin’s current situation.\n\nSo what exactly are Western governments trying to do with this novel use of declassified intelligence assessments? Especially given that in many previous geopolitical crises, intelligence was kept secret by routine?\n\nAs with the pre-invasion messaging, it’s clear that the US does not want the Russians to be able to create a dominant narrative of their own about the war through disinformation. Creating a picture of a failing war also helps maintain support for the tough Western stand against Putin. It may also improve morale among Ukrainians who are resisting Russia’s onslaught. And it gives Western leaders a political opening to argue their policies are working as they manage public opinion on the war.\n\nBy providing a look into the disarray among Russian troops, the allies may be able to build internal political pressure on the Kremlin. Given the Moscow government’s crushing of independent media, there will be few illusions that the Russian people will hear the US version of events, though tech-savvy younger Russians with VPN passwords allowing access to foreign internet services might.\n\nBut a drumbeat of humiliation for Russia could further sow discord inside the military, political and intelligence elites. In recent days, it has almost seemed as though Western officials, by discussing the situation in the war so openly, have been trying to address Putin and his advisers directly.\n\nThe complications of an intelligence-driven strategy\n\nIt’s unlikely the intelligence stream will dry up any time soon. That’s because it seems to be rooted in a morale problem inside Russian armed forces, which became obvious thanks to eavesdropping.\n\n“They’re whipping out their cell phones and trying to communicate with each other, both tactically, ‘Where are you? Where’s your unit?’ and perhaps also back home in Moscow. That makes it really easy to collect,” Hall said.\n\n“And then, it’s an interesting political decision to say, look, it’s worth perhaps showing the Russians how good we are at collecting this stuff, in order to get the word out to citizens of both countries, citizens of the world, as to what’s really going on in the Russian military right now,” Hall added.\n\n“It’s an interesting decision, but it’s been very illuminating.”\n\nStill there is reason for caution in interpreting the war solely based on the West’s declassified assessments.\n\nIntelligence, by definition, is a murky business. The information about the Russian operations in Ukraine and the apparent isolation of Putin in Moscow only tell the outside world what the Western intelligence services want to release. There is, therefore, no way for outsiders to know whether these snapshots give the full picture or a more selective one.\n\nAnd the information that does filter out is still limited. An official cited by CNN’s Diamond and Kevin Liptak on Wednesday declined to provide additional details of Putin being misinformed by his advisers other than what was reported. The intelligence community declassified and downgraded a summary of their findings but not the material itself.\n\nAs always, intelligence agencies are taking strenuous steps to avoid identifying their sources and the methods that were used to collect the intelligence.\n\nThere have been multiple times in recent American history – for example, before the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, when US intelligence assessments have proven to be faulty. In this crisis, however, the covert community has repaired some of its reputation. For weeks, the US warned that Putin was getting ready to send his forces across the Ukrainian border. Even the Ukrainians were skeptical.\n\nThen hours before the invasion actually happened, the US issued a warning that the incursion was imminent – and was proven correct.\n\nStill, the problems encountered by the Russian invading force have surprised Western intelligence agencies and have caused a reassessment of assumptions about the supposed might of Russia’s military forces and leadership.\n\nThe head of US European Command, Gen. Tod Wolters, said at a Senate hearing this week that there could be an intelligence gap that led the US to overestimate Russia’s strength and underestimate Ukrainian defenses.\n\nBut even that oversight only underscores the surprisingly poor performance of Russia’s forces, and draws attention to it, further advancing the West’s goals.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/04/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/09/russia-engineered-election-hacks-europe/96216556/", "title": "Russia engineered election hacks and meddling in Europe", "text": "Oren Dorell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nRussia's alleged use of computer hacking to interfere with the U.S. presidential election fits a pattern of similar incidents across Europe for at least a decade.\n\nCyberattacks in Ukraine, Bulgaria, Estonia, Germany, France and Austria that investigators attributed to suspected Russian hackers appeared aimed at influencing election results, sowing discord and undermining faith in public institutions that included government agencies, the media and elected officials.\n\nThose investigations bolster U.S. intelligence findings of Russian meddling to help elect Donald Trump, a conclusion the president-elect has disputed — although he conceded Friday after a private intelligence briefing that Russia was among the possible hacking culprits.\n\n“They’ve been very good at using the West’s weaknesses against itself, the open Internet to hack, the free media to sow discord, and to cause people to question the underpinnings of the systems under which they live,” said Hannah Thoburn, a research fellow at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank.\n\nU.S. National Intelligence Director James Clapper told a Senate committee Thursday that Russian intelligence hackers, masquerading as third parties, have conducted attacks abroad that targeted critical infrastructure networks. “Russia also has used cyber tactics and techniques to seek to influence public opinion across Europe and Eurasia,” Clapper said.\n\nA declassified intelligence report on the Russian hacking released Friday accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering the effort to help elect Trump.

Russian sabotage of Western computer systems started that same year.\n\nRussia and Europe's extremist parties find common cause\n\nHere is a closer look at those incidents:\n\nESTONIA\n\nIn 2007, Estonia accused hackers using Russian IP addresses of a wide-scale denial of service attack that shut down the Internet in the former Soviet republic and one of NATO’s newest members. The attack on the Estonian government, newspaper and banking websites appeared to be a response to Estonian authorities’ decision to remove a Soviet World War II memorial known as the Bronze Soldier from a central square in Tallinn, the Baltic nation's capital.\n\nRussia denied the accusation. According to The Guardian newspaper, the attacks came in waves that coincided with riots on May 3, 2007, over the statue, whose removal drew objections from Russia and Russian-speaking Estonians, and on May 8 and 9, when Russia celebrated its victory over Nazi Germany.\n\nUKRAINE\n\nDays before the 2014 parliamentary elections that followed the ouster of pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych, hackers launched a multi-pronged attack on Ukraine’s Central Election Commission website with a denial of service attack and a separate attempt to fake voting results, according to Ukrainian investigators. They blamed the attacks on a pro-Russia group called CyberBerkut.\n\nHudson analyst Thoburn, who was working as an election observer in Ukraine at the time, said the Ukrainians were able to get around it by deleting their entire system and restoring it from a backup that was not contaminated.\n\nUkrainian officials have also accused Russia of being behind a power grid attack in December 2015 that cut power to 80,000 in western Ukraine.\n\nIn overt actions against Ukraine, Russia seized the province of Crimea in 2014 and helped armed separatists launch a rebellion in eastern Ukraine.\n\nGERMANY\n\nGerman intelligence in 2015 accused Russia of hacking at least 15 computers belonging to members of Germany’s lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, and stealing data. Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) said the attack was conducted by a group called Sofacy, which “is being steered by the Russian state.\"\n\nBfV chief Hans-Georg Maassen told Reuters in November that Moscow has tried to manipulate the media and public opinion through various means, including planting false stories. One in 2015 by Russian media was about a German-Russian girl kidnapped and raped by migrants in Berlin.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said she could not rule out Russian interference in Germany's 2017 federal election through Internet attacks and disinformation campaigns.\n\nBULGARIA\n\nThe country's Central Election Commission had been hacked during a referendum and local elections in 2015 that was almost certainly linked to Russia and a group that had hacked NATO headquarters in Brussels in 2013, then-President Rosen Plevneliev told the BBC in November.\n\n\"The same organization that has attacked the (German Parliament) — stealing all the emails of German members of Parliament — the same institution that has attacked NATO headquarters, and that is the same even that has tried to influence American elections lately and so in a very high probability you could point east from us” (to Moscow), Plevneliev said.\n\nA pro-Russian political novice was elected in November to replace Plevneliev.\n\nOSCE\n\nThe Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, whose tasks include monitoring elections across Europe and the conflict in eastern Ukraine, was attacked in “a major information security incident” in November, spokeswoman Mersiha Causevic Podzic said.\n\nThe incident “compromised the confidentiality” of the organization’s IT networks, Podzic said.\n\nThe French daily Le Monde, which first reported the incident, cited a Western intelligence agency attributing the attack to the Russia-linked group APT28, aka Fancy Bear, and Sofacy. Russia, a member of the OSCE, has objected to the group’s criticism of Russian-backed forces battling the Ukrainian government in eastern Ukraine.\n\nFRANCE\n\nRussian hackers posing as the “Cyber Caliphate” were suspected of attacking France’s TV5Monde television channel in 2014, causing extensive damage to the company’s computer systems, FireEye, a cyber security firm that examined the attack, told BuzzFeed.

Results show that coffee plants will be “drastically” less suitable for cultivation in current coffee-producing regions by 2050 because of the impacts of climate change.\n\nArabica coffee, which is used by Starbucks and other major coffee sellers, is already a finicky crop that requires specific conditions to flourish. Currently the most suitable areas for coffee growth are in Central and South America, particularly Brazil, as well as Central and West Africa and parts of South and Southeast Asia, according to the study by Roman Grüter and others at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland.\n\nOver the next 28 years, projected climate change impacts to those areas will make them far less friendly to coffee crops, the report found.\n\nA worker picks coffee cherries during a harvest in Colombia. Edinson Ivan Arroyo Mora/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“The main coffee producing countries investigated (Brazil, Vietnam, Indonesia, Colombia) are all seriously affected by climate change with a strong decline in suitable areas … and an increase in unsuitable areas by 2050,” according to the report, which noted that higher temperatures make it harder to grow coffee.\n\nThe study also looked at how climate change will impact growing conditions for cashews and avocados. For those items, rising temperatures could actually create new viable growing environments in some areas, according to the report. Coffee, however, “proved to be most vulnerable, with negative climate impacts dominating in all main producing regions,” the study found.\n\nThe authors concluded that for all three crops, “climate change adaptation will be necessary in most major producing regions.” That could include breeding varieties that are better suited to the new conditions. And in the case of coffee, it might also mean switching to Robusta trees, which are hardier but produce beans generally considered to be of lower quality than Arabica beans.\n\n“In the worst case, it could also mean that farmers would have to shift to a different crop,” Grüter told CNN Business, adding that it’s “difficult to say at what point and where this will happen.”\n\nSome companies are already preparing for the changing conditions.

More than half of the bat species in the United States are in severe decline or listed as endangered. And international scientists recently announced the monarch butterfly is perilously close to extinction.\n\nWhat these three creatures have in common is that they are all pollinators. Without them, fruits, vegetables and other plants wouldn’t be pollinated, and that’s a major problem for our food supply.\n\n“One out of every three bites of food that we eat” is directly connected to a pollinator, Ron Magill, the communications director and a wildlife expert at Zoo Miami, told CNN. Around 30% of the food that ends up on our tables gets there because of things like butterflies, bees and bats.\n\nLosing those critical populations could also mean losing some of our favorite foods.\n\nApples, melons, cranberries, pumpkins, squash, broccoli and almonds are among the foods most susceptible to the pollinator decline, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Bees, in particular, are responsible for pollinating around 90 commercially produced crops, the agency reports. Even tequila is at risk.\n\n“It’s all so intricately connected, whether you’re eating the food that is directly pollinated or you’re eating something that depends on that pollinator,” Magill said. “It’s a domino effect.”\n\nIn other words, if you are eating fried chicken or pork chops, those chickens and pigs eat fruit, vegetables and other plants that depend on pollinators.\n\nA monarch butterfly. courtesy Ron Magill\n\nAnd the climate crisis has taken a toll on pollinators. While more intense and prolonged drought is the most obvious impact, a growing concern is the effect of extreme heat – particularly on butterflies.\n\n“Because butterflies are some of the most sensitive insects to changes in temperature, they are considered the ‘canary in the coal mine’ when it comes to climate change,” Magill said.\n\nWarmer temperatures cause plants to bloom sooner, which is out of sync with when the butterflies lay their eggs and metamorphose. This will mean the flowers they depend on for food will have already bloomed out, leaving little for the butterflies to feed on, which will in turn greatly impact their ability to reproduce and survive.\n\nIt snowballs into a cyclical problem where the butterflies can’t get the food they need to reproduce, nor can the plants get pollinated – causing both to suffer greatly.\n\nBees tending a honeycomb. courtesy Ron Magill\n\nAlso, for butterflies like monarchs that are known for long migrations from the Northern US to Mexico – food along their route may no longer be available at the time that the natural migration takes place.\n\nA UN report in 2019 found that a million species are at risk of extinction in the coming decades, as the climate crisis accelerates.

California is pushing to restrict bee-killing pesticides.\n\nMagill noted that while these declines are happening gradually, they will eventually be too great for ecosystems to overcome – like a tipping point beyond which some species will be lost forever.\n\n“You know, what is the straw that is going to break the camel’s back when it comes to the balance of the environment?” Magill said.\n\nTequila at risk\n\nBats also play an irreplaceable role in food security. The USDA points to recent studies which estimate that bats eat enough pests to save more than $1 billion per year in crop damage and pesticide costs in the United States, mostly from the corn industry alone.\n\n“Across all agricultural production, consumption of insect pests by bats results in a savings of more than $3 billion per year,” according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nBats are also vital pollinators.\n\n“You wouldn’t have tequila if you had no bats, because that’s the only thing that pollinates the agave plant that makes tequila,” Magill said.\n\nBats pollinate the agave plant, a base ingredient for tequila.

If you plant a cactus in Louisiana, it’s not going to do well in the humid environment. Likewise, impatiens or begonias will not do well in the desert Southwest as they require a tremendous amount of water to flourish.\n\nAn atala butterfly. courtesy Ron Magill\n\nA new online database helps users in the UK find pollinator friendly plants for their gardens, and support biodiversity. Similar lists of native, pro-pollinator plants exist for the United States.\n\n“When you plant native wildflowers, you’re planting a buffet for the wildlife that needs that to survive,” Magill says. “That’s the refueling stations for our pollinators.”\n\nMagill points to Lady Bird Johnson’s effort to beautify roadsides in the US. While her goal was nationwide, her efforts shone in Texas.\n\n“She did such a wonderful thing with wildflowers in Texas,” Magill says. “There are times you can drive through Texas, and you can see wildflowers for as far as the eyes can see, and it’s such a beautiful sight, because she understood the value of that.”\n\nWhile other states are doing that along roadways as well, individual homeowners can also do the same.\n\n“We have beautiful plant life in our native areas where we live in this country. If we could focus more on that and start rebuilding what was naturally here, we can start bringing back those natural rhythms.”\n\nYou can also work to reduce your pesticide and chemical use around your home. Good alternatives include using organic products such as compost for soil health and adding beneficial insects like ladybugs, praying mantises, or even nematodes to keep pests away.", "authors": ["Allison Chinchar Jennifer Gray", "Allison Chinchar", "Jennifer Gray"], "publish_date": "2022/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/01/27/wine-supply-threatened-climate-change-new-study-says/4590653002/", "title": "Climate change: Wine supply threatened due to global warming", "text": "Wine grapes are extremely sensitive to the changes in temperature and season that come with climate change.\n\n\"Wine is like the canary in the coal mine for climate change impacts on agriculture.\"\n\nBut there is hope: By switching some of the varieties of wine around, losses could be reduced.\n\nNow this is getting serious.\n\nMany of the world's prime wine-growing regions could shrink dramatically due to human-caused climate change, a study released Monday suggests.\n\nThis is because wine grapes are extremely sensitive to the changes in temperature and season that come with climate change.\n\nIn fact, if the global temperature rises by 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, the regions of the world that are suitable for growing wine grapes could shrink by as much as 56% , according to the study.\n\nAnd with 7.2 degrees of warming, 85% of those lands would no longer be able to produce good wines.\n\n“In some ways, wine is like the canary in the coal mine for climate change impacts on agriculture because these grapes are so climate-sensitive,” said study co-author Benjamin Cook of Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.\n\nThe study was conducted by combining long-term records with global data on where different wine grapes are planted.\n\nWine-growing regions that are already warm now – such as Italy, Spain and Australia – will see the largest losses as the planet heats up. But the scientists say that cooler wine-growing regions in countries like Germany, New Zealand and the U.S. Pacific Northwest could be relatively unscathed.\n\nClimate change is coming for your wine:What the world's wineries are doing to save grapes\n\nStill, overall, study authors said that losses were unavoidable in both warming scenarios, due to shifting temperatures and seasonal changes that would affect conditions while the varieties were ripening.\n\nThese factors would also affect the wines’ quality, the study said.\n\nWine varieties studied included cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, merlot, pinot noir, riesling, sauvignon blanc and syrah.\n\nBut there is hope. By switching some of the varieties of wine around, losses could be reduced. The study said that reshuffling where certain grape varieties are grown could halve the potential losses of wine-growing regions.\n\n\"By switching these varieties around, you can reduce losses by a significant amount,” said Cook.\n\nHowever, switching wine grape varieties could come with significant legal, cultural and financial challenges.\n\n“Conversations in Europe have already begun about new legislation to make it easier for major regions to change the varieties they grow,” said study co-author Elizabeth Wolkovich of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.\n\n“But growers still must learn to grow these new varieties,\" she said. \"That’s a big hurdle in some regions that have grown the same varieties for hundreds and hundreds of years, and they need consumers who are willing to accept different varieties from their favorite regions.”\n\nCook added that “the key is that there are still opportunities to adapt viticulture to a warmer world. It just requires taking the problem of climate change seriously.”\n\nThe study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n​​​​​​​Climate change:Republican and Democratic voters actually agree on many climate change solutions.

World's beer supply threatened by global warming", "text": "Now this is getting serious.\n\nWorldwide, over the next few decades, beer could become more scarce and thus more expensive because of human-caused global warming, a study reported Monday.\n\nThe production of barley, the main ingredient in beer, is likely to drop substantially because severe droughts and heat extremes will become more frequent as the climate changes, the study says. \"Average yield losses (of barley) range from 3 percent to 17 percent, depending on the severity of the conditions,\" the study says.\n\nIn the USA, beer shortages could reduce the amount Americans consume each year by as much as 900 million gallons. That's (gulp) about 9 billion bottles of beer.\n\n\"Future climate and pricing conditions could put beer out of reach for hundreds of millions of people around the world,\" said study co-author Nathan Mueller of the University of California-Irvine.\n\nThis is the first study to quantify the effect of climate change on beer, the world's most popular alcoholic beverage.\n\n\"While the effects on beer may seem modest in comparison to many of the other impacts of climate change, there is nonetheless something fundamental in the cross-cultural appreciation of beer,\" said study lead author Dabo Guan of the U.K.'s University of East Anglia.\n\nResearchers used computer models to predict the possible effects of extreme climates on barley yields in 34 regions around the world. They examined the effects of the resulting barley supply shock on the supply and price of beer in each region under several climate scenarios.\n\nOn average, beer prices are likely to double as less barley becomes available, according to the study. One of the most affected countries would be Ireland – where beer prices could increase by as much as 338 percent by 2099 under the most severe scenario.\n\nAs for consumption, the global amount of beer consumed could fall by as much as 16 percent.\n\nIn the worst-case climate scenario, parts of the world where barley is grown – including the northern Great Plains, Canadian prairies, Europe, Australia and the Asian steppe – were projected to experience more frequent droughts and heat waves.\n\n“Current levels of fossil-fuel consumption and carbon dioxide pollution – business as usual – will result in this worst-case scenario, with more weather extremes negatively impacting the world’s beer basket,” Mueller said. “Our study showed that even modest warming will lead to increases in drought and excessive heat events in barley-growing areas.”\n\nThe likelihood of weather conditions hurting barley production would increase from about once a decade before 2050 to once every other year by the end of the century, the research showed.\n\nScientists have long known that barley “is one of the most heat-sensitive crops globally,” but the new study connects that to something that people care about – the price of beer – so it’s valuable, said David Lobell, a Stanford University agriculture ecologist who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"Increasingly, research has begun to project the impacts of climate change on world food production, focusing on staple crops such as wheat, maize, soybean and rice,\" study lead author Guan said. \"However, if adaptation efforts prioritize necessities, climate change may undermine the availability, stability and access to 'luxury' goods to a greater extent than staple foods.\"\n\nThe study was published in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature Plants.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/economy/heat-inflation-economy-drought/index.html", "title": "Extreme weather could push food inflation even higher | CNN ...", "text": "Minneapolis CNN Business —\n\nWeather has long been a fickle farmhand, devastating fields one year while delivering bountiful harvests the next.\n\nBut as extreme weather events increase in frequency or become even more intense, the unpredictability is becoming more of an economic liability.\n\nAs the United States continues to battle high inflation, the effects of prolonged droughts and extreme weather events could help keep the heat on prices for a long time to come.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index, which measures price changes for a basket of goods and services, showed inflation hit 8.3% in August from the year before. But food prices rose at an even faster pace, increasing by 11.4% during that period, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nScorching heat and drought continue to bear down on the American West, forcing farmers in vital agriculture-producing states to fallow land, pull up orchards, reduce livestock herds, and slash expected yields.\n\n“The prolonged droughts that we’re seeing [present] some increased risk that inflation remains higher for a longer time,” said Charlie Dougherty, a Wells Fargo economist who recently co-authored a status report on the economic state of American agriculture.\n\nThe high heat and drought have only compounded the issues facing American farmers, including supply chain ripple effects from Russia’s war against Ukraine that have caused inputs such as fertilizer to surge in price; nationwide worker shortages; and inflation and high energy prices, the economists noted.\n\n“When you’ve put all that together, farmers and ranchers have experienced extraordinary cost pressures,” Dougherty said. “And those higher costs are being passed on to consumers.” The rise in food prices is one of the key factors fueling inflation, according to recent CPI data.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of fruits, tree nuts and vegetables are sourced from drought-stricken states such as California and Texas, the American Farm Bureau Federation noted in a recent market update.\n\nThe drought and its effects “will likely result in American consumers paying more for these goods and either partially relying on foreign supplies or shrinking the diversity of items they buy at the store,” according to the Farm Bureau. “Drought conditions in the US also risk global access to some items like almonds, since California produces 80% of the world’s supply.”\n\nWhile the majority of those specialty crops are holding up, one of the hardest-hit crops in California has been rice, according to Aaron Smith, UC Davis’ DeLoach professor of agricultural economics.\n\nRice acres have dropped by 55% this year, Smith said, noting US Department of Agriculture data showing an increase in prevented-planting acres, or land intended for a crop but prevented by natural disaster or inadequate water.\n\nCalifornia, which is second to Arkansas in rice production among US states, generates about $900 million of rice annually, he said. California is a key producer and exporter of medium-grain rice, found in sushi and risotto dishes. While the acreage drop represents a big hit to US rice production, the effects could be mitigated by other sources, he said.\n\n“If you look in a global perspective, which is what drives the price of rice, California is not a very big producer relative to the whole world,” Smith said. “The local impact is very big; the global impact and the consumer impact for now — not so big.”\n\nA worker walks along a dried-up field of sunflowers while extreme weather conditions, including record-breaking heat waves, are the latest sign of climate change in the western United States, where wildfires and severe drought have emerged as a growing threat, near Sacramento, California, U.S., August 18, 2022. Carlos Barria/Reuters\n\nThe globalized economy and trade serve as a buffer to an extent, said Josué Medellín-Azuara, an associate professor of environmental engineering at UC Merced who studies climate change adaption and the economics of agricultural, environmental and urban water uses.\n\n“I don’t think we’re in a situation of food insecurity at this point, but it’s really just a reminder that warmer temperatures can bring some more challenges to produce many of the agricultural commodities we traditionally see,” he said. “There’s a recognition that the groundwater reserves won’t always be there to help us weather future droughts, if we don’t use those more sustainably.”\n\nWeather whiplash\n\nIn far western Minnesota, a few miles from the South Dakota border, Anne Schwagerl and her family run a 400-acre organic farm.\n\nLast year, Schwagerl and other farmers across the North Star State endured the worst drought seen in decades. Some of the yields were halved on her family’s farm, where they grow crops such as corn, soy beans, oats and rye.\n\nThis year brought the rain. By mid-June, about 75% of the state saw above-average levels of precipitation, according to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.\n\n“We had a really challenging fall harvest and then a wet winter, which was great,” Schwagerl said. “We needed that rain, but then it kept coming, and we had a very wet late spring. So it was this whiplash feeling of knowing that this could change [at] the drop of a hat.”\n\nA soaked field of newly planted corn at Anne Schwagerl's Prairie Point Farm in western Minnesota after a heavy storm in the spring of 2022 dropped 3.5 inches of rain. The heavy rain came months after Schwagerl and other Minnesota farmers endured the worst drought in decades and exemplifies the \"whiplash\" nature of extreme weather, she said. Anne Schwagerl\n\nAnd in the past couple of years, the intensity of those weather events has only increased and relatively infrequent weather phenomena like derechos — long-lasting and high-powered wind storms that can crush grain bins like they were soda cans — have joined the vernacular, she said.\n\n“2019 was a historically wet year. All throughout the year, we couldn’t miss a rain for love or money,” she said. “2020 was Covid, our first Covid year, where everything was locked down. And then 2021, we went through a once-in-a-generation drought.”\n\n“It feels like you can’t use those words like ‘once-in-a-generation’ anymore because they keep happening. Does that still have meaning?” she added.\n\nSchwagerl is feeling uneasy about what 2023 might bring in terms of input costs, commodity prices and weather.\n\n“We’re riding along on this endless roller coaster at the same time as everyone else,” she said.\n\nCompounding factors\n\nAriel Ortiz-Bobea, an applied economist at Cornell University working on agricultural and resources economics, is optimistic about the private and public sector investing in research and development and other mechanisms to improve productivity and conserve resources. He expressed concern about lesser-developed countries and the effect of global events such as the war in Ukraine.\n\n“If things get more politically hairy, those [drought] events become more painful,” he said.\n\nExtreme weather also can negatively affect companies’ bottom lines, according to research from Paul Griffin, professor of management at UC Davis.\n\nGriffin’s research of heat effect found that every degree over 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius) translates into an annualized loss of sales of 0.63% and a profit margin decrease of 0.16%. Stock prices dropped by an average of 22 basis points in response to a heat spell, Griffin found.\n\nCorn crops that died due to extreme heat and drought during a heatwave in Austin, Texas, on Monday, July 11, 2022. Jordan Vonderhaar/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“The implication there is that if sales are decreasing, then firms will have an incentive to raise prices,” he said.\n\nThe exact extent to which extreme heat, drought and, more broadly, climate change will play a role in prices and inflation is extremely difficult to estimate, Smith said.\n\nThere are far more costs baked in to the price of a product than what consumers pay at the grocery store — including wages, materials, production, processing, transportation, distribution, retailing, and marketing, he said. Farmers and ranches receive an estimated 8 cents from every dollar spent on food at home and away from home, according to the Farm Bureau.\n\n“All those costs are much bigger pieces of the food pie than the actual value of the food that’s produced by the farmer,” he said. “So when we’re looking at food prices and worrying about things that might increase food prices, we probably should be paying more attention to those costs of processing and transportation and marketing rather than what’s happening on the farm.”\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine helped fuel a sharp rise in oil prices, which filtered down through key inputs such as fuel and fertilizer; and it complicated already tangled supply chains, further raising costs for all the businesses that help bring farm products to the table.\n\nStill, the very prospect of more extreme weather could further sap away groundwater and limit the cultivation potential in the future, Smith said.\n\n“That’s probably going to mean, as we look forward, fewer acres of the different fruits and vegetables that are grown in California and that people around the country eat,” he said. “So that, inevitably, in the long run will raise prices — maybe not this year, but they will go up.”", "authors": ["Alicia Wallace"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/17/business/west-drought-farmers-survey-climate/index.html", "title": "American farmers are killing their own crops and selling cows ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nNearly three quarters of US farmers say this year’s drought is hurting their harvest – with significant crop and income loss, according to a new survey by the American Farm Bureau Federation, a lobbying group that represents agricultural interests.\n\nThis year’s drought conditions are taking a harder toll than last year’s, as 37% of farmers said they are plowing through and killing existing crops that won’t reach maturity because of dry conditions. That’s a jump from 24% last year, according to the survey.\n\nJuly was the third-hottest on record for the US and ranked in the top 10 for every state in the West except for Montana, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information. The US Department of Agriculture’s weekly weather and crop bulletin ending the week of August 6 reported “rapidly intensifying drought gripped the central and southern Plains and mid-South, depleting topsoil moisture and significantly stressing rangeland, pastures, and various summer crops.”\n\nThe AFBF estimates nearly 60% of West, South and Central Plains are experiencing severe drought or higher this year.\n\n“The effects of this drought will be felt for years to come, not just by farmers and ranchers but also by consumers. Many farmers have had to make the devastating decision to sell off livestock they have spent years raising or destroy orchard trees that have grown for decades,” said Zippy Duvall, AFBF president.\n\nThe AFBF survey was conducted across 15 states from June 8 to July 20 in extreme drought regions from Texas to North Dakota to California, which makes up nearly half of the country’s agricultural production value.\n\nIn California – a state with high fruit and nut tree crops – 50% of farmers in the state said they had to remove trees and multiyear crops due to drought, the survey revealed, which will affect future revenue. And 33% of all US farmers said they’ve had to do the same, nearly double the number from last year.\n\nSelling off herds\n\nFarmers in Texas are being forced to sell off their cattle herds earlier than normal due to extreme drought – as water sources dry out and grass burns up. Farmers in the Lone Star state reported the largest reduction in herd size, down 50%, followed by New Mexico and Oregon at 43% and 41% respectively.\n\n“We haven’t had this kind of movement of cows to market in a decade, since 2011, which was our last really big drought,” said David Anderson, a professor of Agricultural Economics at Texas A&M told CNN last month.\n\nAccess to water for livestock has been a key issue for farmers and ranchers this year, with 57% reporting local restrictions on water use, compared to 50% of farmers last year. Key water sources in places like Lake Mead and Lake Powell – which are running below 30% of their full capacity – typically provide water to 5.5 million acres of land in seven western states according to the AFBF.\n\nOn Tuesday, the federal government announced the Colorado River will operate in a Tier 2 shortage condition for the first time starting in January. That means means Arizona, Nevada and Mexico will have to further reduce their water usage from Colorado River.\n\nHigh inflation makes it harder for ranchers to salvage their land. The cost of diesel is falling but is still high, making it significantly more expensive to truck in additional water than in years past. The price of fertilizer for grass and crops and feed for animals also remains expensive.\n\nConsumer impact\n\nUS consumers can expect to spend more on certain food products because of the drought, according to the report.\n\n“For cattle and beef, once the market processes the excess animals sent to slaughter and has a smaller breeding herd to operate off of- [price increases] could be six months to well over a year. For specialty crops it could be immediate upon harvest,” said Daniel Munch, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n\nFruits, nuts, and vegetables overwhelmingly come from states that with high levels of drought. But farmers have been forced to forgo planting or destroy orchards. This will “will likely result in American consumers paying more for these goods and either partially relying on foreign supplies or shrinking the diversity of items they buy at the store,” the report states.\n\nFor example, California grows 80% of the world’s supply of almonds – limiting other places US consumers can buy the popular nut. And shifting where almonds can grow is not easy – as the crop needs a specific climate and soil.\n\n“In general, the outlook for the 2022 crop volume is more pessimistic than a month ago and much more than two months ago,” a July report from The Almond Board of California notes. The key culprits were drought, low water supply, and the removal of orchards.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistic’s August inflation report shows US consumers are spending 9.3% more on fruits and vegetables from a year ago.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the American Farm Bureau Federation.

The schools of the minnow-sized fish once were often the length and breadth of a bus but now, he lamented, its lunar calendar-tied mating and feeding cycles had shifted and the schools were barely as big as a picnic table.\n\nOn Guam, signs of climate change are everywhere: In fishing cycles, rising sea levels, declining reservoirs of drinking water and telltale pieces of dead staghorn coral washing ashore, signaling the slow death of the island’s protective coral barrier that prevents erosion.\n\nThis tiny Western Pacific island is 7,920 miles from Washington but central to U.S. security interests in the region. It is home to two of the nation’s most strategically important military bases — both threatened by climate change.\n\nClimate change has already begun to re-shape the island.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency warned in an August 2016 report that Guam’s air and ocean are warming, the sea level is rising and the ocean is becoming more acidic. Combined, these changes stress and kill the ring of coral that protects against storms and coastal erosion.\n\nFurthermore, Guam is beginning to see a reduction in freshwater during the dry season, increased damage from flooding and typhoons, and an increased average air temperature, which means days when the heat index is dangerously high will become more common and impede military operations.\n\n“If the military is thinking about the security of their bases, they have to think about the security of the land they're inhabiting, the security of the water they use,” said Robert A. Underwood, former president of the University of Guam and the one-time Guam delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nNaval Base Guam boasts two submarine support vessels and four nuclear fast-attack submarines, which have been used to gather intelligence along the Korean Peninsula and in the South China Sea, where China has been building man-made islands to extend its reach.\n\nAndersen Air Force Base, spread across Guam’s northernmost tip, has served as a launching pad for B-52 bomber runs over parts of Asia. Additionally, at least one anti-missile defense system is permanently based at Andersen.\n\nThe U.S.-held territory, with a population of about 167,000 — including about 7,000 naval and Air Force personnel in addition to their families—is where America projects her power westward towards Asia and the South China sea.\n\nThe Trump administration has scrubbed mentions of climate change from governmental sites and documents, declining to formally recognize it as a national security threat. However, a 2012 report by the non-partisan American Security Project found Guam to be one of the five naval bases most threatened by climate change.\n\nGlobal warming — the effect of man-made and natural emissions of heat-trapping gases — threatens not only a way of life on Guam, but freedom for the United States to act unimpeded by restrictions that might be imposed by host countries in the Pacific.\n\nAlthough South Korea and Japan play host to U.S. naval bases, those countries’ own political interests leave the United States facing restrictions on the number of troops stationed there, and even the types of missions it can launch from those bases.\n\nIndeed, over the past several years, the U.S. military has sought to relocate 5,000 Marines and their families from Okinawa to Guam to realign forces in the Pacific region and reduce political tension in Japan. That would nearly double the number of forces stationed on Guam and significantly increase naval water usage.\n\nAs Navy leaders grapple with the effects of climate change here, they must do so throughout the world as well. The Navy faces disastrous effects on its infrastructure and installations, as well as on human populations displaced by severe heat, rising seas and water shortages.\n\nClimate change a worldwide threat\n\nA 2010 report by the Department of Defense showed that more than 30 bases were at risk from rising seas; a 2016 survey by the Union of Concerned Scientists raised that number to 128 in the United States alone. Additional bases face threats from severe storms, warming oceans and the contamination of drinking water.\n\nGuam is hugely important from a logistics standpoint in facilitating the flow of supplies to forces in the Pacific, said Retired Adm. Gary Roughead, a former chief of naval operations who created a Navy task force on the impact of climate change on military operations in the Arctic. However, he said, other Navy sites face even more dire and immediate concerns, such as Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia.\n\nNorfolk, the largest naval installation in the world, is sinking into the ocean after decades of unsustainable groundwater use. Home to 75 ships and 134 aircraft, as well as over 80,000 active duty sailors, Norfolk routinely suffers crippling floods of roads and parking structures.\n\nA 2014 Department of Defense study found one and a half feet of sea level rise to be a “tipping point” for Norfolk; at that point it will suffer significant infrastructure damage and losses in mission performance. Experts predict sea levels will rise a minimum of three feet-three inches within the next 100 years.\n\n“All I know is that the climate and the planet are changing markedly, and we need to do things to get ready for that,” Roughead said, skirting the political contention over the causes of global warming.\n\n“Unfortunately, there’s still debates about climate science and policy,” said Shana Udvardy, climate preparedness specialist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Last December, President Trump put out a national security strategy that wiped clean any mention of climate change. While this may be the case, the Navy understands climate change and they’re working to address it.”\n\nClimate change affects every aspect of naval operations, from where sailors are based to how they are trained to when and where they are deployed.\n\nIndeed, the Navy has shown significant interest in climate change vulnerabilities over the past several decades. It has built multi-story piers, worked with local communities, revamped training syllabi and cut back on construction in flood plains. It even deployed the Great Green Fleet in 2016, a group of ships that runs on a mixture of regular fuel and biofuels, in order to cut down on carbon emissions that contribute to climate change.\n\nBut some scientists say the U.S. military is still too slow to respond to a rapidly changing climate.\n\n“Military planning hasn't adjusted to some of the new studies at this point,” said Marcus King, an associate professor at the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University. King formerly served as a research analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses and as a Pentagon foreign affairs specialist. “They're not really putting the worst-case scenarios into the planning process.”\n\nAn existential threat\n\nClimate change also has amplified threats to U.S. national security, by increasing societal instability and fomenting terrorism in drought-sensitive regions while driving up the number of requests for humanitarian aid and disaster relief, analysts said.\n\nDrought is a long-term threat to Guam, with climate change refugees from surrounding islands spurring that along.\n\nWater contamination led to the closing of several wells in 2017, a small glimpse of a future with an overdrawn aquifer – a lens of freshwater perched atop the seawater beneath the northern half of the island. The Navy and the local government run the risk of triggering island-wide shortages of drinkable water by overdrawing the aquifer.\n\nNavy and local officials have long managed their own water sources and rarely communicate about the areas or depths at which they draw water. But overdrawing water can introduce salt water into the freshwater, said Victoria Keener, a research fellow at the East-West Center in Hawaii who studied Guam’s aquifer with the U.S. Geological Society for a Department of Defense study.\n\nThe island is also beginning to see less rainfall, so the aquifer is being replenished at a slower rate than before, said Keener. She predicts this problem will grow worse over the coming century.\n\nIf mismanagement practices are not quickly corrected, Keener explained, those, in concert with slower replenishment would eventually spell disaster for Guam’s freshwater sources.\n\n“The Department of the Navy is committed to transparent communication and partnership with communities, water authorities, elected officials, and state and federal agencies on water quality on and near our installations,” public affairs officer Lt. Ben Anderson responded, on behalf of the Navy.\n\nThe Kwajalein Atoll, located in the Marshall Islands more than 1,500 miles from Guam and ten feet above sea level, provides a warning of the effect of climate change on military installations. In 2016, long after the Air Force began building a $1 billion radar installation, experts assessed the small coral atoll would be uninhabitable by humans within 25 years from saltwater intrusion in its aquifer and sea level rise.\n\nGuam may face similar problems in decades to come, given the thinning of its aquifer. Drought could eventually force the Navy to either relocate or find alternate ways to hydrate its sailors and civilian contractors.\n\nAlthough the Navy did not allow reporters for Medill News Service and USA Today onto its base in Guam, those familiar with the outpost describe it as well-protected from the elements. It is seated atop cliffs with low-slung, concrete buildings constructed to withstand typhoons. However, an overdrawn aquifer could spell the demise of the island.\n\nAt the same time drought begins to threaten Guam, the dying coral reefs that ring other low-lying islands in the Pacific are giving up the ghost. Soon they will no longer hold back tsunamis, or even strong waves that would eat away at an island’s footprint. Many of those fleeing such climate change will head for Guam, known as the metropolis of the Pacific. The addition of refugees atop growing numbers of tourists and military personnel will further stretch the island’s finite resources.\n\n“Those people have no place to go,” said Underwood. “The demise of the coral reef and sea level rise means they're facing an existential threat.”\n\n“We have a number of those people living within a couple hundred miles of here,” Underwood added. “The potential demographic impact of that on Guam is large.”\n\nWithout a consistent supply of freshwater, it will be difficult to sustain a base on Guam, leaving the Navy without local residents to work on the base, a community to employ their spouses or even educate their children.\n\nThat, in turn, can upset the Navy’s ability to carry out its mission.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/19/climate-change-trigger-widespread-hazards-earth-and-humanity/2059370002/", "title": "Climate change to trigger widespread hazards to Earth and humanity", "text": "Don't say we weren't warned.\n\nFrom human health to the world's food supply, from water scarcity to widespread migration and violence, the threats from climate change are much larger than previously thought, a study released Monday suggests.\n\nAnd in many places, several threats will be happening at once.\n\n“It’s just going to be crazy,\" study lead author Camilo Mora of the University of Hawaii at Manoa told NBC News. \"We cannot imagine what will happen when all these things happen at the same time.\n\n\"We have uncovered a more complete and realistic portrait of how much danger humanity truly faces with ongoing greenhouse gas emissions and the need for immediate action,\" he said.\n\nAmong other phenomena, researchers looked at how climate change will increase heat waves, wildfires, sea level rise, hurricanes, flooding, drought and shortages of clean water.\n\nHumanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal that power our world releases greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide into the Earth's atmosphere. This has caused the planet to warm to levels that cannot be explained by natural causes.\n\nIn addition to the unsettling results of his study, Mora told the Sydney Morning Herald that \"it was also mind-blowing that we just refuse to wake up about how serious this is.\"\n\nTo better understand the threats we face, Mora and his colleagues reviewed more than 3,200 scientific papers and found 467 ways that climate change has affected all aspects of human civilization and the Earth itself.\n\nIn other words, by the end of the century, folks will have to endure not just one or two climate hazards, but potentially three, four or more at the same time.

By that time, Los Angeles will deal with three.\n\nAlthough the scientists discovered few positive or neutral effects, the overwhelming majority of climate impacts are detrimental to humans.\n\n\"If we only consider the most direct threats from climate change, for example heat waves or severe storms, we inevitably will be blindsided by even larger threats that, in combination, can have even broader societal impacts,\" study co-author Jonathan Patz of the University of Wisconsin said.\n\nThe study was published Monday in Nature Climate Change, a peer-reviewed British journal.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/08/23/climate-change-alabama-rising-temperatures-already-transform-environment-state/2033999001/", "title": "Climate and change: Rising temperatures are already transforming ...", "text": "In waters off the Alabama coast, and in the forests blanketing much of the state, warmer winters — and warmer nights — are opening paths for pests and invasive species.\n\nRain patterns have shifted. Long-term forecasts expect a significant rise in the number of 95-degree days in Alabama over the next 50 years, heat that could particularly affect the poor and elderly.\n\nClimate change is starting to transform Alabama.\n\n“The uncertainties have diminished to the point where anybody that denies it is just not paying attention, or they have other motives for denying it,” said George Crozier, a retired director of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab on Dauphin Island.\n\nAnd during the next few decades, climate-related changes in Alabama could accelerate.\n\nUnder current fossil fuel consumption models, the Southeast is expected to warm considerably over the next several decades. The Fourth National Assessment of Climate Change, released by the federal U.S. Global Climate Change Research Program last November, foresees summers where daytime temperatures usually stay at 95 degrees or above, and nighttime lows rarely dip below 75. Days requiring air conditioning are expected to double. Days requiring heating could fall by a third.\n\nThat could have significant impacts on human health, driving up the risks from heat-related illnesses. The National Climate Assessment in 2018 said the Southeast was responsible for nearly 29% of heat-related deaths in the United States between 2000 and 2010. Those warmer days could also put more ozone in the air, contributing to respiratory illnesses. Or allow mosquitoes to live year-round, extending the threat of illnesses. Birmingham is already experiencing heat waves that are longer and more intense than the nation as a whole.\n\nClimate change could also alter state industries, particularly forestry and fishing, as added heat and shifting water supplies alter flora and fauna. Scientists throughout multiple disciplines say the area needs more study to help prepare Alabamians for what’s coming.\n\nBecause one thing is clear: Alabama will be different.\n\nClimate change has been less intensely studied in the Southeast and along the Gulf Coast than other regions in the country. Studies of fish stock in the Gulf, for example, don’t go nearly as far back as similar studies on the West Coast and in the Northeast.\n\n\"In the Chesapeake Bay, there are more studies than in the entire Gulf of Mexico,\" said Dr. Ken Heck, a marine ecologist at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab. \"Money rolls downhill from Washington into Chesapeake Bay. We call this the third coast.\"\n\nAlabama and other portions of the Southeast have also seen average maximum temperatures (daily highs) that are the same or — in the case of summers — slightly cooler compared to the 1930s. Vasubandhu Misra, a professor of meteorology at Florida State University who has studied the “global warming hole,” said in an interview several theories to explain it have been advanced, including shifts in rainfall and reforestation of the Southeast in the 20th century.\n\nBut, Misra said, the cooling in Alabama is in the past. All other indices show temperatures rising.\n\n“The global warming hole is filling up,” Misra said. “There is a warming trend. The cooling trend is reducing over time.”\n\nEven if the days were slightly cooler, the nights in the Southeast have become hotter since the 1960s. Winter and springtime temperatures have also gone up during that time. The period from 2010 to 2017 featured the hottest nights recorded in the Southeast, the National Climate Assessment said.\n\n“During the 2010s, the number of nights with minimum temperatures greater than 75 degrees Fahrenheit was nearly double the long-term average for 1901-1960, while the length of the freeze-free season was nearly 1½ weeks greater than any other period in the historical record,” the report said.\n\nWarmer nights and shorter cold periods have a multitude of effects. In the state's forests, they draw moisture out of trees, affecting growth patterns, and giving pests more time to damage trees. With fewer freezes, aquatic species from more tropical regions are beginning to thrive in the waters off the state. Those species, or their offspring, used to die when the temperature dropped. With Mobile becoming a tropical zone, that’s no longer the case — with, at best, uncertainty for the life that's already there.\n\n“We’ve always had them coming in,” said Heck. “What’s different now is we’re not having the cold winter nights that knocked them out. It’s allowed them to survive.”\n\nMore and frequent storm events are making their mark on the state. One study that tracked 70 climate-related natural disasters that caused $1 billion in damage between 1980 and 2007 found 21 affected Alabama. Increased threats from storm surges will likely stress the transportation system in the Mobile area, particularly the seaport.\n\n“Damage can range from debris removal to complete destruction of certain assets,” a 2012 Federal Highway Administration study of the Mobile area said. “The direct costs of clean up, repair and replacement can be high, and the secondary implications of disrupted transportation networks and supply chains can have widespread impacts on community life, and on the local and regional economy.”\n\nEven without large storms, more rain is falling in Alabama. According to a 2016 report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, rain in Alabama has increased between 5 and 10% since 1950. Stations in north and south Alabama have reported increases in extreme rainfall events — defined as days with 3 or more inches of rain — as high as 40%. When the Mobile Area Water and Sewer System (MAWSS) reached a consent decree with environmental groups in 2001 over violations of the Clean Water Act, the decree came with a specific definition of what a 100-year flood event was, to determine events when MAWSS might not have to pay a penalty.\n\n“When we redid that agreement (in 2017), we made them go back and re-evaluate what a rain event was,” said Casi Callaway, executive director of Mobile Baykeeper, one of the groups involved in the negotiations. “And that has changed dramatically. We’ve had four 100-year flood events in the last six years. When that happens, that’s not a 100-year flood event anymore.” (Messages seeking comment were left with MAWSS.)\n\nAll the rain could impact Mobile Bay, already seeing a potential influx of saltwater from rising ocean levels. Rising sea levels could increase saltwater intrusions into coastal areas, affecting not only wildlife but threatening marshes in the Mobile-Tensaw delta that act as natural filters for water flowing into the bay. Conversely, increased rainfall could lower salinity in Mobile Bay, which could wreak havoc on species such as oysters. Mississippi has already seen a significant loss of oysters this year, thanks to rains in the Midwest that forced freshwater into the bay.\n\nNorth of the bay, shifting precipitation and higher temperatures are likely to impact the state’s agriculture and forest industry. Drier, hotter conditions in the West could shift more agriculture into Alabama and the Southeast from areas no longer able to sustain them. Corn and cotton could thrive. But other crops, like wheat and soybeans, could decline.\n\nAnd even with increased rainfall, the land might struggle to hold onto moisture. Despite increased rainfall, higher temperatures could send more water into the air, reducing water supplies and leading to longer drought periods. Longer periods of warmth and drier soils could radically alter the state's forests. Steve McNulty, director of the USDA’s Southeastern Climate Hub, said an absence of water would force trees over time to spread out, resulting in forests with less canopy cover, and shorter, thicker trees that could force changes to the forest industry in the state.\n\n“It’s not because (trees) don’t want the sunlight,” McNulty said. “It’s because if they’ve got less water, those leaves would take more water.”\n\nEvaporation, combined with population growth and increased need for irrigation by farmers, could cut the water supply in Alabama by as much as 5% over the next four decades. Scott Duncan, an author writing a book on climate change in the Southeast, said in a recent interview that will have consequences not only for agriculture but for energy plants that rely on water resources to cool off their turbines.\n\n“It gets even more acute and worse in the future because we don’t have a plan,” he said. “I would love to see Alabama have a plan and then build into the system resiliency and adaptability.”\n\nSome state agencies are factoring climate change into their plans. The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources' Coastal Comprehensive Plan includes a point to identify \"areas vulnerable to sea level change and coastal storms and characterizes the resilience of the area.\" In a statement, Gov. Kay Ivey pointed to those factors as \"tools in the toolbox to be prepared for anything that might come in our future.\"\n\n\"We must always be good stewards of the Earth,\" the statement said. \"In Alabama, we are very fortunate to be blessed with an abundance of natural resources — from our timber to our Gulf waters. It is our duty to take care of our resources, and we are certainly always working to do that.\"\n\nGenerally, though, state leaders have been at best uneasy about climate change and at worst openly hostile to the idea that it's happening. The state does not have a comprehensive climate change plan, and officials have rarely addressed the topic. The then-Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2009 passed a resolution encouraging action on climate change, though the resolution was more focused on protecting existing jobs and industry than attacking consequences of climate change for the state. This attitude shifted after the Republican-controlled Legislature in 2011 passed a resolution calling on Congress — \"by any means necessary\" — to prohibit the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gases.\n\nRepublicans in the U.S. Senate race have taken different approaches. Though critical of the Green New Deal proposed by House Democrats, U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne, R-Mobile, said last February he wanted to see a \"moonshot\" of technology investment to address climate change. On the other end, Republican candidate John Merrill, the Alabama secretary of state, appeared to shrug off the issue at his campaign kickoff in June.\n\n“Climate change and weather changes and atmospheric changes have been happening since the Lord created this world,” Merrill said.\n\nOne reason scientists across multiple disciplines seek better studies of climate change in the Southeast is to help the region plan for those changes. Because the changes are coming.\n\n“I think that what’s kind of scary is that what was an unreasonable radical extreme 10 years ago is no longer an extreme,” Crozier said. “The extremes have ratcheted up 10, 50, 100%.”\n\nNext in the series: How warming temperatures could alter Alabama's forests.\n\nCLIMATE AND CHANGE\n\nPart 2:How a hotter world could transform Alabama's forests", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/02/asia/pakistan-floods-climate-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Pakistan floods: What you need to know | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nMore than one third of Pakistan is underwater, according to satellite images from the European Space Agency (ESA), as deadly floodwaters threaten to create secondary disasters.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See volunteers use bedframe to rescue people from deadly floods 01:19 - Source: CNN\n\nFood is in short supply after water covered millions of acres of crops and wiped out hundreds of thousands of livestock.

As of this point in his presidency, Biden has spent more than a quarter of his time working from his home state of Delaware, either at his house in Wilmington or his Rehoboth Beach property.\n\nSome 21 months into his term, Biden has made 55 visits to Delaware, totaling some or all of 174 days as of Sunday, according to a CNN analysis of presidential schedules and a tally kept by Mark Knoller, the longtime unofficial statistician of the White House press corps. In addition, Biden has made 19 visits, or all or part of 64 days, to the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland.\n\nHe has now surpassed even the getaway time of former President Donald Trump, so often criticized by Democrats for his regular departures from the White House to stay at one of his personal homes. At this point in his tenure, Trump had spent about 135 days at either his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, or his home at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump also had spent 23 days at Camp David.\n\n“President Biden is deeply proud of his roots and his family and it has been a staple of his time in public life to never lose touch with either,” White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said to CNN. “Presidents of the United States are constantly on the job, regardless of their location – whether they’re on a state visit overseas or just 100 miles from the White House for a short trip to Wilmington, DE. And as all Americans can agree, it’s important for leaders to avoid becoming ensconced in Washington, DC.”\n\nThe comforts of home can be a salve for the commander in chief while carrying out one of the world’s most demanding jobs. The American president is never truly “off,” and – in fact – Biden, like all presidents, has a whole remote White House apparatus that travels with him to facilitate that round-the-clock enterprise, with the most state-of-the-art capabilities, resources and technology traveling with him wherever he goes.\n\nSome argue that Biden can now lean into the normalcy of working from home, which millions of Americans had to rely on when Covid-19 forced isolation from offices and public spaces. “WFH” is not just a shorthand for being productive at the home office, it’s become a professional way of life for many.\n\n“It is 2022, not 1922. If the rest of the country can work from home, so can the president of the United States,” said Michael LaRosa, a director at a DC-based public affairs firm and former press secretary to first lady Dr. Jill Biden.\n\n“He spent (practically) every weekend in Delaware during his 36 years in the Senate, and his eight years as vice president,” LaRosa said. “This is nothing new. The Bidens have never lived in Washington, DC.” When he was a senator, Biden commuted back to Delaware almost every night by train – earning the nickname “Amtrak Joe” – and the train station in Wilmington is named for him.\n\nThe physical presence of a president is, however, meaningful for some, at least in ritual.\n\nThe statistics – 236 days away from the White House in Delaware and Maryland in less than two years on the job – are significant for the modern presidency. The job has been set in the nation’s capital near the Congress and the Supreme Court, in part for its symbolic power, for more than 220 years. Being in that power center brings a higher level of transparency thanks to the proximity to the national media, along with White House rules about press access and public records about who comes and goes.\n\nWhenever the president is actually in the Oval Office, for example, that presence is honored by the solemn watch of a stone-faced US Marine posted outside the West Wing.\n\n“A special challenge that Biden faces, because of his age, is that people will assume the worst if he’s not always visible. That is something that comes with being the oldest president in office,” said Tim Naftali, a CNN presidential historian, who notes presidents have had a “moveable Oval Office” for decades. “Perception is important in American politics.”\n\nThe optics of WFH or WFWH\n\nA president of the United States who doesn’t consider the White House his primary home does not go unnoticed by the media, or critics. But the executive mansion’s primary residents have generally found it stifling.\n\n“I always say I don’t know whether it’s the finest public housing in America or the crown jewel of the prison system,” former President Bill Clinton famously mused during a 1993 interview.\n\nKnoller, who during his 32-year career with CBS News covered the personal habits of six presidents, concurs.\n\n“It may look luxurious, but it can be suffocating to live and work there day in and out,” Knoller said.\n\nTrump’s trips to Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster were fodder for op-eds and lent themselves to critics painting a portrait of a president unwilling to give up the trappings of a luxe off-duty lifestyle. And though many days were spent on the golf course – 125 or so at this point in Trump’s presidency, compared to Biden’s 19 on the links – Trump was still the leader of the free world. Biden’s former boss, Barack Obama, traveled home much less frequently while in office but was frequently dinged – by Trump, among others – for the amount of golf he played.\n\n“(Ronald) Reagan and (George W.) Bush both spent lots of time at their private ranch homes,” said Knoller of two other former presidents who escaped the White House with regularity.\n\nKnoller tabulated time away for presidents, he says, because the numbers “added color to my reporting and gave insight to the president’s needs and activities.”\n\nAccording to Knoller’s count, George W. Bush spent all or part of 490 days – more than a year – at his Texas ranch during his eight years in office. Reagan spent nearly a year, all or part of 349 days, at his California ranch during his two terms. If Biden were reelected and kept up his current pace of trips to Delaware until the end of a second term in office, he would far surpass both Reagan and Bush in time away from the White House.\n\nHowever, post-pandemic culture has blurred the boundaries of what defines a workplace.\n\n“Our concept of being ‘on the job’ has shifted, and that may actually change the way we think about where our president needs to be,” Naftali said.\n\nSome of Biden’s biggest political wins came this summer, after all, when he was isolating in the residence of the White House after testing positive for Covid-19. Photos showed him tie-less, often working in the second-floor Treaty Room or reading papers with his feet up on the Truman balcony, Commander by his side.\n\nIt was a view into what Biden’s work from home life may be like when he’s in Wilmington or Rehoboth.\n\n“It’s a bit antiquated to think that because he is not physically in the White House on the weekends, that he is not working,” LaRosa said. “He never stops being President and he never stops working. Just ask the first lady.”\n\nA weekly ritual\n\nBiden has the advantage of a more normalized routine in his trips away from Washington.\n\nThe White House residence staff has by now perfected the choreography of managing, packing and planning the departure of the President and first lady most Fridays, the day, statistically, the Bidens normally split town.\n\nThe ushers know which bags are to be brought downstairs – it’s a light-pack, most of the couples’ needed belongings are already in their Delaware homes, a person familiar tells CNN. While Biden occasionally plays golf at a local course when in Wilmington, his other activities – seeing his grandchildren, taking casual social visits, going to church – don’t require multiple outfit changes.\n\nIn Rehoboth, he rides his bike and he and the first lady like to set up a big, blue umbrella on the sandy beach in front of their house and sunbathe or read in reclining chairs. Outside of swimsuits, joggers and polo shirts, it’s not a multiple-suitcase situation.\n\n“The biggest issue is usually the pets,” said the person familiar with the weekend planning for a presidential getaway to Delaware.\n\nCommander, now one year old and no longer a small puppy, and Willow, the barn cat adopted by Jill Biden, are “almost always” on the Delaware visits. While many American families leave their pets at home with caretakers for the weekend, or book them at pet-sitting facilities, the Bidens take theirs with them.\n\nThey like to be around their pets at all times – when Joe Biden was isolating at the White House with Covid-19 this summer, he was kept company by Commander; likewise, when Jill Biden had her bout with Covid, she spent the her rebound case isolation period in Rehoboth, with Willow.\n\nThe animals frequently travel to Delaware via van, with support staff, but occasionally they are in vehicles solely dedicated to their transportation, says the person. Willow, in particular, is not a fan of noisy, whirring helicopter blades, said another person familiar with the feline’s habits. In June, there was a rare sighting by White House press members of Willow in her crate, being carried by a residence staffer to Marine One for a weekend at Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThe Biden’s Delaware visits, of course, no matter how quick, have a significant footprint beyond those of the paws of their pets.\n\nSecret Service coordinates with law enforcement on all movements – several highway exits must close for the presidential motorcade, locals in both Wilmington and Rehoboth must at times wait on traffic patterns or be swept by agents with handheld magnetometers just to walk down the beach if one of the Bidens is there, as one neighbor of the Bidens in Rehoboth Beach told CNN.\n\nThe large presidential apparatus helps ensure that the President is able to perform his duties with the full input of his advisers, even if they’re not with him in person.\n\n“Unless we discover his being away from Washington results in him bobbling the ball as JFK did on the eve of the Bay of Pigs operation, there shouldn’t be an issue,” says Naftali, referring to Kennedy’s canceling of an air strike on a Sunday, without full consultation and full consideration, a move the former President later regretted.\n\n“But if Biden is in touch virtually and telephonically, in this era, leadership doesn’t have to involve always being physically present in Washington, D.C.”", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/politics/joe-biden-covid-cabin-fever/index.html", "title": "A stir crazy Joe Biden fought Covid cabin fever with help from his ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen President Joe Biden tested positive for Covid last week, the dog stayed with him. The cat went with his wife.\n\nBiden’s long-anticipated, heavily-planned-for, how-has-it-not-happened-yet Covid infection turned the White House residence briefly into a sick ward for a single, high-profile patient who aides said spent the weekend going stir crazy from the isolation.\n\nHis wife decamped for Delaware, bringing with her their new shorthair tabby. Staffing inside the executive mansion was reduced to the most essential personnel, whom Biden fretted might contract the highly transmissible variant of the coronavirus that likely infected him.\n\nAnd even the cart of video equipment wheeled into the second-floor Treaty Room, phone calls from his grandkids and a stack of books about Ireland couldn’t prevent the cabin fever from setting in.\n\n“I’m only a couple hundred yards away,” Biden told visitors from South Korea on Tuesday, who listened to him speaking on a screen in the Roosevelt Room. “I could look out from the balcony and holler to you!”\n\nWhen the meeting concluded, he took off his jacket and stepped onto the Truman Balcony to do just that.\n\nBy Tuesday, Biden was feeling well enough to resume working out in the White House gym – a daily routine he’d foregone during his convalescence. Instead of waking up to exercise, his German Shepherd, Commander, served as his alarm clock on Monday when – in the first lady’s absence – he nudged the commander-in-chief awake just before 7 a.m.\n\n“My wife’s not here,” Biden explained a few hours later. “She usually takes him out in the morning while I’m upstairs working out.”\n\nBy Wednesday, Biden had tested negative on two antigen tests and was allowed to break out of his isolation, though he’ll have to wear a mask for 10 days. His first stop: The White House Rose Garden to speak about his experience with the disease.\n\nLong viewed as something of an inevitability, Biden’s bout with Covid has nonetheless marked a turning point. Some on Biden’s team expressed quiet relief that what nearly everyone expected would come to pass finally did – without, for now, any major health complications.\n\nFor a White House whose operations were designed – from its earliest days – to prevent the septuagenarian commander-in-chief from getting sick, Biden’s aides saw the illness as a sign that even the most protected person can come down with Covid and be just fine.\n\nEarly in his tenure, Biden’s meetings were held with the smallest groups of officials possible, all of whom wore color-coordinated wristbands to indicate they’d been tested for coronavirus that day. Masks were required everywhere on the White House grounds in the first months of Biden’s administration. Travel outside Washington was rare.\n\nSo restricted was the President’s inner circle that when a long string of Washington officials – including the vice president, secretary of state, attorney general, House speaker and several senior-level Biden aides, including the press secretary and national security adviser – tested positive, none were determined to have been in “close contact” with Biden.\n\nConcerns about the President contracting Covid were partly rooted in his age; at 79, he is at higher risk for severe disease. But some Democrats also wondered how getting sick might affect Biden’s political standing, given the increasingly frequent questions about whether he will be too old to serve a second term.\n\nYet life in the bubble did not suit Biden, who chafed at the limitations placed on a job he’d been seeking for the previous four decades. Trappings like state dinners and medal ceremonies were put on hold. And perhaps most galling for the famously tactile President, visitors were rare.\n\nThe restrictions began to ease as vaccinations became available and the virus started to wane. Even episodes of variant-propelled resurgence did not prevent Biden from beginning to live more loosely.\n\nThe day before he tested positive, Biden flew back and forth to Massachusetts for a speech on climate change. Photos from aboard Air Force One showed he wasn’t wearing a mask as he engaged with lawmakers who were invited on the trip.\n\nHe shook hands before and after the event, though didn’t linger for long given the blistering sun and high temperatures. But that was an exception; as he begins to travel more across the country, Biden has spent as much as 45 minutes greeting audiences with handshakes and hugs after his speeches.\n\nBy the time he’d returned to the White House Wednesday evening, however, he began to feel fatigued. One restless night and two tests later, Biden became the second sitting US president to test positive for Covid.\n\nHis symptoms – runny nose, sore throat, elevated temperature, body aches – were all deemed mild, which the White House attributed to his four doses of vaccine. But the rules were still the rules, and Biden entered the required period of isolation as his team began executing a plan they’d had in place for months, beginning with a swift public announcement.\n\nMany White House staffers only learned from that disclosure the President had Covid.\n\n“We have said for some time that there was a substantial possibility that the President – like anyone else – could get Covid, and we have prepared for this possibility. We are now executing on our plan so that the President can continue to work seamlessly from the residence,” chief of staff Ron Klain wrote in a memo to staff a few hours after the initial statement.\n\nFacing reporters this week, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was joined by the White House Covid response coordinator, Dr. Ashish Jha, instead of the doctor who actually tended to Biden. Jha, who had not examined the President, had FaceTimed with him throughout the course of his illness and received updates from the presidential physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor.\n\nReporters protested not being allowed to directly question O’Connor. Jha said neither Biden nor O’Connor had explicitly decided against having O’Connor deliver the briefings himself.\n\nO’Connor, a retired Army colonel who has treated Biden for several years, is not a seasoned presence on television or during public question-and-answer sessions, one official said. He has a loose, joking manner with Biden and other top officials – sometimes using humor to cut through serious moments, including when Biden’s son Beau was diagnosed with cancer – but doesn’t normally engage with the press.\n\nHowever, Jha regularly appeared as a medical commentator on Covid before joining the White House earlier this year.\n\nDuring former President Donald Trump’s bout with Covid in 2020, then-White House physician Dr. Sean Conley briefed reporters from the steps of Walter Reed National Medical Center, where Trump was hospitalized.\n\nConley, it was later learned, obscured the severity of Trump’s disease during his briefings. Only when the former chief of staff Mark Meadows published his White House memoir did it emerge Trump’s oxygen level fell to about 86% – dangerously below the normal level.\n\nO’Connor, in daily written updates distributed by the White House press office, has not disclosed Biden’s oxygenation rate beyond saying his “oxygen saturation continues to be excellent on room air.” He has also described Biden’s pulse, blood pressure and respiratory rates as “normal” without disclosing any numbers.\n\nWhite House officials said those vital signs were being recorded throughout the course of the day, and that they never diverged from normal levels. And they argued that because the President’s symptoms were mild, their level of transparency was appropriate.\n\n“We have provided, I think, an extraordinary amount of transparency about his care: When he tested positive; how he’s done each day; the evolving nature of his symptoms: is his runny nose a little worse, a little bit better?” Jha told reporters Monday. “Like, we’ve been very, very open and transparent with all of that data.”\n\nThe White House was forced to cancel a string of events out of town, including a political rally in Tampa, Florida, that had been viewed as a debut of sorts for the President’s upcoming midterm message.\n\nA speech to a group of Black law enforcement executives that Biden had planned to deliver in-person in Orlando went virtual instead. He used the address to accuse his predecessor of cowardice during the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, a declaration that aides once hoped he would deliver to a crowded and supportive audience.\n\nInstead, Biden taped the speech from the Treaty Room, where he’d spent much of his days in isolation. The video released by the White House on Monday was edited in several places as Biden continued to shake his cough.\n\nBy Tuesday, however, Biden’s voice had mostly lost its rasp.\n\n“I hope I look as great as I feel,” Biden told a group over video conference. “I never look that good. I hope I look as good as I usually do, which is not that good.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/05/politics/fact-check-biden-midterms-2022/index.html", "title": "Fact check: Biden's midterms message includes false and ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been back on the campaign trail, traveling in October and early November to deliver his pitch for electing Democrats in the midterm elections on Tuesday.\n\nBiden’s pitch has included claims that are false, misleading or lacking important context. (As always, we take no position on the accuracy of his subjective arguments.) Here is a fact-check look at nine of his recent statements.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment for this article.\n\nSocial Security, part 1\n\nBiden said at a Democratic fundraiser in Pennsylvania last week: “On our watch, for the first time in 10 years, seniors are going to get the biggest increase in their Social Security checks they’ve gotten.” He has also touted the 2023 increase in Social Security payments at other recent events.\n\nBut Biden’s boasts leave out such critical context that they are highly misleading. He hasn’t explained that the increase in Social Security payments for 2023, 8.7%, is unusually big simply because the inflation rate has been unusually big. A law passed in the 1970s says that Social Security payments must be increased by the same percentage that a certain measure of inflation has increased. It’s called a cost-of-living adjustment.\n\nThe White House deleted a Tuesday tweet that delivered an especially triumphant version of Biden’s boast, and press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre acknowledged Wednesday that the tweet was lacking “context.” You can read a more detailed fact check here.\n\nSocial Security, part 2\n\nBiden said at a Democratic rally in Florida on Tuesday: “And on my watch, for the first time in 10 years, seniors are getting an increase in their Social Security checks.”\n\nThe claim that the 2023 increase to Social Security payments is the first in 10 years is false. In reality, there has been a cost-of-living increase every year from 2017 onward. There was also an increase every year from 2012 through 2015 before the payment level was kept flat in 2016 because of a lack of inflation.\n\nThe context around this Biden remark in Florida suggests he might have botched his repeat campaign line about Social Security payments increasing at the same time as Medicare premiums are declining. Regardless of his intentions, though, he was wrong.\n\nA new corporate tax\n\nBiden repeatedly suggested in speeches in October and early November that a new law he signed in August, the Inflation Reduction Act, will stop the practice of successful corporations paying no federal corporate income tax. Biden made the claim explicitly in a tweet last week: “Let me give you the facts. In 2020, 55 corporations made $40 billion. And they paid zero in federal taxes. My Inflation Reduction Act puts an end to this.”\n\nBut “puts an end to this” is an exaggeration. The Inflation Reduction Act will reduce the number of companies on the list of non-payers, but the law will not eliminate the list entirely.\n\nThat’s because the law’s new 15% alternative corporate minimum tax, on the “book income” companies report to investors, only applies to companies with at least $1 billion in average annual income. (There are lots of nuances; you can read more specifics here.) According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, the think tank that in 2021 published the list of 55 large and profitable companies that avoided paying any federal income tax in their previous fiscal year, only 14 of these 55 companies reported having US pre-tax income of at least $1 billion in that year.\n\nIn other words, there will clearly still be some large and profitable corporations paying no federal income tax even after the minimum tax takes effect in 2023. The exact number is not yet known.\n\nMatthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said in a Thursday email that the new tax is “an important step forward from the status quo” and that it will raise substantial revenue, but he also said: “I wouldn’t want to assert that the minimum tax will end the phenomenon of zero-tax profitable corporations. A more accurate phrasing would be to say that the minimum tax will *help* ensure that *the most profitable* corporations pay at least some federal income tax.”\n\nThe debt and the deficit\n\nBiden said at the Tuesday rally in Florida: “Look, you know, you can hear it from Republicans, ‘My God, that big-spending Democrat Biden. Man, he’s taken us in debt.’ Well, guess what? I reduced the federal deficit this year by $1 trillion $400 billion. One trillion 400 billion dollars. The most in all American history. No one has ever reduced the debt that much. We cut the federal debt in half.”\n\nBiden offered a similar narrative at a Thursday rally in New Mexico, this time saying, “We cut the federal debt in half. A fact.”\n\nThere are two significant problems here.\n\nFirst: Biden conflated the debt and the deficit, which are two different things. It’s not true that Biden has “cut the federal debt in half”; the federal debt (total borrowing plus interest owed) has continued to rise under Biden, exceeding $31 trillion for the first time this October. Rather, it’s the federal deficit – the annual difference between spending and revenue – that was cut in half between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022.\n\nSecond, it’s highly questionable how much credit Biden deserves for even the reduction in the deficit. Biden doesn’t mention that the primary reason the deficit plummeted in fiscal years 2021 and 2022 was that it had skyrocketed to a record high in 2020 because of emergency pandemic relief spending. It then fell as expected as the spending expired as planned.\n\nDan White, senior director of economic research at Moody’s Analytics – an economics firm whose assessments Biden has repeatedly cited during his presidency – told CNN’s Matt Egan in October: “On net, the policies of the administration have increased the deficit, not reduced it.” The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group, says the administration’s own actions have significantly worsened the deficit picture. (David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, told Egan that the Biden administration does deserve credit for the economic recovery that has boosted tax revenues.)\n\nThe unemployment rate\n\nBiden said at the Florida rally on Tuesday: “Unemployment is down from 6.5 to 3.5%, the lowest in 50 years.” He said at the New Mexico rally on Thursday: “Unemployment rate is 3.5% – the lowest it’s been in 50 years.”\n\nBut Biden didn’t acknowledge that September’s 3.5% unemployment rate was actually a tie for the lowest in 50 years – a tie, specifically, with three months of Trump’s administration, in late 2019 and early 2020. Since Biden uses these campaign speeches to favorably compare his own record to Trump’s record, that omission is significant.\n\nThe unemployment rate rose to 3.7% in October; that number was revealed on Friday, after these Biden comments. The rate was 6.4% in January 2021, the month Biden took office.\n\nBiden’s student debt policy\n\nDuring an on-camera discussion conducted by progressive organization NowThis News and published online in late October, Biden told young activists that they “probably are aware, I just signed a law” on student debt forgiveness that is being challenged by Republicans. He added: “It’s passed. I got it passed by a vote or two, and it’s in effect.”\n\nBiden’s claims are false.\n\nHe created his student debt forgiveness initiative through executive action, not through legislation, so he didn’t sign a law and didn’t get it passed by any margin. Since Republicans opposed to the initiative, including those challenging the initiative in court, have called it unlawful precisely because it wasn’t passed by Congress, the distinction between a law and an executive action is a highly pertinent fact here.\n\nA White House official told CNN that Biden was referring to the Inflation Reduction Act, the law narrowly passed by the Senate in August; the official said the Inflation Reduction Act created “room for other crucial programs” by bringing down the deficit. But Biden certainly did not make it clear that he was talking about anything other than the student debt initiative.\n\nGas prices\n\nBiden correctly noted on various occasions in October that gas prices have declined substantially since their June 2022 peak – though, as always, it’s important to note that presidents have a limited impact on gas prices. But in an economic speech in New York last week, Biden said, “Today, the most common price of gas in America is $3.39 – down from over $5 when I took office.”\n\nBiden’s claim that the most common gas price when he took office was more than $5 is not even close to accurate. The most common price for a gallon of regular gas on the day he was inaugurated, January 20, 2021, was $2.39, according to data provided to CNN by Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. In other words, Biden made it sound like gas prices had fallen significantly during his presidency when they had actually increased significantly.\n\nIn other recent remarks, Biden has discussed the state of gas prices in relation to the summer peak of more than $5 per gallon, not in relation to when he took office. Regardless, the comment last week was the second this fall in which Biden inaccurately described the price of gas – both times in a way that made it sound more impressive.\n\nYou can read a longer fact check here.\n\nBiden and Xi\n\nBiden has revived a claim that was debunked more than 20 months ago by The Washington Post and then CNN. At least twice in October, he boasted that he traveled 17,000 miles with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\n“I’ve spent more time with Xi Jinping of China than any world leader has, when I was Vice President all the way through to now. Over 78 hours with him alone. Eight – nine of those hours on the phone and the others in person, traveling 17,000 miles with him around the world, in China and the United States,” he told a Democratic gathering in Oregon in mid-October.\n\nBiden made the number even bigger during a speech on student debt in New Mexico on Thursday, saying, “I traveled 17-, 18,000 miles with him.”\n\nThe claim is false. Biden has not traveled anywhere close to 17,000 miles with Xi, though they have indeed spent lots of time together. Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler noted in 2021 that the two men often did not even travel parallel routes to their gatherings, let alone physically travel together. The only apparent way to get Biden’s mileage past 17,000, Kessler found, is to add the length of his flight journeys between Washington and Beijing, during which, obviously, Xi was not with him.\n\nA White House official told CNN in early 2021 that Biden was adding up his “total travel back and forth” for meetings with Xi. But that is very different than traveling “with” Xi as Biden keeps saying, especially in the context of a boast about how well he knows Xi – and Biden has had more than enough time to make his language more precise.\n\nThe Trump tax cuts\n\nBiden claimed at the Thursday rally in New Mexico that under Trump, Republicans passed a $2 trillion tax cut that “affected only the top 1% of the American public.”\n\nBiden correctly said in various October remarks that the Trump tax cut law was particularly beneficial to the wealthy, but he went too far here. It’s not true that the Trump policy “only” affected the top 1%.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center think tank found in early 2018 that Trump’s law “will reduce individual income taxes on average for all income groups and in all states.” The think tank estimated that “between 60 and 76 percent of taxpayers in every state will receive a tax cut.” And in April 2019, tax-preparation company H&R Block said two-thirds of its returning customers had indeed paid less in tax that year than they did the year prior, The New York Times reported in an article headlined “Face It: You (Probably) Got a Tax Cut.”\n\nThe Tax Policy Center did find in early 2018 that people at the top would get by far the biggest benefits from Trump’s law. Specifically, the think tank found that the top 1% of earners would get an average 3.4% increase in after-tax 2018 income – versus an average 1.6% income increase for people in the middle quintile, an average 1.2% income increase for people in the quintile below that and just an average 0.4% income increase for people in the lowest quintile. The think tank also found that the top 1% of earners would get more than 20% of the income benefits from the law, a bigger share than the bottom 60% of earners combined.\n\nThe distribution could get even more skewed after 2025, when the law’s individual tax cuts will expire if not extended by Congress and the president. If there is no extension – and, therefore, the law’s permanent corporate tax cut remains in place without the individual tax cuts – the Tax Policy Center has estimated that, in 2027, the top 1% will get 83% of the benefits from the law.\n\nBut that’s a possibility about the future. Biden claimed, in the past tense, that the law “affected” only the top 1%. That’s inaccurate.\n\nThis wasn’t the first time Biden overstated his point about the Trump tax cuts. The Washington Post fact-checked him in 2019, for example, when he claimed “all of it” went to the ultra-rich and corporations.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/politics/house-republicans-white-house-hunter-biden/index.html", "title": "House Republicans vow to investigate Biden and his family's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter clinching the majority in the House of Representatives in the midterm elections, top Republicans on Thursday outlined a broad range of investigative targets focused on President Joe Biden and his family’s business dealings.\n\n“In the 118th Congress, this committee will evaluate the status of Joe Biden’s relationship with his family’s foreign partners and whether he is a President who is compromised or swayed by foreign dollars and influence,” said Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee. “I want to be clear: This is an investigation of Joe Biden, and that’s where the committee will focus in this next Congress.”\n\nIn a wide-ranging news conference flanked by GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, who is expected to become chair of the House Judiciary Committee, and other Republicans on the oversight committee, Comer said Republicans have made connections between the president’s son, Hunter Biden, and the president that they believe requires further investigation. Comer said his team has spoken with multiple whistleblowers who say they were involved in schemes involving the Biden family, reviewed Hunter Biden’s laptop, and received “previously unknown transactions.”\n\nComer is specifically zeroing in on more than 100 bank activity reports – known as Suspicious Activity Reports – that are allegedly related to the Biden family and says that the Treasury Department has ignored his repeated requests when Republicans were in the minority to hand over them over.\n\nSo far, Comer says he has only seen two of those reports, and he renewed his request for the remainder of them today. Such reports are not always indicative of criminal activity or wrongdoing.\n\nAs part of his investigation, Comer said, “We would love to talk to people in the Biden family, specifically Hunter and Joe Biden.”\n\nThe White House said the investigations are politically motivated and a waste of time.\n\n“Instead of working with President Biden to address issues important to the American people, like lower costs, congressional Republicans’ top priority is to go after President Biden with politically motivated attacks chock full of long-debunked conspiracy theories” spokesmen for the White House Counsel’s office, Ian Sams, said in a statement to CNN.\n\n“President Biden is not going to let these political attacks distract him from focusing on Americans’ priorities, and we hope congressional Republicans will join us in tackling them instead of wasting time and resources on political revenge,” Sams added.\n\nA spokeswoman for Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, Nelly Decker, said the Republicans “rehashed the same, partisan talking points” that have been circulating for years.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback President Biden on his son Hunter: 'I have great confidence in my son. I love him' 01:17 - Source: CNN\n\n“Now that former President Trump is running for office again, House Republicans’ top priority is attacking President Biden and his family in a desperate attempt to return Mr. Trump to power,” Decker said in a statement.\n\nRepublicans had little ability to enforce their document requests while they were in the minority. But once the new Congress is sworn in in January, Republicans will gain subpoena power, a more powerful enforcement mechanism to try to compel individuals and government entities to hand over information.\n\nPrivate attorneys representing Biden family members did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nZeroing in on suspicious activity reports\n\nAt the heart of Comer’s investigation is digging into a series of suspicious activity reports that Republicans claim banks have filed related to Hunter Biden’s financial activities. In a letter to the Treasury Department on Thursday, Comer sought any such reports related to various members of the Biden family, their business associates and companies linked to Hunter Biden.\n\nComer also is seeking communications within the Treasury Department, its financial crimes enforcement division and the White House regarding those family members and related businesses and associates.\n\nWhile Republicans have seized on the suspicious activity reports as evidence that Joe Biden’s son was involved in problematic activities, such reports are not conclusive and do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing. Financial institutions file millions of suspicious activity reports each year and few lead to law enforcement inquiries.\n\nComer sent a letter to a financial adviser, who Comer has said was managing Hunter Biden’s finances, seeking any suspicious activity reports, as well as financial information about Hunter Biden. He is also seeking information from one of Hunter Biden’s former business partners, including communications related to Hunter Biden and Joe Biden’s finances, taxes and debts.\n\nThe letters were part of a new round Comer fired off to various government agencies and individuals Thursday seeking more information to further his probe.\n\nHe also asked the National Archives for flight manifests and other documents related to Air Force Two and Marine Two during Biden’s tenure as vice president, as well as communications related to Russia, Ukraine and Hunter Biden during his vice presidency.\n\nFrom the FBI, he’s seeking any documents related to “foreign intelligence services’ efforts to compromise the Biden family” and information about Timothy Thibault, a former FBI agent that Republicans have accused of politicizing investigations. Thibault has denied wrongdoing.\n\nAnother letter went to Georges Bergés, the gallery owner who showcased and sold Hunter Biden’s artwork. Among the documents requested were communications with the White House and Hunter Biden, discussions about the pricing of Hunter Biden’s work, and rosters of those who attended Hunter Biden’s art shows and purchased his work.\n\nAlleged ‘politicization’ at the FBI\n\nFederal prosecutors have been investigating Hunter Biden since 2018 and have not brought any charges yet. When asked by CNN if they know whether the claims presented Thursday have already been investigated by federal prosecutors, Jordan said: “We don’t know.”\n\nJordan also said that under his leadership, the House Judiciary Committee will look into alleged “politicization” at the FBI. Jordan and other Republican lawmakers previously claimed that they’ve heard from FBI insiders about anti-conservative bias fueling FBI decision-making, especially at the FBI’s Washington Field Office.\n\n“I’ve been in Congress a few years now, and I’ve never seen anything like it,” Jordan said. “Fourteen (FBI) agents come talk to us while we’re in the minority about how political that place has become.”\n\nAccording to Jordan, the alleged politicization might include attempts by the FBI to suppress media coverage of the Hunter Biden story in 2020.\n\nMany of these claims have been circulating in GOP circles during Biden’s administration – with Republicans taking over the House next year, they’ll have an official platform to investigate these matters and put them on full display.\n\nAt least one of the FBI agents that the GOP lawmakers are scrutinizing has previously denied any wrongdoing. The “whistleblowers” are anonymous and haven’t testified at any public Congressional hearings.\n\n“The FBI has testified to Congress and responded to letters from legislators on numerous occasions to provide an accurate accounting of how we do our work” an FBI spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.\n\n“The men and women of the FBI devote themselves to protecting the American people from terrorism, violent crime, cyber threats and other dangers,” the spokesperson said. “Put quite simply: we follow the facts without regard for politics.”", "authors": ["Annie Grayer Sara Murray Marshall Cohen", "Annie Grayer", "Sara Murray", "Marshall Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/politics/biden-griner-whelan-decision/index.html", "title": "Brittney Griner: Inside Biden's agonizing decision to take a deal that ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden had already personally informed Cherelle Griner that her wife was being released from Russian detention when aides arrived with more news: Brittney Griner was now securely out of Russia – and on the telephone.\n\n“It’s Joe Biden,” the president said when the call was patched through. “Welcome, welcome home!”\n\nNearly ten months after Brittney Griner was arrested at a Moscow airport, the jubilant moment in the Oval Office on Thursday amounted to the culmination of prolonged, frustrating negotiations and one painful decision that left another detained American disappointed and wondering what his fate may be.\n\nIn conversations across an array of government channels, Russian officials were clear with their American counterparts: they would release Griner – and only Griner – in exchange for a convicted Russian arms dealer nicknamed the “merchant of death.”\n\nBecause of the matter’s exceedingly high profile, it was certain those conditions had been set by Russian President Vladimir Putin himself, one US official said.\n\nDespite Biden’s attempts to link Griner’s case to that of Paul Whelan, a former US Marine arrested on espionage charges in 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison two years later, it became plain recently that Putin would not budge.\n\n“The choice was bringing Brittney Griner home right now, or bringing no one home right now,” one senior administration official said.\n\nWith winter approaching at the penal colony where Griner was being held, Biden faced a singularly presidential decision. Welcoming Griner home would fulfill a promise and end the nightmare endured by her and her family.\n\nBut any victory would be tempered by the inability to secure Whelan’s freedom and inevitable blowback over the release of one the most prolific arms dealers of the past decades.\n\nThe situation was complicated further when senior law enforcement officials, angry at the prospect of releasing a notorious figure it had taken years to capture and alarmed by the precedent Bout’s release would set, raised strong objections.\n\nBiden took the deal.\n\n“Brittney will soon be back in the arms of her loved ones and – and she should have been there all along,” the president said from the Roosevelt Room, where he was joined by Griner’s wife. “This is a day we’ve worked toward for a long time.”\n\nMoments earlier in Abu Dhabi, Griner had stepped from her transport plane into the Middle East air – fifty degrees warmer than Moscow – and smiled, a US official said.\n\nDeal comes together\n\nBy the start of this week, US officials had grown confident a resolution to Griner’s case was not only possible, but probable. Biden gave final approval to the parameters of the deal and set in motion the prisoner swap.\n\nThe decision was shared with only a tight knit group of US officials to prevent the news from breaking before Griner was in US custody, one US official explained. US officials were concerned about Russia pulling back on the promise after repeated warnings from the Kremlin that the matter should not be discussed in public. They were also cognizant of the ongoing war in Ukraine, wary that any major escalations had the potential to derail the plan. So concerned were White House officials that the fragile deal could collapse that Biden didn’t sign the commutation papers for Bout until Griner was on the ground in Abu Dhabi and in the sight of a US greeting party.\n\nGriner’s wife, who arrived in Washington on Wednesday, was invited to an early morning meeting at the White House set for Thursday. She was initially scheduled to meet with national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who had briefed her several times over the course of the negotiations.\n\nGriner, by that point, had been moved from the penal colony where she’d been held to Moscow: a concrete sign of an imminent resolution. When Cherelle Griner arrived at the White House for the meeting with Sullivan, it had become apparent the critical question was no longer if her wife would be released, but when.\n\nCherelle Griner waited at the White House for a short period of time before it became clear the planned meeting with Sullivan had shifted. One person in particular wanted to deliver the official news that Griner’s nearly 10-month ordeal had come to an end.\n\nShe was led into the Oval Office, where Biden was waiting to tell her Griner was officially on her way home.\n\nGriner’s flight to freedom marked a moment officials acknowledged was only the first step of what will likely be a difficult and emotionally jarring process for the professional athlete in the weeks and months ahead. A range of support programs, developed across the US government over years to address the needs of detainees and hostages returning to US, have been prepared for Griner to utilize.\n\nBiden, who has been briefed on what may lie ahead, according to officials, made his own public plea as he announced Griner’s release.\n\n“The fact remains that she’s lost months of her life, experienced a needless trauma, and she deserves space, privacy, and time with her loved ones to recover and heal from her time being wrongfully detained,” he said.\n\nCases intertwined\n\nA star athlete with an outspoken wife and a dedicated base of supporters, including several fellow celebrities, Griner’s case captured public attention and heaped pressure on Biden to secure her release over the past year. The White House described her suffering “intolerable circumstances” during her detention. And there had been concern about the health and wellbeing of Griner, who is Black and a lesbian, while detained in Russia.\n\nHer case also served to amplify the plight of Whelan, whose arrest on espionage charges led to a conviction in 2020 and a 16-year prison sentence. US officials have called the trial unfair and say the charges are manufactured.\n\nIn July, Griner wrote a letter to Biden saying she was “terrified I might be here forever.” She asked him to do all he could to bring her home. At the White House, Biden met with Griner’s wife for the first time to show her the letter he was sending in response.\n\nIt was later that month the White House made the unusual decision to reveal publicly it had placed a significant offer on the table to secure both Griner’s and Whelan’s release. For Griner and Whelan, they were willing to exchange Viktor Bout, who was convicted in 2011 on charges including conspiring to kill American citizens.\n\nAmerican officials voiced intense frustration that Russia seemed to reject the proposal.\n\nBehind the scenes, Russian officials told their counterparts that releasing two detained Americans for one Russian prisoner was a non-starter. Yet when American officials sought to raise other options that would secure Whelan’s release alongside Griner’s, they were met with significant resistance.\n\nA senior administration official said the US had “tried to articulate other options, other categories of options, to create the space to really have the haggling that we want to have,” describing the other categories as involving individuals in US custody.\n\n“If you’re haggling, you’re getting closer,” the official said. “And instead we have had no change or softening of a response that is simply a demand for something we just can’t provide because it’s not something in our control.”\n\nAs it became clear that Whelan would not be released alongside Griner, Whelan’s sister was visited in person by senior US government officials to “share and talk through” the news. Another senior US official spoke at length Thursday with Whelan himself.\n\nIn a phone call with CNN on Thursday, Whelan voiced his frustration that more has not been done to secure his release.\n\n“I was arrested for a crime that never occurred,” he said from the penal colony where he is being held in a remote part of Russia. “I don’t understand why I’m still sitting here.”\n\nPaul Whelan’s sister, Elizabeth Whelan spoke with Biden on Thursday afternoon, she told CNN.\n\nShe described it as a “good call.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback John Kirby lays out reasons why Griner case was different from Whelan 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\n‘Merchant of death’\n\nAs the outlines of the deal emerged over the past week, White House officials briefed other US government agencies that the Russians would only agree to swap Bout for Griner. Justice Department officials, who were always opposed to releasing Bout, expressed frustration that an earlier deal that included Whelan had, in their view, gotten worse.\n\nOne official said law enforcement officials raised strenuous objections but were told the decision had been made. For law enforcement officials from the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, which spent years and elaborate efforts to try to capture Bout, the release of Bout raised additional concerns about the precedent the deal could set.\n\nThe Biden administration conducted a security assessment in the lead-up to Biden giving the final green light to accept the deal to trade Griner for Bout. Ultimately, the assessment’s conclusion was that “Bout was not a security threat to the US,” a US official told CNN.\n\nOne reality the assessment took into account, the official said, is the fact that Bout has been in prison for over a decade and has not been actively engaged in any recent criminal activity.\n\nOther than to say that the security assessment conducted on Bout was “thorough,” the official would not elaborate further on how the US was able to be certain that the Russian arms dealer wouldn’t pose a future risk to the country.\n\nThe publicity surrounding Griner, including celebrities posting criticism of the Biden White House on social media for not moving more quickly to secure her release, appeared to raise the Russian price for Griner’s release, law enforcement officials said.\n\nThat added to concerns that the deal increases the likelihood that Russia, Iran and other countries could use the arrest of Americans to try to use the publicity to gain concessions the US otherwise wouldn’t give.\n\nSpeaking Thursday, an administration official rejected the notion that Bout’s release set a new precedent for securing the release of Americans and said hostile governments would be mistaken if they interpreted Thursday’s swap that way.\n\n“Any inference that somehow this has become the norm would be mistaken, and I don’t think governments around the world would be wise to draw that inference,” the official said. “But in the rare case when there is an imperative to Americans home, which is a real priority for this president, there sometimes are no alternatives left, and a heavy price has to be paid.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Phil Mattingly", "Kevin Liptak", "Phil Mattingly"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/politics/us-troops-ukraine-russia-nato/index.html", "title": "Here's what Biden has said about sending US troops to Ukraine ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden has warned Americans they will have to pay a price for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nGas prices are likely to rise.\n\nThe post-World War II world order that has maintained relative peace in Europe is threatened.\n\nBut Biden has also been very clear on another point: US troops will not be sent to Ukraine to take part in the conflict.\n\nAs he announced new sanctions on Russia on Thursday, Biden said, “Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict.” He added, “Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the east.”\n\nWhen he announced the first tranche of sanctions against Russia for beginning its invasion on Tuesday, Biden similarly took great care to make clear the US was not being aggressive toward Russia.\n\n“Let me be clear: These are totally defensive moves on our part. We have no intention of fighting Russia,” Biden said.\n\nEarlier in February, Biden told NBC News he would not consider any scenario that included sending US troops to evacuate Americans in Ukraine.\n\n“There’s not. That’s a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another,” he said.\n\nWhile Biden’s clarification that US troops would not become offensively involved can help avoid a conflict between the US and Russia, critics pointed out it also made clear to Russian President Vladimir Putin that his forces would face fewer obstacles in their invasion.\n\n“Biden diluted our most important source of leverage in this crisis,” Ian Brzezinski, former Pentagon official under President George W. Bush told the New York Times earlier this month.\n\nUS troops are in countries that border Ukraine\n\nA major element of Putin’s invasion is his fear that Ukraine could become part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, which was formed after World War II to contain the Soviet Union and has expanded in recent decades to include former Soviet bloc countries.\n\nUkraine borders the NATO member countries of Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. If Russia threatened one of these countries, the US would be required by the agreement to defend them.\n\n“We want to send an unmistakable message, though, that the United States, together with our Allies, will defend every inch of NATO territory and abide by the commitments we made to NATO,” Biden said Tuesday.\n\nHe said something similar last week, in remarks from the White House, but he added clearly, “We also will not send troops in to fight in Ukraine, but we will continue to support the Ukrainian people.”\n\nMoving troops within NATO countries\n\nWhile Biden has pledged not to send US troops to Ukraine, the US has sent additional troops and fighter jets to eastern European countries including Poland and Romania in recent weeks and on Thursday announced the deployment of 7,000 additional troops to Germany.\n\nAfter Russia’s invasion and attack on Ukraine, CNN is reporting that the Biden administration is considering moving more US forces already in Europe to countries farther east due to the massive Russian firepower so close to allies, according to a US official familiar with the matter.\n\n“Today we activated NATO’s defense stance that gives our military commanders more authority to move forces and to deploy forces when needed, and of course this can also be elements of the NATO response force,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday. “We are ready, we are adjusting our posture but what we do is defensive, measured, and we don’t seek confrontation. We want to prevent the conflict.”\n\nOpposition to major US involvement\n\nAmericans are wary of US intervention in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, according to polls taken in the runup to Russia’s invasion.\n\nIn an AP-NORC poll, conducted last Friday through this Monday, just 26% of Americans believed the US should play a major role in the situation between Russia and Ukraine. About half, 52%, said it should play a minor role and another 20% that it should play no role at all.\n\nOne-third of Democrats (32%) and 22% of Republicans wanted the US to play a major role. Independents were most likely to say the US should play no role; 32% felt that way, compared with 22% among Republicans and 14% among Democrats.\n\nIn light of the polling, Biden and American officials would have to be very careful to engage the public before changing the administration’s position on the commitment of US troops.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

But Tuesday night, with a 4-1 victory over the Marlins in Game 1 of their NL wild-card series, they registered the first of what they hope is 13 conquests on their way to a championship.\n\nAnd there’s ample evidence they can be just as punishing as last year's squad — if not more.\n\nStalwarts and upstarts\n\nIn Game 1 of this best-of-three, the usual stars of recent vintage came out. Starting pitcher Zack Wheeler took a shutout into the seventh inning, struck out eight and walked none, his playoff ERA now 2.55 with an absurd strikeout-walk ratio of 41-7 in seven career starts. Castellanos had those two key doubles, Harper that wild-haired viral-ish moment, Alec Bohm drove in the first run, Bryson Stott notched an RBI and a run scored.\n\nYet these Phillies seem to be so much more − and not just because $300 million shortstop Trea Turner is now in the mix.\n\nSure, Turner had a pair of hits and two stolen bases, but the bottom of the lineup flashed a depth that makes the Phillies truly scary.\n\nTake No. 9 hitter Johan Rojas. He’d never played higher than Class AA until the Phillies summoned him in July and were immediately taken in by his work ethic, approach and defense. Rojas took just 149 at-bats this year — and somehow racked up 2.4 Wins Above Replacement.\n\nIn Game 1, he started only because the lefty Luzardo, who struck out 208 batters this year, was on the hill. And Rojas cracked him.\n\nIn a stunning nine-pitch at-bat, Rojas fouled off pitch after pitch to lead off the third inning, sending a pair of rockets foul down the left field line before finally shortening up and smacking a single into left field.\n\nThe crowd awoke. Rojas scampered to second on a wild pitch that barely squirted away from catcher Nick Fortes. He came home on Bohm’s double. It was 1-0.\n\nAn inning later, No. 8 hitter Cristian Pache — who arrived with an all-glove, no-hit rep from Oakland in March — followed Stott’s RBI single with one of his own.\n\nIt was 3-0 and a club that saw six guys slug at least 20 home runs was winning with their ground game, and with a pair of players who did not partake in last October’s glory.\n\nYet are playing like veterans.\n\n\"They’re themselves. That’s the best part about them,\" says Harper. \"Rojas has been great for us since he’s been up here. He’s always wanting to learn, always has questions.

And yet, once he arrives to the park, it’s hard not to get antsy. Eventually, quelling the energy is pointless; better to feed off it.\n\nIt is a connection that begins in the clubhouse and seemingly flows through a stadium, and a city.\n\n\"There’s no cliques,\" says Stott of the Phillies’ room. \"There’s not three guys that don’t hang out with each other.

One more win Wednesday night, and they’ll nearly replicate the path they walked last October: A date with the Braves in the NLDS, Games 3 and 4 right here.\n\n\"You can’t fake these experiences,\" says Castellanos. \"And no matter how talented you are, you can’t replicate a moment like the postseason, playing here in this stadium, with the electricity of the crowd.\n\n\"The fact we’ve all been down this road before, and now we start this journey again − we’re very present and very focused on what we need to do.\"\n\nEven if, amid the chaos, they’re prone to lose their minds sometimes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2023/08/02/s-nchez-hits-bases-loaded-single-in-12th-to-complete-marlins-9-8-comeback-win-over-phillies/70518657007/", "title": "Sánchez hits bases-loaded single in 12th to complete Marlins' 9-8 ...", "text": "GEORGE RICHARDS\n\nAP\n\nMIAMI (AP) — Jesús Sánchez hit a bases-loaded single with no outs in the 12th inning as the Miami Marlins rallied from a five-run deficit and came back twice in extra innings for a 9-8 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Wednesday night in a matchup of NL wild-card contenders.\n\nThe Marlins faced a 5-0 deficit going into the bottom of the sixth inning, but chipped away from there and forced extra innings when Jorge Soler slugged a solo homer with one out in the ninth.\n\nAfter Philadelphia’s Brandon Marsh hit a two-run homer to lead off the 10th inning, Miami matched it.\n\nPhiladelphia also took a lead in the 11th before Miami newcomer Josh Bell singled through the infield with two outs to tie the score once more.\n\n“Fight is exactly how I would describe it,” Miami manager Skip Schumaker said. “Really good job battling back-and-forth and that is not easy in these extra inning games with guys starting on second base and all kind of different scenarios which can happen.

It was early, but it felt like the Brewers were going to have little trouble holding serve: winning the game they were supposed to with their ace on the mound.\n\nThe homers changed that. Carroll’s two-run shot made it a one-run game, Marte’s tied it one pitch later and Moreno’s put the Diamondbacks in front, where they would stay the rest of the game despite regular threats from the Brewers.\n\nWith Brewers right-hander Brandon Woodruff sidelined due to a shoulder injury, the Diamondbacks will have a clear advantage, at least on paper, when they send right-hander Zac Gallen to the mound in Game 2.\n\n– Nick Piecoro\n\nMLB wild card series Game 1 scores\n\nFull MLB postseason schedule, all the way through the World Series.\n\nMarlins pull one back – but Phillies get out of it\n\nMiami left fielder Bryan De La Cruz hit an RBI single in the seventh inning to cut the Phillies' lead to 3-1, but reliever Jose Alvarado struck out Yuli Gurriel with runners on second and third to limit the damage.\n\nAlvarado came on to replace Zack Wheeler, who finished with eight strikeouts and no walks in 6 ⅔ innings, after the Phillies starter gave up the run-scoring hit.

Yet when Phillies ace Zack Wheeler delivers the game’s first pitch on Tuesday, Arráez will dig into the batter’s box – and really, there was no question.\n\n“If I'm here with one leg, I'll go play with one leg,” Arráez said before Game 1. “I need to be there to help my team win.”\n\n– Gabe Lacques\n\nRead Gabe Lacques' full story on the Marlins' wizard here\n\nMichael Taylor catch keeps Twins in front\n\nWith the Twins leading 3-1 in the top of the sixth inning, Minnesota center fielder Michael Taylor made a leaping catch at the wall that saved two runs on a ball hit by Matt Chapman, ending the frame.\n\nKevin Kiermaier's RBI single earlier in the top of the sixth got the Blue Jays on the board.\n\nTaylor, 32, won a Gold Glove win the Royals in 2021 and helped the Nationals win the World Series title in 2019.\n\nRangers beat Rays 4-0 behind Jordan Montgomery's gem\n\nThe Texas Rangers shutout the Tampa Rays 4-0 behind a dominant pitching performance from Jordan Montgomery to take Game 1 of the American League wild-card series.\n\nThe Rangers starter tossed seven scoreless innings and allowing no walks to earn the victory.\n\nThird baseman Josh Jung got the Rangers on the board with a sacrifice fly in the second inning.\n\nThe Rays defense self-destructed, allowing four errors and a wild pitch from Tyler Glasnow that scored a run in the fifth inning.\n\nTampa Bay, wearing throwback Devil Rays jerseys, lost its sixth straight postseason game since winning its 2021 Division Series opener against Boston.

Yandy Diaz, Rene Pinto and Taylor Walls made previous errors for Tampa Bay.\n\nRangers score again, but Rays limit damage\n\nTexas made it 2-0 when Corey Seager scored on a wild pitch by Tyler Glasnow, but the Rangers were able to any more – squandering an opportunity with the bases loaded and no outs in the fifth inning.\n\nSeager led off the inning with a double and the bases were loaded two batters later following a Robbie Grossman walk and Adolis Garcia single. Glasnow got Nathaniel Lowe to pop out (infield fly rule) but then uncorked the run-scoring wild pitch with Jonah Heim at the plate. Heim walked to re-load the bases but Glasnow struck out Leody Taveras and Josh Jung to escape the jam.\n\nPablo López rocks jersey honoring Twins' last playoff win\n\nGame 1 starter Pablo López arrived at Target Field wearing a throwback Johan Santana jersey.

The three wild card teams in each league are the teams with the best records that didn’t win their division.\n\nThe top two division winners with the best records in each league got a bye and don’t have to play in the wild card round.

The 18-game playoff losing streak is the longest in North American team sports.\n\nNow, here they are, with another shot to end their dreaded drought, playing the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League wild-card series on Tuesday (4:38 p.m. ET, ESPN) at Target Field.\n\nMercifully, they’re not playing the Yankees, who are responsible for 13 of those 18 losses.\n\nRead Bob Nightengale's full story on the Twins' losing streak.\n\nTexas rivalry takes odd turn over Rangers' celebrations\n\nOne of the oft-used admonitions in sports is a desire to \"act like you've been there.\" As a way to focus on the ultimate goal of winning a championship, the saying reminds athletes not to celebrate their accomplishments prematurely.\n\nBut what if you haven't been there? How should you act then?\n\nThe Houston Astros are the defending World Series champions. The Texas Rangers are in the playoffs for the first time since 2016. Both teams clinched postseason spots last Saturday. And while the Rangers ended up squandering the AL West division title on the final day of the regular season, they still had reason to be proud of their accomplishments.\n\nBut then the teams' intrastate rivalry took an odd turn when Astros beat reporter Brian McTaggart of MLB.com sent out a social media post that seemed to criticize the Rangers, saying they \"partied\" on Saturday while the Astros were focused on claiming the division title the next day. \"Houston's 'been-there-done-that mentality paid off, it seems.\" McTaggart wrote.\n\nHowever, Rangers beat reporter Evan Grant of the Dallas Morning News called the observation \"inaccurate.\"\n\nAnd from there, things escalated -- with each team's fanbases getting involved in the debate online and on sports talk radio. Even Rangers GM Chris Young was asked about it during an interview Monday on Dallas radio station 105.3 The Fan.\n\nWhile it may be much ado about nothing right now, the Rangers and Astros could eventually meet in the AL championship series. If that happens, the winner can certainly claim bragging rights – and the right to a slightly bigger celebration – on the way to the World Series.\n\n– Steve Gardner", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/phillies/2023/10/04/phillies-bryce-harper-sent-message-nl-wildcard-running-coach-wathan-stop-sign-marlins-zack-wheeler/71033670007/", "title": "How Bryce Harper sent Phillies, Marlins message by running past ...", "text": "PHILADELPHIA − Bryce Harper had to be kidding, right?\n\nHe was on first base when Nick Castellanos hit a line drive into the left field corner.

The right-hander went eight innings and struck out 12.\n\nPhiladelphia reliever Seranthony Domínguez walked three batters with one out in the ninth, but pinch-hitter Jesús Sánchez grounded into a fielder’s choice that forced pinch-runner Billy Hamilton at home. Domínguez then struck out Miguel Rojas for his fourth save.\n\n“That’s how you have to beat (Alcantara),” Phillies interim manager Rob Thomson said. “You’ve got to scratch out some hits and some runs and play good defense.

Realmuto followed with a hard smash down the third base line.\n\n“We didn’t make a ton of good contact tonight,” Hoskins said. “We got some hits when we needed it.

Avisaíl García walked and advanced on Brian Anderson’s double.\n\n“You want to be able to have room for error,” Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. “You want to be able to scratch a run or two in there somewhere while you’re getting those zeros. We just weren’t able to do it.”\n\nWALK AND TALK\n\nThe Phillies had not drawn a walk in 148 plate appearances until Hoskins reached on four pitches in the seventh. Hoskins also had an eight-pitch at-bat against Alcantara in the fourth before flying out.\n\n“I didn’t know it was that long. It felt like it had been a long time,” Hoskins said. “Those guys with elite stuff, the aces, you try to grind them a little bit. Get them out of the game early.

But 121.3 million were either in upper- or lower-income households. The \"upper class\" portion possessed almost half of all annual U.S. income, at 49 percent.\n\nAnd while the middle class made up 61 percent of the U.S. adult population in 1971, now, it's just 50 percent.\n\nRob Rains and Karen Houston are not surprised. Rains is president of United Way of Brevard; Houston is field representative for the Space Coast AFL-CIO.\n\nThe median household income for Brevard is $46,162. However, the amount needed for a bare-minimum budget in Brevard for a family of four, Rains says, is $48,020. This would cover items such as housing, child care, food, health care and transportation — but leave little for anything else, including savings to cushion financial blows.\n\n\"When we look at Brevard, we have 13.5 percent of our population living below the poverty level,\" Rains said.\n\n\"But additionally, we have another 27 percent considered to be working poor. This group is just one crisis away from slipping into poverty. They live paycheck to paycheck but in reality, struggle to cover the basics.\"\n\nI asked Rains and Houston:\n\nWhat do you see locally as causes for this loss of middle-class households?\n\nHouston: A multitude of factors have contributed to a definite decline in Brevard, starting with the loss of the shuttle program. As commercial companies push against collective bargaining and service contract work, many workers find the level of income they were used to is a thing of the past. Their income has diminished and it has become a \"take it or leave it\" mantra from some of the new contractors. Many have left the area and others struggle to find an adequate income to maintain their middle-income-based obligations.\n\nRains: While there are many reasons for it, the fact is our economy doesn’t distribute wealth evenly. The trend of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer has been ongoing for a couple of decades now. The challenge is, it creates more uncertainty and stress across the board, but especially for those on the margin.\n\nWhat's the danger of the shrinking middle class in terms of the work nonprofits do here in Brevard?\n\nHouston: That danger is already a reality. I have friends who are striving to survive a loss of income or a reduction in wages. I, too, have faced such and have not recovered completely. Most agencies are pushed to the limit. I know of people who worked all their lives and now find they must seek help from food banks to survive. These were at one time middle-income wage earners. They have exhausted their retirement funds and savings trying simply to survive. People are losing homes and families are sharing residences for longer periods of time.\n\nRains: As the lower-income population increases, the demand for assistance from local nonprofits also increases. For instance, the demand for assistance with food from food stamps has more than tripled since 2007. The number of students eligible for free and reduced lunch has increased more than 5 percent since 2009. Educational attainment plays a key role in future success in life, including higher income and better health. We have 36 percent of our third-grade students failing the reading portion of standardized tests ... what hope do they have for the future if they can’t read?\n\nIn weeks to come, I'll explore this topic in more depth with Rains, Houston and others who deal daily with workers, job-seekers and families on the brink of disaster. I'll talk with people of every income level about what \"middle-class life\" means on the Space Coast and how it can be strengthened.\n\nI welcome your questions and thoughts on the topic.\n\nAnd if you're wondering if you're a member of the middle class, check out Pew's online income calculator.\n\nCheck your memory bank, too.\n\nContact Kennerly at 321-242-3692 or bkennerly@floridatoday.com.

More US schools consider shorter weeks", "text": "A school district in the Kansas City, Missouri, area could be the next large K-12 system to shorten its week to four days.\n\nSt. Joseph School District, which serves more than 10,000 students, including a growing English-language learner population, announced this week that it would be exploring a four-day school week. Officials hope the reduction, which wouldn’t take effect until the 2024-25 school year, would help address gaping staff vacancies, particularly in the English-Language Learner department, or ELL.\n\nThe move comes after board members of Independence School District, a school system east of Kansas City, voted 6-1 this month to adopt a four-day week. In doing so, Independence became the largest district in the state, serving roughly 14,000 students, to adopt the shortened schedule.\n\nHow much time do kids spend in school? It depends on where they live.\n\nWhat states have four-day school weeks?\n\nInstructional time policies often vary by district, but the four-day model is particularly pronounced in certain states, including those in the western region of the country and the South. Dozens of school districts in Texas have shortened their weeks.\n\nMore than a quarter of Missouri’s school districts had four-day weeks as of the start of the 2022-23 school year. The districts tend to be small and rural. The second-largest Missouri district with a four-day week, for example, serves just 3,000 students.\n\nFour-day weeks have been a relatively common – and often well received – format in small, rural districts since well before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBrookings Institute research shows they’ve grown in popularity over the past two decades. An analysis published shortly before the pandemic found at least 662 districts across two dozen states with four-day weeks.\n\nTeacher shortages fuel four-day school week\n\nThe pandemic has accelerated the four-day-week trend, particularly as schools grapple with teacher and support staff shortages.\n\nAccording to a federal survey in October, nearly half (45%) of public schools have at least one vacant teaching position, about the same rate as when the survey was done in January. Across the country, 4% of teaching positions remained vacant this fall, though the problem was pronounced in special education (7% of positions unfilled) and ELL programs (6%).\n\nBack in St. Joseph in Missouri, six of the more than 20 ELL teaching positions are vacant. Yet students learning English are the district’s fastest-growing group, from several hundred a decade ago to more than 1,000 today. Roughly three dozen languages are spoken, including Spanish, Chuukese and Burmese.\n\nOverworked, underpaid?:The toll of burnout is contributing to teacher shortages nationwide\n\nLearning loss affects these kids most:The teacher shortages are just piling on\n\nAre four-day weeks better?\n\nSt. Joseph School District’s next steps will involve lots of consultation with Independence officials as well as community members, said Gabe Edgar, St. Joseph’s superintendent.\n\nFrom a logistics standpoint, four-day weeks are appealing. Shortened weeks are often a strategy for recruiting and retaining teachers, particularly in rural and other hard-to-staff areas.\n\nThey can also help cut costs, particularly on electricity and other building expenses.\n\nThe consequences of four-day school weeks\n\nShortened school weeks can cause headaches for parents, from child care burdens to transportation problems. Many low-income families rely on schools to provide breakfast and lunch.\n\nThen there are the academic ramifications, of course. Research shows more high-quality instructional time is key to catching kids up from COVID-19-era learning disruptions.\n\nSome schools and districts try to compensate for the lost day with added hours to the other four days or other extracurricular opportunities. Still, one study found that on average students who attend them spend 85 fewer hours on instruction every year.\n\n\"The move to four-day school weeks is an unequivocally bad thing for kids and families,” Matt Kraft, an education researcher and professor at Brown University in Rhode Island who has studied instructional time, told USA TODAY earlier this year.\n\nEdgar said his end goal \"is to do what’s best for students.\" He said he’d rather “take a chance and fail than sit there and not do anything.”\n\n“Just try it and see if it happens. If it's good, it's good. If it's bad … we'll get back up and start over.”\n\nContact Alia Wong at (202) 507-2256 or awong@usatoday.com.

Many of them end up paying for more than four years of college, driving up the cost of attendance significantly.\n\nCNBC Make It set out to capture the information students would need to balance these considerations. The result is our first list of the U.S. colleges that pay off the most, a ranking that spotlights 50 schools that provide students the highest average salaries for their tuition dollars.\n\nWe started by identifying the true net cost of each college for the typical American student — including tuition, fees, books, supplies and other expenses — after subtracting scholarships and grants. Using data from Tuition Tracker, a tool created by education-focused nonprofit news organization The Hechinger Report, we looked at the net cost for students from families making between $48,001 and $75,000, an income range established by the Department of Education. We chose to focus on this bracket because it includes the median U.S. household income, $61,372.\n\nWells Fargo:Earnings top estimates on strong consumer checking\n\nTesla:Employees say they took shortcuts to meet aggressive production goals\n\nThe Hechinger Report calculates net cost by subtracting federal, state, local and institutional grants and scholarships from the sticker price for first-time, full-time (and, at public universities, in-state) undergraduates based on data provided by the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nThen, using data from PayScale’s College Salary Report, we divided net cost by graduates’ expected annual earnings, which was calculated based on the median salary of graduates with less than five years of experience as well as those with 10 or more years of experience. The ranking gives greater weight to workers’ earnings in the years immediately after college, when individuals are the most impacted by college costs and student debt. (You can read our full methodology here.)\n\nWe excluded tuition-free institutions from the list, including military schools like West Point and U.S. Naval Academy, because the cost of post-college military service introduces an additional factor that’s challenging to measure against other schools.\n\nStanford University takes first place on the list. According to The Hechinger Report, the net cost for a student from a family that earns between $48,001 and $75,000 is $4,061 per year. Stanford graduates with more than 10 years of experience report average salaries of $143,100.\n\nAccording to PayScale, 51% of Stanford students major in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) field, a factor that contributes to high average salaries among graduates. And Stanford is known for providing robust financial aid. The average scholarship and grant total for students from families making less than $65,000 a year is $74,095 per year. Students from families making between $65,000 and $95,000 receive $65,050 on average in scholarships and grant aid.\n\nWhile Princeton, Harvard and Yale get top marks, a wide range of schools from across the U.S. are represented here. State schools like the University of Washington-Seattle, small liberal arts colleges like Pomona College and STEM-focused schools like MIT also appear on this list, indicating that you don’t have to attend the Ivy League to get a great return on your college investment.\n\nHere is CNBC Make It’s 2019 list of the top 50 U.S. colleges that pay off the most:\n\nThe top 25 private universities\n\n1.

Consider pursuing a degree in a high-paying field. Earning a degree in a STEM field can help students at any college prepare themselves for in-demand high-paying jobs. Students can keep costs low by keeping on pace with their requirements and graduating on time. Additional semesters of college can be expensive and in some cases, scholarship and grant aid does not apply for semesters beyond the standard four years.\n\nBut the most significant step students can take to ensure their college degree pays off is, simply, to complete their college degree. Just 60% of college students complete their bachelor’s in six years and many drop out altogether, and one of the worst outcomes for students is taking on loans for a degree they do not complete. The economic benefits of earning a bachelor’s degree are still significant, and if students study hard and play their cards right, college can pay off big time.\n\n©CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Atrocious school conditions have even prompted some teachers this school year to go on strike.\n\nHow CNN found subpar school conditions CNN asked teachers about the conditions of their schools and received more than 250 responses from across the US. Some teachers spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.\n\n“We’re getting to a critical stage now,” said Mike Pickens, executive director of the National Council on School Facilities. “The average age of a school building now is from 49 to 50 years” – the highest in memory. Some schools date back to World War II.\n\nBut as schools get older and more desperate for repairs, the funding gap for public schools keeps getting worse.\n\n“American Society of Civil Engineers gives the condition of America’s 100,000 public school buildings an overall grade of D+,” the National Education Association said late last year. “And no wonder – half our school buildings are half a century old.”\n\nNow, everyone is paying the price for underfunded schools.\n\nStudents get sick, distracted or miss entire days of education when conditions turn abysmal. Parents sacrifice income to provide child care when classes suddenly get canceled.\n\nBurnt-out teachers already stressed by the pandemic and school violence are pushed closer to leaving the profession.\n\nEven those not directly connected to deteriorating schools will be impacted, Pickens said.\n\nWithout more investment in US public schools, he said, “we get further and further behind on the world stage.”\n\nFrom Maryland to Colorado, students struggle to breathe in oppressively hot classrooms\n\nIn Baltimore, Marcia Turner is sick of her kids feeling sick at school.\n\n“My children can’t even breathe in the school. It be so hot. One have asthma,” Turner told CNN affiliate WMAR.\n\nFourteen Baltimore schools don’t have any air conditioning, school district Chief Operating Officer Lynette Washington told CNN. Those students get sent home early when it’s too hot to learn – 85 degrees or higher in their classrooms, she said.\n\nStifling temperatures can impede students’ academic success. Researchers who looked at millions of test scores from American high schoolers found students tend to score lower when it’s a hot school year, according to a 2018 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nBut air conditioning mitigated many of the negative effects, the researchers found.\n\nThe lack of air conditioning doesn’t just stymie students’ learning. It also hurts parents who can’t afford to leave work to take care of their children in the middle of the day.\n\n“And I can’t get off because I’m just starting a job,” Turner told WMAR.\n\nThe Baltimore school district’s COO said she’s frustrated, too. About 65% of the city’s public schools are over 41 years old; more than a third are over 51 years old.\n\n“We have such a backlog of infrastructure that has not been updated and upgraded in a consistent way. When they’re not upgraded toward the end of their life cycle, then we just hold onto them, and we just keep putting Band-Aids on them,” Washington said.\n\n“We do not have the dollars. We do not have the resources.”\n\nFive years ago, Baltimore had 75 public schools without air conditioning, Washington said. Installing AC in all those schools would cost $250 million – about five times the district’s entire annual infrastructure budget.\n\nSo Baltimore Public Schools is chipping away at the problem over years. Of the 14 schools that still lack air conditioning, six will have it in the next 24 months, Washington said. The other eight will be completely renovated – with air conditioning – or shuttered.\n\nWhy window AC units won't fix the problem For schools that don’t have air conditioning, window AC units aren’t a practical solution, said Baltimore Public Schools Chief Operating Officer Lynette Washington. “The challenge with these window air conditioning units is that they don’t meet what is called ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) standards because they do not provide the ventilation and fresh air intake required for classrooms,” she said. “The other challenge with the air conditioning box units is that they have a very short life cycle. So they may last for a year or two … (and) have to be consistently maintained and replaced. We don’t have the resources.”\n\nMany states away in Colorado, more than 30 schools in Denver Public Schools had to send kids home early and four closed for full days this month due to the heat, the district said. Temperatures soared in Denver the first full week of September, with daily highs ranging from 97 to 99 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n“I can’t change the fact that it’s 88 degrees in the classroom,” said Sara, a teacher at McAuliffe International School, which had three days of early dismissal. “It gets really draining, physically and emotionally, to be kind of beat down by these factors, day in and day out.”\n\nThe middle school in Colorado’s largest school district has no air conditioning, said Trena Marsal, the district’s executive director of facility management. The infrastructure, she said, was never meant for higher temperatures.\n\n“Our oldest building is (from) 1889,” she said.\n\nForty Denver public schools still lack AC, down from 55 in 2019, Marsal said. In 2020, Denver voters approved bonds to pay, in part, for the installation of air conditioning units in schools, including a two-year plan to air-condition McAuliffe, the school district said.\n\nBut supply chain problems delayed installations this summer, leaving the work at eight schools only partially completed.\n\nSo the district has heat mitigation liaisons, Marsal said. Portable cooling units are strategically placed during the day, and windows are opened at night, she said.\n\nOpening windows, though, means “we basically daily get wasps and flies – and it’s always exciting when that happens,” Sara said.\n\nIn the heat of day, Sara said, conditions in classrooms can make older kids anxious.\n\n“You have students, I’m sure, who are nervous about sweat stains or they sit down on a plastic chair and their butt gets sweaty,” she said. “It’s stuff as an adult we’re not as self-conscious about, but a teenager absolutely is.”\n\n“I sweat, like, everywhere,” seventh grader Zmarra Fleming told CNN affiliate KUSA. “In the classrooms, it’s really hot. It’s, like, hot where the point is you can’t really breathe in there.”\n\nMcAuliffe International School student Zmarra Fleming said it was hard to breathe in her hot classroom. KUSA\n\nBut the immediate fix – early dismissal – caused transportation problems this month for some students. McAuliffe got out at 1:32 p.m., according to the school’s website, but Marsal said early buses weren’t requested.\n\n“It’s very frustrating,” parent Stephanie Bates told KUSA. “I can’t imagine what parents who don’t have flexibility in their schedules do.”\n\nRusty water drips from classroom ceilings\n\nLeaking water in classrooms and brown, stained ceiling tiles have made for a “morning ritual” among some teachers at Joseph G. Pyne Arts Magnet School in Lowell, Massachusetts.\n\n“Outside my room, in the hallway, there’s several tiles that are stained brown like rusty, dirty water from leaks,” said Eric Kolifrath, a seventh and eighth grade science teacher. “Everyone on my floor, especially if it’s rained, we examine the ceiling to let the custodial staff know if we see new leaks.”\n\nEric Kolifrath says it's become a \"morning ritual\" to inspect for leaks on his floor of the school. Courtesy Eric Kolifrath\n\nLast school year, a ceiling tile got so wet it “bowed out like a bowl,” Kolifrath said. So custodians wheeled in a 33-gallon trash bin to collect the water.\n\nAnother time, a leak sprang right above his classroom projector.\n\n“That’s not a problem that my principal can fix,” Kolifrath said. “If she had a wand, she would wave it.”\n\nThat’s in part because Kolifrath’s school, which serves pre-K through eighth grade, and 28 others in the district are managed by the City of Lowell, which also looks after municipal buildings, City Manager Tom Golden said.\n\nThe setup is among the myriad ways American school buildings are maintained – which can lead to confusion over who’s responsible for repairs.\n\nA browning ceiling tile hangs over a room this school year at Joseph G. Pyne Arts Magnet School in Lowell, Massachusetts. Courtesy Eric Kolifrath\n\nLike many teachers nationwide, Kolifrath has crowdsourced financial support for his classroom.\n\nThe city is putting $2.3 million into all Lowell schools during the 2022-2023 school year and investing $389 million to build a new high school, Golden said.\n\nThe roof at J. G. Pyne was repaired last year, he said. But maintaining ceiling tiles “would be the responsibility of the custodians who work for the school department,” Golden said.\n\n“With the number of buildings that we have, there are always going to be issues and challenges on a day-to-day basis, which our lands and buildings professionals will be out there to rectify.”\n\nThe school funding gap keeps getting worse\n\nThe money spent on fixing or building US public schools falls woefully short of what’s needed to get buildings up to standard, according to the latest “State of Our Schools” report by the 21st Century School Fund, the International WELL Building Institute and the National Council on School Facilities.\n\nAnd the gap is widening. In 2016, public schools were underfunded by $46 billion a year (or $60 billion, when adjusted for inflation to 2020 dollars), the report said. By 2021, that annual deficit had grown by $25 billion.\n\nWhere does funding for public school buildings come from? The funding sources and ratios vary across the country. But in general, “local school districts bear the heaviest responsibilities for school construction capital funding,” according to the 2021 “State of Our Schools” report. From fiscal years 2009 to 2019: Local school districts paid 77% of the costs for PK-12 capital projects. States paid 22% to districts for capital outlay and debt service. But state support is highly variable, with 11 states paying nothing to eight states paying over half the district-level capital costs. Public school districts got slightly more than 1% from federal funds for school construction.\n\n“We have a gap of about $85 billion in our country from where we are to where we need to be to be current with codes and standards and the quality of education,” Pickens said. “In that, $57 billion is in capital improvements, and about $28 billion is in M&O – which is maintenance and operation.”\n\nThe trend is untenable as more American schools cross the half-century mark.\n\nEven with regular maintenance, “about 50 years is a good place to (consider) replacing a school.” Pickens said.\n\nBut funding sources vary widely, and it can be hard to secure money for school improvements without raising taxes.\n\n“Every state handles school facility improvements a little differently,” said John Heim, executive director of the National School Boards Association. But “it usually comes from property taxes.”\n\nAnd that can put already-disadvantaged students in a more dire situation.\n\n“It affects poor districts or those that have lower tax bases more than it does wealthier districts that have more tax base to call on,” Heim said.\n\n“And so as things get more expensive, you’re going to see that gap continue to grow.”\n\nAs schools deteriorate, so do teachers’ and students’ performance\n\nAt Reading Memorial High School in Massachusetts, a longtime teacher runs up to seven fans in his classroom to try to compensate for the school’s lack of air conditioning.\n\nBut those efforts don’t prevent him or his students from fading as the day gets hotter.\n\n“I don’t get the same caliber of work from them as I do during those cooler months when they’re actually comfortable,” he said.\n\n“I find myself adjusting my lessons as the day goes on because I know I’m not going to have the energy or mental capacity to do what I did earlier in the day because I’m so uncomfortable.”\n\nThe temperature in his classroom can reach 100 degrees, and the humidity can make you “slip on the floor,” the teacher said.\n\nThat’s especially problematic because he has an autoimmune disease and has suffered dizzy spells that have forced him to leave the classroom to splash cold water on his face, he said.\n\nHVAC preventative maintenance has been completed at all Reading Public Schools, the district said.\n\n“We are committed to ensuring high quality air ventilation in all of our classrooms,” Superintendent Thomas Milaschewski told CNN in a statement.\n\nThe district “will continue to encourage staff to open windows, as feasible, to increase air flow in classrooms, and to bring students outside when weather permits,” the superintendent wrote.\n\nBut that brings little comfort to the veteran high school teacher – especially because the building’s central and main offices are air-conditioned, he said.\n\n“I cannot think of many professions where people have graduate degrees or have a license where they would tolerate something like this,” the teacher said. “I don’t understand where the disconnect is, where you want your teachers to be the best that they can possibly be but you’re not even making them comfortable.”\n\nKids miss entire school days because some buildings don’t have heat\n\nWhile nonexistent air conditioning can hinder students at the beginning and end of the school year, the opposite problem can have even greater consequences.\n\n“We tend to have to close schools down more for heating issues than for cooling issues,” said Washington, the Baltimore school district COO. “Wintertime goes from December all the way up until March.”\n\nBaltimore teachers have reported classrooms as cold as 40 degrees. More than a third of the schools’ boilers are over 20 years old. Some pipes were installed when Harry Truman was President.\n\nBeyond that, one elementary school had no running water for more than two weeks last winter, according to a school district memo.\n\n“The district is severely underfunded,” Washington said.\n\n“Baltimore’s already taxed at a higher rate than the surrounding counties,” she said. But “Baltimore city has a low tax base. We have a disproportionate share of households that live below the poverty line. And so if we’re just depending on property taxes, we might not get there at all.”\n\nShe hopes the state will increase funding for Baltimore city schools “so that we won’t continue to have the infrastructure challenges that we’re having.”\n\nIf not, Washington said, “I cannot guarantee that our students will have the learning environments that they deserve and that they need to be successful.”\n\nWhy this year may be even more challenging\n\nFallout from the pandemic could make infrastructure problems harder to fix this year, Pickens said.\n\nSome school districts haven’t been able to complete projects due to supply chain shortages or an increase in the cost of raw materials, he said. And remote or hybrid learning during the pandemic means some parts of schools may have been neglected.\n\nA demonstrator in Columbus, Ohio, rallies in support of teachers at a Columbus Education Association protest in August. Barbara J. Perenic/Columbus Dispatch/USA Today Network\n\n“We’ve had two years of less use than we had,” Pickens said. “And because students were not in buildings, we probably did not continue the maintenance and operation and capital improvements of those school buildings because students weren’t in them.”\n\nInflation this year could also be getting in the way of school improvements, Heim said.\n\n“If we’re talking about an improvement that was to be made for the 2022-2023 school year, that bid process probably would have taken place back in January, February,” Heim said.\n\n“That’s when we were seeing those incredibly high building costs. And it’s also when we were experiencing all those supply chain issues. So … schools may not have been able to get the projects done in time or weren’t able to do as much because of the supply chain issues and inflation issues.”\n\nCockroaches make lunch a scary scene, teacher says\n\nSchools that aren’t well-maintained can attract unwelcome visitors. Around one school building, cockroaches have occupied corners, carpets, sinks and sticky glue insect traps, an Oakley, California, high school teacher said.\n\nThe bugs can be seen every day, inside and outside the school. They grow as long as 2 inches and seem to have multiplied after school resumed in-person learning last year, the teacher said.\n\nThe infestation at Freedom High School is so bad it inspired an Instagram account. The teacher verified the cockroach photos were taken at the school and shared some personal ones from the last week of August. The teacher submitted work orders about the cockroaches in recent years but didn’t report them directly to the administration, they said.\n\nDead cockroaches lie inside and outside a bug trap at Freedom High School in Oakley, California. Provided to CNN\n\nLiberty Union High School District Superintendent Eric Volta recognized Freedom High School in the social media photos, he said. The district sprays schools for pests quarterly, he said, and if there are additional needs, pest services are requested.\n\n“We fog, we spray, we bait, we trap. We do whatever we need to do to try to correct the issue,” Volta said. “We’ve been having triple-digit temperatures out here, and these things are coming up out of wherever they are just looking for water.”\n\nA big concern is cockroaches shed, leaving the teacher wary of eating in most places. Some students haven’t wanted school lunches because of the roaches, the teacher said.\n\nBut all kitchens and snack bars go through health inspections. So Volta is not worried about the pests in eating areas, he said.\n\n“I guess this is something that probably most teachers deal with,” the teacher said.\n\nWhile cockroaches might not be in every school, “there’s these problems that you have that are constant, but that you just go on teaching and doing what you have to do, knowing that you almost have no control over the situation,” the teacher said.\n\n“I can keep stepping on cockroaches and killing them, but there’s always more. The problem just sort of needs to be addressed instead of just putting Band-Aids on it.”\n\nThe consequences of inaction … and possible solutions\n\nAnd if America keeps underfunding public schools, the impact could last generations, said Mary Kusler, the National Education Association’s senior director for advocacy.\n\n“It’s really setting up a continued structural imbalance between the haves and the have-nots … unless we step up and push to ensure that a child’s ZIP code does not determine the education they receive,” she said.\n\nIncreasing funding for school infrastructure would “improve a lot of things in our country, including putting out into the workforce a more vibrant and more educated workforce,” said Pickens, the director of the National Council on School Facilities.\n\n“Also, by improving schools, somebody has to do the work on a school building. We’re putting people to work. We’re getting taxes from those people, from the labor. We’re increasing jobs. All of those things are factors in providing funds for school buildings.”\n\nTeachers and supporters rally in 2019 in Annapolis, Maryland. Baltimore union members asked for fans to be donated to cool sweltering classrooms without air-conditioning. Susan Walsh/AP\n\nIt’s in everyone’s best interest to ensure students in poorer communities have schools in which they can thrive – even if local tax revenues aren’t as plush as those in wealthier communities, said Heim, the director of the National School Boards Association.\n\n“I think it comes down to having good formulas that can compensate for that. I think states are reevaluating those all the time,” Heim said.\n\n“But that’s what it comes down to: affordability and helping those poorer districts with their facilities.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean wealthier school districts with state-of-the-art buildings should have anything taken away, Kusler said.\n\n“The issue isn’t that they deserve less. The issue is actually that all of our kids deserve more,” she said.\n\n“Ultimately, we are about creating the next generation of leaders in this country. And they will come from all over the country. Therefore, we need to make sure all of them have access to the education that they deserve.”", "authors": ["Christina Zdanowicz Holly Yan", "Christina Zdanowicz", "Holly Yan"], "publish_date": "2022/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2023/03/02/stop-requiring-college-degrees-entry-level-jobs/11322828002/", "title": "Want to end income inequality? Stop requiring college degrees for ...", "text": "Steve Jobs was a failure – at least by academic standards. The co-founder of Apple, who revolutionized the way we learn, communicate and connect, dropped out of college after only one semester on campus.\n\nIf you were the manager of a tech firm, would you hire someone with Jobs' lack of academic qualifications?\n\nThe answer at many companies, tech and otherwise, is no. For too long, companies have required college degrees for positions that don't require college-level skills.\n\nNeo-Nazis protested Broadway musical:All the more reason for the show to go on.\n\nMost entry-level jobs require a college degree\n\nAccording to a report by Cengage Group, \"Nearly two-thirds (62%) of employers still require a degree for entry-level jobs.\"\n\nA study by Joseph Fuller and Manjari Raman of Harvard Business School found that \"in 2015, 67% of production supervisor job postings asked for a college degree, while only 16% of employed production supervisors had one.\" That's a 51 percentage point gap.\n\nBut American companies haven't always been so focused on academic attainment. A little known U.S. Supreme Court decision, Griggs vs. Duke Power Co., handed down in 1971, might have inadvertently paved the way for employers to require college completion for many jobs by discouraging on-the-job competency tests.\n\nBefore the 1970s, companies commonly required employees to take aptitude tests to be eligible for promotions. But Griggs vs. Duke changed that practice.\n\nThe case involved Willie Griggs, a Black man, who sued Duke Power for violating Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act by requiring a high school diploma and a minimum score on two aptitude tests to attain higher positions in the company.\n\nSupreme Court hears student loan forgiveness:Biden's student loan plan is an abuse of power. Supreme Court must rule against it.\n\nGriggs argued that the requirements disproportionately discriminated against African Americans. The court unanimously agreed that it did.\n\nSoon after the decision, businesses chose to end job testing for higher positions because of the potential legal consequences. Instead, more businesses began to require college degrees as a substitute for aptitude tests, to the detriment of the working class.\n\nWorkers could at one time demonstrate their prowess on the job and pass a test to show they were ready for promotion. Now, they need years of college classes and a decent GPA just to be considered for an entry-level job.\n\nDegree requirements have hurt upward mobility\n\nAnd that has made it harder for lower-income Americans to land higher-paying jobs and move into the middle class.\n\nIn 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for Americans with a high school diploma was 6.2%. People with a bachelor’s degree had a jobless rate of 3.5%. The median weekly income for high school graduates was $809 – a salary of $42,000 a year. For college graduates, the median weekly salary was $1,334 – or $69,000 a year.\n\nHow not to layoff employees:Pro tip: Don't quote Martin Luther King Jr. when you announce layoffs via email\n\nBad news, remote workers:You need to return to the office for your employer to succeed\n\nDespite the Supreme Court's intentions with the Griggs ruling, the end of aptitude testing and the rise in college degree requirements has disproportionately hurt Black Americans, who are less likely to hold a college degree.\n\nThankfully, companies are starting to eliminate college degree requirements for middle-skill and high-skill jobs, according to a study from Harvard and Emsi Burning Glass.\n\nTech companies, in particular, seem to be leading this change. The study found that \"only 26% of Accenture’s Software QA Engineer postings specify a degree requirement, and 29% of IBM’s.\"\n\nAccenture established an apprenticeship program in 2016, and the vast majority of the apprentices, 80%, joined the company without a four-year college degree.\n\nAccenture CEO Jimmy Etheredge told CNBC: \"A person’s educational credentials are not the only indicators of success, so we advanced our approach to hiring to focus on skills, experiences and potential.\"\n\nIs your office pet-friendly?:Pets are our companions at home. More employers are welcoming them at work, too.\n\nAmerican workers are falling behind:Employees need paid family leave\n\nEtheredge is right.

None of the former leaders responded to requests for comment.\n\nBoard Chairman John Cochran declined an interview request.\n\nIn a statement, the retired Bank of America executive said there is \"no one-size-fits-all\" approach to contract negotiations.\n\n\"Employment packages often involve a mix that includes deferred compensation, retirement contributions, and items such as bonuses earned in one year that may be paid out over multiple years,\" he wrote.\n\nTaken together, such line items represent the full value of an executive's compensation, which is rarely reported, in total, to the public, according to George Mason University public policy scholar James Finkelstein, who has reviewed hundreds of university president contracts.\n\n\"We call it the CEO-ization of university leadership,\" he said.\n\nState. Sen. John Kowalko called UD's compensation packages \"excessive.\"\n\nFor years, the Newark Democrat has rallied unsuccessfully to open up the state's land-grant universities to increased public scrutiny.\n\n\"Until you let the public see how you're doing these things, you are and you should be suspected,\" he said.\n\nUD is slated to receive about $120 million from the state this fiscal year, about 11 percent of the university's total budget. The university is not obligated to publicly disclose the details of its executive compensation packages other than what it reports to the IRS.\n\nThe Delaware General Assembly considers UD, like Delaware State University, a quasi-public agency, which means most of its records are off-limits to the public.\n\nUD President Dennis Assanis, for instance, took over in 2016, but the university won't release his base salary or total compensation package.\n\nState Sen. Greg Lavelle has consistently voted against broadening public access to UD records and meetings.\n\nThe university \"is not a state agency in the true sense of the word,\" the Sharpley Republican said recently, noting that taxpayers finance a small portion of UD's billion-dollar budget.\n\nLavelle and his wife, Ruth, work as managing directors for Puglisi & Associates, a Newark accounting firm founded by UD Trustee Don Puglisi. The senator said his votes are unrelated to his employment, which predates Puglisi's time on the board.\n\nAsked about UD's payouts to former top executives, Lavelle wrote in a statement: \"I'm concerned about the increasing cost of higher education across the country. I think all universities should manage all of their expenses.\"\n\nLieutenant Governor Bethany Hall-Long, a former state senator and representative, works as a nursing professor at UD.\n\nTo determine how much money the university paid former administrators, The News Journal pieced together the information from the university's Form 990s, which tax-exempt organizations file annually with the IRS.\n\nAmong the findings:\n\n• Before stepping down in July of 2007, former University President David Roselle earned about $875,000 a year, making him the highest-paid public university president in the nation. Post-UD, Roselle has received nearly $1.9 million. This is in addition to the more than $2.45 million he earned during his final year at the helm, according to IRS records.\n\n• K.C. Keeler, who during the Great Recession was granted a 10-year contract extension to stay on as head football coach through the 2017 season, was fired in January of 2013. Keeler, who earned a salary of more than $300,000, received nearly $2 million from UD in 2013, despite working for roughly one week that year, IRS forms show.\n\n• Former President Patrick Harker, who left UD midway through 2015 to lead the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, earned nearly $817,000 that year, or about 86 percent of his compensation the previous year. For six months of 2015, Harker was also employed by the Fed. His salary at the central bank has not been disclosed; his predecessor, Charles Plosser, earned $350,000.\n\nIt's not certain if Harker or other recently departed UD executives are due more payments from the university; UD won't file its form 990 for fiscal year 2017 until next year.\n\nFormer Provost Domenico Grasso, who resigned in October from a $641,000-a-year position for what he called personal reasons, is now on a one-year paid administrative leave.\n\nAfter that, Grasso plans to return to UD to develop a program in engineering and environmental policy.\n\nReached by phone recently, the former chief academic officer likened the leave to a faculty sabbatical.\n\n\"I took a sabbatical back in 1996 and I have worked constantly,\" Grasso said, before rushing off the phone.\n\nUD Vice President for Finance and Deputy Treasurer Greg Oler signs UD's 990 forms, but would not comment on the compensation portion.\n\n\"Attracting and retaining the best talent is vital in helping our University and students thrive and grow,\" he said in a statement.\n\nPrivate dollars, not taxpayer funds, are used to pay executive compensation at UD, according to university spokeswoman Andrea Boyle. University leaders receiving post-employment payouts earned that money while they were still working at UD under the terms of their contracts, she said. State law doesn't cap how much top administrators can receive.\n\nThe Board of Trustees' special compensation committee, whose meetings aren't open to the public, sets compensation packages for key executives.\n\nThe committee relies on benchmark data from peer institutions and a third-party consultant who reviews proposed compensation for \"reasonableness,\" Boyle said. The IRS recommends a similar process to determine \"reasonable compensation\" at private universities, according to its website.\n\nUD trustee Joan Coker, a Wilmington doctor who has served on the board for three years, said the full board is not privy to executive contract negotiations. She declined to name the members of the compensation committee.\n\n\"Literally, this is the first time I've heard this,\" she said of the university's post-employment payouts.\n\nParting gifts common\n\nNationwide, universities like UD dangle exit perks to recruit the best and brightest managers, according to research by Finkelstein and his colleague, Judith Wilde, chief operating officer of George Mason's Schar School of Policy and Government.\n\nIn evaluating more than 100 employment contracts for university presidents, the pair found that 40 percent contained deferred compensation clauses, allowing executives to delay receiving a portion of their income, such as retirement benefits, until after they enter a lower tax bracket. The value of such arrangements ranges from $17,000 to $500,000, according to the study by Finkelstein and Wilde.\n\nSeventy percent of contracts gave university presidents a direct pipeline to tenured faculty positions, recouping most of their previous salaries even if they don't teach any classes, according to the researchers.\n\nNearly half of the contracts guaranteed presidents a year-long sabbatical at their full presidential salaries, while 13 percent offered contract completion bonuses of $50,000 to $1 million – unless the presidents were fired for cause, such as in cases of embezzlement or sexual harassment.\n\nEven when presidents are fired, they emerge as winners in severance agreements that protect colleges and universities from costly litigation. Last summer, for instance, outgoing Northern Illinois University President Doug Baker received a $700,000 package in a closed-door meeting with university trustees, after a state investigation detailed his mismanagement of the university.\n\nGolden parachute clauses written into university president contracts have been around for decades, just as private CEOs and college coaches continue to earn eye-popping rewards. Over the years, the perks have filtered down to other high-ranking university administrators like provosts and finance chiefs, Wilde said.\n\nMembers of the business elite, who populate university boards, are comfortable paying top dollar for talent to compete with private universities and the corporate sector. To that end, they sweeten contracts with allowances for housing, cars, entertainment and country club memberships, along with generous payments for unused sabbaticals and sick time that aren't available to faculty and other staff.\n\n\"If you add in all the extras, the contract could be twice [the base salary] or more,\" Wilde said.\n\nThe public City University of New York system, for instance, paid $19,500 a month to house its Chancellor James Milliken on the Upper East Side as part of his annual $670,000 compensation package. Milliken's rent in 2015 was roughly on par with an adjunct instructor's annual salary in the university system.\n\nOn the opposite coast, California has cracked down on executive compensation at public universities. In 2012, public outcry prompted the Board of Trustees of the California State University system to cap pay raises for new presidents at no more than 10 percent of their predecessor's earnings.\n\nIn 2015, the trustees barred the university system, which receives billions of dollars annually from taxpayers, from financing executive pay with foundation funds. The move came after a state audit revealed that university executives' salaries and benefits were significantly higher than those awarded to state employees with similar job functions.\n\nBut reining in executive compensation has real consequences, according to Raymond Cotton, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney who has negotiated compensation packages for hundreds of university presidents.\n\nIn an interview earlier this year, Cotton insisted that executive benefits prevent star academic talent from going elsewhere.\n\n\"In the business world, those people who bring substantial benefit get substantial pay,\" he said.\n\nCollege and university presidents have far-reaching responsibilities, including essential fundraising tasks. They also work in tumultuous, highly politicized environments. On average, chief executives at S&P 500 companies remain in their positions a decade or more, but university presidents typically leave before 7 years, according to a recent study by the American Council on Education.\n\nIRS records show that UD is not the only Delaware university to handsomely reward executives on their way out.\n\nSTORY: At Wilmington University, it's all in the family\n\nSTORY: University of Delaware Provost steps down for personal reasons\n\nThe last time the Chronicle of Higher Education published data on the highest-paid private university presidents for 2014, then-Wilmington University President Jack Varsalona led the pack with his more than $5.4 million compensation package. The bulk of that amount came from a one-time retirement bonus that Varsalona received after more than 25 years of service at the commuter school.\n\nMichael Townsley, Wilmington University's former senior vice president and chief financial officer, stopped working for the university in fiscal year 2002, but received more than $911,000 three years later as part of a supplemental retention and retirement plan, IRS forms show. Former Provost Betty Caffo, who retired in 2011, received more than $2.2 million the following calendar year, including $2 million in \"other compensation.\"\n\nLike UD, Wilmington University has declined to discuss its employment contracts.\n\nAt Goldey-Beacom College, which counts fewer than 3,000 students, former president Mohammad Ilyas earned nearly $1 million in retirement bonuses in 2015, bringing his total compensation that year to nearly $1.5 million.\n\nIlyas retired from the Wilmington college on June 30, 2015, but his compensation that year included accumulated sick time dating to 1975, Goldey-Beacom Executive Vice President Kristine Santomauro said. Goldey-Beacom's board of trustees has since nixed that policy and no longer automatically offers senior managers deferred compensation plans, she said.\n\nSantomauro declined to release current president Gary Wirt's contract, explaining that Goldey-Beacom is a private institution.\n\nDespite the secrecy surrounding lucrative top administrator contracts, universities aren't internationally trying to deceive the public, according to Finkelstein, the researcher. Federal tax forms \"only require you to report what an individual received in that year.\"\n\n\"The public isn't asking the right questions,\" he said.\n\nWhose legacy?\n\nRoselle, a mathematician credited with ushering in a renaissance at UD, also earned substantially more money than his predecessors.\n\nPast president E.A. Trabant, who served for more than two decades beginning in 1968, earned less than $121,000 in his final year, according to a 1991 News Journal article. Trabant's successor, Russel Jones, who served for less than two years, earned a nearly $138,000 salary. Following Jones, Trabant took over briefly before Roselle came on board.\n\nA former University of Kentucky president, Roselle was known as a soft-spoken straight-shooter who was fiercely protective of UD's national reputation. His name now graces the university's performing arts venue.\n\nWhile Roselle's $875,000 compensation package outshone those of presidents at institutions twice UD's size, he was praised for transforming the university into a respected and financially secure institution over his 17 years at the helm.\n\nRoselle nearly quadrupled the university's endowment to $1.2 billion, shepherded the construction or renovation of about two dozen buildings, and boosted endowed faculty positions, student study abroad opportunities and student aid programs.\n\nWhen Roselle retired in 2007, the university senior administration counted one provost, one executive vice president and six vice presidents at a cost of nearly $2.5 million, according to IRS forms.\n\nWhen Harker stepped down eight years later, UD had one provost, one deputy provost, one vice provost for research, one executive vice president and nine vice presidents at a cost of nearly $4.7 million.\n\nFormer UD employees said spiraling executive compensation under the Harker administration has dragged down the university since the recession, forcing UD to consolidate departments amid state budget cuts. In 1991, Delaware paid 24 percent of UD's budget, compared to half that percentage today.\n\nIn 2011, Harker, a former dean of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, asked the General Assembly to give UD more flexibility to spend state funds. He also sounded the alarm on layoffs.\n\n\"We have to put everything on the table right now,\" Harker told legislators at the time. \"If someone retires, will we fill that position? That's something we have to think about.\"\n\nFour years later, UD eliminated Joseph Filippone's job and four others in the Facilities Planning and Construction department after the department merged with the university architect's office.\n\nHarker \"ran the university like a business,\" according to Filippone, who said he earned a $47,000 salary working as a computer design technician. After 14 years of service, Filippone received nearly $8,000 upon his exit, which consisted of one month's salary and one month's worth of unused vacation time.\n\nAnother former employee, who requested anonymity, said she lost her job in 2008, along with 10 others in her division over the next two years, after the university's publications department merged with the public relations office.\n\n\"Everybody just got to the point that they were keeping their head down and crossing their fingers that they weren't on the list,\" the employee said.\n\nThrough a Fed spokeswoman, Harker declined an interview for this story, referring all questions to UD. During his tenure in a tough economy, he increased student diversity, built new residence halls and laid the foundation for the STAR (Science, Technology & Research) Campus on the site of the former Newark Chrysler plant.\n\nIn 2014, in addition to receiving more than $950,000 in salary and benefits from UD and its affiliates, Harker earned more than $500,000 serving on the boards at chemicals group Huntsman Corp. and power utility Pepco Holdings Inc., according to a Bloomberg News report.\n\nBoyle, the university spokeswoman, said she could not discuss layoffs in individual departments. UD may merge operations to \"reduce redundancy\" and boost efficiency in an effort to \"keep tuition cost at a reasonable level for our students,\" she said. The university counted more than 4,300 employees last year, an eight percent increase from 2007, according to UD statistics.\n\nFull-time faculty members at UD receive salaries and benefits above the national average, according to data from the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). Full professors, for instance, earn about $149,000 a year, while instructor-level faculty earn $72,000. The AAUP did not include data from part-time faculty members, the largest segment of the academic labor force.\n\nUD surpasses the national average in another area: Tuition and fees. In-state students pay $13,160, not including room and board, according to College Board data. Out-of-state students pay $33,150.\n\nOver the past decade, in-state tuition and fees at UD have increased by 61 percent, which is in line with the national average. Out-of-state students, however, saw a 71 percent increase, significantly higher than the national average. More than 60 percent of undergraduates at the Newark campus come from out of state.\n\nLast month, UD announced \"Delaware First,\" the largest-ever fundraising campaign in the centuries-old institution's history.\n\nThe $750 million fund drive will support student scholarships, endowed professorships, graduate fellowships, a $60 million transformation of the Delaware Stadium and a new building to house UD's public policy school and the Biden Institute, a domestic research and policy think tank.\n\nIn announcing the campaign, Assanis said that while the university appreciates its state funding and tuition dollars, it needs more money to make a difference globally.\n\n\"This is all about taking the University of Delaware to the next level,\" he said.\n\nContact Margie Fishman at 302-324-2882, on Twitter @MargieTrende or mfishman@delawareonline.com.\n\nWhere the money flows:\n\nFederal tax records dating to 2007 show that UD has distributed more than $6 million in payments to top administrators who have left their posts. Here are the highest earners:\n\nDavid Roselle\n\nServed: President from May, 1990 to July, 2007\n\nExit pay: Nearly $1.9 million\n\nDetails: Roselle's total compensation of about $875,000 in 2005 was the highest nationwide that year among public university presidents. The following year, his last full year at the helm, Roselle earned more than $2.45 million, the university's IRS forms show. He continued to receive annual compensation from UD through 2011. Roselle now serves as executive director of Winterthur Museum, Garden & Library. He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDavid Hollowell\n\nServed: January, 1988 to December, 2007, most recently as executive vice president and treasurer.\n\nExit pay: Nearly $1.1 million\n\nDetails: Hollowell earned nearly $651,000 in total compensation in 2006, which ballooned to more than $1.1 million during his final year. In 2008, when he was no longer employed by the university, he received nearly $1.1 million, according to IRS forms. He now serves as a commissioner and treasurer for the Middle States Commission on Higher Education in Philadelphia, which is chaired by Goldey-Beacom College President Gary Wirt. Hollowell could not be reached for comment.\n\nK.C. Keeler\n\nServed: Head football coach from March, 2002 to January, 2013\n\nExit pay: Nearly $2 million\n\nDetails: Keeler, who earned more than $300,000 annually, was under contract with UD through 2017. He was fired in January 2013, but received nearly $2 million from the university that year, including a $1 million \"severance payment\" listed on UD's Form 990. Now head football coach at Sam Houston State University, Keeler did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJennifer \"J.J.\" Davis\n\nServed: Vice president for finance and administration from November, 2008 to March, 2013\n\nExit pay: At least $454,000\n\nDetails: Davis left UD in early March of 2013, but still received more than $563,000 in total compensation from the university for the 2013 calendar year, including a more than $454,000 \"severance payment\" listed on UD's Form 990. Previously, Davis earned about $346,000 a year from UD. She now works as senior vice president for finance and administration for George Mason University in Virginia. Davis did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMark Stalnecker\n\nServed: Chief investment officer from October, 1999 to July, 2013\n\nExit pay: At least $107,000\n\nDetails: Stalnecker was among UD's highest-paid employees, earning nearly $367,000 in 2012, his last full year at the university. Stalnecker left midway through 2013 but still earned more than 80 percent of his 2012 compensation. Stalnecker earned a bonus of more than $107,000 that year \"for services rendered through the date of his retirement,\" according to UD's Form 990.\n\nPatrick Harker\n\nServed: President from July, 2007 to July, 2015\n\nExit pay: At least $400,000\n\nDetails: Harker stepped down from UD at the close of the 2014-15 academic year. During his final full year at the helm, he earned nearly $951,000, including nearly $144,000 in bonus compensation. In 2015, Harker earned nearly $817,000 from UD for working 55 hours a week, according to UD's Form 990 filed with the IRS, despite working for the university for only half the year. Harker left UD mid-year to become president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/06/28/many-worry-america-too-expensive-economy-inflation/70343618007/", "title": "Is America getting too expensive?

About 52% of Americans participating in a USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll said the United States is too expensive to live in. And about 7 in 10 Americans said stifling inflation and the economy are the nation's top problems today, according to a new Pew Center survey. A majority across age, gender and race told Pew that inflation is \"a very big problem.\"\n\n\"Their spending power has been minimized,\" said Gene Ludwig, former head of the Comptroller of the Currency, a U.S. Treasury Department bureau.\n\nAmerica's economic state is uncertain\n\nWhat's America’s economic state? Frustrating and uncertain. The typical American household spends about $768 more monthly on goods and services these days compared to 2020 because of high inflation, said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics.\n\nMeanwhile, as the United States skirts a recession, Zandi said some Americans seeking relief are also dipping into their savings for survival. Around 25 million Americans are behind on their credit card, auto loan or personal loan payments, according to a recent Moody’s/Equifax data analysis. Also, the delinquency rate for bank credit cards was 3.27% in May, nearly 2 points higher than in 2021, Zandi said.\n\n\"The economy is struggling due to these ongoing battles,\" said Zandi, who gave the U.S. economy a B-minus grade. \"If you ask the typical American, I think they feel uncomfortable. The good news is many people still have jobs and wage growth has been solid, but it's not enough to feel good about shelling out more money for basic needs.\"\n\nUS economy trying to find ‘better balance,’ economists estimate\n\nZandi's theories echo a Brookings study this month by former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernake and former International Money Fund chief economist Olivier Blanchard titled, \"What Caused the U.S. Pandemic-Era Inflation?\"\n\nThey wrote that the Fed and many forecasters didn't expect \"mismatches\" of a strong job market while the interest rate spiked. \"Together, these shocks to prices given wages would prove to be the critical triggers of the rise in inflation,\" the economists said. Bernake and Blanchard said lowering the current inflation rate of 4.05% to the Fed’s preferred 2% target requires a better balance.\n\nLudwig, the former comptroller, said the Fed has relied too long on inflation data such as the consumer price index to assess the impact of the nation's economy accurately.\n\n\"We have to find new tools to tame inflation because when you raise interest rates, those who get hurt the most are low- and middle-income Americans,\" Ludwig said. \"It’s disproportionately painful and unfair.\"\n\nFirst-time homeowners struggle to buy houses\n\nHousing demand remains high across the United States, but the market has cooled since the 2020 pandemic-prompted sales boom because of high 6% mortgage rates and inflation. As many Americans see homeownership as a traditional way to generate wealth, fears over banking industry instability, increasing job layoff concerns and a possible economic recession mean gridlock is growing from homebuyers reluctant to purchase and owners wary to sell.\n\nThrow in a low inventory of affordable homes, and the future looks bleak, especially for would-be first-time homeowners. Around 75% of Gen Xers, 80% of millennials, and 66% of Gen Zers advise against making a home purchase in these conditions, a survey from real estate company Truehold reveals.\n\n“The market is recalibrating,” said Bess Freedman, CEO of real estate firm Brown Harris Stevens in New York City. “We’re thirsty for housing.”\n\nConverting vacant offices, schools and malls into housing could be a possible solution, said Jessica Lautz, the National Association of Realtors' deputy chief economist. It’s still “a seller’s market,” as the ratio of first-time homebuyers is currently at a 41-year low, Lautz said.\n\nBrighter days ahead for the US economy?\n\nBetter economic days might be ahead. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose to 63.9% in June, compared to 59.2% in May, at the time the lowest level since November 2022.\n\nConsumer sentiment, which is how Americans feel about their finances and the economy and what businesses use to gauge their brands' impact, is also 28% above the historical low from a year ago and “its upward trajectory\" might climb, said Joanne Hsu, director of University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. Overall, \"sentiment remains low. A majority of consumers still expect difficult times in the economy over the next year,\" Hsu said.\n\nWhile Zandi doesn't expect a recession this year, Americans must still adjust to this new reality, he said. \"We need to become more price sensitive and look for bargains and deals,\" Zandi said. \"That’s when businesses become more conscious as you and I become more judicious and circumspect in their price increases.\"\n\nWhen Stinney’s rent spiked, she moved instead of giving up essentials like her car and phone, both needed to grab extra shifts in an already exhaustive 70-hour work week.\n\n“If my eyes are open, I’m usually working,” said Stinney, driving home from her airport job late Sunday.

The movement has a growing number of blogs devoted to it and a name that, while catchy, illustrates what happens when you come up with the acronym first: FIRE, or “financially independent retire early.”\n\nRecent research from the online broker TD Ameritrade found that, on average, millennials expect to retire when they are 56. That’s more than a decade earlier than what’s considered full retirement age by Social Security.\n\nIt’s a noble goal, but also a lofty one: If there’s one factor that can make or break your retirement plans, it’s the age at which you begin that coveted life stage. Here’s why.\n\nThe one-two punch of retiring early\n\nThe reason early retirement changes the game is twofold, says Cary Cates, a certified financial planner in Denton, Texas. “It reduces the time that you actually have to save money and receive compounded growth on that, and it increases the amount of time that the money has to last.”\n\nThe concept is fairly simple when you break it down: Let’s say you start saving at 25. If you retire at 56, you have 31 working years to save for retirement. (And that’s probably generous — the TD Ameritrade research found that respondents plan to start saving when they are 36, on average.) Assuming a life expectancy of 95, the money you save needs to last 39 years.\n\nMore:1-in-3 in US have less than $5,000 saved for retirement. Tips for not being one of them\n\nMore:A 'sell-by' date for employees? Fixing ageism and rethinking retirement in the workplace\n\nMore:Total return: Does your investment strategy in retirement need rethinking?\n\nCompare that with someone who retires at 67. That person would have 42 years to save, and would need that money to last 28 years.\n\nWhat that means: The saver who retires earlier needs to save more money in a shorter time. How much more? Consider a 25-year-old who earns $40,000 per year. Let’s say she wants to plan for a life expectancy of 95, and expects to earn an average annual return of 6 percent on her investments, with 2 percent salary increases per year.\n\nIf she wanted to retire at age 56, she’d have to save 27 percent of income — $883 per month. Retiring at the standard age of 67 means saving a more reasonable 16 percent of income, or $533 a month.\n\nWhat might surprise you: That 27 percent is actually quite low, thanks to this hypothetical saver’s young age. Someone who decides to embark on this early-retirement quest at age 35 would be in even more trouble, even if she already has quite a bit saved.\n\nUsing the same assumptions above, a 35-year-old who earns $60,000 and has $60,000 saved would still need to save 38 percent of income — $1,900 a month — to retire at age 56. That’s nearly twice what would be required if she planned to retire at the typical age of 67.\n\n(NerdWallet’s retirement calculator produced the above numbers — plug in your own information to see how much you should be saving based on your expected retirement age and other factors.)\n\nA lower standard of living helps make it possible\n\nOne thing that makes early retirement possible for those who aren’t scared away by these high savings rates: If you’re saving 30 percent or 40 percent of your income, you’re already accustomed to living on significantly less than you earn. That can make transitioning to a lower income in retirement more seamless.\n\n“The biggest problem with retiring early is not necessarily that people don’t save enough — it’s that over time, as they earn more, they expand their standard of living,” Cates says. “Saving big chunks of money forces you to live on less, and that’s what can make [early retirement] feasible.”\n\nEven so, it means a commitment to consistently live below your means so you can save a third or more of your salary.\n\nRetirement accounts are designed for a later retirement age\n\nOne more factor in the decision to knock off early: Whether you can access the money you’ve saved without paying extra penalties or taxes.\n\nMost retirement accounts levy a 10 percent penalty for distributions before age 59½. The major exception: Roth IRAs, which allow you to tap your contributions — but not investment earnings — at any time.\n\n» Learn more about Roth IRAs\n\nYou may also be able to tap money in your 401(k) without penalty if you leave your job — what the IRS calls separating from service — in or after the year you turn 55, Cary says.\n\nThat rule applies only to current 401(k) plans, however — if you still have money in an old employer plan and you weren’t 55 or older when you left that employer, you have to meet the 59½ age barrier to avoid an early distribution penalty. That means early retirees may want to roll old 401(k)s into their current 401(k) before retiring.\n\nAnd if this all sounds like a lot of rules to swim through on your way to Margaritaville?

In January, FISH provided food boxes to nearly 790 people.\n\nBut King and other food bank managers fear that demand will spike further in March, when officials roll back pandemic-era increases to SNAP benefits. The program, administered by the Department of Agriculture, provides monthly stipends to people with low incomes to spend on food. Before 2020, those payments averaged a little more than $200 and were hiked by a minimum of $95 during the pandemic.\n\nOfficials estimate families King works with will see a 30% to 40% decrease in SNAP payments as emergency allotments tied to the public health emergency halt in 32 states, including Nevada. Other states, such as Georgia, Indiana, Montana and South Dakota, have already ended the emergency allotments.\n\nThe cuts to SNAP benefits will uniquely hurt people living in rural America, said Andrew Cheyne, managing director of public policy for GRACE, a nonprofit run by the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul focused on reducing childhood hunger. A higher percentage of people depend on SNAP in rural areas compared with metro areas. And those areas already have higher rates of food insecurity and poverty.\n\n“We have so many households who simply aren’t going to know that this is happening,” Cheyne said. “They’re going to go to the grocery store and expect to have money in their account and not be able to buy the food they need to feed their families.”\n\nAnd as the fallout from those cuts hits, food pantry managers in rural areas find themselves on the front lines trying to fill gaps in their communities. They and food policy experts fear it won’t be enough. For every dollar worth of groceries a food bank distributes to a community, SNAP delivers $9.\n\n“There’s just no comparing the scale of SNAP to the charitable food sector,” Cheyne said. “It’s simply not possible to make up that difference.”\n\nEach household’s benefits will drop by at least $95 per month, with some households absorbing as much as a $250 reduction, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\n“There’s no way, that I see, that we’re ever going to make up fully for what’s being lost,” said Ellen Vollinger, SNAP director for the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger nonprofit in Washington, D.C.\n\nRELATED:As pandemic-era provisions lapse, millions of Americans to lose Medicaid\n\nThe cuts will reduce payments to households that receive assistance to an average of about $6 per person, per day, Vollinger said, adding that $2 per meal isn’t enough to feed a person, especially given other factors, like rising fuel, rent and grocery prices. Some older adults, she said, will see the most precipitous drop in benefits, going from $280 a month to $23.\n\nChasity Harris, 42, said the $519 in benefits she has received monthly since October makes a big difference for her and her granddaughter. Once the emergency allotment is cut, she said, she knows she can do what it takes to make sure there’s food on the table in her home but that doesn’t mean it’ll be easy.\n\n“You can’t eat healthy without having a nice little budget,” Harris said. “Bad food is cheap. Just because I can manage doesn’t mean I’m getting everything that we need. I’m buying the cheapest stuff.”\n\nA study published by the Urban Institute estimated that the SNAP emergency allotments helped more than 4 million people stay above the poverty line in late 2021. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic people saw the biggest reduction in poverty levels, according to the study.\n\nIn Montana, the expanded SNAP benefits were cut in summer 2021. Brent Weisgram, vice president and chief operating officer of the Montana Food Bank Network, said that reporting from the network’s partners shows a 24% increase in the number of households seeking assistance from emergency food pantries from July 2021 to July 2022.\n\nWeisgram said food pantries are not prepared to absorb the impact of the cut to the largest federal nutrition assistance program and are strictly a supplemental resource.\n\nFood banks nationwide are still coping with increased demand that began in 2020, Cheyne said. That lingering need from the pandemic, coupled with food price inflation, leaves food pantries less prepared for demand resulting from cuts to the SNAP emergency allotments.\n\nMORE:More Americans struggling to put food on the table after federal benefits end\n\nWhile the FISH food pantry has enough meat for families now, King said, she worries about whether it’ll be enough six months from now. On a scale of 1 to 10, King said, her level of concern regarding the consequences of the looming SNAP cuts is a 9.\n\nIf history is any indication, her concerns are valid.\n\nIn 2009, SNAP recipients received, on average, about 15% to 20% more in benefits as the federal government responded to the challenges of the Great Recession. A family of four received $80 more a month in benefits. In 2013, the government rolled the boosted benefits back, averaging a 7% cut for households. The effects were immediate and long-term, Cheyne said, including significant spikes in food insecurity and poverty-related hunger that lasted for nearly a decade.\n\nThe cuts this time around are much greater than in 2013 and there’s much less time for states to prepare, making it more difficult to ensure SNAP recipients are aware of the benefits they’re about to lose.\n\nWhile families and individuals are expected to turn elsewhere, like food banks, other aid organizations face challenges brought on by inflation and rising food costs.\n\nThe Food Bank of Northern Nevada, which helps supply food pantries in smaller communities, including FISH, has seen a drop in food donations during the past six months, said Jocelyn Lantrip, director of marketing and communications for the food bank. Staffers are “scrambling” to source and buy enough food to meet the expected increase in demand, she said.\n\nKing said the FISH food pantry will depend on donations because its grant dollars aren’t stretching as far as they used to because of inflation. But they’ll do everything they can to meet the needs of their community, which go far beyond food assistance. The food boxes are just a spoke on the wheel of services FISH and other food pantries provide, such as assistance with signing up for SNAP and other benefit programs, housing, and referrals to mental health providers.\n\nDespite the challenging road ahead for the small food pantry, King is hopeful.\n\n“I feel that everybody who has the power to help is doing everything they can to help us,” she said. “You just gotta look at your food and say, ‘OK, how long can I make this last and make a difference in someone’s life?’”\n\nKHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

Yet merchants say violent neighborhoods like West Center City, and a public perception that fails to distinguish between the city’s various neighborhoods, have created a public image of the city that does not match reality – particularly in the relatively tranquil shopping and entertainment district.\n\n“In larger cities like Philadelphia and New York, people recognize some areas are good and some are bad,” said Scott Morrison, owner of Chelsea Tavern and Ernest & Scott Taproom. “Maybe it’s because this city is small and everything is closer together, but everyone assumes Wilmington is just one, singular place and crime is everywhere. Market Street may only be a few blocks away from rougher areas like West Center City, but they are 100 percent worlds apart.”\n\nWilmington is Delaware's largest city and through its business-friendly tax laws, is an economic driver for the entire Mid-Atlantic region. The downtown area has benefited from those laws, creating a thriving environment for banks, law offices and support industries. A company planning a new stock exchange for small- and mid-sized businesses, the Delaware Board of Trade, also is in talks to occupy a downtown space.\n\nBut the business community has had to deal with an uptick in crime. City officials and business owners have undertaken several initiatives over the years aimed at making the Market Street corridor safe and attractive to shoppers, students and visitors. Still, public perception remains an issue.\n\n“My mom is really uncomfortable with me being in the city,” said Anna Sheeky, a 19-year-old Delaware College of Art and Design student from Claymont. “We had homicides almost every day for how long? I try not to spend too much time down here, and the latest I’ll stay is maybe 8 p.m.”\n\nBusiness and community leaders say they are now hoping a host of new investments in residential and commercial development will finally allow the business district to overcome the public image they say has long kept the area from flourishing.\n\n“Unfortunately perception is reality,” said Marty Hageman, executive director of Downtown Visions, a public-private partnership aimed at improving downtown. “For a long time, it’s felt like those two things haven’t matched on Market Street. But I think we’re reaching a critical mass that could finally change that perception to something positive.”\n\nBuilding for the future\n\nMuch of that hope is based around developer Buccini/Pollin Group’s $125 million investment between Fourth and Ninth streets that will create three apartment communities with a combined 390 units.\n\n“Nationally, more and more people are leaving their cars and commute behind to move back into cities for the exciting urban lifestyle,” said Mike Hare, senior vice president for Buccini/Pollin. \"Our hope with these projects is to create that elusive critical mass of people who will both live and play on Market Street. These are people who will stay beyond 5 p.m., shop at these downtown stores, eat and drink at the restaurants and bars and create a real 24/7 lifestyle in the new downtown.”\n\nMKT, shorthand for Market, is a combination of existing apartments and new high-end, loft-style units in three renovated buildings.\n\nThe first residents began moving into the 28 units at 608 Market St. in July, and only three vacancies remain. Located next to DCAD, the building is the first “ground-up apartment community on Market Street in over 50 years,” according to the developer.\n\nThe 46-unit building at 627 Market St. opened this fall. A former department store that most recently served as Delaware State University’s Wilmington Campus is about 20 percent leased. Another seven market-rate units are slated to follow at 829 Market St. next year.\n\nBuccini/Pollin will hold a ribbon cutting in January for its 76-unit Market Street Village apartments. The three-building community includes a redevelopment of the former WSFS headquarters at 838 Market St. into a mix of 37 market-rate and low-income units, 24 units at 839 Market St. above a Walgreens drugstore, and 15 units at the site of a former furniture store at 6 E. Third St.\n\nAnd starting next year, the developer plans to begin construction of a 230-unit apartment building called Residences at Midtown on the site of the former Midtown Garage at Ninth and Shipley streets.\n\nEach building will include its own security guards, but Hare said the residents moving into Buccini/Pollin’s new apartments are younger business professionals who do not share the same perception of crime held by previous generations.\n\nSurveys of those residents, he said, show that less than 1 percent identify crime as an issue of concern.\n\n“It’s not an obstacle at all for the people who want to live here,” he said. “They can see this is a safe neighborhood and they feel confident coming home at night.”\n\nAbdoul Hady, a software engineer for the health care company Anthem, moved to Buccini/Pollin’s The Residences at Rodney Square at 902 N. Market St. after living in Detroit.\n\n“That was a very bad area so I was looking for someplace secure and calm,” the 28-year-old said. “There are cops everywhere (on Market Street), but there’s not much to do. Everything closes by 6 p.m.”\n\nAn influx of new residents like Hady is helping to spur additional investment along Market Street that could help make the area more fun for the millennial crowd.\n\nRestauranteur Bryan Sikora, who opened La Fia Bakery + Market + Bistro at 421 N. Market St. in 2013 and this summer added the Mexican restaurant Cocina Lolo in The Renaissance Centre at 405 N. King St., is doubling down on the business district.\n\nHe spun out his bakery operation into Market Street Bread + Bagel, a new eatery that opened at 823 N. Market St., on Friday. Next month, he will open the doors to The Merchant Bar, which will serve up light bites and drinks across the street from La Fia.\n\n“We’re trying to bring some energy to this area, which is what it needs more than anything,” Sikora said. “With all the residential development going on, Market Street has an opportunity to become a real social experience. But people need to feel like there is more than one reason to be here and they need to feel safe.”\n\nMorrison, meanwhile, plans to launch 3 Doors Brewing Co., a microbrewery that also will serve barbeque and healthier lunch favorites, with the added luxury of curbside pick-up and delivery.\n\nThis spring, he’s also hoping to open a new beer garden near Chelsea Tavern at 821 N. Market St., where there is a walkway through to Shipley Street. The current building at 817 Market St. will be torn down as part of the Residences at Midtown project, opening room for Morrison’s 200-seat outdoor space.\n\n“I see Market Street right now as right at the beginning of this critical mass with new people moving in who are going to bring this great energy,” he said. “We’re getting in on the ground floor of that renaissance.”\n\nAn overdue reemergence\n\nThat change is long overdue, said Leonard Simon, owner of Wright and Simon, an 80-year-old men’s clothing store at 911 N. Market St.\n\n“I’ve got customers who say they don’t want to come visit me anymore because they’re worried about crime,” he said. “It’s perfectly safe, but if you’ve got a perception, you’ve got a problem and Wilmington has had a problem for years.”\n\nOnce a vibrant center of commerce filled with bustling restaurants and thriving businesses, Market Street would swell each afternoon as thousands of office workers hit the sidewalk to search out lunch and complete mid-day errands.\n\n“Back then, Market Street was a buzz of activity like you wouldn’t believe,” said Simon, who joined the family business in the mid-1960s. “In those days, my counters were lined with people, but it’s a different world today.”\n\nRiots in wake the Rev. Martin Luther King’s assassination in 1968, followed nine months of National Guard occupation, were a turning point for the city, business owners say.\n\nWhat had been a gradual population decline became a rapid exodus as Wilmington lost more than a tenth of its population per decade before reaching a low of 70,200 in 1980 – nearly 30 percent fewer people than four decades earlier.\n\nLarge corporations in downtown Wilmington also began opening offices closer to their workers in the suburbs, while shoppers there began heading to the Christiana Mall and other shopping centers rather than into the city.\n\n“There were something like 8,000 DuPonters in this town back when we started and now there are none,” Buckley said. “Plus corporate culture has changed over the years. People stay at their desks for lunch nowadays.”\n\nThinner crowds also means less businesses and more nuisance issues such as panhandling. And Buckely says there are too many “adults acting like junior high kids” along the downtown corridors.\n\nThose issues, on top of a near record number of shootings and murders in a city that already had been dubbed “Murder Town USA” by Newsweek a year earlier, is only fueling the perception that Market Street is dangerous.\n\nMark Fields, executive director of The Grand and the Playhouse at Rodney Square, said that has posed particularly difficult challenges for Market Street’s entertainment venues, which also include The DuPont Theatre and World Café Live.\n\n“We’re not affected by changes in downtown worker population, but we are affected by the perception issue,” he said. “Our response has been to up our game in attracting bigger name artists and casting our net over a larger geographic area so we’re dealing with a population who doesn’t have that perception.”\n\nIn just the last week, he noted, the two venues were able to bring more than 9,000 theater goers and music lovers to Market Street for a touring production of “Annie” and classical music performances by a trio of legendary musicians – violinist Itzhak Pearlman, cellist Evgeny Kissin and pianist Michance Maisky –– and by Celtic Woman with the Delaware Symphony Orchestra, for the 39th annual Grand Gala.\n\n“When people from Chester County, Delaware County or Philadelphia come down, they tell me they thought Wilmington was supposed to be this horrible place,” he said. “But they find everything is fine and they’re mystified by the perception, honestly.”\n\nBret Morris also is puzzled by attitudes regarding Market Street.\n\n“I’ve worked here my whole life and never once had an issue with crime,” said the owner A.R. Morris Jewelers at 802 Market St. “But we have customers who say they would rather shop at our Greenville location because they’re uncomfortable coming into the city. People say it’s just a perception, but the fact is most of us live our lives based on perceptions.”\n\nSafety in numbers\n\nThe commonly held belief that all of Wilmington is plagued by violent crime was closer to reality in the mid-1990s, according to Hageman.\n\n“Crime in the business district was real, particularly purse snatching, car break-ins, muggings and even the occasional strong armed robbery,” the retired Wilmington police detective said.\n\nConcerned that the city was losing its grip on downtown, Wilmington City Council created Downtown Visions and tasked the group with managing a new 70-block business improvement district.\n\nCommonly referred to as the BID, the special tax district funds Downtown Visions through an added levy on downtown property owners that today collects about $2 million a year. One of the first initiatives launched by Downtown Visions was the ambassadors program, which created a small army of full-time paid workers who today patrol the BID in their distinctive yellow jackets.\n\nAt a starting wage of $9.75 an hour, more than a dozen “cleaning ambassadors” pick up trash, remove graffiti and clean sidewalks. Another 35 “safety ambassadors” act as a mix between neighborhood watch and Walmart greeters by giving directions, answering questions, checking alleys and parking garages, and providing free escort to workers and students walking to their vehicles.\n\nDowntown Visions later bought 25 closed-circuit cameras to monitor the BID and donated them to city, along with a dedicated staff to monitor the feeds.\n\n“We have so many levels of safety downtown now,” said Wilmington Sgt. Harold Bozeman. “And those layers have led to an overall decrease in crime and the relatively safety of the area.”\n\nBozeman supervises the Downtown and Riverfront Patrol unit, which deploys eight officers throughout the city’s central business district 15 hours each weekday and eight hours on Saturdays. The unit was first formed after Mayor Dennis Williams took office in 2013 and doubled in size last year.\n\n“At the time, Mayor Williams was under a lot of pressure to stabilize the downtown because there were businesses leaving and threatening to leave,” Bozeman said.\n\n“It seems to have reversed the tide,” he said. “I think the people who live here and the small businesses here understand the progress we’ve made. A lot of the misperception comes from people who commute here … and the only time they spend here is during their workday.”\n\nA hill left to climb\n\nContrary to business owners’ claims, Market Street is not entirely crime free.\n\nBut it tends to be nuisance crime and low-level property thefts in the overnight hours, rather than the violence that grabs headlines elsewhere in the city, according to city police.\n\nThe 70-block downtown business district accounted for roughly 2.4 percent of drug crimes, 3.1 percent of aggravated assault cases, 3.1 percent of robberies, 3.4 percent of thefts and 5.5 percent of burglaries in the city through November, said department spokeswoman Sgt. Andrea Janvier.\n\nThe corridor, meanwhile, accounted for about 13 percent, of all cases involving disorderly conduct charges.\n\nThe commercial real estate company Jones Lang LaSalle reported in July that Wilmington’s central business district experiences 14-percent less crime than the citywide average and 46-percent less than the highest-scoring census tract in the city.\n\nThose statistics have done little to assuage fears among some of the city’s largest employers, some of whom have spoken out about crime encroaching on the business district.\n\nDelaware Supreme Court Chief Justice Leo E. Strine Jr. and others told The News Journal in January that out-of-town lawyers were being warned about wandering too far from their hotels. And a former general manager of the Sheraton Suites said in a 2014 public meeting that his business has trouble with handbags and cell phones being stolen. Richard Gessner, Delaware liaison at Capital One, complained to a meeting of state officials in 2014 that a senior associate had recently been mugged in broad daylight.\n\nWestover Capital Advisors and Fidelity Investments also each moved to Greenville in the last year amid reported concerns over public safety.\n\nSome also have questioned whether DuPont’s decision to relocate 800 to 1,000 employees out of the DuPont building to Chestnut Run near Greenville this summer was related to frustration with the city.\n\nDuPont spinoff The Chemours Co., which replaced its parent company in the DuPont building and is now in the process of finding a permanent central office, raised public safety as a key concern with city officials in October, just weeks after 27-year-old Thomas “Cannibal” Cottingham was stabbed to death in Rodney Square after stepping in to protect a young mother and her infant from a man wielding a knife.\n\n“That’s one of those seminal moments that make everyone stop and wonder what’s going on,” Buckley said of the murder. “And can you imagine what downtown would be like if Chemours left? That’s another 700 people who won’t be shopping downtown.”\n\nSeveral store owners said they are pleased to see new development along Market Street. But some questioned whether those new residents would be enough to take the place of business lost elsewhere.\n\n“All these buildings they’re trying to put up, who are they helping,” asked Wan Kim, owner of the hair care shop Crazy Discount at 611 N. Market St. “Who are they drawing in? They’re not drawing people for me. Maybe for the food joints and bars, but not me.”\n\nAn influx of residents along Market Street probably would not be a big boost for the Ninth Street Book Shop either, but Buckley remains hopeful.\n\n“Who knows, maybe people will start to see Market Street as a real destination,” he said. “And you have to be in favor of anything that might change the public perception and finally make this a vibrant area again.”\n\nContact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/11"}]}

There has always been a lot of great pizza in New York, likely more than in any city in the world, yet upstart Motorino was the first to become beloved so quickly so far from home. Why? Well it is delicious, but it is also consistent, and perhaps most importantly, the company lives up to its credo of being “a neighborhood pizzeria, whether in New York or Hong Kong.” Unlike many brands we have seen turn into chains, there are no food court locations, and each Motorino in its own way feels like the only one.\n\nThe vibe is that of a small, informal local restaurant like a true Italian trattoria, with the focus on pizza, plus creative and varied appetizers. It is sit down style with waiter service at small, white marble-topped tables close to one another, white tile walls, mirrors, lots of windows and marble counters for making pizza. There is a well-rounded menu with great non-pizza appetizer options, and the oven is the centerpiece. The pizza making, topping and cooking process is on display, very close up and personal. For example, New York’s Upper West Side location is one of many similarly sized restaurant and bar storefronts in a very competitive dining stretch of Columbus Avenue, and has just eight tables all with clear views of the large tile pizza oven occupying one corner of the small space. It’s unpretentious and warm, the kind of place where you think of going “for dinner” rather than “for pizza,” though its combination of small size and large-scale popularity can make for long waits to be seated. The restaurant doesn’t take reservations, so Motorino also offers takeout and delivery, and for this kind of pizza, it travels surprisingly well.\n\nGreat American Bites:Philadelphia's pilgrimage-worthy pizzeria\n\nMany of the famed New York City pizza temples this column has visited in years past, including John’s of Bleecker Street and Di Fara, have become full-time tourist spots (while still serving great food) with lines out the door before opening and nary a local in sight. Motorino bridges that gap — a destination pizzeria that still caters to regulars, and if you don’t care to wait, you can always carry out.\n\nReason to visit: Pizza\n\nThe food: The pizza is obviously the main attraction here and the first bite is surprising. Despite the showcase high-temperature, wood-burning oven, charred edges with black spots, and apparent similarities to dozens of nouveau Neapolitan-style pizzerias around the world, this is different. The pizza is not crispy at all, with a uniquely doughy, airy, pleasantly chewy and very tasty crust. It is not for extra crispy thin crust lovers, and it may well be this difference that has set Motorino apart and fueled its growth. The topping ingredients are first rate, nothing tastes processed, with fresh real cheeses including fior de latte and real Buffalo mozzarella, imported San Benedetto anchovies, fresh veggies with interesting options like Brussels sprouts and baby kale, and artisanal meats — great soppressata and smoked pancetta. The result is gourmet but still approachable, the kind of pizza you might make at home if you were a good cook and chose excellent ingredients — delicious, but not quite the earth moving, hard to believe it’s so good experience we’ve had at the world’s best pizza spots like Arizona’s Pizzeria Bianco.\n\nBesides starters, the menu is all pizza, divided into two categories, red and white, with the former including the true classic styles, marinara and margherita, along with more typically topped creations featuring meatballs, sausage and salami. The whites are more inventive, with options including fresh cherrystone clams, kale, Brussels sprouts, anchovies and more, and the division is well thought out to let the flavors that are better on their own shine without red sauce, while those the tomato flavor complements are used well. You can construct your own, but if you simply choose whichever house specialty suits your tastes, you will not be disappointed, as all have the great crust and top-notch flavorful toppings.\n\nGreat American Bites:Michael Schwartz's Miami pizzeria is a must-try\n\nThe appetizers are strong, and I love the beet salad, not really a salad at all in the green sense, but rather mostly roasted beets with soft boiled egg, delicious anchovies and a few olives -- really well-balanced flavors. The meatballs are very good, not quite great, but well worth having if you like the heartier, more substantial style, not the fall apart tender take on this beloved comfort food. There certainly will be a next visit because this is standout pizza even by lofty New York standards.\n\nThere is a small but well curated and affordable all-Italian wine list, an usual small slate of craft beers alongside blasé Italian lagers Peroni and Moretti, and an odd mix of soft drinks including Italian classics aranciata and limonata along with Mexican Coca-Cola products and craft root beers. It’s as if Motorino can’t really choose between its Brooklyn hipster roots or Old-World inspiration across the board from the wood oven-roasted chicken wings to baby kale to drinks, and has it both ways. The good news is that it all works.\n\nPilgrimage-worthy?: Almost and should be a stop on a pizza junkies tour of the Big Apple.\n\nRating: Yum-Plus!

That's not to mention Rihanna's halftime show or the pregame performances from Chris Stapleton, Babyface and Sheryl Lee Ralph.\n\nHere's a recap of celebrity sightings, fan events, autograph signings, concerts, parties — all the biggest moments before, and during, the big game.\n\nSuper Bowl in Arizona 2023: Updates on traffic, weather, restrictions\n\nTravis Kelce is ready to party after the trophy ceremony\n\nWell done, whoever plays music over the public-address system at State Farm Stadium.\n\nLiterally.\n\nDuring the trophy ceremony immediately following the thrilling game, in which the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35 with a field goal in the final seconds, Travis Kelce did what he does from the on-field stage: Screamed, \"You gotta fight! For your right!\"\n\nAnd then he let the Chiefs fans finish, \"TO PARRRRRRTTTTY!\"\n\nWhich they did, screaming with delight. And immediately the stadium speakers blasted \"Fight for Your Right\" by the Beastie Boys.\n\nRock on.\n\nSuper Bowl 57 comes to a dramatic end\n\nThe tension inside State Farm Stadium was incredible — as was the noise.\n\nNo surprise, since these are two of the loudest fan bases in the NFL. They went back and forth through the second half till Kansas City kicked a field goal with 11 seconds left to go up 38-35.\n\nIt was a wild end to a wild day. Which made it kind of perfect.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nPregnant and stunning in red: Rihanna crushed the Super Bowl 2023 halftime show\n\nAfter party: 7 Westgate restaurant and bars offer late hours on Super Bowl Sunday\n\nWhether you celebrating your team's win or looking for a pick-me-up if they didn't, you won't need to go far for a post-game drink.\n\nSeven restaurants and bars near the stadium at Westgate Entertainment District are staying open late after the game. Karaoke, check; food, check; drinks, check; pool, check.\n\nHere are seven restaurants and bars with extended hours on game day.\n\n— Bahar Anooshahr\n\nAfter a powerhouse Super Bowl performance, everyone wants to know: Is Rihanna pregnant again?\n\nAt around 6:28 p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 12, the yearslong Rihanna drought came to an end.\n\nAmid the excitement surrounding hearing her perform classics like \"Umbrella,” there was rampant speculation on social media about whether Rihanna is pregnant again nine months after giving birth to her first son. Some posts were more tactful than others.\n\nThe NFL shared footage of A$AP Rocky enjoying Rihanna’s performance and some millennials drew parallels between Rihanna’s backup dancers’ outfits and the 2008 Disney film ‘Minutemen.’\n\nA representative for Rihanna confirmed that she is indeed expecting her next child, making her Super Bowl performance possibly the biggest pregnancy reveal ever.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nRihanna reasserts her pop music dominance at her halftime show\n\nWe’ve all been wondering who Rihanna might bring out to join her in the spotlight when she took the world’s biggest stage at State Farm Stadium for the Super Bowl 2023 halftime show and … surprise.\n\nShe got along just fine without a single cameo.\n\nRihanna made her entrance on a floating platform high above the field, rocking a stylish red jumpsuit and matching latex bustier singing “Bitch Better Have My Money,” seamlessly working her way through a dizzying celebration of her catalog that put the focus squarely on her most iconic hits, from “Umbrella” to “Work.”\n\nShe hasn’t toured since late 2016 and this halftime show more than lived up to the promise of a world-class performer reasserting her place in the pop music stratosphere.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nRihanna's Super Bowl 2023 playlist: Here's every song from her halftime show performance\n\nOne fan paid over $30K for her seat. Was it worth it?\n\nLiz Foster had the best seat in the house for Super Bowl 57, between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAnd she’s a Cincinnati Bengals fan. She and her husband Bill bought the tickets before the AFC Championship, in which the Chiefs beat Cincinnati.\n\n“We were just hoping the Bengals would be here so we planned ahead,” Foster said. “We were putting out good vibes.”\n\nThey were also putting out good money — Foster wouldn’t come clean on exactly how much they spent, but she hinted at it — “30-ish,” she said.\n\nAs in $30,000?\n\n“Plus some.”\n\nPlus how much? Foster wasn’t saying. But even without her favorite team playing in the game, she said a backup plan:\n\n“I’m here for Rihanna.”\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nFan zone:The best seat at Super Bowl 2023 cost her $30,000 (plus some). And she's a Bengals fan\n\nFans at the Hance Park watch party aren't just blown away by Rihanna\n\nIt's getting a bit rough in downtown Phoenix for us mere mortals who didn't make it inside State Farm Stadium in Glendale.\n\nThe winds are whipping around Margaret T. Hance Park, where the official NFL watch party is underway at the Super Bowl Experience. According to the National Weather Service, the wind is blowing west at more than 20 mph, kicking up dead grass and the few leaves left on the trees.\n\nThat hasn't tamped down the excitement at the park, where it's been difficult — if at all possible — to navigate from one side to the other because the crowd in front of the stage is just that dense.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nAre you ready for Rihanna?\n\nThe Super Bowl has rarely had a more anticipated halftime show.\n\nRihanna, one of the most successful pop sensations of the century, is making her return to live performance for the first time since 2018, when she did the Grammys. It's been even longer since she’s toured.\n\nWe spoke to several members of the team that helped her put this show together and they promised us \"It's nothing like you've ever seen before.” Her music director added, “Trust me, this is my fourth Super Bowl halftime. And I must say, Rihanna has pushed the bar.\"\n\nThe singer herself is promising a “jam-packed ... celebration of my catalog in the best way that we could have put it together.\"\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nAdele at State Farm Stadium for the Super Bowl: 'I'm going just for Rihanna'\n\nAdele is cheering for Team Rihanna at Super Bowl 2023 in Glendale, just like she promised.\n\nThe British singer — who can always be counted on for a good reaction meme — was spotted in a box at State Farm Stadium on Sunday. Just over a week earlier, she told the crowd at one of her Las Vegas residency shows that she's \"going just for Rihanna.\"\n\nHopefully there will be some cameras pointed her way during the halftime show performance.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nChris Stapleton spared us the all-too-common national anthem showboating\n\nIs Chris Stapleton “only the best voice in the world,” as Babyface suggested at a press conference in downtown Phoenix Thursday morning?\n\nTo be fair, few singers could hope to live up to that level of hype. But Stapleton does have a wonderful voice, as anyone at all familiar with the Grammy-winning country singer’s catalog would surely testify.\n\nAnd he used it to brilliant effect at State Farm Stadium without making it feel like he was out there to impress us with a show of vocal pyrotechnics.\n\nIt was more about the song itself, which as Stapleton said, can go horribly wrong. But this one didn’t.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nReview:Chris Stapleton's deeply soulful Super Bowl national anthem, plus Sheryl Lee Ralph, Babyface\n\nSheryl Lee Ralph delivers a monumental ‘Lift Every Voice and Sing’\n\nSheryl Lee Ralph, the Emmy-winning star of “Abbott Elementary,” got the pregame entertainment off to a breathtaking start with her version of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the Black national anthem, looking powerful in a flowing, off-the-shoulder red gown and matching gloves.\n\nAt Thursday’s pregame press conference in Phoenix, Ralph said her goal was “to make sure we could have a version for people to understand the great lyrics of this song and what it means.”\n\nAnd that’s exactly how it went, a life-affirming testament to the deep meaning of the lyrics, well served by Ralph’s Broadway experience. If you didn’t understand those lyrics, you weren’t listening. — Ed Masley\n\nHere's what to expect in 2023:How long does the Super Bowl national anthem take?\n\nHow to watch Chris Stapleton sing the national anthem at Super Bowl 2023\n\nCountry superstar Chris Stapleton will sing the national anthem just before Super Bowl 2023 kicks off at 4:30 p.m. Sunday at State Farm Stadium.\n\nHe’ll be joined in the pregame ceremonies by Babyface, who will sing “America the Beautiful,” and Sheryl Lee Ralph, of “Abbot Elementary,” who will sing “Lift Every Voice and Sing.”\n\nEach song will be performed in American Sign Language as well, by Arizona native Troy Kotsur, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for “Coda”; Colin Denny, a member of the Navajo Nation in Arizona; and Justina Miles.\n\nHere’s everything to know about today’s national anthem, including how long it might last.\n\n— Jill Cassidy\n\nSuper Bowl pregame: Sheryl Crow soaks up the sun, suggests new footwear for Patrick Mahomes\n\nSheryl Crow was midway through a hit-filled concert at the On Location tailgate party outside State Farm Stadium when she took a moment to reflect on her footwear — spectacular studded black open-toed clogs with heels that had to be at least 4 inches high.\n\n“All I’m saying,” she said, “is I think Patrick Mahomes should have to run in these shoes.”\n\nThat would definitely be a game changer.\n\nCrow and her band took the stage to a raucous recording of the Rolling Stones’ “Start Me Up” — a bold move, to be sure, and a handy frame of reference for the brand of rock ‘n’ roll that has underscored her finest hours from the start.\n\nAfter setting the tone with “If It Makes You Happy,” Crow proceeded through such classics as “A Change Will Do You Good,” the decidedly Stonesy “My Favorite Mistake” (which always makes me think of “Goats Head Soup”), her stellar cover of Cat Stevens’ “The First Cut Is the Deepest,” “Soak Up the Sun,” her breakthrough single “All I Wanna Do” and “Every Day Is a Winding Road.”\n\n“Can you believe this weather?!” she asked. “It’s supposed to be snowing in Nashville today. I’m just really happy to be here, if nothing else to give myself a killer suntan.”\n\nShe also took a moment to note another cause to celebrate this weekend.\n\n“Yesterday was my birthday,” she said. “I’m 38 again.”\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nThe downtown Phoenix Super Bowl action has moved to Hance Park\n\nThe Super Bowl Experience at Phoenix Convention Center is officially over, and the NFL fans who have swarmed downtown Phoenix for the past week moved north to Margaret T. Hance Park for the free Super Bowl Experience fan event.\n\nThat’s where the NFL’s first ever official Super Bowl watch party is taking place on what officials claimed were the largest LED screens in Arizona. An hour and a half before kickoff, the bar scene near the Convention Center was subdued, with a smattering of patrons at venues such as Majerle’s Sports Grill and Barrel and Bushel.\n\nThe real fans — sorry, not sorry — were at Hance Park, biding their time by completing the QB obstacle course, playing corn hole and enjoying local food and drinks.\n\nThe lines for the bars, craft beer and portable toilets were manageable with an hour to go before kickoff. Visitors were eager to get their hands on some food; lines for the vendors on the north side of Hance Park far surpassed the shorter ones on the south side.\n\nBut the majority of fans were staked out in front of the screens, braving the full sun exposure (my weather app showed it was 76 degrees) as they sat on blankets and folding chairs.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nHance Park dining guide:What to eat and drink at the 2023 Super Bowl Experience\n\nWhat channel is the Super Bowl on? How to watch\n\nWondering how to watch Super Bowl 57 between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles?\n\nThe short answer is that the game airs on Fox this year. The game is scheduled to begin at 4:30 p.m. Arizona time. Here’s how to watch or stream Super Bowl 2023.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nSeriously, what is up with Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly?\n\nOne moment we're speculating about whether Machine Gun Kelly actually got electrocuted while performing at the WM Phoenix Open's Birds Nest in Scottsdale on Friday.\n\nThe latest mystery now is whether he and Megan Fox are still engaged.\n\nThis Super Bowl Sunday — the morning after MGK headlined SI the Party with The Chainsmokers at Talking Stick Resort and two days after the couple attended the h.wood Homecoming event in Scottsdale — Fox sparked rumors that the couple, who have been engaged for over a year, are on the rocks.\n\nAccording to reports, she shared an Instagram post that included a clip of a burning letter with the Beyonce lyrics \"You can taste the dishonesty / it’s all over your breath\" in the caption. Then she reportedly removed all her photos with MGK and unfollowed everyone except Harry Styles, Timothée Chalamet and Eminem.\n\nShe has since appeared to have deactivated her Instagram.\n\nOnly time will tell what this development actually means.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nRihanna, Dave Grohl, Paris Hilton:Celebrities spotted in Phoenix for Super Bowl 2023\n\nSibling rivalry at Super Bowl 57\n\nCornell and Darlene Brooks are siblings who may agree on some things, but football isn't one of them. Though the pair are attending Super Bowl 57 at State Farm Stadium together.\n\nCornell, from Chicago, wore a Kansas City Chiefs jersey. Darlene, from coastal Mississippi, wore a Philadelphia Eagles jersey.\n\n“She doesn’t know what she’s doing,” Cornell said of his sister. “She’s starting to get on my nerves.”\n\nFor her part, Darlene responded with an eye roll. Nothing like sibling rivalry.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nA peek inside the swag bags for premium seat ticketholders\n\nAs if great seats weren’t enough, fans sitting in the best seats in State Farm Stadium had a cooler full of snacks waiting for them.\n\nZachary Ginsberg of Scottsdale was one such fan. He was sitting with his father, who got the tickets.\n\n“I’m a plus-one,” Zachary said.\n\nInside the collapsible cooler was a Twix candy bar, almonds, Skittles, Doritos and … condiments.\n\nWhy condiments?\n\n“You can never have enough mustard and ketchup,” Zachary said. Fair enough.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nSuper Bowl announcers walk the field at State Farm Stadium\n\nThe NFL on Fox crew set up on the field just outside the Kansas City Chiefs endzone. Meanwhile, announcers Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen walked the field, chatting with players and surveying the scene.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nDon't let Tom Brady make it his last:Greg Olsen is about to call his first Super Bowl\n\nSuper Bowl 57 is all about sponsorships\n\nEverything is sponsored at Super Bowl 57. Even the pop-up store in State Farm Stadium. It’s open for Arizona Cardinals games all season long, but Sunday its stock was limited to Frito Lay and Anheuser-Busch. So if you wanted Lay's potato chips or Bud Light, this is the place for you.\n\nOn the other hand, what else do you really need?\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nOh, it’s on: Puppy Bowl is happening now.

In the noon hour more than a mile from State Farm Stadium in Glendale, as traffic crept by at a pace no snail would envy, a woman was holding a bright green poster advertising parking on her street for $80. By 12:30 p.m., hundreds of people were trudging down the street in a line toward the stadium.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nPlan ahead: Super Bowl travelers should allow extra time when returning rental cars to Sky Harbor Airport\n\nAt least 180,000 passengers were expected at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on the Monday after the Super Bowl. That's about 60,000 more people than an average day.\n\nThousands of those people will be returning cars to the Rental Car Center. If you’re one of them, allow yourself ample time to drop off your car and ride the PHX Sky Train to your terminal. Airport staff recommends Super Bowl travelers allow at least four hours before departure to return car rentals.\n\nThe Rental Car Center is at 1805 E. Sky Harbor Circle South, south of Buckeye Road. It's accessible via exit 149 off Interstate 10. It’s roughly 2 miles from Terminal 3 and Terminal 4.\n\nHere are more tips on how to navigate Sky Harbor Airport after the Super Bowl.\n\n— Michael Salerno\n\nWhat to expect from Rihanna's halftime show, in her own words\n\nIn the event that you’re wondering what to expect from Rihanna when she hits the stage at State Farm Stadium, she shed some light on that in downtown Phoenix on Thursday, promising “a jam-packed show.” Her biggest challenge was \"trying to cram 17 years of work into 13 minutes,\" she said.\n\n\"That was the hardest, hardest part, deciding how to maximize 13 minutes, but also celebrate. That’s what this show is gonna be — a celebration of my catalog in the best way that we could have put it together.\"\n\nHere’s hoping she checked out our countdown of her greatest songs before she made the final edit to that setlist. For more on what she had to say about the road to State Farm Stadium and where her music might be headed when the game is over, here’s a link for more Rihanna in her own words.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nFans can try a taste of Arizona at State Farm Stadium on Sunday\n\nLola's Tacos owner Lola Olivares said she's excited to introduce authentic Mexican food to football fans flying in from Philadelphia and Kansas City on game day. In addition to the food trucks selling local fare in front of the stadium, she is one of several vendors offering a taste of Arizona inside State Farm Stadium.\n\n\"It's a huge honor,\" Olivares said. \"I keep pinching myself, like, is this for real?

Been a long time since I’ve been home….”\n\nThe answers range from the genuinely helpful — Coach House in Scottsdale comes up, which is an excellent choice, as is Arizona Wilderness — to the funny.\n\n“There are no bars in Scottsdale,” one person responded. “It’s a dry county now. Sorry.”\n\nKimes replied, “About a million people are in for a big surprise next week.”\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nA Scottsdale vintage boutique gets into the Rihanna spirit\n\nWhat is Super Bowl 57 if not a Rihanna concert bookended by a football game?\n\nVintage by Misty seems to agree.

With her Fuel Up to Play 60 Team, Julia volunteers and helps others learn strategies to stay healthy and be physically active for at least 60 minutes a day.\n\n“She participated in a breakfast cookoff with her classmates to show other students what a healthy breakfast that includes dairy looks like and continuously helps to host fun runs at her school throughout the year to show how physical activity can be enjoyable.

The state is projected to make hundreds of millions of dollars off of Super Bowl 57, but at what cost?\n\nThis week on The Gaggle hosts Ron Hansen and Mary Jo Pitzl are joined by Arizona Republic reporter Corina Vanek and associate professor of finance Dr. Ryan Brewer to dissect the costs and answer the question: is it worth it to host the Super Bowl?\n\n— Amanda Luberto\n\nTostitos is opening a pop-up restaurant in downtown Phoenix\n\nIn celebration of Super Bowl 57, Tostitos is opening a pop-up restaurant in downtown Phoenix called Tost by Tostitos.

No one ever broke any substantial news at an event like this, but it’s still fun.\n\nFor Burkhardt and Olsen, seated on a stage, reporters and camera crews waited in line for a brief audience, kind of like what you’d see at a wedding reception. Or a visitation before a funeral.\n\nSideline reporter Erin Andrews was up there, too, along with Richie Zyontz, who will produce the TV broadcast.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nThese Arizona creatives made exclusive Super Bowl collections.

Cashing in on instant gratification, many — though not all — companies now release commercials before the game. Adweek magazine is compiling them on a site as they’re released. Some big ones, too, like Alicia Silverstone reprising her Cher role from “Clueless” for Rakuten. Or Jon Hamm and Brie Larson for Hellmann’s mayonnaise. Ham and cheese, get it?

But there’s something especially special about their appearance Friday, Feb. 10, at Footprint Center, where they’re scheduled to headline the second day of the Bud Light Super Bowl Music Fest. It’s the band’s first concert of the new year – a fact they found relevant enough to share in a Facebook post that ended with: “We can’t wait to see you all again.” They’ve been off the road since mid-November, when they played a two-night stand at Madison Square Garden.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nWhere are the Chiefs and Eagles staying? These swanky hotels\n\nAhead of Super Bowl 2023, the Kansas City Chiefs are staying at the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Gainey Ranch on Doubletree Ranch Road in Scottsdale. With the McDowell Mountains as a backdrop, the resort has a spa and fitness center, an adults-only pool with a bar and a water park with a three-story water slide and a sandy beach. Among the restaurant options are six-seat Noh for sushi and sashimi and SWB, a Southwest Bistro, with wood-fired ovens and an open kitchen.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are staying at the Sheraton Grand at Wild Horse Pass on the Gila River Indian Reservation just south of Phoenix. The design of the hotel reflects the history and culture of the Pima (Akimel O'otham) and Maricopa (Pee Posh) tribes. The menu at the award-winning Kai restaurant changes frequently and incorporates Indigenous and traditional ingredients. The resort includes four pools, golf, tennis and an equestrian center, plus kayaking, paddleboarding and boat rides on a 2.5-mile river.\n\n— Jill Cassidy\n\nIs Kevin Jonas rooting for the Chiefs or Eagles?\n\nThe Republic caught up with the eldest of the Jonas Brothers, Kevin, who was in Glendale to unveil Courtyard by Marriott’s sleepover suite inside State Farm Stadium.\n\nJonas recently celebrated his legacy being cemented on a Hollywood Walk of Fame star — an emotional event, he said — with his brothers, family members and bandmates. The band is also releasing their sixth studio album, “The Album,” on May 5. He calls it “the best body of work, in my opinion, we've ever put together.”\n\nThough he was unsure whether he and his family would be in town for the Super Bowl, he did have a take on whom he’d like to see win the Lombardi Trophy on Feb. 12.\n\n“I’m gonna have to go with the Kansas City Chiefs because I’m a Giants fan and can’t pick the Eagles,” Jonas said. “Our good friend Pat Mahomes, you know, he’s our boy.

Far too many, a lot of us will grumble. But for better or worse, what makes a restaurant beloved sometimes has more to do with feeling than flavor, a memory rather than Michelin star.\n\nThe first White Castle in Arizona inspired one Gilbert resident to camp overnight for sliders in honor of his late father. Another local woman spent her Christmas waiting outside Arizona's first Jollibee, driven by nostalgia for celebrations past at this Filipino fast-food joint.\n\nDespite the abundance of regional American and international chains in metro Phoenix, there are still a few we can't enjoy without a drive or flight out of state. These are the 13 restaurant chains we don't have in Phoenix but wish we did.\n\nKolaches: This Phoenix drive-thru is selling Texas' best gas station food\n\nWawa\n\nThe first restaurant on this list is actually a convenience store that happens to sell made-to-order food. Wawa opened its first shop in 1964 in Folsom, Pennsylvania. While it may look like any regular ol' convenience store, Wawa has captured a cult following \"I can’t remember the last time I had communion, but whenever I go home, I seek out the touchscreen sacrament of the Wawa hoagie,\" wrote Meghan McCarron for Eater. Wawa has inspired a Spotify playlist, become a hangout spot for suburban teenagers and sparked a passionate rivalry with Sheetz, another regional convenience store. The Gobbler, a hoagie made of Turkey and Thanksgiving sides, is a fan favorite.\n\nDin Tai Fung\n\nTwenty years ago Taiwanese franchise Din Tai Fung opened its first U.S. dumpling parlor in Los Angeles. It's known for its xiao long bao, also known as soup dumplings because of its hot broth filling. Making xiao long bao is a time-consuming and demanding task, but Din Tai Fung has perfected two varieties of their tender, hand-folded dumplings: Kurobuta pork and Kurobuta pork with blue crab and snow crab. The restaurant has opened an outpost in Las Vegas, so we can only hope that the dumpling franchise will continue to make its way to Arizona.\n\nHappy Bao's:Lamb dumplings bring Welsh family an unexpected taste of home\n\nNando's\n\nFounded in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1987, Nando's is known for its flame-grilled peri-peri chicken. Peri-peri chilies are a spicy pepper Portuguese explorers introduced to southern African territories and the chicken at Nando's is marinated in a piquant pepper sauce, served with sides such as Portuguese rice with turmeric and peppers and Macho Peas, a mash of whole peas, parsley, mint and chile. The multinational chain has expanded to locations on the East Coast and in the Midwest. Considering how many Midwestern transplants we have in Phoenix, we're left wondering, why not here?\n\nTacodeli\n\nTacos come in many varieties influenced by regional styles. We think it's safe to say Phoenix has nailed it in a lot of ways — from Sabor a Mi's quesabirria with chile-infused consomé to Ta' Carbon's carne asada plunked on thin, chewy flour tortillas. That said, it wouldn't hurt to add a little Tex-Mex to the Valley mix. Tacodeli is an Austin institution co-founded by Roberto Espinosa, who grew up in Mexico City and attended The University of Texas at Austin. Tacodeli is perhaps best known for its breakfast tacos and Texas Monthly's taco editor José R. Ralat has given one of them, The Otto, multiple shoutouts. The Dallas branches are already using Sonoran-style flour tortillas, so a crossover to Arizona doesn't seem so far out of reach.\n\nFlour tortilla power:3 must-try burritos at Mexican restaurants in metro Phoenix\n\nZippy's\n\nHomesick islanders might tell you: Zippy's is the restaurant embodiment of Hawai‘i. The chain was founded in 1966 in Honolulu and serves a fusion of Japanese, Chinese, Okinawan, Korean and Hawaiian foods, plus American fast food. Zippy's is the kind of place where you and your friends can sit down over burgers, sushi, Korean fried chicken and noodles stir-fried with Spam, fish cake and green onions. Zippy's has an entire menu section dedicated to their chili, which features Portuguese sausage. The diversity of the menu reflects the state's multi-ethnic population and immigration history. That's a vibe we think would fit right in here in the Valley.\n\n'That aloha feeling':Mesa mom-and-pop shop serves island food and snacks\n\nTim Hortons\n\nNot familiar with Tim Hortons? Think Dunkin' Donuts gone Canadian. The eponymous doughnut and coffee chain was founded by professional hockey legend Miles G. \"Tim\" Horton in Hamilton, Ontario in 1964. The first franchised location opened in 1967 and Tim Hortons has since become the largest quick-service restaurant chain in Canada. Timbits, bite-sized doughnut holes, are a childhood favorite for many Canadians. Look for them in the trailer for \"Turning Red,\" a 2022 Pixar movie set in Toronto. And we'll keep an eye out for signs that the chain is coming south.\n\nBarcelona Wine Bar\n\nPhoenix-area oenophiles may point to Postino, owned by homegrown restaurant group Upward Projects, as a go-to for interesting and affordable wines. But the existence of a well-loved five-before-five (that's Postino's daily $5 glasses of wine before 5 p.m.) doesn't mean there isn't room in town for Barcelona Wine Bar, a national chain of Wine Spectator award-winning bars with a critically acclaimed selection of Spanish tapas to boot. Originally started in Connecticut more than two decades ago by Sasa Mahr-Batuz and Andy Pforzheimer, the chain has since grown to include locations across the country.\n\nYour couch is calling:Here's a guide to the best Trader Joe's wine and snack pairings\n\nLongtime Phoenix residents may remember Fazoli's, which at one time had a dozen locations around the Valley. But it's been more than a decade since diners could gorge themselves on the restaurant's signature unlimited breadsticks. Founded by multi-brand restaurant group Jerrico, Inc. in Lexington, Kentucky in 1988, Fazoli's positioned itself between brands like Chipotle and McDonald's, aiming to deliver affordable Italian American comfort food for under $10 an entree. Fazoli's, if you're listening, Phoenix misses you!\n\nBojangles\n\nFried chicken and biscuits are the specialties of this Southern restaurant chain that was founded in 1977 in Charlotte, North Carolina. The restaurant is known for Cajun-seasoned fried chicken, scratch-made buttermilk biscuits and sweet tea. A popular choice for hungover college students in the Southeast, the breakfast selection includes biscuits sandwiching a pimento cheese spread as well as gravy-smothered biscuits.\n\nCurry Up Now\n\nThis fast-casual Indian restaurant from the Bay Area got its start as a food truck in 2009 and has since gone national wide with locations across California, Texas, Utah and Georgia. Blending Indian street food with modern California style, the menu includes tacos with pico kachumber and cilantro chutney, a vegan chana masala burrito and samosa burgers with Maggi ketchup and chutneys on an Amul-buttered bun. One of the most popular menu items is the Naughty Naan, described on its website as an Indian pizza with mozzarella, caramelized onions, shaved jalapeño and your choice of chicken, paneer or lamb.\n\nJeni's Splendid Ice Creams\n\nThis ice cream shop opened in 2002 in Columbus, Ohio by Jeni Britton Bauer, who got her start after adding cayenne pepper oil into her chocolate ice cream while she was in college. She's built her wide range of whimsical ice cream flavors into a frozen desserts empire, with scoop shops as well as pints sold in retail locations around the country. Jeni's sources its milk from Smith’s, a century-old dairy in Ohio's Appalachian region, and churns out flavors like Skillet Cinnamon Roll, Brandied Banana Brûlée and Frosé Sorbet. Pricey pints can be found at select AJ's Fine Foods stores, but Jeni's has yet to open a brick-and-mortar ice cream shop here.\n\nFrom Sweet Republic to Mary Coyle:Here are 15 of the best ice cream shops around Phoenix\n\nCook Out\n\nThis Southern restaurant chain is known for its char-grilled hamburgers, Cajun fries and Cheerwine, a cherry-flavored soda invented in North Carolina. Diners can order their burger Cook-Out Style, featuring house-made chili, slaw, mustard and onion. Perhaps one of the most impressive aspects of Cook Out is the massive milkshake menu. The milkshake menu is so long that someone made a website dedicated to reviewing Cook Out shakes. Top scorers on the website are Reese's Cup and Blueberry, while Hi-C Fruit Punch scored the lowest.\n\nPappaRich\n\nThe 2019 closure of BP Street Cafe has left a Malaysian food hole in Phoenix. PappaRich could help fill that void. The Malaysian restaurant chain so far has only one U.S. location, in Queens, New York, and a second location coming soon to Houston's Bellaire neighborhood — both areas known for their large Asian populations. But with the Mesa Asian District and East Valley attracting other Asian restaurant chains in recent years, could PappaRich stake its flag in Phoenix, too? It might be a while before we get our hands on their roti canai with beef rendang and curry fish balls, but we'll continue to hold out hope.\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nAn informal poll of The Arizona Republic newsroom about beloved chains incited a flurry of responses. Based on those impassioned opinions, honorable mention goes to Blake's Lotaburger, a fast food chain founded in Albuquerque that's best known for its Hatch green chile cheeseburger. While the New Mexican chain hasn't made its way to Phoenix, it has a few locations in Tucson, making it a mere 2-hour drive away.\n\nAnother honorable mention goes to Fong's Pizza, an Iowa restaurant known for Asian fusion pizzas. While it only has a few locations, Republic employee Katherine Fritcke sold us on her description: \"Best pizza you never knew you needed. But once you have crab Rangoon pizza for the first time, you’ll understand.\"\n\nReach the reporter at Priscilla.Totiya@azcentral.com.

Having a piping-hot meal delivered right to your hotel room lets you know that you've arrived. It's comforting, nourishing and downright convenient. To find out what travelers were ordering, The Daily Meal reached out to hotel publicists across the country to see what dishes topped the list of in-room best sellers. Some of the results were surprising. Who would have guessed that Maryland crabcakes were the most-ordered dish at a New York City hotel? But others were totally expected. Guests at a Washington, D.C., hotel known for hosting business professionals were most likely to request a healthy yogurt, fruit and granola plate.\n\nAlthough room service is typically thought of as an early-morning treat, breakfast foods only represent six of the 13 total items. When it comes to room service, it turns out that comfort, not time of day, is the bigger factor in determining what guests will order. The majority of the most popular room service items on our list are, well, comfort foods — pancakes, eggs, burgers and pizza all make an appearance, but regional differences also tend to influence menus. For example, Rhode Island visitors prefer their hash with some lobster, while travelers in Texas often request Mexican-influenced huevos rancheros to start their days.\n\nRegardless of the location, travelers across the country can probably agree that ordering room service can make you feel more at home, and not to mention, satisfied. Check out this list to see what topped the list of most-requested in-room dishes.\n\n1. Maryland crabcake at The Ritz-Carlton, Battery Park, New York City\n\nDespite The Ritz-Carlton, Battery Park's location that overlooks one of New York City's most iconic sights — the Statue of Liberty — the Maryland crabcake appetizer is guests' most-asked-for item. The dish, served with red quinoa mango salad, has been on the in-room menu for just seven months and already sells about 20 per day.\n\n2. Granola at The Jefferson, Washington, D.C.\n\nThose staying at Washington, D.C.'s The Jefferson Hotel prefer getting a light and nutritious start with the hotel's \"Power Crunch\" breakfast. It's a combination of house-made granola, puréed acai, bananas, blueberries, and Greek yogurt.\n\n\"Breakfast is always a top-seller on our room service menu, as The Jefferson attracts many business travelers on the go,\" says the hotel's executive chef Chris Jakubiec. \"'The Power Crunch' breakfast is a quick and healthy dish to start the day, and it's packed with antioxidants from the acai and blueberry. It is a refreshing option for those who usually dine out for three meals a day when on the road.\"\n\n3. Lobster roll with bacon dressing at The Rittenhouse Hotel, Philadelphia\n\nThis AAA five-diamond award-winning hotel's most popular item is the lobster roll, served on a soft house-made brioche bun with bacon dressing. \"We put the lobster roll on the room service menu to offer an alternative to classics like the burger,\" says hotel chef Jon Cichon. \"We did not want to reinvent to roll, but we wanted to put our spin on it. Lobster reminds us of grilling, grilling reminds us of summer, and smoky things remind us of grilling. So we decided to use a smoky aioli made with bacon instead of a traditional mayonnaise. To cut the richness of the bacon aioli, we added sliced grapes that lend their acidity to the roll.\"\n\n4. The Maine lobster hash at Castle Hill Inn, Newport, R.I.\n\nEach dish on the Castle Hill Inn's menu is influenced by Rhode Island's cuisine and heritage. So it makes sense that the seafood-laden Maine lobster hash, which also includes poached eggs, arugula and pea tendril salad with chive crème fraîche, is the most-requested plate. The varied tastes in this item reflect the cooking staff's love of creating their own melting pot of flavors, according to the inn's website.\n\n5. Antipasto at Montelucia Resort & Spa, Scottsdale, Ariz.\n\nVisitors at the Montelucia Resort & Spa in Scottsdale, Ariz., prefer to keep it light with the resort's antipasto dish. This ideal-for-sharing item consists of three types of artisan cheese, La Quercia prosciutto, almonds, olives, dried fruit, fig jam and grilled bread. This European-inspired plate takes its cues from the hotel's theme, which is inspired by the rich cultural history, whitewashed villages and sunbathed hills of Spain's Andalusia region.\n\n6. Pancakes at Grand Cascades Lodge, Hamburg, N.J.\n\nClassic, all-American pancakes are the most popular in-room menu item at the Grand Cascades Lodge in Hamburg, N.J. You can ask for them however you like, but the most commonly requested variations are — in order of most-ordered — strawberry, chocolate chip, banana and blueberry. A variety of fruit toppings or compotes are also available.\n\n7. Meat, eggs and potatoes at Hotel deLuxe, Portland, Ore.\n\nGuests of the Hotel deLuxe in Portland, Ore., keep it hearty and American by ordering Gracie's Breakfast. The dish that's ordered 550 times annually includes a choice of meat (one piece of ham, three slices bacon, two chicken sausage links or one sausage patty), two eggs and breakfast potatoes. The item is named after the hotel's restaurant, Gracie's. The eatery — staying true to the hotel's Old Hollywood vibe — takes its name from Gracie Allen, the comedienne wife and performing partner of entertainer George Burns.\n\n8. The Beverly Hilton Burger at The Beverly Hilton, Beverly Hills, Calif.\n\nThe Beverly Hilton is possibly best known as the home of the Golden Globes, but the signature Beverly Hilton Burger is also noteworthy. The hotel's most-ordered room service dish since 1955, it's made with freshly ground sirloin grilled with your choice of toppings and is served with french fries, crisp lettuce, vine-ripened tomato and sweet onions.\n\n9. Margherita pizza from Tulio Ristorante at the Hotel Vintage Park, Seattle\n\nSeattle's Hotel Vintage Park's cooking staff is most frequently asked to whip up classic and simple margherita pizzas for its guests to enjoy in their rooms. The pie is made with fresh mozzarella, sweet basiland tomato. As of press time, guests have ordered 299 pizzas since the start of 2013.\n\n10. Roasted Anaheim cage-free huevos rancheros at the Omni La Mansión del Rio, San Antonio\n\nHuevos rancheros top the list of most-ordered dishes at San Antonio's Omni La Mansión del Rio. In addition to eggs, the plate includes a crisp corn tortilla, refried beans, queso fresco, and is topped off with spicy ranchero and tomatillo salsa. To date, the Omni has sold 810 of these Mexican-tinged plates that reflect San Antonio's heritage.\n\n11. Cleveland Benedict at The Renaissance Cleveland Hotel, Cleveland\n\nThe Renaissance Cleveland Hotel's top-seller for breakfast is the Cleveland Benedict. This plate, which was designed to reflect the area's food preferences, includes in-house cured corned beef atop a seeded rye toast medallion, a poached egg and Amish butter hollandaise sauce.\n\n\"We focus on using indigenous ingredients and showcasing local cuisine. In room service, it is no different,\" says executive chef Brett Montgomery.\n\n12. Chocolate chip cookies at The Biltmore, Coral Gables, Fla.\n\nOne of the most-ordered desserts at The Biltmore in Coral Gables, Fla., are the comforting (and delicious) staple chocolate chip cookies. They're made fresh, in-house daily. Last year, the cooking staff made 5,941 chocolate chip cookies.\n\n13. Country-fried steak at Charleston Place in Charleston, S.C.\n\nThe undeniably Southern country-fried steak is one of the most-asked-for room service dishes at the Charleston Place in South Carolina. This filling breakfast comes with beef short ribs, caramelized onion gravy, breakfast potatoes and two eggs any style. In keeping with the hotel's reputation as one of the most luxurious spots in all of Charleston, all the in-room tables are set with fine china and silverware. Each ordered plate comes with pineapple (the symbol of Southern hospitality) dipped in dark chocolate, along with a fresh-cut rose.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/10/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2015/02/26/polly-campbell-cincinnati-chili-gold-star-skyline/23999529/", "title": "Polly: Area has taste all its own — Cincinnati Chili", "text": "Polly Campbell\n\npcampbell@enquirer.com\n\nThis story ran in The Enquirer May 17, 2009. We found it in the archives, and thought it rang just as true today.\n\nAll across this country, people are eating the same lunch in the same fast-food restaurants that have sprawled everywhere you go. But here in Greater Cincinnati, we're crazy for a fast food that you can't find anywhere else, a unique specialty that is \"one of the nation's most distinctive plates of regional food,\" as roaming road food writers Jane and Michael Stern call it. We have Cincinnati-style chili, that improbable culinary creation and emotional fixation on an oval plate. Other local specialties have spread out from their birthplaces: You don't need to go to Buffalo to get Buffalo chicken wings, or to Philadelphia for a cheesesteak. But to try a four-way, you mostly have to head to a 50-mile-wide target whose bull's-eye is probably somewhere near Boudinot and Glenway avenues. No one else really \"gets\" it. People from other cities think it's weird, in fact. How can we call it chili, they snicker, when it's more the texture of spaghetti sauce, and in fact is ladled over spaghetti? What's with the cinnamon?There are historical answers to those questions.\n\nFirst, you have to remember that it started as a hot dog sauce. And that its spice palate is not, like Texas chili, Mexican-inspired. It's Greek. It is a complex, warm spice blend of cinnamon and cumin and probably coriander and ... well, no one knows what else, as every chili recipe is by tradition secret and carefully guarded. The Greek salad you often can get on the side, and the common combination of chili and gyro parlor are the other hints of the chili's origin.\n\nTo be specific, we should say Cincinnati chili is Macedonian. The fathers of Cincinnati chili, the Kiradjieffs, came here from Macedonia, then part of Greece. John and Tom immigrated to New York in 1920, where they sold hot dogs, improving them with a ground-meat sauce they spiced with flavors that were familiar to them from home. When they moved to Cincinnati in 1922, they opened a little place next to Empress Theater downtown and started serving the sauce on noodles as well as hot dogs. At some point, they added cheese and the optional onions and beans.\n\nCincinnatians embraced the Kiradjieffs' invention, and the variations on it from others, such as the Lambrinides and Sarakatsannis and Kostopoulos and Bazoff and Daoud families. We haven't let go since. Chili here is no quaint historical tradition - it is a way of life, or at least a way of lunch.\n\nWe have an extraordinary emotional connection to our chili, eating 2 million pounds of it a year, and to our particular brand. If you're new to this area, a warning: Don't stand between a Cincinnatian and his or her five-way. You won't get stampeded; you will simply get walked over - repeatedly, as we travel a well-worn path from our office or home to our favorite parlor, often several times a week. (We might even pass or drive by one or two others to get to the one we consider \"ours,\" even if it's the same chain. The Clifton Skyline is not the same as one in Anderson Township.)\n\nWe devise our own special ways to vary our order beyond the usual three-, four- and five-way by asking for more or less cheese, on the bottom or on the side, or getting creative with the hexagonal crackers that always come with it.\n\nAnd something you may notice about those out-of-towners who visit or move here and get all snotty about the chili: They come around. After a few months, you'll see them with the bib tied on, engaging in arguments about the relative merits of Pleasant Ridge and Price Hill chili, and cutting their spaghetti with a fork.\n\nMORE THAN CHILI\n\nChili parlors are about more than chili. You're also likely to find:\n\nDouble deckers. These are impossibly tall sandwiches with three pieces of toasted white bread that define Cincinnati lunch. There will be two layers of filling. \"Ham and hard-boiled egg used to be popular,\" said Phillip Bazoff of Park Chili, \"but nobody orders that anymore.\" Now you can get ham and beef, egg salad and turkey, chicken salad and egg salad or bacon and tomato, among many other combinations. Ham and beef with lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise is called a Hippo.\n\nGreek salads. If there was any doubt that Cincinnati chili is a Greek invention, it's confirmed by the presence of so many Greek salads on chili parlor menus. Usually they're iceberg lettuce with a few kalamata or ripe black olives, a wedge or two of tomato, cucumber and a sprinkle of feta cheese, maybe with a pepperoncini. Some people's craving for Skyline's or Dixie's Greek salad dressing may be as strong as those for the chili.\n\nYork peppermint patties. They're at the checkout and are a natural ending to a meal, especially if you've gone for a four-way with onion.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nCincinnati-style chili is popular in Jordan and throughout the Middle East. The Daoud family, who immigrated here from Jordan and opened Gold Star, also went back to Jordan and opened chili parlors there, including Chili House. You can be in Amman and see photos of Cincinnati on the wall of a restaurant.\n\nThe Fourth and Sycamore store is the largest Skyline location. It's popular for wedding rehearsal dinners and even wedding receptions at midnight.\n\nAll chili recipes are proprietary and are locked in a safe or known only to one or two people. It's easy to detect that there's cinnamon and other warm spices in most recipes. It's long been conjectured that chocolate is an ingredient. \"It's not what you think it is,\" is all Charlie Howard of Gold Star will say.\n\nMany recipes for making chili at home start with browning the beef. Wrong - the ground beef is simmered without browning it first.\n\nEarly chili parlors were named for theaters. Empress was next to the Empress Theater, and when it became the Gaiety Theater there was a Gaiety Chili next door. 20th Century Chili was next to the 20th Century Theater in Oakley, and Park Chili in Northside was across from the Park Theater.\n\nCincinnati has more chili restaurants per capita than any other city.\n\nJohn Johnson may be the plain American name of Camp Washington Chili's owner, but his wife's name is Antigone.\n\nDiscover more about Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky.\n\nCHILI EATING 101\n\nNew to Greater Cincinnati and want to look like you fit in?\n\nDon't look at the menu. Just order your regular.\n\nOnce you've gotten used to casually ordering your four-way bean, get more advanced. Try a four-way-bean sloppy inverted. Practice at home first so it sounds like you've been ordering it like this all your life. Or maybe get a coney no mo (no mustard).\n\nYes, it's OK to get a three-way and a cheese coney. In fact, it's one of the most popular orders.\n\nDon't twirl the spaghetti! Cut it.\n\nPut the oval plate so the narrow end is facing you and work your way front to back\n\nDevelop a personal style. You might, for instance, take the crackers and carefully arrange them all around the rim of the plate before you dig in.\n\nMake a cracker-bomb appetizer. Using a tiny hole in an oyster cracker, fill it up with hot sauce and pop it in your mouth. Or do it when your friend isn't looking and sneak it back into their dish.\n\nBibs are for babies, some say. Others say they're for people who know what can happen when a piece of noodle covered with chili flips onto your dress or your good tie.\n\nYes, there are drive-throughs at many chili places. Don't consider this as a license to eat a five-way with a fork while you drive. A coney, maybe, but even that's a little dangerous.\n\nIf you don't know, chili by 'way' is:\n\nBowl of chili\n\nTwo-way: Chili on spaghetti\n\nThree-way: Chili on spaghetti, with a fluffy toupee of bright-orange cheese\n\nFour-way bean: Kidney beans between the chili and cheese\n\nFour-way onion: Chopped raw onions instead of beans\n\nFive-way: All of the above\n\nBut those are just the classic combinations. Now you can get chili on:\n\nBaked potatoes\n\nFries\n\nBurritos\n\nSalad\n\nPizza\n\nAnd some places offer their own six-ways:\n\nWith garlic at Dixie\n\nWith hot dogs cut up and dotted on the top at some Gold Stars\n\nWith jalapenos at Blue Ash\n\nAnd, of course, you've always been able to add hot sauce to spice it up.\n\nA newer classic that deserves its own place in the \"way\" lineup is chili dip: a layer of cream cheese topped with chili, onions and cheddar, baked and served with tortilla chips. A few parlors offer this, but mostly it's made at home with frozen or canned chili and taken to parties.\n\nAnd you can order:\n\nSloppy or wet: Technically, this means a little more chili juice, but most people think it means more chili - if so, you'll be charged more\n\nDry: Chili juice drained\n\nInverted: Cheese on the bottom so it melts\n\nCheese on the side: So it doesn't melt\n\nEvery pre-schooler's favorite: Three-way, hold the chili", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/local/2022/10/04/whats-cooking-news-from-the-beaver-valley-restaurant-bar-scenes/69538427007/", "title": "What's Cooking: News from the Beaver Valley restaurant & bar scenes", "text": "New restaurants and bars pop up all the time.

Here are a few tricks to ...", "text": "Kellie Ell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAmericans are spending a frightening amount of money on Halloween. The National Retail Federation estimates consumers will spend a record $9.1 billion this year, up 8.3% from 2016 when the number was $8.4 billion. That breaks down to an investment of $86.13 per person. But these hair-raising statistics don’t have to be so scary. Here are the things Americans are splurging on during Halloween — and ways you can celebrate on a budget.\n\n1. Costumes\n\nTis the season for costly costumes. Americans are expected to shell out around $3.4 billion on Halloween attire. Men, on average, spend more than women. ($96 vs. $77.) But before you pull a Wednesday Addams and dress like everyone else, here are a few tips for frugal shoppers. Pop-up shops and Halloween-themed stores are fun and convenient, they can also be pricey. Instead, consumers should try discount retailers like T.J. Maxx, Nordstrom Rack or Party City. Not only do these stores offer huge savings, but shoppers can also find one-of-a-kind items. Thrift stores, like national chains Goodwill and The Salvation Army or your local vintage shops, also have reduced merchandise. Sometimes shoppers can even score near-new costumes. “People don’t usually re-wear costumes,” says Andrea Woroch, a money-saving expert. “Since they were only worn one time, they’re usually in good condition.”\n\nIf you're shopping online, browse Pinterest and Instagram for ideas, then compare websites to find discounts. “There are so many Halloween retailers out there,” Woroch says. “Google the retailers name and ‘coupon code’ to see who has the best deal.” The point, she says, is to avoid paying full price when you don’t have to. Some sites to check out are Buycostumes.com, Halloweencostumes.com SpiritHalloween.com. Many have free shipping. Jet.com offers cash back on purchases, and right now first-time customers get an additional 15% off with a promo-code.\n\nMore:Halloween sales of candy and costumes expected to break a record\n\nMore:5 Halloween myths and urban legends, debunked\n\nMore:Snickers, candy corn: What's the top-selling Halloween candy in your state?\n\nApps like Poshmark and Mercari are also money saving tricks. They’re free and let you buy and sell clothes that no one else has. Or, raid your bestie’s closet to see what could fit into your costume. “If you use what you have around your house and then you only spend $5 or $10 on one item, then you really save,” Woroch says.\n\nAnd, if you’re flexible about your costume, wait until a few days before Halloween or even the morning of to buy. Merchants often have even bigger sales then because they want to sell everything in stock.\n\n2. Candy\n\nHalloween hits the sweet spot: The NRF anticipates Halloween candy sales will hit $2.7 billion this year. There are plenty of affordable ways to satisfy your sweet tooth. Shoppers should buy in bulk. Stores like Costco, Target, Sam's Club and Walmart have supersize bags of candy. Many of these stores let you double up on savings with coupons. And, just like costumes, wait until Halloween morning when candy goes on sale at most stores.\n\n3. Decorations\n\nJust like candy, Americans are expected to purchase $2.7 billion worth of Halloween décor this year. Thrift stores and yard sales can offer major savings on this front though.\n\nLori Maloney, a stay-at-home mom in Kearneysville, W.Va., found Halloween decorations at a yard sale near her home. “I probably paid 10% of the retail value,” she says of her July shopping spree. “At the time I thought it was a bit silly to buy them, but I’m glad I did.”\n\n4. Greeting cards\n\nThe art of writing correspondence is not dead. Consumers will likely spend around $400 million on Halloween cards this year. A great way to save is by making your own. Dollar stores, like Family Dollar and Dollar Tree, are all over the U.S. and have low-cost supplies. Even better: dollar stores sell cards too.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/budget-and-spending/2017/10/30/halloween-spending-younger-generation-outpacing-others/812534001/", "title": "Here's how much people your age are spending on Halloween", "text": "Shawn M. Carter\n\nCNBC\n\nBetween candy, costumes and décor, Americans could spend $15 billion on Halloween this year. And, according to a Harris Poll Online survey of more than 2,000 U.S. adults, conducted on behalf CIT Bank, Millennials will be responsible for most of that.\n\nOn average, younger people are expected to spend $183 each on candy, costumes, decorations and miscellaneous items. That's compared to $70 for those in Generation X and $23 for Baby Boomers.\n\nOn costumes alone, Millennials could spend $66 each, versus $25 for Gen X and only $3 for Boomers. And, 29% of Millennials believe they'll likely spend more than they initially planned. Only 20% of Gen X and 11% of Boomers say the same.\n\n\"Millennial consumers continue to demonstrate how they value experiences and are spending and saving accordingly,\" Ravi Kumar, head of Internet Banking at CIT Bank, says.\n\n\"From costumes to parties, Halloween is all about enjoying the moment and has become one the most popular celebrations for those between the ages of 18 [and] 36.\"\n\nBut just because Millennials are spending on experiences like Halloween costumes and candy doesn't mean they're not saving for the long-term, too.\n\nAccording to the study, 61% of Millennials are currently saving in case of an emergency, compared with 63% of those in Gen X and 51% of Boomers.\n\nAnd, in general, Millennials are better at managing their money than their older peers. In a national survey, Charles Schwab tracked how 1,000 Americans, aged 21 to 75, manage and use their wealth.\n\nIt found Millennials are better than older generations at financial planning, financial awareness and having confidence in being able to reach financial goals.\n\nWhat's more, a survey from NerdWallet of more than 2,000 Americans found that if Millennials keep pace with their current savings habits, they could retire with $1 million more than Boomers and $400,000 more than those in Gen X.\n\nKumar has some tips to become even better at managing your money: \"Utilizing products such as high-yield savings accounts and [certificates of deposit] provide the opportunity to make your cash work harder and reach one's savings goals faster.\n\n\"This can be beneficial in meeting both near-term goals such as vacation and emergency savings as well as long-term planning.\"\n\nLook for opportunities to increase your contributions, for instance, like if you get a higher-paying job or a raise. Try automating your savings. And look for ways to better manage your income, not just increase it.\n\n© CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Halloween's been hijacked by adults", "text": "Bruce Horovitz, USA TODAY\n\nOn Wednesday night in New York City's Greenwich Village, a record 2 million people — about 90% of them grown-ups — are expected to gather for one reason: to act like kids.\n\nThe annual event, now in its 39th year, is the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade, which will go all night long, filling bars, restaurants and hotels and acting as a $90 million instant stimulus to the city's economy.\n\nThis adultification of Halloween is taking place in virtually every city in America. At bars. At restaurants. At movie theaters. Even at high-end gift shops. Like treats snatched from a trick-or-treat bag, adults have slowly been stealing Halloween from kids for years. Now it appears, grown-ups own the holiday.\n\nA record $8 billion will be spent by U.S. consumers this Halloween — most of it by adults, for adults. Seven years ago, when the National Retail Federation asked adults if they, themselves, planned to celebrate Halloween, 52.5% said yes. This year, it's 71.5%.\n\n\"I call it Occupying Halloween,\" says consumer anthropologist Robbie Blinkoff. \"My gut tells me that it's bigger than Halloween, and is actually part of our culture. We need to creatively express ourselves to find pure joy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA decade ago, fewer than three in 10 costumes purchased for Halloween at Halloweenexpress.com were for adults. Now, it's more than six in 10. It should be no surprise that consumers will spend an average of $123 this Halloween, more than twice the average $53 that they spent on it a year ago, reports American Express Saving & Spending Tracker.\n\nIn the midst of this adult takeover, Halloween has emerged as the No. 2 holiday in consumer spending for decorations, after Christmas. Maybe it's because Halloween is about friends, not family. Or perhaps it's because there are really no gifts to purchase, no religious rituals to observe and rarely any red-eye plane rides involved.\n\n\"Halloween has become an adult holiday for the new American family,\" says Jeanne Fleming, who has been the Greenwich Village parade's producer for years. But it's not a family that you have to fly home to in order to celebrate. \"You stay right where you are,\" she says, \"and you celebrate with your friends.\"\n\nAdults seem to relish this cultural joy as much as or more than kids. Social media — from YouTube videos of the wackiest Halloween yard displays to postings of huge, adult-targeted Halloween parades in Greenwich Village and West Hollywood — clearly play a role.\n\nWith Celtic roots dating to the mid-1500s, Halloween was originally known as All Hallows Even (Evening), a time to pray for those whose souls had yet to reach heaven.\n\nHalloween wasn't really a child-focused holiday in the USA until the spreading of suburbia in the 1950s, says Lesley Bannatyne, who has written five book on Halloween, most recently Halloween Nation: Behind the Scenes of America's Fright Night. As suburban tracts grew, she says, kids carrying pillowcases loaded with candy became an increasingly familiar sight.\n\n\"But you knew Halloween was changing when Hugh Hefner started throwing big Halloween parties at the Playboy Mansion,\" Bannatyne says.\n\nFast-forward to the late 1970s, when teen and adult interest in Halloween in the U.S. exploded, as Hollywood grabbed onto Halloween gore and never let go. Consider: The Halloween film franchise, now 34 years and 11 films old, recently passed the $366 million mark in worldwide box office receipts.\n\n\"I like to think that the Halloween film franchise played a role in adults embracing Halloween,\" says Malek Akkad, who produced the last two Halloween films, and was but a kid when John Carpenter directed the very first one. \"The holiday has grown into something bigger than any of us could have imagined.\"\n\nBut not too big for Jayna Gregory. The 24-year-old tech consultant from Phoenix figures she's spent about $2,000 on Halloween costumes and decorations for herself in the past two years.\n\nHalloween also happens to be her birthday. She's already purchased three costumes for three different Halloween parties that she plans to attend. \"I do it for my own enjoyment,\" she says.\n\nAs far as Blinkoff is concerned, that \"enjoyment\" has its roots in a culture of folks desperate to act out their true feelings. \"It's a way for people to try to be more themselves,\" he says. Even as adults in costumes play out their fantasies, it's as if they're actually saying, \"I'm behind a mask, but this is really who I am.\"\n\nThis adult infatuation has not gone unnoticed by marketers, from alcoholic beverage sellers, costume makers and movie makers to haunted house and amusement park operators.\n\nThere's even a massive annual Halloween trade show, which brings together haunted house operators and Halloween-focused retailers from across the country. And here's a turn: You can't get into the Halloween show if you're under 16.\n\nHalloween has another famous franchise: Cassandra Peterson.\n\nIf you don't recognize her by that name, perhaps you'll recognize her stage name: Elvira, Mistress of the Dark. Halloween has made a multimillionaire out of the former Las Vegas showgirl. who, in 1981, first began appearing as a sexy, vampire-like hostess for a Los Angeles TV station airing spooky, evening flicks.\n\nNow, more than 30 years later, she's still making a killing off the Elvira franchise. And while she has developed a small cult following of kids, it's mostly teens and adults who line up for Elvira's autograph at Halloween-theme events.\n\n\"How sad to have a holiday you love so much and then grow out of it,\" says Peterson, whose image several decades ago helped turn Halloween into one of the biggest days of the year for Coors beer. \"I do have to take some credit for Halloween becoming an adult holiday.\"\n\nFor the wine, beer and booze makers, Halloween is huge. \"Halloween is second to New Year's in parties, liquor and wine purchases,\" says Steve Wilde, president of Wilde Advertising, which specializes in promotions for the spirits industry. \"It a gi-normous event.\"\n\nNone of the alcoholic beverage makers contacted — MillerCoors, Diageo and Gallo — would discuss Halloween marketing with USA TODAY.\n\nWilde says Halloween has become the party event for folks in their 20s and 30s. \"If you're 35 or under, the chances of you answering the door and handing out candy on Halloween are slim,\" he says. \"You're probably at a party.\"\n\nMany beer, wine and spirits brand invest in costly supermarket displays that attract attention and goose sales.\n\nGallo purchased thousands of dollars worth of Halloween-decorated trees, hanging skeletons and giant spiders from Wilde's agency — just for the states of Washington and Oregon.\n\nSimilarly, Diageo's Captain Morgan brand has mustache and beard kits for Halloween, Wilde says.\n\nFor the spirits companies, Wilde says, \"Halloween has become a focal point between the end of summer and Thanksgiving.\"\n\nFor some businesses, there simply would be no Halloween without avid adult participation. At Home Depot, for example, the front of every store right now has huge sections devoted to selling gobs of outdoor Halloween inflatables. One looks like a lighted pirate ship and fetches $179.\n\nThen, there are the specialists:\n\n-- Haunted houses. Some 3,000 temporary haunted houses coast-to-coast -- at up to $15 a pop -- will try to lure thrill-seekers. Youngsters may want to go, but most discourage kids under 13 from even entering. The real target: 16 to 21 year old girls. \"Groups of girls love to go in and scream together,\" says Leonard Pickel, owner of Hauntrepreneuers, which designs and consults for haunted houses.\n\n-- Spooky theme parks. The best way to make money at a theme park between mid-September and Halloween: Turn it into an adult-themed haunt. Knott's Berry Farm has done this for 40 years under the name Knott's Scary Farm. \"We call it a PG-13 event,\" says Raffi Kaprelyan, general manager. The park has opened 13 mazes this year, including Jack the Ripper and Dominion of the Dead. Admission to the evening haunt: $38.\n\n-- Halloween pop-ups. A record 1,000 Spirit of Halloween pop-up stores opened in and near malls between early September and Halloween. The stores sell a vast array of mostly adult-targeted Halloween merchandise, including $199 ghoulish animatronics. Where Halloween used to be all about trick-or-treating, \"the focus is much more about the party,\" says CEO Steven Silverstein. Clearly grown-ups have bought in. Ten years ago, there were 150 Spirit locations. This year, it's almost 1,000.\n\n-- Costume makers. Adults this year will spend more on costumes for themselves ($1.2 billion) than for their kids ($1 billion) at Rubie's Costume Co., one of the nation's largest costume makers. \"Our adult business is growing like crazy,\" says Howard Beige, executive vice president. \"Children go for all the hot licenses (such as Mattel's \"Monster High\" dolls and Batman or Spider-Man.) Adults go for zombies.\"\n\nThe West Hollywood Halloween Costume Carnaval attracts upwards of 500,000 spectators and is the Los Angeles area's second-largest annual event next to the Tournament of Roses New Year's Day Parade.\n\nBut at four times the size, the grandmother of them all is the Greenwich Village Parade. Not only are adults the vast majority of the onlookers, says Fleming, the producer, but also 90% of the participants.\n\nPeople stay in the Village and party all night, making it the biggest annual night for Greenwich Village businesses, she says. For grown-ups, even more than kids, Fleming says, it's all about letting loose.\n\n\"It's probably the last night of the year when everyone can come out in G-strings and be in the street.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/09/25/halloween-spending-how-much-you-spend-candy/2441754001/", "title": "Halloween spending: How much will you spend on candy?", "text": "How much candy are you buying for Halloween?\n\nAccording to the National Retail Federation’s annual survey conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics, U.S. consumers are expected to spend $2.6 billion on candy or more than $25 on average.\n\nThat's a lot of snack-size chocolate and candy corn.\n\nAdd in other Halloween purchases – costumes, decorations and greeting cards – and altogether shoppers said they plan to spend an average $86.27 for the holiday or $8.8 billion in total spending, down from $9 billion last year.\n\nAccording to the retail federation's survey of more than 7,400 people, 68% of Americans plan to celebrate with 69% saying they will hand out candy, 49% decorating homes and 47% dressing in costume.\n\nMonster deal:IHOP's special Halloween menu features Addams Family spooky meals and Kids Eat Free deal\n\nHalloween 2019:Theme parks around the USA offer chills to go with the thrills\n\nThe survey also found social media is influencing Halloween purchases.\n\nWhile online search is still the biggest Halloween driver, Pinterest, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter have grown in popularity for costume and decoration inspiration since 2015, the survey found.\n\n“Spending hasn’t changed much over the past few years, but we are seeing a noticeable increase in consumers whose Halloween purchases are inspired by their friends, neighbors and even celebrities on social media,\" said Matthew Shay, the retail federation's president and CEO, in a statement.\n\nThe survey found a gender divide over what social media channel is used.\n\nPinterest was the choice of 25% of women but only 12% of men, while 19% of men cited YouTube compared to 10% of women.

And I’m not even done.”\n\nGarcia planned to have a haunted house, but city permit issues put that on hold this year, allowing him to focus all his efforts on Halloween night.\n\nNevertheless, Garcia is savvy with his spending — and gets the biggest bang possible for his buck.\n\n“I usually buy discount props that are broken or damaged that are little cheaper. That’s the smart way to do it,” said Garcia, who finds seasonal items at yard sales and local thrift stores, including Goodwill and the Salvation Army store in Ventura.\n\nHe also finds great deals shopping after Halloween, when many items are offered at a discount.\n\n“A lot of my stuff is new, too, but I try to avoid that,” Garcia said. “A lot of my witch props I re-use because I have old antique witches from 1999. And I bought a clown that I have had for six years that’s still in pristine condition.”\n\nCostly holiday\n\nThis Halloween, consumers nationwide are expected to spend a record $8.4 billion, said Ana Serafin-Smith, senior director of media relations for the National Retail Federation, based in Washington, D.C.\n\n“This year, we saw the largest number of consumers wanting to spend more on Halloween,” said Serafin-Smith, noting that this year’s figures are based on an 11-year survey. “This is the highest we’ve seen in survey history.”\n\nOne of the factors is the economy becoming stronger, she said.\n\n“More consumers are working, which means a lot more money is available for those experiential moments that consumers are looking for right now,” Serafin-Smith said.\n\nCan't view the charts above or would like to view them in more detail? Click here.\n\n“A big trend is they want to spend the money on a moment in time where they can show off that moment in time,” she said. “A lot of this is influenced by social media … being driven by millennials. When you add all those things up, that’s why we’re seeing this really high forecast for Halloween.”\n\nMillennials were especially affected by the recession, Serafin-Smith said.\n\n“So they have that mentality to get the most for their buck,” she said. “They are looking for deals and are very savvy consumers. They’re looking for ways to get everything they need for the budget they allocated to have the best Halloween.”\n\nOut of the $8.4 billion consumers are expected to spend, $3.1 billion will be spent on costumes, Serafin-Smith said.\n\nFor children, the No. 1 Halloween costume this year is action and superhero characters, followed by princesses.\n\n“This is the first time in survey history that we’re seeing princesses fall to second place,” Serafin-Smith said. “There’s been a lot more action heroes this year in movies, plus Pokémon is considered an action hero.”\n\nBatman is going to be the top costume for millennials, she said, followed by witches and animals.\n\n“For adults 35 and older, witch costumes are going to be the most popular, followed by pirates,” Serafin-Smith said. “Third place will be political characters, so we might see some presidential candidates this Halloween.”\n\nStore owners said news coverage and viral videos of people dressed in \"creepy clown\" masks scaring people have made clown costumes among the top sellers, forcing some retailers to restock after demand outstripped availability.\n\nD’Anne Fraye, who has one daughter and triplet sons, has made her children’s costumes every year, as well as props, including a carriage the year her daughter portrayed Cinderella.\n\n“When you have that many kids, you have to be thrifty and creative,” said Fraye, of Simi Valley, whose daughter, Lynzee, is now 22, and sons, Mitchell, Garrett and Spencer, are 16.\n\nHer daughter has always been something glamorous for Halloween, including Marilyn Monroe, a Greek goddess and Xena the Warrior Princess. Her sons have portrayed characters in sets of three, including rock, paper and scissors, the Three Musketeers, three blind mice, three bugs in a rug, the Jamaican bobsled team, earth, wind and fire, and Snap, Crackle and Pop.\n\n“A lot of our costumes have been made out of cardboard, spray paint, duct tape and hot glue. Hot glue was our best friend,” Fraye said. “And being a hairdresser, I always do their hair.”\n\nHaunted celebration\n\nThe Boys & Girls Club of Simi Valley puts on one Halloween carnival and a haunted house that runs for five days.\n\n“We don’t spend a lot of money, said Virginia Hayward, the club’s CEO.\n\nThe club spends about $150 on candy for the kids, she said, and 400 toys were donated this year by Moose Toys. About 50 pumpkins were donated by Adam and Kaitlin Berezowsky, owners of Epic Fitness in Simi Valley, and Jo-Ann Fabric & Craft Stores donates decorations.\n\n“We have to get black coverings to make the maze of the haunted house, so there’s a little bit of cost for that,” Hayward said. “Our amazing staff pulls it off and does all the setup and provides a great time for the kids.”\n\nAt The Best Halloween Store Ever in Thousand Oaks, “it’s been an awesome year in terms of sales,” said Tiana Scharf, of Camarillo, the store owner.\n\nHer shop offers a prop rental service, “so we have people that come in and say they’re having a party for the night, and we’ll come and decorate their house.”\n\nThe types of costumes people buy vary she said, including the pre-packaged ones with all the accessories.\n\nPeople who attend multiple parties will purchase separate items, including accessories, to get the most out of their costume.\n\nPoll:\n\nIf they want to wear white, for instance, “one night they can be a ghost, one night be an angel and one night be a cat,” Scharf said. “They can take these simple accessories, like cat ears or a halo, and be able to repurpose their costume throughout Halloween weekend.”\n\nOver the past few years, Scharf has noticed Halloween has transitioned from a children’s holiday to an adult holiday.\n\n“So we get a lot of adults coming in going crazy with their costumes because they’re going to parties or hosting parties,” Scharf said. “It’s just fun for adults to dress up — they stress all year long, and it’s the one time of year they can let loose, act the way they want to act, dress the way they want to dress, and it’s really turned into a super-fun holiday for everybody.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/08/09/another-retailer-lands-deal-amazon-time-its-party-city/950770002/", "title": "Another retailer lands a deal with Amazon: This time, it's Party City", "text": "Lauren Thomas\n\nCNBC\n\nAnother retailer is tying itself up with Amazon. This time, it's Party City.\n\nIn tandem with reporting second-quarter earnings, the retailer on Thursday said it would be rolling out a pilot program on Amazon ahead of the Halloween season this year. Party City will offer an assortment of items on Amazon to start, but with a big focus on Halloween costumes, the company said.\n\nJust within the past year, a number of brands have announced similar initiatives, partnering with the e-commerce giant that is taking a larger and larger share of retail sales online. That list of companies now includes Sears Holdings, Nike, Chico's, Calvin Klein and Carter's, to name a few.\n\nHalloween meanwhile is Party City's biggest selling season, and consumer spending across the U.S. on Halloween-related merchandise continues to climb. Spending on items like costumes, candy and pumpkins reached a record $9.1 billion in 2017, according to an annual survey by the National Retail Federation. That was up more than 8 percent from a previous record of $8.4 billion in 2016.\n\nParty City CEO James Harrison said the company's goal with the Amazon pilot is to reach customers who are increasingly gravitating toward shopping online, including millennials.\n\n\"[T]he program also creates an additional channel of distribution that allows us to leverage our dynamic manufacturing and distribution capabilities,\" he said in a statement. Party City will continue to run its own website.\n\nThe party goods retailer said it expects the pilot program will eventually expand to other product categories for Christmas and the New Year, \"with further expansion possible in 2019.\"\n\n\"Amazon is like the most trafficked mall,\" Party City CFO Dan Sullivan told CNBC. \"Our intent is to put up another storefront\" that will complement Party City's existing locations and online business, he explained, not to cannibalize anything.\n\nIn the wake of Toys R Us' demise, Party City is also making a bigger push into the toy category and plans to open 50 Toy City pop-up stores ahead of the holidays. The company didn't say Thursday if it would test selling toys on Amazon.\n\nUnlike its costumes business — which is either manufactured or sourced by Party City 95 percent of the time — Party City will still rely on outside vendors for their toy merchandise. The company said on a call with analysts and investors Thursday that it wasn't considering beginning to manufacture its own toys in the near future. \"We don't aim to be Walmart or Target,\" Sullivan later told CNBC.\n\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2018 ended June 30, Party City's sales climbed 3 percent to $561 million, falling slightly short of Wall Street's expectations for $563.9 million, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.\n\nNet income rose to $28.5 million, or 29 cents a share, compared with $25 million, or 21 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding one-time items, Party City earned 40 cents a share, a penny above analysts' estimates and compared with earnings per share of 28 cents for the same period last year.\n\nThe company didn't change its full-year outlook and still expects to bring in as much as $2.49 billion in sales and earn between $1.76 and $1.87 a share, on an adjusted basis. The Street had forecast Party City's sales to be $2.48 billion for fiscal 2018, with net income of $1.84 per share.\n\nAccording to CFO Sullivan, it's still \"premature\" to think about the Amazon pilot and Toy City pop-up stores contributing to Party City's earnings, hence why the company didn't hike its expectations. \"We are set on learning and evaluating how the customer shops,\" he said. He also didn't rule out Party City opening a more permanent toy location in the future.\n\nParty City shares rose nearly 5 percent in trading Thursday morning on the news. The stock has climbed nearly 13 percent so far this year, bringing Party City's market cap to $1.6 billion.\n\n© CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Americans are expected to fork out $9.1 billion on the festivities this year, according to a 2017 Halloween survey from the National Retail Federation.\n\nParticipating consumers are expected to spend an average of $86.13 on Halloween in 2017, more than last year’s $82.93, according to the NRF. Some 69% of Halloween shoppers plan to buy costumes for a projected total of $3.4 billion.\n\nHalloween is a big spending holiday because of its widespread appeal for adults and children alike, says Joyce Hicks, associate professor of business at Saint Mary’s College in Notre Dame, Indiana. All that spending makes Halloween a huge money maker for retailers. Costumes are often expensive because consumers are willing to pay the prices, Hicks says — especially for popular characters.\n\n“A good retailer knows if the demand is going to be that high, they can actually up-charge and mark up the costume even more than they originally planned,” she says.\n\nMore: Badass feminist Halloween costumes for 2017\n\nMore: Fall deals: What to buy in October\n\nMore: These are the most popular Halloween costumes for kids and adults for 2017\n\nSpookily simple strategies to save\n\nSo are you stuck paying a high price for something you wear only one day out of the year? Not so fast.\n\n“There’s Thanksgiving and Christmas, but for whatever reason, you hardly ever hear anyone talk about a Halloween budget,” says Nora Yousif, associate vice president at RBC Wealth Management in the Boston area.\n\nBut budgeting can work for this holiday, too. If you plan to celebrate, Yousif recommends setting aside some money to devote to Halloween and then being smart about how you spend that allocation.\n\nTo help you out, we rounded up tips from experts. These won’t help you decide whether to be Wonder Woman or Minnie Mouse, but they can help you cut costs on whatever outfit you don.\n\nStick to a list. Hicks likens being unprepared in a Halloween pop-up store to shopping at a grocery store when you’re hungry; you’ll spend more than you planned. Know what you want to find before you let your eyes take over. For instance, instead of throwing accessories into your cart, decide you need a mask and cape — and that’s it.\n\nDo it yourself. Sometimes accessories are all you need. Many shoppers buy a few items and combine them with pieces from home rather than buy an entire costume, says Devin Rubink, spokesman for HalloweenCostumes.com. Your unique creation will save money and make you less likely to compete in a “who wore it better?” contest.\n\nPick a different version of the same character. Superheroes and movie characters are among the top 2017 costume trends, Rubink says. But there are often multiple versions of the same character, so find one that fits your needs. “We have 113 items in our Wonder Woman costume page, so they can shop for the style they want or they can shop at the price point they want,” he says of HalloweenCostumes.com.\n\nSkip your first choice. Your second or third choice might be more affordable than your first. Trendy costumes will likely see higher demand and higher prices, so consider going with something that’s more likely to be discounted, Hicks recommends. For instance, if there are too many ghosts left on the shelf, the store will want to unload them.\n\nExpand your search. Yousif says you’ll generally pay a premium for items in the Halloween section, but you can usually find accessories or makeup in other departments for less. There’s always the thrift store, too.\n\nDon’t lose sight of November. While decorations can be used year after year, Hicks points out that many consumers throw away their costumes once Nov. 1 arrives. So when the expensive accessories start calling your name, remember that Halloween is just one day.\n\nStay true to your finances.\n\nHicks says there’s a sense of unaccountability associated with Halloween. After all, you’re wearing a costume that masks your true identity. But don’t let that unaccountability spill over into your spending. “Anything that’s outside of your budget should not be included in your purchase,” she says.\n\nMore shopping tips from NerdWallet\n\nCourtney Jespersen is a writer at NerdWallet.

Meanwhile, a white supremacist “fight” club in California includes current and former military members, a new investigation finds. And the opening of a virtual Holocaust museum inside the game Minecraft is temporarily delayed by racist protests.\n\nIt’s the week in extremism.\n\nHate machine: How social media platforms push extremism\n\nThe world’s largest social media platforms are still hosting antisemitic and hateful content, and their algorithms push users towards additional extremist material, according to two new reports provided exclusively to USA TODAY this week.\n\nResearchers at the Anti-Defamation League and Tech Transparency Project tested social media algorithms by creating six fictional accounts — four for adults and two for teenagers — on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nWhen the accounts searched for antisemitic and other racist content, all of the platforms except YouTube suggested additional pages and content along similar lines, one study found.\n\nInstagram, in particular, directed a fictional account for a 14-year-old toward neo-Nazi content, including a video interview with the American Nazi Party founder saying: “The main thing we are fighting for is the preservation of the white race.”\n\n“I think it's definitely intentional, and I think it's based off greed,” content creator and activist Natasha Zinda told USA TODAY. “I very much believe the system is working as intended.”\n\nFacebook and Instagram owner Meta said in an emailed statement that hate has no place on its platforms: \"We've made progress in fighting antisemitism on our platforms, and our work is never done.”\n\nWhite supremacist 'active club' includes US military\n\nA white supremacist “active club” in California counts as its members serving and former members of the U.S. military, according to an investigation by The Guardian published this week.\n\n“Active clubs,” otherwise called “fight clubs” recruit members to train in martial arts and also to harass and intimidate political adversaries.\n\nAs the Guardian story notes: “Their recruitment among active and former members of the military underscores both the broadening appeal of the fitness-centric organizing model and the American armed services’ persistent struggle with extremism within the ranks.”\n\nUSA TODAY’s investigation last month revealed that the U.S. military continues to fall short in its effort to combat extremism in the ranks. Earlier this month, an internal military audit confirmed those concerns, finding military recruiters weren’t screening eligible recruits for ties to extremism 40 percent of the time.\n\nInvestigation:The military ordered big steps to stop extremism. Two years later, it shows no results\n\nFortnite Holocaust museum launch delayed by harassment\n\nIndependent video game designer Luc Bernard, who created a Holocaust museum for the hugely popular online game Fortnite, has delayed the museum’s launch because of online harassment, according to a report in artnet news.\n\nThe museum, which was approved by Epic games, which developed Fortnite, is to feature galleries detailing the atrocities of the Holocaust and exhibits dedicated to people who resisted the Nazis.\n\nBernard briefly delayed the launch of the museum after Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes posted about it Bernard on his Telegram account: “I’m waiting until things die down,” Bernard said. “I just don’t want the Nazis to go in it and do Nazi things when it launches.”\n\nThe museum launched on Monday.\n\nReached by direct message on Thursday, Bernard told USA TODAY “Things have gotten a lot better” regarding the harassment.\n\nStatistic of the week: 3 million\n\nThat’s the value – in dollars – of a Bitcoin transfer sent to internet hosting company Epik shortly after the company announced its servers had been hacked in 2021, according to a new report by Southern Poverty Law Center researchers.\n\nEpik is notorious for hosting white supremacist and other extremist websites, including far-right YouTube clone BitChute.\n\nThe researchers were unable to confirm who sent Epik the bitcoin, but said that a few days later, those funds and others were transferred to a Malaysian businessman.\n\nMore:He infiltrated a white supremacist group.

Ron DeSantis has had a meteoric rise in the Republican party. After cementing his status as a national figure during the pandemic, the governor turned his focus to education policy. As part of an all-out assault on what he views as the progressive indoctrination of American children, DeSantis has moved to overhaul Florida's school system.\n\nNo more AP African American Studies?Gov. Ron DeSantis' feud with the College Board over the course, explained\n\nThe governor's education policy spans detailed reviews of classroom reading materials and restrictions on how sexuality and race can be discussed with students.\n\nAs DeSantis gears up for a rumored presidential run, here's a look at his efforts to remake education in the Sunshine State so far:\n\nThe Stop WOKE Act\n\nThe Stop WOKE Act, passed in 2022, was a sweeping legislative actionaimed at limiting the way gender and race are discussed in classrooms and workplaces.\n\nThe legislation prohibits instruction stating that a person's race or sex makes them inherently biased or that a person is responsible for the actions of their sex or race throughout history.\n\nUsed since the early-to-mid 20th century by Black Americans to signal an awareness of social and racial injustice, \"woke\" has been co-opted by the GOP as a sort of umbrella term for progressive ideology.\n\nWhile there is no broad consensus across the GOP of what \"woke\" means, its so-called presence in academic institutions is a popular point of attack for political hopefuls. \"It's kind of this lumping together of anybody whose views could be construed as being progressive on issues related to identity and civil rights,\" Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory University in Georgia, told USA TODAY.\n\nDuring a trial with former Hillsborough state attorney Andrew Warren, who was suspended, in part, because the governor viewed his politics as \"woke,\" DeSantis' lawyer Ryan Newman defined the term as \"the belief there are systemic injustices in American society and the need to address them.\"\n\n'Don’t Say Gay' bill\n\nOne of DeSantis' most high-profile moveswas the signing of the Parental Rights in Education Bill, nicknamed \"Don't Say Gay'\" by opponents over its limiting of discussions on gender and sexuality.\n\nCritics characterized the bill as censorship disguised as protection for children. The bill restricts \"classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity in certain grade levels or in a specified manner.\" It bars school employees from keeping information shared with them about a student's mental or physical well-being from parents.\n\nAdvocates for the bill touted the increased control it granted parents.\n\nThe bill, passed originally in 2022, was expanded this past year to ban classroom instruction on both gender identity and sexuality in grades K-12. The expansion also prohibits teachers from using pronouns for students that do not correspond to their sex at birth.\n\nIs the magic still there? Disney fans react to feud with DeSantis, Florida lawmakers\n\nDeSantis' revenge:Florida governor takes over Disney district on eve of book launch\n\nBook bans\n\nUnder DeSantis, Florida passed a law requiring all books available to children to be approved by a \"district employee holding a valid educational media specialist certificate.\"\n\nAlarm spread fast as books were removed entirely from campuses so they could be reviewed. Brian Covey, a parent at Greenland Pines Elementary in Duval County, uploaded a video to Twitter in January that quickly went viral showing library shelves wiped clean. Andrew Spar, president of the Florida Education Association told The New Yorker in February that teachers in roughly one-third of the state's counties had been instructed to remove or cover up books until further review.\n\nThe law bars any content deemed \"pornographic\" or \"not suited to student needs,\" a classification so broad some teachers began removing books early as a precaution against legal action. Once the training guidelines for media specialists were released, not all those books were in violation – though the rules are stringent, explicitly warning against \"the use of any unsolicited theories or strategies that may lead to student indoctrination.\"\n\nIn response, the Florida teacher's union joined other groups in filing a lawsuit against the state Department of Education alleging the law is overreaching and will lead to censorship.\n\nThe DeSantis administration rejected dozens of textbooks in early May, citing their inclusion of \"contested topics.\"\n\nTeacher's Unions\n\nIn early May, DeSantis signed a law that levied tough new requirements on public-sector unions, including those that represent teachers and healthcare workers.\n\nCalling it a \"very productive day for education,\" DeSantis approved the legislation that prohibits paycheck deduction for union fees and ups the employee membership requirement to 60%.\n\nThe law also places term limits on school board members, approves raises and training programs for teachers, implements a Teachers' Bill of Rights and restricts TikTok and social media access on school Wi-Fi.\n\nDeSantis takes on higher education\n\nDeSantis holds a veto-proof supermajority in the state Legislature, giving him a unique opportunity to use the state as both a policy lab and a powerful launching pad for a presidential run.\n\nA new bill, HB 999: Public Postsecondary Educational Institutions, tests that power. If enacted, the legislation would significantly weaken professor tenure at state institutions, giving political appointees like university presidents and trustees the power to review it at any time.\n\nIn addition,students at public universities would be explicitly barred from majoring or minoring in subjects pertaining to critical race theory, intersectionality, or gender studies. University faculty would be prohibited from providing courses that deal with \"identity politics\" – long a hot-button issue for the right. The phrase is not defined, which may prompt professors to censor themselves out of fear of violating the law.\n\nThe law would also restrict universities from considering diversity, equity and inclusion measures in their hiring process and from doing business with other institutions that do. In May, DeSantis signed an additional bill banning state funding for diversity, equity and inclusion programs at public universities. The bill was one of three signed at a New College of Florida ceremony. The legislation, taken as a package, restricts the way race and gender can be taught on university campuses, prohibits students and faculty from having to pledge a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and expands apprenticeship programs.\n\nDeSantis has said the hope is to tip the balance in what he views as a predominantly left-leaning culture at many Florida colleges.\n\nNew College of Florida\n\nDeSantis' plan for remakinghigher education has already begun at a small liberal arts institution in Sarasota. The New College of Florida, a public university, is the first stop in DeSantis' foray into combatting \"wokeness\" on college campuses.\n\nEarly in 2023, DeSantis remade the board of trustees, installing a ream of conservative allies. The new board then fired President Patricia Okker and replaced her with DeSantis' former education commissioner Richard Corcoran.\n\nFlorida's education commissioner Manny Diaz said the vision is to turn the New College, which describes itself as a \"community of free thinkers,\" into \"a Hillsdale of the south.\" Hillsdale College, a Christian university in Michigan, has been for decades a rampart of conservative thought and political power.\n\nCritics have lamented the shift which, they say, compromises the campus' status as a blue speck in an increasingly red state. \"This is nothing more than a transparent attempt to score political points regardless of how many people are hurt, fired or lose this place as their home,\" X Gonzalez, a New College alumni and survivor of the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, said at a board meeting.\n\nSome private donors have also signaled distaste for DeSantis' changes and indicated they may pull funding.\n\nLGBTQ youth, transgender rights\n\nIn 2021, DeSantis signed a bill banning transgender athletes from competing on women’s public school teams, at both the high school and collegiate level, a growing trend across red states.\n\nThe governor has been a vocal opponent of gender-affirming care. \"I think these doctors need to get sued,\" DeSantis said of physicians who treat gender dysphoria.\n\nIn January, the governor sent a survey to Florida's 12 public universities and 28 state and community colleges asking them to report if they provide transgender health services to students. The survey also asked for detailed information like how much they spend, student ages, hormone prescriptions and medical procedures.\n\nTwo additional bills, one in the Florida state Senate and one in the House, have been introduced to expand \"Don't Say Gay\" to include pronoun restrictions, barring school employees from asking students their preferred pronouns and from sharing their own if they differ from their sex at birth.\n\nAP African American Studies ban\n\nEarlier this year, DeSantis made national news for banning a pilot course in AP African American Studies. The curriculum was still in its pilot phase when the DeSantis administration said it would not be offered in Florida, claiming it violated state law.\n\nDeSantis said he was not against the teaching of Black history – merely the specific content of this course. His main gripe? References to intersectionality, Critical Race Theory and \"queer theory,\" which he said pushed an agenda. \"We want education, not indoctrination,\" the governor said.\n\nWhen the College Board released the official curriculum months later, controversy ensued over changes that seemed to reflect specific points of contention DeSantis had raised. The College Board adamantly denied any outside influence but, after fierce backlash, signaled in April that it planned to revisit the course material.\n\nCritical race theory\n\nDeSantis is a vocal opponent of critical race theory. If passed, HB 999 would bar the teaching of any critical race theory principles in higher education and prevent any Florida students from majoring in subjects related to the philosophy.\n\nA concept used in both academic and legal settings, critical race theory posits that racism is systemic in American society, baked into the institutions of the country from the courts to the doctor's office.\n\nThough it is generally reserved for college-level courses and higher, a nationwide panic over the idea has torn through the GOP. A tracking project from the University of California, Los Angeles' School of Law identified over 200 local state, and federal government entities that have introduced anti-CRT legislation and statements since 2020.\n\nAt the same time DeSantis has attacked the teaching of Black history and systemic racism in Florida classrooms, DeSantis signed a bill in May mandating the teaching of Asian American and Pacific Islander history in K-12 classrooms. The bill was met with some backlash from activists in the community, however, who said other communities of color were having their history erased from curriculums. “Racial justice can’t be a zero-sum game for communities of color,” Gregg Orton, the national director of National Council of Asian Pacific Americans told NBC news.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/03/19/the-35-most-popular-craft-breweries-beer-destinations-in-america/111421420/", "title": "Favorite breweries: 35 of the most popular beer destinations in the US", "text": "Colman Andrews\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nWhen the first colonists arrived in New England in the early 17th century, they started brewing beer – not making wine. Wine grapes didn’t grow well in the Northeast, and, anyway, the colonists came from England, where beer was the principal tipple.\n\nEver since then, and despite the increasing popularity of wine – and recently of hard seltzer – we’ve been a nation of beer drinkers. According to a Gallup poll released last summer, some 38% of Americans – and 55% of men – who drink alcohol prefer beer to wine or liquor. (You might be surprised to learn how much beer the average person drank in every state.)\n\nMost of what we drink is mass-produced, primarily by brands owned by one of two companies – Anheuser-Busch InBev and MillerCoors. More than 29 million barrels of Anheuser-Busch’s Bud Light – America’s best-selling beer – alone were shipped in 2018. In comparison, the total shipped by all of the country’s estimated 7,500-plus craft breweries combined amounts to 25.9 million barrels.\n\nThat may be a fraction of what the big boys sell, but it represents an impressive growth for craft beer from the mere 9.1 million barrels shipped in 2009. As Forbes put it last year, “the craft beer revolution is still going strong.” The craft brewing industry’s market share reached 13.2% in 2018, and sales grew 7% over 2017, to $27.6 billion. And craft breweries are a nationwide phenomenon: The industry group Brewers Association reports that a majority of Americans live within 10 miles of a craft brewer.\n\nThe homeowner advice and review site House Method recently crunched the numbers to determine the most popular craft breweries in America, both overall and state-by-state. (Brewers Association defines a craft brewery as one producing no more than 6 million barrels a year and is independent in the sense that no more than 25% is owned or controlled by a beverage alcohol company that is not itself a craft brewer.) A number of these are responsible for some of the 40 most delicious beers in America.\n\nThis list of the 35 most popular American breweries, as computed by House Method, shows a wide geographical spread, with representatives stretching from Oregon to Florida and from Maine to California. California, however, is the clear winner here, with 11 breweries out of 35 – and the western states hold a slight majority overall, with 19 of the 35. (One facility, the Ballast Point brewery in Daleville, Virginia – originally listed at No. 13 – is no longer operating in its original form.)\n\nWherever they’re located, though, and whether or not their beers are available nationally or only locally, all these breweries have earned an avid following for their first-rate brews.\n\nTo determine America’s most popular breweries, House Method considered four factors: number of Facebook followers, number of Instagram followers, Yelp score, and number of Yelp reviews.\n\nCall your credit card issuer:Fees or payments may be waived as coronavirus disrupts lives\n\n35. Firestone Walker Brewing Co.\n\n• Location: Buellton, California\n\nThis operation was founded in the California Central Coast town of Paso Robles 1996 by David Walker and his brother-in-law, Adam Firestone – great-great-grandson of the founder of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. While the original facility (see No. 15) produces a wide range of beers, this Buellton location, styled the Barrelworks, specializes in what the brewery calls “eccentric wild ales” – for instance Violet Underground, flavored with raspberries and candied violet petals, and El Gourdo, a wild roasted pumpkin ale. Belgium’s Duvel Moortgat company now owns the company (it also owns Kansas City’s Boulevard Brewing Co.; see No. 28).\n\n34. Saint Arnold Brewing Company\n\n• Location: Houston, Texas\n\nShipping its first keg in 1994, Saint Arnold claims to be the oldest craft brewery in Texas. When they launched their business, founders Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol chose Houston, they said, because it was then the largest city in America without a microbrewery. Their range of beers includes several hoppy IPAs and lagers, such seasonal choices as a crisp Summer Pils and a hearty Imperial pumpkin stout called Pumpkinator, and a chocolate milk stout called Icon Blue.\n\n33. The Alchemist\n\n• Location: Stowe, Vermont\n\nThe Alchemist began as a brew pub in the village of Waterbury. This evolved into the Alchemist Cannery, which quickly gained famed for its Heady Topper IPA. That offering is still made in Waterbury, but the brewery's main facility, complete with visitor's center, is now in Stowe.\n\n32. Wicked Weed Brewing\n\n• Location: Asheville, North Carolina\n\nOwned by two families, Wicked Weed started as a brewpub in 2012, and now produces 25 different craft beers, including West Coast-style IPAs and barrel-aged sour ales. Featured beers currently include Hop Cocoa, a porter brewed with cocoa nibs, and an IPA called Pernicious. (Note: Anheuser-Busch acquired the brewery in 2017.)\n\n31. Sleepy Dog Brewing\n\n• Location: Tempe, Arizona\n\nWith brews like Wet Snout Peanut Butter Stout and Feisty Chihuahua Mexican Lager, Sleepy Dog has been devoted, over its nine-plus years of existence, to \"Man's two best friends\" – i.e., beer and canines. It participates in dog adoption programs and teams with \"local animal shelters and organizations to help bring beer lovers and dogs together.\" Chicago's Two Brothers Brewing Company bought Sleepy Dog in 2017, and the beer is now available in Illinois as well as Arizona.\n\n30. Printer's Row Brewing\n\n• Location: Chicago, Illinois\n\nLaunched in 2016 in Chicago's historic Printer's Row neighborhood, this operation describes itself as \"another great, quality craft beer in the Chicago landscape of ever-growing micro breweries.\" Its catalogue includes a porter called Cannonball and an American blonde ale called Bookbinder.\n\nCoronavirus pandemic:How utility, phone and internet companies are giving consumers a break\n\nCoronavirus store closings:Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue closing all stores\n\n29. Spoetzl Brewery\n\n• Location: Shiner, Texas\n\nGenerations of beer-lovers, Texan and otherwise, have enjoyed Shiner Bock and other specialties from this historic brewery, established in 1909 in the town of Shiner, southeast of Austin. Shiner Bock was introduced in 1913, and two years later, German master brewer Kosmos Spoetzl bought the facility, giving it his name.\n\n28. Boulevard Brewing Co.\n\n• Location: Kansas City, Missouri\n\nThe first Boulevard Pale Ale rolled out of what was originally a 35-barrel brewhouse in 1989. Since then, the brewery has grown exponentially. In 2013, Belgium's Duvel Moortgat company, whose famous Duvel beer was an early inspiration to Boulevard founder John McDonald, bought the company. Today, the brewery's headquarters includes a Tours & Rec Center, complete with a deck offering tabletop shuffleboard.\n\n27. The Bruery\n\n• Location: Anaheim, California\n\nThe Bruery, a boutique craft brewery focused on barrel-aged and experimental ales, was founded by one-time law student and home brewer Patrick Rue (hence \"Bruery\") in 2008. Among the beers in Rue's repertoire are Goses Are Red (a rosÃ© version of the German-style sour ale type called gose) and Ruekeller Helles (Helles is a kind of malty German lager).\n\n26. Funky Buddha Brewery\n\n• Location: Oakland Park, Florida\n\nOriginally a tea and hookah bar that evolved into a craft beer lounge and one-barrel brewhouse, Funky Buddha opened a new full-scale brewery facility in 2013 near the Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport. Its range of beers includes Hop Gun IPA, Vibin' Groovable Lager, and Manhattan Double Rye Ale. (Note: Constellation Brands, which also owns Corona and Modelo, acquired Funky Buddha in 2017.)\n\n25. Deschutes Brewery\n\n• Location: Bend, Oregon\n\nA brewery with a nearby \"public house\" that has been a fixture in Bend since 1988, Deschutes has a social conscience. It announces on its website that \"We are committed to the craft beer industry and our community by honoring our mission [t]o profitably deliver the world's finest adult beverages and cultivate extraordinary experiences.\" Those adult beverages include Lil' Squeezy Juicy Ale, Fresh Haze IPA, and a seasonal Tangelo and Cardamom Sour Ale.\n\n24. Oskar Blues Brewery (North Carolina)\n\n• Location: Brevard, North Carolina\n\nOskar Blues has three brewery/taproom locations, in Austin, Texas, and Longmont, Colorado, as well as this one in North Carolina. (There's also a taproom/restaurant in Boulder, Colorado.) A \"wee heavy\" Scotch ale called Old Chub, an American Imperial red ale dubbed G'Knight, and a German-style pilsner known as Mama's Little Yella Pils are some of its beers. (Oskar Blues Brewery in 2015 became part of a collection of craft breweries controlled by Fireman Capital Partners now called CANarchy.)\n\n23. Russian River Brewing Co.\n\n• Location: Santa Rosa, California\n\nRussian River is a brewery born out of a winery, founded by Sonoma County's Korbel Champagne Cellars in 1997. One of its best-known beers, Pliny the Elder, was one of America's first Imperial IPAs. Among its many other offerings is a Triple IPA – meaning that's it's particularly high in alcohol with lots of hops – called Pliny the Younger. The brewery recently opened a second location in Windsor, just up Highway 101 from Santa Rosa.\n\nState taxes:Tourism, energy and other industries help offset lack of income taxes in these states\n\nHot car brands:Cheaper gas prices help fuel sales of these 25 cars, SUVs and trucks\n\n22. Left Hand Brewing Co.\n\n• Location: Longmont, Colorado\n\n\"Damn Good Beer Because of Damn Good People\" is this nearly 27-year-old brewery's motto. In addition to producing such brews as Nitro Milk Stout and Death Disco Porter, Left Hand runs a foundation supporting community, cultural, and medical projects; an employee-based group raising money to combat multiple sclerosis; and an initiative called Ales4FemAles, dedicated to \"empowering and educating women in the world of craft beer.\"\n\n21. Green Flash Brewing Co.\n\n• Location: San Diego, California\n\nEstablished in 2002, this brewery draws on recipe ideas from employees to create a range of small-batch beers, sold in cans. West Coast IPA, Baja Bound Lager, and Beter – an organic wheat ale brewed with aÃ§aÃ­ berries and black tea – are some of the results.\n\n20. Four Peaks Brewing Co.\n\n• Location: Tempe, Arizona\n\nFour Peaks opened as a brewpub in 1997 in a 19th-century ice house that later became a creamery and then a recording studio. Today, it operates a brewery in the space, as well as a second brewery nearby and pubs in Scottsdale and Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport, and is owned nationwide by Anheuser-Busch. Its flagship brew is Kilt Lifter, a full-bodied Scottish-style ale.\n\n19. Allagash Brewing Co.\n\n• Location: Portland, Maine\n\nSpecializing in Belgian-style beers, Allagash opened in 1995, initially producing only a single brew, a wheat beer called Allagash White, flavored with coriander and orange peel. In 2007, the brewery made beer history by producing the first lambic – a spontaneously fermented Belgian ale – on American soil, Coolship Resurgam.\n\n18. Harpoon Brewery (Massachusetts)\n\n• Location: Boston, Massachusetts\n\nBoston's Harpoon Brewery (there's also a branch in Windsor, Vermont, purchased in 2000) received the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Brewing Permit #001 in 1986, and a few years later released New England's first seasonal craft beer – Harpoon Winter Warmer, flavored with cinnamon and nutmeg. Employee-owned today, Harpoon makes everything from a straightforward IPA to a coffee porter co-branded with Dunkin'.\n\n17. Cigar City Brewing Co.\n\n• Location: Tampa, Florida\n\nLong a major producer of cigars, Tampa's nickname is Cigar City, and the first beer released by the brewery that borrowed that sobriquet when it opened in 2007 was called Maduro Brown Ale – \"maduro\" being a type of cigar with mature dark-brown leaves. It's still produced, but so are such non-tobacco-related beers as Cubano Espresso, Florida Man (a double IPA), and a barleywine-style ale aged in whiskey barrels and flavored with cherries and vanilla that goes by the name of Excessive and Lustful Kissing. (Like Oskar Blues, Cigar City Brewing is part of CANarchy.)\n\n16. Bell's Brewery\n\n• Location: Kalamazoo, Michigan\n\nLarry Bell opened a home brewers' supply store in Kalamazoo in 1983, and produced his own initial commercial beer – brewed in a 15-gallon soup pot – two years later. The first version of what was to become an iconic Bell's beer, Two Hearted Ale (made with Wisconsin hops and English malt) appeared in 1997. Today, the main Bell's brewery is in Comstock, near Kalamazoo, but the original location remains, as the Bell's website puts it, \"a home to innovation.\"\n\n15. Firestone Walker Brewing Co.\n\n• Location: Paso Robles, California\n\nThis operation founded in 1996 by David Walker and his brother-in-law, Adam Firestone (of the Firestone tire family) makes a variety of beers, including a number of IPAs, along with such specialties as Rosalie (a beer brewed with hibiscus and wine grapes) and a “cocktail inspired” blended ale called Old Man Hattan. Firestone Walker has two other California locations – a “Barrelworks” in Buellton (see No. 35) and what it calls its Propagator, a restaurant/lounge plus taproom and barrel cellar, in Venice. Like Kansas City’s Boulevard Brewing Co. (see No. 28), Firestone Walker is now owned by Belgium’s Duvel Moortgat company.\n\nIt's not just toilet paper:People line up to buy guns, ammo over coronavirus concerns\n\nWorking at home because of coronavirus?:Be careful what you download to keep cybersafe\n\n14. Rogue Ales Brewery\n\n• Location: Newport, Oregon\n\nThe original Rogue Public House in Ashland, opened in 1988, was lost to flooding. A second location, in Newport, southwest of Salem on the Oregon coast, became Rogue headquarters, and today there are also facilities in Portland, Astoria, Independence, and the Washington town of Issaquah. Rogue produces a variety of ales and lagers, as well as a line of distilled spirits and a few canned cocktails.\n\n13. Stone Brewing Co.\n\n• Location: Escondido, California\n\nTwo beer-lovers who met in the music business in L.A. collaborated on Stone Brewing Co., opening in 1996. Stone Pale Ale was their first beer. That's still made, but has been joined by a number of other IPAs, including a number of special releases available only once a year, or for one year only.\n\n12. Binary Brewing Co.\n\n• Location: Portland, Oregon\n\n\"Good beer is like software – in the end it's binary,\" reads the motto of this brewery operating out of Portland's Uptown Beer Co. taproom and bottle shop. Binary produces a number of seasonal and year-round IPAs, pale ales, etc., – many with computer-related names, like CTRL-ALT-DEL Irish Stout and Hack the Planet Pale Ale.\n\n11. Lagunitas Brewing Co. (Illinois)\n\n• Location: Chicago, Illinois\n\nOriginally founded in Northern California in the mid-1990s and still based there (see No. 6), Lagunitas also has brewpubs in Seattle and the Southern California city of Azusa. In 2014, the company opened a 300,000-square-foot second brewery, in Chicago. Lagunitas IPA leads the product lineup. (Note: Heineken acquired full ownership of Lagunitas in 2017.)\n\n10. Anchor Brewing Co.\n\n• Location: San Francisco, California\n\nAnchor traces its origins to a brewery established by a German immigrant named Gottlieb Brekle in 1871, but the first bottled Anchor Steam Beer didn't appear until a century later. The beer selection expanded over the years to include such landmarks as Anchor Summer Wheat, the first American wheat beer since Prohibition, and a one-time-only beer called Ninkasi – an attempt to reproduce a 4,000-year-old Sumerian beer.\n\n9. Hodad's Brewing Co.\n\n• Location: San Diego, California\n\nHodad's is a brand extension of the small local burger chain of the same name, which dates from 1969. (\"Hodad\" is old surfer slang for a surfer wannabe.) The brewery supplies craft beers to the restaurants, including five seasonal locations inside Petco Park, home field for the San Diego Padres. The beers include Tablista (a Mexican-style lager called Tavlista), Boss Brew Kölsch (a German-inspired golden pale ale), and Hodaddy Hefeweizen (an unfiltered wheat beer).\n\nCoronavirus in the US:Here's everything to know, from symptoms to how to protect yourself\n\nWFH advice:Everything you need to work from home during the coronavirus outbreak\n\n8. Lewis & Clark Brewing Co.\n\n• Location: Helena, Montana\n\nHome brewer Max Pigman bought Helena's Sleeping Giant Brewing Company in 2001, changing the name to honor 19th-century explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark four years later. He operated the brewery and a taproom at the original location for about nine years before moving into an old paint factory and expanding his brewing operations. Beers honor the history and landscape of the region, with names like Mt. Edith Barleywine, Meriwether IPA, and Yellowstone Golden Ale.\n\n7. Ballast Point Brewing Co. (California)\n\n• Location: San Diego, California\n\nStarted by a group of San Diego home brewers in 1996, Ballast Point subsequently opened three tasting rooms in its home city, as well as one each in Anaheim and Long Beach, California, and another in Chicago. After it was purchased by the massive Constellation Brands, an additional tasting room and brewery were established in Virginia, but that is now closed. Constellation subsequently sold Ballast Point to Kings & Convicts, a small Illinois craft brewer.\n\n6. Lagunitas Brewing Co. (California)\n\n• Location: Petaluma, California\n\nThis brewery's founder, Tony Magee, started making beer with a stovetop homebrew kit in Northern California in 1993. His early efforts, he admits, \"ranged from vile and repugnant, to delicate and exceptional.\" As his enterprise grew, he moved first to an old storage shed, then to a full-scale brewery, later opening a second brewery in Chicago (see No. 11) and brewpubs in Seattle and Azusa (near Los Angeles). In addition to the well-known Lagunitas IPA, offerings include everything from a low-cal, low-carb IPA called DayTime to Cherry Jane Sour Ale, brewed with Turkish delight cherry juice.\n\n5. Dogfish Head Craft Brewery\n\n• Location: Milton, Delaware\n\nIn 1995, Sam Calagione opened Dogfish Head Brewings & Eats, a brewpub and restaurant with, in Delaware's Rehoboth Beach. Brewing operations expanded, and the main brewery moved inland to Milton. Here, Dogfish Head became one of the early proponents of so-called extreme beer, generally higher in alcohol than ordinary brews and flavored with unusual ingredients – for instance, its Bourbon Barrel-Aged Fruit-Full Fort, made with four kinds of fresh berries and boasting a 17% ABV. Now the nation's 13th-largest craft beer producer by sales volume, Dogfish Head merged last year with the Boston Beer Co. (see No. 2), though the operations remain separate.\n\n4. Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.\n\n• Location: Chico, California\n\nSierra Nevada, which was born in 1980, is one of the largest craft producers in America – due in part to the fact that the California original expanded with a brewery in Mills River, North Carolina, in 2015. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is the concern's best-known brew, but the extensive range includes Kellerweis (a Bavarian-style wheat beer), Hop Bullet (a double IPA), and Narwahl (an Imperial stout) – and after 2018's Camp Fire destroyed much of Butte County, Sierra Nevada's California home, they released a fundraising Resilience Butte County Proud IPA.\n\n3. Goose Island Brewery\n\n• Location: Chicago, Illinois\n\nThere is some disagreement in the beer community as to whether Goose Island should be considered a craft beer or not. It started life as a Chicago brewpub in 1988, expanding to a full-scale brewery in 1995. It continued to grow, and was acquired by brewing giant Anheuser-Busch (now Anheuser-Busch InBev) in 2011. Though the Chicago facility continues to produce the brand's high-end bottlings, its biggest-selling beers – including 312 Urban Wheat Ale and Honker's Ale – are produced at other several Anheuser-Busch breweries.\n\nCoronavirus and technology:The role of tech from telemedicine to Star Trek-like devices\n\nConfined amid coronavirus?:Here are best practices for remote-managing your small business\n\n2. Boston Beer Co.\n\n• Location: Boston, Massachusetts\n\nWith the distinction of being America's second-largest craft brewery in sales volume (first place is held by Pennsylvania's D.G. Yuengling & Son), Boston Beer Co. – whose most famous offering is Samuel Adams Boston Lager – was founded in 1984. Today, in addition to a range of Samuel Adams beers, it owns Delaware's Dogfish Head Craft Brewery (see No. 5), as well as Twisted Tea Hard Iced Tea, Angry Orchard Hard Cider, and several other brands.\n\n1. New Belgium Brewing Co.\n\n• Location: Fort Collins, Colorado\n\nNew Belgium founders fell in love with Belgian-style beers on a bike trip through Belgium, and launched their brewery in their basement in 1991. One of their first offerings, an amber ale called Fat Tire, became their emblematic brew. In addition to what evolved into a full-scale Colorado facility, New Belgium opened a second brewery in Asheville, North Carolina. Formerly 100% employee-owned – it was bought late last year by Lion Little World Beverages, a subsidiary of Japan's Kirin Holdings Co. – New Belgium is an environmentally conscious company: It boasts one of Colorado's largest solar arrays and has its own wastewater treatment plant;, and is a member of 1% for the Planet, a global environmental solutions movement.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

But veteran auto executives know that the industry's history is an unpredictable mix of hits and duds.\n\nThe most noticeable introductions will come at the opposite ends of the spectrum: two of the best-known pickup trucks and the new mass-market electric car from Tesla. The pickup wars will be especially vicious.\n\n\"You can't ignore a big truck,\" says Jessica Caldwell, analyst for Edmunds.com, the car-buying website. \"Anytime there's a truck, it's a big deal.\"\n\nMore:Infiniti unveils SUV with radical new engine tech\n\nMore:Electric car buyers will still get incentives under tax bill\n\nMore:Chevrolet unveils 2019 Silverado pickup -- and it's all about steel\n\nAs for the Tesla, she thinks the new Model 3, priced at $35,000 before incentives, or at roughly half the cost of the brand's existing luxury sedan and SUV, could finally bring electric cars to the masses.\n\n\"If they do 20,000 (deliveries to customers) a month, that is going to change the landscape,\" Caldwell said. By the end of 2018, the Model 3 could power electric-car sales to the point that they pass gas-electric hybrids for the first time.\n\nThat said, here's a list of some of the most important models that come to showrooms in 2018:\n\nTesla Model 3\n\nAll eyes will be on the Model 3, the test of whether the Silicon Valley automaker can pull average drivers out of their gasoline-powered cars and into a futuristic vehicle. A few are already on the road, mostly in the hands of Tesla employees, so it really hasn't hit the market yet. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the car is running behind schedule because it's in \"production hell.\" But the real question is whether the 400,000 admirers who plunked down $1,000 reservations will still be there when more of them roll off the assembly line.\n\nJeep Wrangler\n\nThis go-anywhere vehicle is the symbol of the Jeep brand, one of the most important assets of its owner, Fiat Chrysler. It is a direct descendant of the Army jeep that helped win World War II. For 2018, Jeep reengineered it using aluminum in some components, and added new engine choices while keeping its iconic look for diehard fans. Coming in the first three months of the year, it looks like Jeep successfully walked the tightrope of improving Wrangler while keeping it true to its roots.\n\nChevrolet Silverado\n\nGeneral Motors' full-size pickup is the nation's second-most-popular vehicle of any sort behind Ford's F-150. The big question was whether Chevy would follow Ford's lead in making extensive use of aluminum to lighten the vehicle and improve fuel economy. It didn't. Chevy is sticking by steel and promoting it as tougher than aluminum. Added bonus: Steel is cheaper.\n\nRam 1500\n\nThe nation's other popular pickup will debut at next month's North American International Auto Show in Detroit. But Ram, another Fiat Chrysler division, faces the same challenge as GM and Ford: winning over hidebound pickup buyers by adding capability and ruggedness while improving fuel economy. The new 1500 arrives in the first half of the year.\n\nSubaru Ascent\n\nThe Ascent fixes a big problem for Subaru, a high-flying brand that won over buyers with its outdoorsy image and all-wheel drive vehicles. Subaru buyers loved their vehicles, but outgrew them as their families got larger and had no where to turn but the competition. Ascent takes over the large SUV space that Subaru left behind with the oddly-styled Tribeca.\n\nLexus RXL\n\n\"The luxury mommy-mobile is getting bigger,\" Caldwell says. Lexus has already created a devoted following with its two-row RX midsize SUV. Now it is extending it by 4.3 inches to create a three-row model with a name aimed at capturing the warm feelings for the RX. It will also come in a hybrid version.\n\nToyota Avalon\n\nCars are out of favor with buyers compared with SUVs, and large cars haven't caught fire either. But Toyota's Avalon has done better than most. A new version comes to the auto show in Detroit and it will hit showrooms later in the year. It will give Toyota fresh product to go up against other full-size competitors like Ford Taurus, Chevrolet Impala and Nissan Maxima.\n\nFord EcoSport\n\nFord was late to the party when it brought a small SUV, the EcoSport, to the Los Angeles Auto Show last year. The SUV finally comes to showrooms early next year. What makes it stand apart? It will be imported from India.\n\nHonda Accord Hybrid\n\nThe latest version of the Accord has been drawing raves for being particularly well done since the turbocharged 1.5-liter version went on sale in October, followed a month later by the hotter version with a turbocharged 2-liter engine. Now comes the hybrid, which should combine all the best of the car with better fuel economy.\n\nNissan Kicks\n\nThe Kicks, which just made its debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show, has the right combination for success in the small SUV category: a peppy yet frugal engine, maximum inside space and lots of connectivity options. Most of all, however, it has more normal looks than Nissan's current small SUV, the quirky Juke. Kicks arrives in June.\n\nInfiniti QX50\n\nThe QX50 is a nice, normal luxury SUV midsize SUV that will stand apart in one important respect: breakthrough engine technology. It has the industry's first variable-compression engine, which changes the way the pistons work in the cylinders in a way that could give the QX50 a hybrid-like fuel economy without the need for large, expensive batteries.\n\nMazda6\n\nWhere are all the midsize cars? Until gas got cheap, they were the industry's largest segment. Then came the SUV onslaught. The Mazda6 hasn't been a huge seller, but it's one of the nicer sedans out there. The new one, even nicer, goes in sale in April or May.\n\nVolvo XC40\n\nVolvo's entrant into the small SUV race looks like a downsized version of the midsize XC60 midsize SUV. The all-wheel drive version will be followed a front-wheel drive model, due next summer.\n\nHyundai Kona\n\nHyundai's small SUV will stand apart on styling. In particular, it has bold, eyebrow-shaped black cladding over the wheel wells. It's an important model for Hyundai as it tries catching up to rivals that offer more SUV choices. Hyundai has done well, but it's car-based lineup has dragged it down. Kona will have two engine choices. It's due in March.\n\nJaguar E-Pace\n\nHaving already launched its first SUV, the F-Pace, Jaguar adds a smaller version. It comes in early 2018 at a starting price of $38,600. There will be a choice of two four-cylinder engines.\n\nAudi A8\n\nThe German luxury brand has redesigned its flagship car, adding features like an air quality filtration system and a rear-seat foot massager. The A8 launch is followed also by a slew of other new Audis, including the A7, A6 and the Q8 in the latter half of 2018.\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2018/05/08/nascar-without-france-family-could-happen/590758002/", "title": "NASCAR without the France family? Could happen", "text": "Mike Hembree\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe concept of family thrives in auto racing – and particularly in NASCAR – perhaps more than in any other sport.\n\nThe Pettys. The Earnhardts. The Elliotts. The Wallaces. Bakers, Flocks, Waltrips, Allisons, Jarretts, Pearsons, Bodines, Andrettis, Unsers, etc.\n\nOnce a bloodline is mingled with racing fuel, the mix seems difficult to separate.\n\nExcept now, maybe it will be, and in the most dramatic of family-table settings.\n\nThe France family is considering selling NASCAR. The remarkable nature of that sentence makes it seem a requirement to repeat it: The France family is considering selling NASCAR.\n\nReports Monday confirmed rumblings that have percolated around NASCAR garages for months – that descendants of NASCAR founder William “Big Bill” France are working with financial concerns to determine levels of interest various entities might have in purchasing the organization. The discussions have been labeled “exploratory” by individuals aware of their nature, and it is not certain, or even likely, that a sale eventually will occur.\n\nHowever, the relentless stream of “no comments” that followed Monday’s initial report by Reuters more or less confirms that something serious is happening here and that it could lead to one of the biggest developments in auto racing history.\n\nThe control of stock car racing at its highest levels has been held – often with extreme authority, as in the pistol Bill France Sr. sometimes carried – by members of the France family since cars first raced under the NASCAR banner in 1948.\n\nFrance wrestled the various factions of a young and wildly disorganized sport into submission and put them under the control of one person – himself. He took on hot-headed drivers, unions, fly-by-night race promoters and a pack of people who told him it couldn’t be done, and he did it. He built speedways, expanded the sport across the country and made his version of stock-car racing essentially the only one that mattered.\n\nHis son, Bill Jr., followed and took the next logical steps, marrying the sport with television and setting the stage for the arrival of Fortune 500 companies to expand the foundation and boost credibility.\n\nThings rolled along steadily for decades, with drivers, teams, tracks and NASCAR awash in dollars. Then a perfect storm of troubles arrived about a decade ago. The economy slumped, NASCAR struggled to find ways to keep its long races interesting, and some of the sport’s more marketable stars began moving to the sidelines.\n\nAttendance and television ratings dropped, and sponsors who had been reliable partners of the sport for years sought greener pastures. Under the watch of Brian France, Bill Jr.’s son and the third generation of the family to carry the sport’s flag, the best of times faded.\n\nReport:France family exploring possible sale of NASCAR to outside group\n\nTrucks:NASCAR Truck Series to be renamed Gander Outdoors Truck Series in 2019\n\nHuge loss:Dale Earnhardt Jr. to retire from NASCAR after 2017 season\n\nBrian France has not shown the same level of interest in the day-to-day, in-the-garage intricacies of the sport exhibited by his father and grandfather, and critics say there has been the lack of a strong central leader – a benevolent dictator who can make hard decisions both related to the quality of the racing and bigger-picture issues. The first two Frances definitely filled that role.\n\nWhat’s next? It seems reasonable to expect that even a deflated NASCAR would attract considerable interest from potential buyers. The NASCAR idea continues to make money for a lot of people, if not in the hand-over-fist form once enjoyed. Television and other outlets in a constantly changing media landscape demand content, and NASCAR, with numerous series and steady diets of racing, qualifying and practicing, has plenty.\n\nLiberty Media bought Formula One recently for $4.6 billion.\n\nWhat would happen with new NASCAR owners? The potential for dramatic change exists, and much of it would be welcomed by many in the sport – fans and participants alike.\n\nSome traditional fans loathe many of the changes, including playoff and stage racing, implemented under Brian France’s watch, but it’s unlikely the sport will ever return to awarding championships based on year-long point racing or any of the other incidentals fans associate with the “good old days”.\n\nMore likely would be a hard look at scheduling, and that would be a welcome approach among much of the garage population. NASCAR’s ties to its core schedule of generally the same tracks from year to year could stand some loosening, particularly as it involves awarding dates to newer facilities.\n\nIf there is a sale of the brand Big Bill France essentially formed from the labor of his own two hands, there will be much work ahead – discussions of television contracts, series sponsorships, “charter” agreements with team owners, contracts with tracks, status of team and driver advisory councils and a backstretch full of others.\n\nThat members of the France family might not be involved in that work is a possibility that, even on his most difficult days, William France couldn’t have imagined.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/greatamericanbites/2019/01/16/le-relais-de-venise-lentrecote-new-york-steak-frites/2587109002/", "title": "Le Relais de Venise L'Entrecôte, New York, Paris, London, Mexico ...", "text": "Larry Olmsted\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nThe scene: This part of midtown Manhattan is a high-rent district, a place for power breakfasts and expense account meals, which makes the large and high-profile corner location of Le Relais de Venise L'Entrecôte all the more mystifying. It occupies a generous piece of ground-level storefront real estate in the base of an office block that is home to financial giant the Blackstone Group, the headquarters of the National Football League and the Irish Consulate, on a street lined with fashionable clothiers. Yet by Big Apple standards the place is a bargain, and it is far from hip or trendy – its menu is not only unchanged since opening, it’s unchanged since the original mother restaurant opened in Paris 60 years ago.\n\nInside it has a classic French bistro feel, with tables simply covered with white, yellow or orange tablecloths, and then covered with white paper, topped with upside-down generic all-purpose wine glasses and napkins. Tables are set astonishingly close to one another, even though there are a lot of them – it’s a big place that seems to go on and on. Efficiency and speed seem to be prized commodities here, and breakfront-style service stations are conveniently distributed so nothing is too far away for servers – all of whom appear to be women, dressed like maids with black uniforms and white aprons. There is a wall of wine bottles and a heavy dark service bar in back, but the majority of the decor is comprised of many colorful, whimsical paintings, some of Venice, for reasons that become apparent with the namesake story behind the place. The atmosphere is warmer than it should be considering the heavy dark woods and tight quarters, and it has quite the following: The solo diner at the next table told his waitress that he comes every time he visits the city on business, and made his reservation as soon as he booked his plane ticket.\n\nReason to visit: Steak frites\n\nThe food: If you love steak frites, hate choosing what to eat, are seeking a bargain red meat meal in one of the world’s priciest cities, or simply want a fun dining experience different from pretty much everything else out there, Le Relais de Venise L'Entrecôte has you covered. On the other hand, if you are a vegetarian, stop reading and go someplace else.\n\nThe original Le Relais de Venise (Venetian Inn) was an Italian restaurant in Paris. After a winemaking French family bought it in 1959, they decided to serve only one traditional and beloved bistro dish, steak frites. For the steak part, the founder chose entrecote, a confusing cut that means different things in different places, but in France is traditionally cut from the sirloin and is in the same family as the New York strip or simply strip steak. Because they already had the name of the restaurant in neon, he added the word entrecote underneath, explaining the rather confusing name that has nothing to do with any cuisine remotely Italian or Venetian.\n\nToday the New York eatery (there was a second location downtown in Soho but it recently closed) is known by fans simply as L'Entrecôte, and has the same neon signage in the window. The original eatery still stands in Paris's 17th arrondissement where it’s known as L'Entrecôte Porte-Maillot, and the group is run by the second generation of the family, along with three outposts in London and one in Mexico City. All serve the same signature dish – and little else.\n\nThere is no menu, since you can only opt for the set course – everyone comes for the steak frites, and everyone is having it. You simply tell your waitress how you like your steak cooked: rare, medium, well done, or in the true French style, blue, or extra rare. The waitress then draws a tic-tac-toe like grid on the white paper tablecloth with initials demarking everyone’s choice, so that when you get refills later there is no mistake. That’s the other quirky signature of this place: refills on both steak and fries, though oddly there is a surcharge for seconds of salad. It’s worth it because the salad is really good, and the first round is included in the sole menu option. You get a starter of green salad with crushed walnuts tossed with a tangy and addictive mustard vinaigrette, simple but quite good. Then you get slices of the steak served from large trays filed with various done-ness options to meet the needs of all the guests at your table, alongside a mound of skinny classic pomme frites. The set meal, including seconds on steak and fries, is $29.95. You also get a basket of French bread.\n\nThe steak itself is good, pleasantly fatty, and a good value that is easily superior to fast-casual chain offerings. But for many customers, the reason the place is so popular is the special sauce, a butter and cream-based carefully guarded house secret that has a cult-like following. Longtime New York Magazine restaurant critic Adam Platt cites French paper Le Monde for revealing that the key secret ingredient is an infusion of chicken-liver essence, and Platt calls it “ruinously addictive.” It is very good, elevating the already impressive meat, and along with the delicious salad and standout fries, few leave unsatisfied. For me, the exceptional bottomless fries were the very best part, skinny and crispy but with hand-cut irregularity, fresh and hot from the fryer every time they came out, and perfect for mopping up the dreamy sauce.\n\nIt doesn’t get much simpler than this, and even the wine list follows suit, just with a handful of bottles, each the sole representative of a grape or region: there’s one Malbec, a Cote du Rhone, a private label L'Entrecôte Bordeaux and just a few others, and all are as expensive or up to twice as much as the entire meal. Then there is dessert, the biggest decision to be made here, if you are still hungry – many guests are not. The slate represents a colorful array of French classics including a pretty good take on profiteroles swimming in chocolate sauce, a merely average cheese plate and a disappointing Mont Blanc, a pureed chestnut and whipped cream tower named for Europe’s highest peak. In general, the desserts are fun and add French fair, but the main attraction is the set meal, a bargain-priced detour to Old Europe in the Big Apple and a hearty, satisfying, fun, change of pace – with that great sauce.\n\nRating: Yum!

Arrive hungry. Virginia’s capital has long been a destination for good grub, and in recent years, the dining scene has catapulted onto the national stage. Beyond salty ham biscuits, pimento cheese and other classic staples of the Virginia larder, Richmond has become a destination for great eating with a bumper crop of homegrown culinary concepts.\n\nIndeed, the city is luring some of the country’s top chefs with low rents, Virginia hospitality and an informed dining public.

It’s like the city’s DIY punk music scene, which contributes to the kitchen ethos. You’re welcome everywhere.”\n\nFor her German-inspired eatery, Anderson chose Church Hill for the diverse, urban ambiance and the affordable rent on a historic building with original architectural details like a pressed tin ceiling. (Never mind that you could see the sky through the roof — before a tasteful renovation.)\n\nThe city’s oldest neighborhood, Church Hill also had a reputation as derelict and unsavory. “At that point you didn’t cross Lee or Marshall,” explains South Carolina-born chef Lee Gregory, who, along with co-owner Kendra Feather, was the first to open in the area with The Roosevelt in July 2011. Gregory has garnered national acclaim for his southern-style fare; dishes like Southern Poutine have garnered cult status among Richmond, Va. foodies. “Opening in Church Hill was a happy accident,” Gregory says, remembering the abandoned building that would later house The Roosevelt. “In the city’s outlying areas, the rents are good and the landlords are willing to work with you; they see the promise of it.”\n\nWithout the pressure of high rents, passionate restaurateurs are demonstrating a remarkable culinary creativity while also revitalizing the neighborhood where Patrick Henry uttered the famous lines, “Give me liberty or give me death!” Pick your protein at Metzger (go for the pork chops brined in beer); carbo-load at Sub Rosa Bakery, where a brother and sister team mill their own flours for breads baked in a wood-fired oven; stuff yourself silly on The Dog and Pig Show’s Pulled Pork Po’boy and the “Milk and Cookies bar”; and come sundown, quench your thirst with a classic cocktail at The Roosevelt.\n\n“A lot of chefs ascended through the city’s best-known kitchens, and have come of age at the same time to open their own establishments,\" Gregory says, thrilled about Richmond’s culinary renaissance. \"The number of good restaurants doubled in a year, each with its own distinct vibe.” The owners of nearby Dutch & Company also credit local food stars like Jimmy Sneed (The Frog & the Redneck) for first bridging the divide between the fine dining establishments and the “mom and pop” places. The “godfather of Richmond restaurants” pioneered the idea of an excellent eatery with a casual vibe. In the same vein, Gregory cites the “Momufuku movement,” wherein diners pay decent prices for top-shelf products… without the white tablecloths and classical music.\n\nJust a few blocks from The Roosevelt, Dutch & Company opened in January 2013 in a converted laundromat, styled with recycled furniture (church pews serve as banquettes, and an artisanal carpenter transformed wood palettes into the bar). The team came up through some of the city’s top kitchens: Aziza’s (chef Caleb Shriver) and Acacia (chef Phillip Perrow and front office manager Michelle Peake Shriver). The ambitious duo are “ying and yang” chefs (to quote Peake) who riff creative ideas with unique ingredients (like huitlacoche, the corn fungus that’s considered “the truffle of Mexico”). Diners swoon over the sophisticated combinations, for example, the softshell crab is served with floral pork sausage, melon, fried plantain, shishito peppers and anchoiade. The “perfect egg” — paired with cured salmon and sprouted quinoa — is so popular it will never come off the menu. And the seasonal “honey pot” — a sublime dessert served in a ceramic honey pot —also gets rave reviews.\n\nChurch Hill isn’t the only happening place in town. Jackson Ward is seeing a similar revival. When the Quirk Hotel debuted in September 2015 on Broad Street, Richmond embraced its first design-focused boutique hotel. Ted and Katie Ukrop, of the local family behind the supermarket chain, restored a city landmark: the former J.B. Mosby & Co department store (dating back to 1916). Inside, the soaring lobby space has double barrel-vaulted ceilings and eye-catching artwork, like Susie Ganch’s large-scale installation made from used coffee lids. Guest rooms feature furniture made from the old building’s recycled pine floors, while the rooftop bar draws the cool crowd for sunset drinks and sweeping city views. Even the craft cocktails — like The Irascible John Randolf, a mix of Tres Agaves Anejo, Campari and Cocchi Rosa — pay homage to Virginia history.\n\nQuirk also reflects Richmond’s status as an ascendant culinary capital. At Maple & Pine Restaurant inside the hotel, chef David Dunlap works with local producers to create refined works of art like the chanterelle mushroom risotto, strewn with edible flowers, followed by the Autumn Olive Farm Pork Loin, served with apricot, sorrel and sugar snap peas, sprinkled with Espelette pepper. Don’t miss the Ants on a Log dessert, a whimsical homage to the childhood classic made with peanut butter mousse, celery ice cream and raisin puree. Dunlap’s fine dining background (he trained under Alain Ducasse and Patrick O’Connell) is clearly visible in both the artful presentation and the top-notch service at the restaurant. If you sleep off your food coma in one of the guest rooms, don’t skip breakfast; the grilled avocado topped with a poached egg is simply divine.\n\nIn the Fan District, Heritage is also in the spotlight for its killer cocktail program and ambitious, seasonal menu showcasing Virginia’s natural bounty. Even the charcuterie is made in-house, as a result of chef Joe Sparatta’s culinary philosophy of minimal waste, utilizing all parts of the hog, fish, even carrot tops. Hailing from New Jersey, Sparatta humbly describes his aspiration to create “a great neighborhood restaurant ... (and) to make people happy.” More than that, crowd-pleasing Heritage is a smash hit.\n\nExciting things are also coming out of the kitchen at the exceptional Shagbark restaurant, which debuted in the West End on June 28. Walter Bundy, who worked at The French Laundry before running the kitchens at the illustrious Jefferson Hotel for 17 years, has scored a home run with his first personal venture. His motto? “Stay rooted, but branch out.” Named for a Civil War-era tree which fell on his family’s farm, Shagbark is beautifully decorated with slabs of shagbark hickory wood, chandeliers made of deer antlers and hand-blown glass fixtures. Bundy is an avid fisherman, hunter and naturalist, and the names of local farms/purveyors are proudly listed on the menu. “I just cook what’s local and fresh,” he says. “It’s important to respect where products are coming from.” Take for example, the Cobia, pulled fresh from the Chesapeake that morning, or the melon, seasoned with salt, plucked from his father’s garden.\n\nA recent meal at Shagbark was revelatory; dishes like the Vidalia onion bisque, with lump blue crab and rainbow trout caviar, have been perfected over the years with skilled technique. To start, opt for the foie gras on brioche French toast, which Bundy calls, “my take on breakfast,” or the Hayman white sweet potato ravioli, served with country ham, black truffle and collard greens. The adept addition of micro greens (like sunflower shoots) — which Bundy first cultivated when he worked for Thomas Keller — adds condensed flavor and a nice crunchiness to his dishes. Cap off your epic meal with the chocolate croissant bread pudding, doused in Wild Turkey anglaise. Don’t be surprised if Bundy scores national awards with his creative Virginia cuisine.\n\nOysters and crab cakes are de rigeur in this southern town, and the best place to indulge is Rappahannock. When Ryan and Travis Croxton resurrected their grandfather’s business and founded the Rappahannock Oyster Company, the cousins were catalysts behind the oyster comeback in the Chesapeake Bay. Just 15 years ago, Crassostrea virginica was at the brink of a crisis due to over-harvesting, pollution and disease. Now — with major aquaculture and restoration efforts — the bivalves can be found on some of the country’s top restaurant menus, and the Chesapeake Bay oyster industry is thriving once again. A little over an hour from Richmond, Va., patrons can visit the Rappahannock’s aquaculture farm and Merroir tasting room at Locklies Marina. (“Merroir\" is derived from \"terroir\" and \"mer”).\n\nVirginia is for (oyster) lovers\n\nLeave it to Rappahannock’s chef Dylan Fultineer, formerly at Blackbird in Chicago for eight years, to improve upon the product’s perfection with Oysters and Pearls. The Rappahannock River oysters are topped with bourbon granita and trout caviar like a decadent salty slurpee. With a packed house at night, Rappahannock is thankfully also open for the lunch crowd. The crab cake sandwich could be the best in all the land.\n\nTo the great delight of local fans, the Croxtons recently opened Rapp Session next door to Rappahannock. A grocery-cum-oyster bar, Rapp Session stays open until 2 a.m. on the weekends, with a Reverse Happy Hour starting at 11 p.m. During the day, patrons can pick up oysters, steamed crabs and the famous smoked bluefish dip to-go. There’s also a barista making espresso drinks with Counter Culture coffee. After sundown, the bar is a popular rendezvous spot for creative cocktails and shared plates. “At the turn of the century, oyster saloons could be found all over the country — all the way to Kansas,” Travis Croxton tells USA TODAY. “These served as meeting places, a casual spot between work and home; they were the Starbucks of the time.” Like a modern-day oyster saloon, Rapp Session is decorated with vintage family photos and antique items from the Croxtons’ grandfather’s store.\n\nIt’s impossible to visit Richmond without noticing that the city has ushered in a new golden age for beverages. Craft breweries are not new to the city; Legend (the oldest) opened in 1994 and Hardywood, a firm local favorite, was launched in 2011. But a recent beer boom has brought a wave of new breweries and taprooms: like Ardent Craft Ales, Isley Brewing Company and The Veil Brewing Company in the Scott’s Addition neighborhood. This year, California-based Stone Brewing Company opened a Richmond, Va. outpost, and Veil made a splash drawing long lines when brewmaster Matt Tarpey unveils weekly new releases.\n\nCraft cocktails are also having a moment. Amongst these shakers and stirrers, top contenders are Saison (where beverage director James Kohler makes his own tonics in-house), The Rogue Gentlemen, The Roosevelt and Heritage, where bartender Mattias Hägglund is garnering acclaim for his creative quaffables. The must try? Bitter about my Hot Friend, made with lunazul reposado tequila, campari, agave, lemon and spice. The Roosevelt’s bartender Thomas Leggett is also racking up the awards for his original libations, like The Seersucker, along with classics like Quoi Club Punch — the rum, brandy and Madeira-based tipple that was the official drink of Richmond’s most popular 19th-century social club.\n\nAnd in Richmond, the best is yet to come. After making it big with smaller neighborhood restaurants, local chefs are striking out with larger, more ambitious ventures (like the soon-to-open Brenner Pass from Metzger’s Brittanny Anderson and Saison’s James Kohler) — without forgetting the local communities who first embraced them.\n\nClick through the slide show above to take a culinary tour of Richmond’s best homegrown food and drinks.\n\nTaste Virginia's Eastern Shore on these culinary adventures", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/06/13/sylvia-day-crossfire/2418699/", "title": "Sylvia Day: Why 'Crossfire' TV show needs explicit sex", "text": "Natalie Zutter\n\nBookish\n\nAfter an agonizingly long wait, fans of Sylvia Day will finally get their fix when Entwined with You, the third novel in her Crossfire series, comes out June 4. While there are two novels left in the series, Crossfire has also been optioned for television. Bookish spoke with Day about the equal need to write strong heroines and hot sex scenes, and how both will factor in to the TV series. She also discussed her love for the classic clinch cover and which TV shows inspire her in her off-hours.\n\nBookish: How do you think readers will react to Entwined with You? What do you think they'll like most and least?\n\nSylvia Day: I think that readers are really gonna love it. [Bared to You] is really kind of a get-to-know-you book, with the two characters just starting the relationship. [\"Reflected in You\"] was really hard; there was a lot of angst to it, and it was a really dark book. People ended the book and were like, \"I'm emotionally exhausted from reading it!\" But with the third book, the readers will be very happy about where the story's moving along. A lot of things they're looking for, they'll find.\n\nBookish: What are you reading, watching or listening to for inspiration?\n\nSD: I have things I watch in my downtime--I love Scandal. I don't write political romance, so there's not a direct relation there. But it's something I do just to turn off the brain for a little bit, and just to relax and recharge. I'm a big fan of IMAX/3-D films; I love that whole experience. If I come out and I'm energized by watching [something], I'm usually excited to go home and write, whether it has anything to do with what I've seen or not seen. As for reading, I read a lot, but I have to. I've found that writers who don't read really can't write.\n\nBookish: How so--in terms of craft, or admiring others' ideas and execution?\n\nSD: Just for the emotional experience of it. For a storyteller, when you finish reading somebody else's story and you have that feeling of \"Oh my God, I wish the story would've gone on forever\"--that's what got me to first start writing. I was 12 and read my first romance novel; it was a sweeping desert saga, and I got to the end of it and was like, \"I want to go to back and start all over again!\" That emotional response to the book and getting to the end of a story you love is what inspires me to write the next book.\n\nBookish: Covers are also key for you, right? You wrote an essay in \"Fifty Writers on Fifty Shades of Grey\" all about the evolution of book covers.\n\nSD: I'm a big fan of the classic clinch cover because of the emotion that it gets across. I don't even care if the hair color's right or if the clothing's right--that doesn't even bother me. But I like to get a feel for the emotional content of the book in the pose, the look on the models' faces and so on. That's been an interesting part for me with getting all of my covers redone into object covers because now, of course, there's no emotion there whatsoever. I fought for a long time to get couples on my covers, because I had just the guy or just the girl. I was like, \"Can I get a couple, please?\"\n\nBookish: You would think that with romance novels, that would be the intuitive thing to do!\n\nSD: Even though I consider myself a hardcore straight romance author, a lot of my books focus on the heroine a lot, so I think they kind of want that as a mainstream look, having one person on there. I really like the few clinch covers I managed to get.\n\nBookish: Speaking of heroines, let's talk about Eva. On various fan sites, readers have expressed appreciation for the fact that she stands up to the possessive Gideon. Why was it important for you to write a female protagonist who's so strong on her own?\n\nSD: In order to really connect with my heroines, they have to be women I would be friends with in real life. It's very hard for me to be friends with women who are not strong. All of my girlfriends are extremely strong women. Almost all of them are entrepreneurs. It's just a sort of female companionship that I'm attracted to. It's the same way with my heroines: I expect them to be confident in their business endeavors--almost all of them have something they're doing--and to be strong with the men they're with.\n\nFor me, it's very hard to buy into the alpha male being attracted to a beta female. It usually just doesn't happen. Alphas are attracted to each other. I would have a hard time being friends with a woman who just let a guy run all over her. [laughs] I love J.D. Robb's \"In Death\" series. Actually, I love a lot of Nora Roberts's books; her heroines are all very strong.Nalini Singh's \"Guild Hunters\" series--of course Elena is usually strong, and all of the women who are in her series are strong women. Mercy Thompson [series] by Patricia Briggs--those are the type of series I gravitate to, because those are women that are respected and admired, and I want them to get to their happily ever after. It's terrible when you read a book and you're like, \"Oh my God, what does he see in her?\"\n\nBookish: Congratulations on the Crossfire series getting optioned for television!\n\nSD: It's very exciting. I talked to the producers; they're big fans of the series [who have] been reading it since last year. They're really in love with the characters and the emotional dynamic between them [that] really drives them. Their goal in presenting the series is, of course, to have that emotional and psychological impact. Every time I talk to them, I get more excited because they're on track with my vision and I see where they're going with it.\n\nBookish: How involved are you with the upcoming show?\n\nSD: I'm an executive consultant on the project. Everything, to some extent, gets run by me. They're very determined that I'm happy with the series and how it turns out. I'll consistently be in contact in the early development process. Then, of course, once it gets started, I'll be looking at the script and talking to the director and writers. I won't actually be writing [episodes] because that's not my forte, plus I have my own projects to write. [laughs] I can't really spend time revisiting a project I've already written. I'm here in California, so it's very easy for me to meet with people in person. I'm also in New York a lot, which is where the story is set and where I expect a lot of filming to take place.\n\nBookish: Both Eva and Gideon have had to work through past sexual abuse, and they use sex as communication and reaffirmation of their love. How do you think the TV adaptation will handle the explicit sex in your books? Do you have any hopes when it comes to those scenes--either specific moments that you want to be included, or ways for them to be rendered?\n\nSD: [The producers are] on board with me, too, as far as the actual emotional, pivotal points of the story [which] happen while [Eva and Gideon are] having sex. That's the way it is with any true erotic romance. If you try to pull the sex scenes out of the story, the whole story falls apart. Usually, protagonists in erotic romance have difficult times communicating verbally, so the way that they get their feelings across--whether it's anger, happiness, love, lust, all of it--is during the sex scenes. You really couldn't do a PG version of \"Crossfire!\" It just wouldn't work. They have that in mind. We're all on board with the fact that it would need to be premium cable, on which recently we've seen a lot of wonderful book-to-film adaptations: Game of Thrones, Dexter, True Blood.\n\nThe very first time they have sex, which is in the back of a limousine, is a hugely pivotal moment in the book. Eva takes control, which is something Gideon's not used to. It wrecks him; it almost wrecks the whole relationship. There's also one [scene] that happens in a hotel that Gideon owns, that again almost destroys their relationship. Talking to [the producers], their expectation is that they'll follow the storyline as I wrote it. They don't have any expectation to deviate from it in any way. So, I'm sure we'll see a lot of that translated to film, which should be interesting and hopefully not too hard on the actors.\n\nI'm really excited. And of course, it's Lionsgate, which has The Hunger Games and Twilight; they're working on Divergent right now. This is a studio that is very familiar with book-to-film adaptations and doing them really well and staying true to the stories. I expect no less with the Crossfire series.\n\nBookish: Which TV shows or movies depict sex in ways that you admire and could help inform how sex is handled in the show about your books?\n\nSD: There are so many of them! There are, of course, some that are explicit and yet, not necessarily is it pivotal to the story. The Tudors did a really good job with the sex; they used that to show characterization and also had some really lovely romantic sex scenes with various characters. I don't think we have anything along the lines of Crossfire yet--as in, taking a novel that's erotic women's fiction and translating it to film. Usually it's a different genre's book that just happens to have sex in it, like Dexter and Game of Thrones and so on. So, it'll be interesting to see how that adaptation works.\n\nFilm-wise, I think we probably have seen more than what we've seen on television. Unfaithful did a really beautiful job of it, with Diane Lane and Olivier Martinez. You see Diane Lane unraveling through sexual interaction with this guy. I think in the film medium we've seen it and, of course, we're not seeing that so much with film anymore, [so] it's kind of turned over to television.\n\nBookish: Which actors and actresses can you see playing Gideon and Eva?\n\nSD: I don't have real-life people in mind when I write my characters; in my head, they're totally unique people. But, you know, the readers have [created] literally dozens of casting videos on YouTube that are really beautifully done. Fan favorites are Henry Cavill from The Tudors, who's also the new Superman; Matt Bomer from White Collar; David Gandy, who's a model; Ian Somerhalder's another one. The readers have their personal favorites--of those, Henry Cavill would be my choice. He's the right age; having seen him on The Tudors, I think he'd do a beautiful job of it.\n\nBut I have no hand in casting. They may come up with something totally different, but the producers are very aware of the Crossfire fandom. They watch the videos, they listen to the interactions on Twitter and Facebook; they're very plugged in to what the readers want. 'Cause they know, of course, in order for the [TV] series to work, the existing fanbase has to be committed to the series as well.\n\nHeroine-wise, I think Scarlett Johansson would do a fabulous job. She's beautiful, she's very curvy like Eva is, and she gets that emotional vulnerability across very well. She even managed to get that vulnerability across in The Avengers!\n\nBookish: It's funny--Cavill, Bomer and Somerhalder have all been put forward as candidates to play Christian Grey in the Fifty Shades of Grey movie. (Though, at this point, who hasn't?) They're all actors who have a good sense of humor.\n\nSD: I find it so funny that the same actors are mentioned with Gideon and Christian, because they look obviously very different. Christian is a redhead with gray eyes, then you have Gideon, who's [got] long black hair! You couldn't find two men who are more different, and yet the same actors come up for it. It'll be interesting to see how that plays out.\n\nBookish: I think it's probably something to do with the sexual magnetism of both characters. Sure, Christian Grey is distantly based on Robert Pattinson as copper-haired Edward, and yet what people are attracted to in someone like an Ian Somerhalder is that great, smoldering gaze. I imagine they see that same energy in Gideon.\n\nSD: That goes back to my thing about the clinch covers--I don't even care if the hair color or eye color is right, as long as you're getting that emotional resonance across. And if that happens, I don't think it really matters what the actor looks like, if he can nail the actual emotional component of the character.\n\n--\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bookish.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/09/19/hospital-concert-serial-revisited-green-chile-pile-news-around-states/50753003/", "title": "Hospital concert, Serial revisited: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nFlorence: An inmate who authorities say escaped with the help of a jail supervisor who later killed herself shared nearly 1,000 phone calls with the woman before the breakout, news outlets report. Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said Casey White and Vicky White, who were not related, may have planned his escape over the phone, but authorities must listen to each of 949 calls before making a determination. Authorities have said the two were in a romantic relationship, and Singleton said at least some of the calls were sexual in nature. The phone calls occurred after Casey White was transferred from the Lauderdale County Jail to a state prison where he was held until being returned to Lauderdale County before the escape, the sheriff said. Casey White walked out of the jail in handcuffs in April accompanied by Vicky White, the assistant corrections director, prompting an 11-day search for the pair. On the day of the escape, Vicky White, 56, told co-workers she was driving the inmate to a mental health evaluation. The two were eventually discovered in Indiana, where Casey White was captured. Vicky White shot herself in the head moments before the man was arrested, authorities said. Casey White was charged with escape and murder in her death. The defense has filed documents suggesting Vicky White was in charge of the escape.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A powerful storm sweeping north through the Bering Strait on Saturday caused widespread flooding in several western Alaska coastal communities, knocking out power and sending residents fleeing for higher ground. The force of the water moved some homes off their foundations, and one house in Nome floated down a river until it got caught at a bridge. The potent storm – what remains of Typhoon Merbok – has been influencing weather patterns as far away as California. In Alaska, no injuries or deaths were immediately reported, said Jeremy Zidek, spokesperson for the Alaska Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. Officials had warned that some places could see their worst flooding in 50 years and that the high waters could take up to 14 hours to recede. Gov. Mike Dunleavy issued a disaster declaration during the day. The nearly 1,000-mile storm front has damaged roads and potentially other infrastructure, Dunleavy said at a Saturday evening news conference. Officials will evaluate any effects on water and sewer systems, seawalls, fuel storage areas, airports, and ports. Federal Emergency Management Agency representatives were already in Alaska before the storm, and Dunleavy said they will stay to help assess damage.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Republican leaders of the Arizona Legislature will not try to defend a new law limiting up-close filming of police that has been blocked by a federal judge, a decision that essentially ends the fight over the contentious proposal. Senate President Karen Fann and House Speaker Rusty Bowers both said they would not intervene in the case by the Friday deadline set by the federal judge when he temporarily blocked the new law from taking effect last week on First Amendment grounds. And the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. John Kavanagh, said Friday that he has been unable to find an outside group to defend the law, which was challenged by news media organizations and the American Civil Liberties Union. The groups will now ask that the law, which was set to take effect next week, be permanently blocked. Kavanagh said he will review U.S. District Judge John J. Tuchi’s ruling and see if he can craft a law that passes constitutional muster. He said the law is needed to keep people from distracting police trying to make an arrest, but Tuchi agreed with the challengers that it runs afoul of precedents that say the public and press have a right to film police doing their jobs. Tuchi noted there are already Arizona laws barring interfering with police and said singling out people for taking videos appears to be unconstitutional on its face.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, a Republican who is running for governor, was released from a hospital Saturday after undergoing surgery for thyroid cancer. “Following successful surgery on Friday to remove her thyroid and surrounding lymph nodes and in consultation with her physician, Sarah was discharged from an Arkansas hospital cancer-free,” said Sanders spokesperson Judd Deere. “She will spend the remaining portion of her recovery at home.” Deere told the Associated Press that Sanders, 40, planned to resume campaigning “soon,” but it was not known precisely when she would return. Sanders said Friday when announcing the surgery that a biopsy earlier this month revealed she had thyroid cancer. Dr. John R. Sims, a surgeon at CARTI Cancer Center in Little Rock who is one of Sanders’ doctors, said her cancer was a stage 1 papillary thyroid carcinoma, the most common type of thyroid cancer, and said she has an “excellent” prognosis. Sims said Sanders will need adjuvant treatment with radioactive iodine and long-term continuing care. Sanders, who served as ex-President Donald Trump’s spokeswoman until 2019, is running against Democratic nominee Chris Jones. She is the daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A new state law will help military service members who were discharged under “don’t ask, don’t tell” policies because of their sexual or gender identities to reestablish their eligibility for Veterans Affairs benefits, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Saturday. “For decades, our bravest heroes, men and women who wore the uniforms of the armed services had to hide who they really were, and many were other than honorably discharged if their sexuality was discovered,” Newsom said in a statement after announcing he had signed the bill. Gays and lesbians were banned in the military until the 1993 approval of “don’t ask, don’t tell,” the policy that allowed them to serve only if they did not openly acknowledge their sexual orientation. Rather than helping, advocates say, it created more problems. Repeal of the law was approved by Congress and then-President Barack Obama in late 2010 and took effect nine months later, allowing lesbian, gay and bisexual people to serve openly. The Department of Defense subsequently created a path for veterans who had been discharged under the policy to receive the full range of veterans’ benefits. “But many veterans sadly don’t know or can’t even access this important process,” Newsom said, adding that some have had to hire expensive legal counsel to navigate the process. “We’re taking steps to fix this.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Stricter air quality regulations are coming for northern Colorado businesses after the Environmental Protection Agency on Friday downgraded the area to a category for “severe” violators of ozone standards. Drivers may have to pay higher gas prices, too, because the reclassification prohibits the sale of conventional gasoline within one year. State environmental officials, however, believe they can achieve better air quality without needing to switch to the reformulated blend of gasoline the EPA requires, Colorado Air Pollution Control Division spokesperson Leah Schleifer said in a news release. Colorado has asked the EPA to reassess that requirement and consider the state’s alternative plan. The gasoline blend would raise gas prices 20-30 cents per gallon, AAA estimates, according to the Denver Post. The area includes a large swath of northern Colorado including Denver, Boulder, Greeley, Fort Collins and Loveland. Colorado estimates it will issue more stringent permits for 600 oil and gas facilities and about 100 more industrial sites, the news release said. The Colorado area was one of six areas to get downgraded by the EPA along with the Chicago area; Texas’ Dallas-Forth Worth and Houston areas; parts of Connecticut and the New York-New Jersey-Long Island area; and the Morongo Band of Mission Indians in Southern California.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who is on trial in Connecticut for calling the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre a hoax, continued Friday to describe the proceedings as a “kangaroo court” from his Infowars studio in Texas. Jones’ commentary became a focus of testimony on the fourth day of the trial, with a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families questioning a corporate representative for Jones’ Infowars brand about how seriously the company was taking the trial. The lawyer, Christopher Mattei, showed the jury a photo he said was of an Infowars webpage, depicting the judge in the trial with lasers shooting out of her eyes. “On a scale of one to 10, how seriously is Infowars taking this trial?” Mattei asked the corporate representative, Brittany Paz. “Ten. It’s serious to me,” Paz responded. The exchange occurred as Jones prepares to attend the trial in Waterbury this week and as the judge, Barbara Bellis, considers a request by the families’ lawyers to limit what Jones and his lawyer can say and argue in court. Jones is expected to testify, but it’s not clear yet when. “They are pretending to the world that it’s an actual trial, but I’m guilty when I get there, and I can’t say I’m innocent,” Jones said on his Infowars web show Friday. “Everybody fundamentally knows that’s a fraud.”\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: In future summers, the edges of the city’s boardwalk could have a new, larger look. Multiple plans are in the works to build hotels in Rehoboth Beach, one of Delaware’s most popular destinations that keeps getting busier. In the coming years, when beachgoers look back on the avenue from the sand, there will likely be more oceanfront balconies and windows than one-story shops. Two projects could shake up the end of the boardwalk. The longtime owner of the Candy Kitchen corner wants to build a 100-plus room building there in the image of a mid-20th-century hotel. Across the avenue, Grotto Pizza is taking over the former Dolle’s with plans for a restaurant and hotel. Elsewhere on Rehoboth Avenue, a motel is being renovated into a boutique hotel. A court battle will decide whether an office strip is replaced by another hotel.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Local officials will consider legislation Tuesday to support migrants bused into the district from Texas and Arizona, WUSA-TV reports. The DC Council plans to vote on an emergency bill introduced by Councilmember Brianne Nadeau at the request of Mayor Muriel Bowser. The measure calls for the establishment of welcome and reception services and the provision of food, clothing, medical services, cash assistance and other necessities for migrants. But the proposal has some residents worried about unintended consequences. The Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless called the legislation a “poison apple” Thursday. LegalAidDC tweeted Friday that the council should reject the bill in its current form, saying it “will weaken basic protections that all unhoused individuals & families deserve when they seek help in the District.” The group also said in a statement that it is concerned about the “unchecked” powers it would give the mayor. The Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network has repeatedly taken issue with Bowser’s claims that the overwhelming majority of migrants do not want to stay in D.C. once they arrive, saying that takes focus off the need to support those migrants who do want to stay in the capital. Local nonprofits say almost all the people arriving are asylum-seekers with pending immigration cases.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Attorneys for school shooter Nikolas Cruz asked for the judge in his murder case to remove herself Friday, two days after she scolded them when they abruptly rested their case after calling only a fraction of their expected witnesses. The Broward Public Defender’s Office said in a motion that Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer held a long-standing animosity toward lead defense lawyer Melisa McNeill. The motion cited Florida’s Judicial Code of Conduct that states a judge shall disqualify himself or herself if the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances in which the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party or a party’s lawyer. Defense attorneys said Scherer’s repeated improper and unjustified attacks on the defense counsel undermine the public’s confidence in the judicial system and have also caused Cruz to fear that he will not receive a fair trial. Prosecutors said in a response that Scherer has been respectful to both sides. Cruz’s attorneys had told the judge and prosecutors they would be calling 80 witnesses but surprisingly rested at the start of Wednesday’s court session after calling only about 25 of them. Scherer called the decision without warning to her or the prosecution “the most uncalled for, unprofessional way to try a case.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nDecatur: Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor, is launching an intensive effort to get out the vote by urging potential supporters to cast in-person ballots the first week of early voting as she tries to navigate the state’s new election laws. The strategy, outlined to the Associated Press by Abrams’ top aides, is a shift from 2018, when she spent generously in her first gubernatorial bid to encourage voters to use mail ballots. It also moves away from Democrats’ pandemic-era emphasis on mail voting, a push that delivered Georgia’s electoral votes to President Joe Biden and helped Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff win concurrent U.S. Senate runoffs to give Democrats control of Capitol Hill. Republicans, including Abrams’ opponent, Gov. Brian Kemp, answered in 2021 with sweeping election changes that, among other provisions, dramatically curtailed drop boxes for mail ballots, added wrinkles to mail ballot applications and ballot return forms, and made it easier to challenge an individual voter’s eligibility. But it also expanded in-person voting. “It’s self-evident we have to have a big early vote in-person,” said Abrams campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo, arguing the new mail ballot procedures make it risky for Democrats to rely too heavily on that option. “What’s not self-evident,” Groh-Wargo said, “is how the hell you do that.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A business owner and a Maui County official have been charged with bribery and public corruption involving more than $2 million in cash and gifts, federal court documents unsealed Thursday showed. Milton Choy, the owner of a Honolulu company that provides wastewater services and supplies, is accused of bribing Stewart Olani Stant, who was a wastewater manager and then director of the Maui County Department of Environmental Management. Choy provided Stant with cash deposited directly to Stant’s bank accounts, plus gambling chips and trips to Las Vegas, U.S. Attorney for Hawaii Clare Connors said at a news conference. In return, prosecutors said Choy received upward of $19 million in business contracts from the county. Messages left for Stant on various social media sites were not immediately returned. Listed phone numbers had been disconnected. Choy took responsibility for his actions and admitted everything he did to federal investigators, said his attorney Michael Green. “He gave unprotected statements – that’s where you don’t ask for a lawyer, and you you sit down with the agents and tell them what you did. And he did that,” Green said. The two will be arraigned in federal court Monday.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: Huckleberries are highly sought after, but the coveted mountain fruit was difficult to find across much of northern Idaho and eastern Washington this year. Pickers were able to locate some productive plants and patches, but they frequently encountered healthy bushes that had few berries or none at all, The Lewiston Tribune reports. “In general terms, this is not a very good year,” said Wayne Kasworm, a grizzly bear biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who tracks huckleberry production in the Selkirk, Cabinet and Yaak mountain ranges. With a changing climate, scientists like him increasingly are tracking huckleberries that are an important food source for grizzly bears and other wildlife and coveted by people as well. Native Americans have harvested huckleberries for thousands of years and continue to do so today. The small berries with a pleasant mix of sweet and tart are targeted by recreational and commercial pickers as well. They are used to make pies, ice cream and other desserts, as well as being added to pancakes, milkshakes and smoothies. Grizzlies depend on the berries as a key food source. “The other thing I’ve learned in the process of doing this work is just how many other species rely on huckleberries. It’s really a keystone species,” said Tabitah Graves, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Two police officers face felony charges for allegedly shooting and seriously wounding an unarmed man during a July shootout on the city’s southwest side that also wounded a second man, authorities said Friday. Sgt. Christopher Liakopoulos, 43, and Officer Ruben Reynoso, 42, of the Chicago Police Department, have been charged with one count each of aggravated battery with a firearm, aggravated discharge of a firearm and official misconduct, said Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx. She said the officers were relieved of their police powers Thursday before they turned themselves in to authorities. Foxx said both officers “are being charged with having fired their shots” that wounded an unarmed 23-year-old man – identified separately Friday through a civil court filing as Miguel Medina – on July 22 in the city’s Pilsen neighborhood. That man has since recovered and is cooperating with the investigation, she said. “The victim who was shot and injured in this incident was not in possession of a weapon, nor did he fire a weapon at these two officers,” Foxx said during a news conference. The officers were heading to a morning training course and were in plain clothes at the time of the shooting. They weren’t wearing their police body cameras because they were going to training, Assistant State’s Attorney Alyssa Janicki said. Prosecutors later obtained surveillance video from the area.\n\nIndiana\n\nElkhart: A staffer for U.S. Rep. Jackie Walorski was trying to pass a flatbed truck on a northern Indiana highway last month when the SUV in which they were traveling crashed into an oncoming car, killing Walorski and three other people, police said Friday. A witness traveling behind the SUV told investigators it sped up, crossed the centerline of the two-lane highway as it neared the truck, and pulled into the path of the other car when the crash happened about 12:30 p.m. Aug. 3, according to the Elkhart County Sheriff’s Office. Airbag control module data from the SUV driven by Zachery Potts, 27, who was Walorski’s district director, showed it was going 77 mph at the time of the crash on a rural stretch of Indiana 19 near the town of Wakarusa, the office said. “All of the evidence and information gathered is consistent with someone attempting to pass another vehicle on a two-lane roadway,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement. Walorski, 58, was a Republican first elected in 2012 and was seeking reelection this year to a sixth term. The sheriff’s office released statements from the county coroner ruling the deaths of Walorski and the others as accidental from injuries suffered in the crash. Investigators blamed the crash on Potts for “driving left of center with a contributing factor of excessive speed.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Iowa Confluence Water Trails project received a big boost Friday when Gov. Kim Reynolds announced she will allocate $7million in federal funding for its construction. Though backers of the project aim to develop outdoor attractions across 150 miles of waterways in central Iowa, the governor allocated the latest round of funding to one of the project’s focal points: the Scott Avenue dam development at the confluence of the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers in downtown Des Moines. Developers plan to turn the low-head dam into two whitewater features for rafting, kayaking, canoeing, tubing and surfing. They also expect to add trails, a plaza and fishing areas. The latest grant represents about 13% of the $53.5 million budget for the development. The water trails comprise one of two Des Moines projects that received federal money through the state’s Destination Iowa program Friday, with the governor allocating $1 million to renovation of the Val Air Ballroom in West Des Moines. Reynolds also awarded Council Bluffs and the Southwest Iowa Nonprofit for Collaborative Impact $4.9 million for a joint plan to redevelop a stretch of that city’s Missouri River frontage.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Hundreds of thousands of dollars of COVID-19 relief funds spent by state and local governments could have violated federal rules or were ill-advised, a report released Wednesday by the Legislature’s nonpartisan auditing office showed. The audit comes as state officials are still grappling with how to spend millions in federal pandemic relief, with the process to dole out the money coming under fire over transparency concerns. Of the $18 million in expenditures by county governments, nonprofits and businesses reviewed by the Division of Legislative Post Audit, officials flagged $1.1 million in spending as ill-advised, with an additional $264,000 considered wasteful or excessive. And while 85% of funding was considered to be clearly allowable under federal guidelines, it was unclear whether $2.7 million in spending was acceptable. Another $48,000 was deemed to likely not be allowed. Potentially problematic expenditures ranged from a recipient of a small-business grant who conducted a festival to the purchase of electronic signs, sports equipment and office supplies by local governments. In Bourbon County, officials gave a vendor $450,000 to start a grocery store in a part of Fort Scott considered to be a food desert – only to see the store close after a few months.\n\nKentucky\n\nPaducah: When 14-year-old Michael Carneal opened fire on his fellow students during a morning prayer meeting in 1997, school shootings were not yet a part of the national consciousness. The carnage that left three students dead and five more injured at Heath High School, near Paducah, ended when Carneal put down his weapon, and the principal walked him to the school office – a scene that seems unimaginable today. Also stretching today’s imagination: Carneal’s life sentence guaranteed an opportunity for parole after 25 years, the maximum sentence permissible at the time given his age. A quarter-century later, Carneal is 39 with a parole hearing this week that comes at a very different time in American life – after Columbine, after Sandy Hook, after Parkland, after Uvalde. Today, police officers and metal detectors are an accepted presence in many schools, and even kindergartners are drilled to prepare for active shooters. “Twenty-five years seemed like so long, so far away,” Missy Jenkins Smith recalls thinking at the time of the sentencing. Jenkins Smith was 15 when she was shot by Carneal, someone she considered a friend. The bullet left her paralyzed, and she uses a wheelchair to get around. The shooting at Heath High School took place Dec. 1, 1997, less than four months before a shooting in Jonesboro, Arkansas. Carneal’s parole hearing is scheduled to start Monday with testimony from those injured in the shooting and close relatives of those who were killed.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Families and businesses in Tangipahoa Parish are a step closer to getting paid for flood damages in 1983 caused by the construction of Interstate 12. A $95 million payment was approved Friday by the Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget, The Advocate reports. The committee’s action allows the money to be moved to an escrow account and eventually to the 1,246 victims, 400 families and 96 businesses harmed. “This is the single final payment that resolves the entirety of the lawsuit,” Commissioner of Administration Jay Dardenne said. When those payments will be made is unclear. The state earlier put $6 million into an account for the plaintiffs, which means the total settlement is $101 million, the newspaper reports. Dardenne said he is confident a district judge will approve the payment, which will then allow a special master to decide how much individuals and businesses are owed. Rains on April 6, 1983, flooded about 6,000 homes in the Baton Rouge area. In Tangipahoa Parish, east of Baton Rouge, the newly opened I-12 acted like a large levee and resulted in water from the Tangipahoa River being diverted into homes and businesses. In 1999, a jury decided that the I-12 bridge over the river did not change elevation crossing the river as it should have and awarded plaintiffs in $92 million. However, nothing happened for years while the state Department of Transportation and Development appealed, and the Legislature declined to approve the award.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Wild blueberries were smaller this summer in the barrens of Maine, where the sweet crop expanse dominates treeless plains of sandy soil. Some of the lowbush berries started shriveling or ripened too quickly, hitting the dry ground before harvest season began. The drought-stressed plants were speeding up their production process. Lobster and blueberries go hand-in-hand when people think of Maine. The state’s iconic wild blueberries are one of only three fruits native to North America, and they’re loaded with twice the antioxidants of their ordinary crop equivalent. There are 36,000 acres of commercial wild blueberry land in the state, and the crop’s total value reaches tens of millions of dollars each year. But climate change-induced drought is threatening the superfood fruit, particularly the native lowbush species in Maine where irrigation systems are few and far between. With climate change creating a world of extremes in New England – longer and more frequent dry spells punctuated by deluges of rain within shorter periods of time – the region’s blueberry farmers face the task of adapting. “In every season, there are all of these different weather events that can happen that can increase or decrease the crop,” said Lily Calderwood, extension wild blueberry specialist and assistant professor of horticulture at the University of Maine. “Every year is a new adventure. And because of climate change, we have seasonal droughts that occur more frequently now.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A court hearing has been set for Monday to consider a request from prosecutors to vacate the 2000 murder conviction of Adnan Syed, whose case was chronicled in the hit podcast “Serial.” Baltimore Circuit Judge Melissa Phinn scheduled the hearing for 2 p.m., The Baltimore Sun reports. The development comes after Baltimore prosecutors filed a motion Wednesday saying a lengthy investigation conducted with the defense had uncovered new evidence that could undermine the conviction of Syed. He has served more than 20 years in prison for the strangling of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee, who was 18 when she was killed in 1999. Her body was found buried in a Baltimore park. Syed, 42, has maintained his innocence for decades and captured the attention of millions in 2014 when the debut season of the “Serial” podcast focused on the case and raised doubts about some of the evidence, including cellphone tower data. Prosecutors said in their motion that they weren’t asserting that Syed is innocent but that they lacked confidence “in the integrity of the conviction” and recommended he be released on his own recognizance or bail. “We believe that keeping Mr. Syed detained as we continue to investigate the case with everything that we know now, when we do not have confidence in results of the first trial, would be unjust,” State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Taxpayers can look forward to seeing a return of some of their tax dollars this year, Gov. Charlie Baker said Friday. The announcement came after the state auditor’s office certified that tax revenues exceeded allowable revenues under a little-noticed 1986 law that kicked in due to the state’s soaring tax collections. As a result, taxpayers are on tap to claim a share of more than $2.9 billion dollars. Those eligible will receive refunds automatically as a check sent through the mail or via direct deposit. Distribution of refunds is expected to begin in November. In general, eligible taxpayers will receive a credit in the form of a refund that is approximately 13% of their Massachusetts Tax Year 2021 personal income tax liability, officials said. To be eligible, individuals must have filed a 2021 state tax return on or before Oct. 17, 2022. An individual’s credit may be reduced due to unpaid taxes, unpaid child support or certain other debts.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A judge on Friday signed off on a fund for more than 1,000 people who said they were sexually assaulted by a University of Michigan doctor – an order that allows victims to start collecting a portion of a $490 million settlement negotiated with the school. “The University of Michigan offers its heartfelt apology for the abuse perpetrated by the late Robert Anderson. We hope this settlement helps the healing process for survivors,” said Paul Brown, chairman of the school’s governing board. Anderson died in 2008 after working at the university for nearly 40 years. He was director of the campus Health Service and a physician for multiple sports teams, including football. Former athletes, students and others who had no connection to the university – mostly men – said they were molested by Anderson during routine physicals or other visits. The settlement was announced in January, but the final details took months to wrap up. The university said the deal recently got approval from 98% of claimants. “It’s been a long road,” said Richard Schulte, a lead negotiator for Anderson’s victims. “I’m very happy for the survivors and glad I could get it across the finish line.” Six percent, or $30 million, of the settlement will be set aside for people who step forward later with claims.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Democratic Gov. Tim Walz agreed Saturday to two additional debates against Scott Jensen, following complaints from the Republican challenger that Walz is ducking him. The candidates will meet for an Oct. 18 debate sponsored by a group of television stations that includes KEYC in Mankato, KTTC in Rochester, KBJR in Duluth and KXJB in Fargo, North Dakota. Another debate is scheduled for Oct. 28 on Minnesota Public Radio. Jensen called Walz’s announcement “a classic case of too little, too late” because early voting begins this week. Jensen, a former state senator, and Walz previously debated at Farmfest, a yearly agricultural expo near Redwood Falls. The Walz campaign said that holding three debates matches the number of forums “that were held in the U.S. Senate elections won by Amy Klobuchar in 2018 and Tina Smith in both 2018 and 2020.” Both debates will be streamed online, according to Walz’s campaign.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city’s water crisis isn’t over, even if its boil-water advisory was lifted Thursday. While the state stopped handing out free bottled water at sites around Jackson on Saturday night, the city said water pressure still hasn’t been fully restored, and state health officials said lead in some pipes remains so worrisome that pregnant women and young children should still use bottled water. “The water that’s coming out of my kitchen sink smells like fresh sewage … as soon as you turn it on, it hits you right in the face. It’s horrible,” resident and mother Carey Wooten said earlier this month. “I’ve tried to give one of my dogs the water, but when she smells it, she won’t even touch it. She walks away from it.” Wooten said Friday that the liquid flowing into her kitchen sink still smells like sewage, but not as bad as before, and she’s glad she won’t have to run to distribution sites before their bottled water supplies run out each day. Other residents said Friday that their water remains too discolored to count on, so now they’ll have to rely on water distribution by community-run charities or buy water again themselves, adding insult to injury. Residents, politicians, experts and activists say systemic racism is the root cause of the crisis. White flight that began accelerating around 1980, a decade after the city’s schools began integrating, left less revenue to maintain infrastructure. Middle-class Black people then moved out to escape urban decay and rising crime. State and federal spending never made up the difference.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: A convicted felon accused of livestreaming threats to bomb and kill people while dressed as Batman villain the Joker was sentenced Friday to 60 days in jail, with credit for several months served after his arrest. Jeremy Garnier, 51, of University City, was sentenced after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge of making a terrorist threat. Prosecutors reduced the charge from a felony for the March 2020 incident. Garnier told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that he never intended to make a threat and pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor to avoid many more months in jail. “I was talking like the Joker,” Garnier said Saturday in an interview. “I was in character. Everybody knew that it was a joke and that I had no intentions of following through with a threat.” Garnier told the Post-Dispatch he served more than 20 years in federal and state prison for robbing a credit union in the 1980s and for other felonies in order to support his crack habit. He said he is now sober and wants to use his platform to raise awareness about the opioid epidemic. He said he has learned another hard lesson. “Think before you act,” he said. “Your actions have repercussions. No matter how trivial and joking I thought it was, people took it seriously.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A judge has determined three laws passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature to regulate activities on university campuses are unconstitutional, including one that sought to ban transgender women from participating on female collegiate sports teams. Montana’s Constitution gives the state board of regents full authority to govern public college campuses and precludes state lawmakers from imposing their own rules, District Court Judge Rienne McElyea said in a ruling issued Wednesday that was emailed to attorneys in the case Friday. Her ruling noted that the Montana Supreme Court recently affirmed the same conclusion in a challenge to a bill that sought to allow more people to carry guns on campuses. The ruling was the second judicial setback of the week on laws passed by Montana’s 2021 Legislature that affected transgender residents. A different state judge on Thursday clarified that he temporarily blocked health officials from enforcing a state rule that would prevent transgender people from changing the gender on their birth certificate. In response, the Republican-run state on Thursday said it would defy the order. The ruling comes amid a heated national debate over whether transgender women should be allowed to participate in female sports at the high school and collegiate level.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A judge has rejected a lawsuit filed by two Omaha women who sought to have both their names listed as parents on their children’s birth certificates, saying the request conflicts with state law. Lancaster County District Judge Ryan Post said in his ruling last month dismissing the lawsuit that state law requires birth certificates to acknowledge paternity. Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services policy also requires that parents listed on birth certificates be the biological parents of the child, he said. The Nebraska chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union sued the state last year on behalf of Erin Porterfield and Kristin Williams. They said the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services repeatedly denied their request to amend one son’s birth certificate in their effort to get full legal recognition as parents of both their sons – one born to each woman conceived through a sperm donor. Porterfield and Williams were in a romantic partnership from 2000 to 2013 – two years before same-sex marriage was legalized in Nebraska. Porterfield gave birth to their first son in 2002, and Williams gave birth to their second son in 2005 before their romantic relationship ended in 2013. But both women continue to share parenting duties. In their lawsuit, the women said that state officials treat unmarried, same-sex couples differently than unmarried, opposite-sex couples, violating their due process and equal protection rights.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The GOP’s nominee for governor said Thursday that he would fight against a national abortion ban if Congress were to pass one. “It’s the vote of the people within the state of Nevada, and I will support that,” Joe Lombardo, who is generally anti-abortion, told reporters while campaigning. “That is an issue that doesn’t need to be in politics.” Nevada voters codified the right to abortion up to 24 weeks into pregnancy into law in a 1990 referendum. Any order to further restrict abortion would have to come from a vote of the people, not the Legislature, unlike in many other states. Last week U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., proposed a near-total abortion ban after 15 weeks. The legislation undermined many GOP candidates’ arguments this summer that the future of abortion rights in the U.S. would be decided by individual states. Lombardo, who is the Clark County sheriff, has long maintained that as governor he would respect the 1990 vote, though he is Catholic and holds anti-abortion views. Still, a nationwide abortion ban would supersede Nevada law, and it is unclear how Lombardo could fight one. Republican April Becker, a candidate in Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District, opposes abortion except for instances of rape and incest. But she told NBC News last week that she would vote against a nationwide abortion ban, calling it unconstitutional for Congress to regulate abortion.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A legislator on Friday proposed extending the March deadline to close the state’s troubled youth detention center amid concerns that the current timeline would endanger public safety. Debate over the future of the Sununu Youth Services Center in Manchester began years ago but has come to a boil amid horrific sexual abuse allegations. Frustrated with spending $13 million a year to operate a 144-bed facility for about a dozen teens, lawmakers set a mandatory March 1 closing date. But the center’s fate remains unclear after lawmakers were unable to agree this year on how to replace it. Rep. Jess Edwards, R-Auburn, said Friday that he plans to introduce two bills for the legislative session that starts in January: one to extend the deadline by three months and another calling for a new 12- to 14-bed facility, with room for 18 if necessary. He told Deputy Health Commissioner Lori Weaver he is concerned about what will happen March 1 without such measures. “The Legislature let you down,” he said. “We just could not reach agreement, so we gave you nothing to go on in terms of money to plan and design it.” Weaver said she can’t predict the center’s population six months in advance, but based on the current situation, “there would be a definite impact on public safety” if the deadline arrived without further guidance.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold Township: In 2020, as saxophonist Steve Barlotta was recovering from a near-fatal bout with COVID-19 that included 24 days on a ventilator, the Jackson resident made a promise to everyone who treated him at CentraState Medical Center. “He was like, ‘I’m going to play a concert out in the parking lot for everyone,” said Shannon Lenahan, a neurologic clinical specialist who helped Barlotta bounce back from near-total paralysis. “We were like, ‘OK,’ People say stuff like that all the time, and they go home and get sidetracked.” Barlotta did not get sidetracked. On Wednesday, he and his band Sensational Soul Cruisers performed a 90-minute concert on the hospital’s campus as a thank-you to the doctors, nurses and rehab therapists who saved his life and restored his health. “To see it actually happen and come to fruition was really special,” Lenahan said. “He didn’t forget. He was a little emotional, and it was a little emotional for us to be able to say, ‘This is why we did it.’ ” Barlotta, who has played alongside Bruce Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, Gary U.S. Bonds and the Monkees, capped the show with two numbers that came straight from the heart: “You’re All I Need to Get By” and “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,” both made famous by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s green chile season is in full swing as the aroma of fresh roasted peppers permeates the air, but growers and exporters in Mexico are just as busy, and that’s causing a crunch at the international border. Authorities said last Monday that agricultural inspectors with U.S. Customs and Border Protection have been processing dozens of chile imports daily at the port of entry in Columbus, New Mexico. They’re looking for any pests in the shipments that could affect domestic production in the state where green chile is a signature crop and a cultural icon. “Chile is a huge crop for farmers in New Mexico, so it is important that CBP agriculture specialists identify and stop any dangerous pests from making it into the state and potentially spreading,” acting Columbus Port Director Sam Jimenez said in a statement. As part of “Operation Hot Chile,” Jimenez said agricultural inspectors are being assigned to Columbus from other locations to help with the increased traffic. The inspectors will process around 100 chile shipments a day during the busiest part of the season. Imports have grown significantly each season, with inspectors seeing a nearly 25% jump since 2016. Officials are expecting continued growth this year. Despite more imports, New Mexico farmers are seeing higher yields from their crops, and the state’s reputation for growing what many have anointed as “the best green chile in the world” is expanding, said Travis Day, executive director of the New Mexico Chile Association.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Yeshiva University has abruptly suspended student club activity in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision last week that ordered the school to recognize – for now – an LGBTQ student group. In an email to students, university officials said Friday that the school would “hold off on all undergraduate club activities while it immediately takes steps to follow the roadmap provided by the U.S. Supreme Court to protect YU’s religious freedom.” On Wednesday, the high court cleared the way for the LGBTQ group, YU Pride Alliance, to gain official recognition from the Jewish university in New York. The undergraduate group describes itself as “a supportive space for all students, of all sexual orientations and gender identities, to feel respected, visible, and represented.” By a 5-4 vote Wednesday, the justices lifted a temporary hold on a court order that requires Yeshiva University to recognize the group, even as a legal fight continues in New York courts. Two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, sided with the court’s three liberal justices to form a majority. The disagreement among the justices appears to be mostly about procedure, and the case is being closely watched by other faith-based institutions.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s hospitals and hospital systems on Friday unveiled an offer that could shake up stalled negotiations to pass legislation that would expand Medicaid to cover hundreds of thousands of low-income adults. The North Carolina Healthcare Association said the offer sent to Republican legislative leaders and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper also contained reforms to some state laws that require regulatory approval before certain medical buildings can be constructed or services offered in a region. Senate leader Phil Berger this summer accused the association of refusing to compromise on “certificate of need” rules. Changes to these rules were contained in the Senate version of an expansion measure approved in June. Berger said they were needed to increase the supply of medical services that would be needed to treat the growing Medicaid population. Cooper, a big expansion proponent, told reporters last week that it would make sense for hospitals to negotiate with Berger on those rules, which hospitals contend help community facilities that disproportionately serve the uninsured or underinsured remain open. “Our board of trustees has made the difficult decision to propose certificate of need law reforms,” board chair Dr. Roxie Wells said in a news release.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state would spend up to $80 million over the next two years to address child care under a proposal pitched Tuesday by Gov. Doug Burgum. The GOP-led Legislature meets again in January and will consider the plan that also includes a child care tax credit for low- to middle-income families, expansion of child care assistance, and matching money for businesses that offer their employees child care. The second-term Republican governor said the lack of available and affordable child care for families contributes to workforce shortages that have hamstrung the state’s economy. Adequate and affordable child care helps attract and retain companies in the state, he said. North Dakota has “tens of thousands” of unfilled jobs, and many families “have to make a choice to work and pay for child care or not work at all,” Burgum said. North Dakota has more than 64,000 children under the age of 5 in some 45,000 households across the state, Burgum said. The state’s more than 800 licensed child care providers employ more than 6,000 people, he said. “In spite of that … working families are experiencing a child care crisis,” Burgum said. “There are more children than there are slots.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s efforts to curb gerrymandering are not working, and voters must once again amend the Ohio Constitution to take politics completely out of the process, the retiring chief justice of the state Supreme Court said Thursday. The current redistricting commission, created by constitutional amendment in 2015, has had no discernible effect on gerrymandering, and as a result voters this fall will elect candidates based on unconstitutional legislative districts, Republican Maureen O’Connor said in her annual and final state of the judiciary speech. A new amendment must create a commission that restricts partisan politics by prohibiting elected officials from serving, O’Connor said. The current Ohio Redistricting Commission consists of elected lawmakers and state officeholders, including the governor, and has a 5-2 Republican majority. Instead, commission members must consist of “sensible people who are not driven by politics but rather by what’s fair,” O’Connor said. “Fair representation and justice.” O’Connor’s remarks echoed the position she took in January when the court first ruled – in a 4-3 decision with O’Connor in the majority – that initial maps drawn by the commission were unconstitutional. The court made similar rulings four more times before a federal court ordered Ohio to use the third set of Statehouse maps approved by the Ohio Redistricting Commission, maps the state Supreme Court had also found unconstitutional.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An embattled jail is facing even more criticism after an inmate was able to leave the booking area unsupervised and raped a handcuffed female inmate who was awaiting release, according to charges filed Thursday. The victim “was handcuffed to a bar attached to a wall in the receiving area of the Oklahoma County jail and unable to escape” when Donta Ramone Thomas, 44, was able to remove her pants and rape her July 19, according to charging documents submitted by District Attorney David Prater. Jail surveillance video of the incident showed Thomas ignored orders to stand with his back to the wall and wait for other inmates to be processed after he was booked into jail on assault charges. “Thomas disregarded these instructions and walked away from the area,” according to an affidavit. “He walked down the hallway toward the old medical screening area, where (the victim) was sitting, handcuffed to a bar.” The incident is the latest at the jail, where a nine-member trust took over the jail from the sheriff’s office in 2020, tasked with managing its operation and finances. Oklahoma County’s Board of Commissioners unanimously approved of the trust the previous year. “This is another example of the jail trust failing to protect those who they are responsible to care for,” Prater said.\n\nOregon\n\nOregon City: A 23-acre property near Willamette Falls has a new name, based on its old name. Formerly known as the Blue Heron Paper Mill, the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde has renamed the site Tumwata Village in recognition of the native name for the falls, tumwata, and the ancestors who called the site home. “As a name, Tumwata Village represents the Grand Ronde tribe’s connection to the falls, as well as the sacred lands and practices of our ancestors,” said Cheryle A. Kennedy, chairwoman of the Grand Ronde tribe and descendant of the Clackamas people. The Grand Ronde tribe’s connection to the falls goes back to creation, Kennedy said. Pre-European contact, the land was home to her ancestors, including the village of the Clowewalla– the Willamette band of Tumwaters. It was also the Kosh-Huk-shix Village of Clackamas people. They lived and used the area to hunt and fish before the Willamette Valley Treaty of 1855 led to the forcible removal of the tribal populations from the falls area to the Grand Ronde reservation. Even after removal, people still went back to fish and gather at the falls. “The connection has remained,” Kennedy said. The Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde began the process of acquiring the land around the falls at least two decades ago, Kennedy said. The purchase was finalized in 2019.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: More than 1.7 million public and private school students in the state will be able to get breakfast for free under a plan that will begin next month and run through the school year, officials announced. The $21.5 million plan will be paid for with money from the previous year’s School Food Services General Fund appropriation. Schools that participate in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs will receive support from the program. The pandemic-era federal aid that made school meals available for free to all public school students ended this past school year, despite a push in Congress to extend it. In Pennsylvania, officials say breakfast consumption under the free meals program increased by 16%, compared to pre-pandemic levels. Nationwide, other states have adopted legislation to provide free meals regardless of income level.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: Short-term rentals such as those offered through websites like Airbnb and VRBO could be severely restricted as town officials contemplate an ordinance to limit them to owner-occupied units in just a few zoning districts. The Warwick Planning Board, in front of a nearly empty meeting room Wednesday night, voted to ask the planning staff who helped draft the ordinance to make a recommendation to the City Council, with instructions to ensure that rules around accessory dwelling units conform to a new state law. Planner Tom Kravitz said he was directed to get an opinion on the ordinance from the board. However, aside from asking Kravitz to issue a recommendation and worries about the state law change to accessory dwelling units, the Planning Board members did not discuss the regulation. Kravitz said the owner-occupied regulation should reduce the chances for complaints around parking and noise, citing the example of Newport, which now requires owners to occupy the units they are renting. Making the owner live in or adjacent to the property being rented provides oversight over guests, he said. The proposed zoning change cites short-term rentals as a source of “noise, congestion, pollution and disorderly behavior” and of generally disturbing the peace.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Lawsuits filed to stop the removal of memorials to Confederate leaders and a pro-slavery congressman have been dropped. The Post and Courier reports that the American Heritage Association helped fund one of the lawsuits. It had been filed by descendants of John C. Calhoun, a former congressman and vice president who died before the Civil War, opposing the city of Charleston’s removal of Calhoun’s statue. The association also had filed a lawsuit opposing the removal of a Robert E. Lee Memorial Highway marker from the campus of a charter school in Charleston and the renaming of an auditorium that had been named after Christopher Memminger, a treasury secretary of the Confederacy. The stone-and-metal monument to Lee was removed in July 2021 and placed in storage. The city made a deal with the South Carolina State Museum to take the statue of Calhoun. Both suits had been filed in state court. The highway marker and auditorium lawsuit was dropped Sept. 13. The Calhoun lawsuit was dropped Sept. 15, the newspaper reports. AHA President Brett Barry declined to comment on the status of the Calhoun case, despite the descendants’ request for dismissal. “Charleston monuments are an integral part of the city’s historical and artistic American landscape,” Barry told The Post and Courier.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s corn harvest may not have much juice this year. According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service’s latest crop production report, the state’s crop yield is estimated at 138 bushels per acre – a number nowhere near the record-breaking harvest of 2020, when farmers gathered a staggering 162 bushels per acre. In the northeastern counties, springtime floods and incessant rainfall oversaturated the region with moisture. The precipitation flooded some fields, preventing producers from being able to plant their seeds during a critical planting window. “Things did turn drier up in the northeast corner over the last two weeks, but, really, the question is whether that corn actually got planted,” said DaNita Murray, executive director of South Dakota Corn Growers Association. John Horter is one producer who received a mixed bag from the wet spring. On his farm in western Day County, he called the rains “timely” and the weather conditions “almost perfect.” The past two weeks of heat, he said, are drying out his fields just in time for the harvest. But there’s a lot of lost potential: The corn in his fields looks good, he said, but the rains flooded what’s traditionally his highest yielding areas of the farm, which kept him from being able to plant those acres.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The police officers who fatally shot a man walking on an interstate will not face criminal charges, a district attorney announced Friday. A lawsuit filed last week by the widow of Landon Eastep alleges that law enforcement used excessive force and should be liable for his death in Nashville. Chelesy Eastep argued it was unfair to expect her husband to act reasonably with multiple guns pointed at him. However, Davidson County District Attorney Glenn Funk said in a statement that after reviewing the case, Eastep’s actions “were designed to cause officers to perceive an immediate threat.” Eastep’s encounter with police began with a state trooper checking on him as he sat on a guardrail along Interstate 65 the afternoon of Jan. 27. After a brief interaction, Eastep pulled a box cutter, and the trooper called for backup, police said. Many other officers arrived, blocking traffic along the normally bustling travel corridor in both directions as a helicopter circle overhead. Authorities pleaded with Eastep, 37, to surrender while they kept their guns drawn. “During this encounter with law enforcement officers, Mr. Eastep became emotional, began sobbing, and reportedly started cutting his wrists a few times with a box cutter from his pocket,” Chelesy Eastep’s lawsuit says.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A judge on Friday expanded her order blocking the state from investigating families of transgender youth who have received gender-affirming medical care. Judge Amy Clark Meachum issued a temporary injunction preventing the state from investigating members of the LGBTQ advocacy group PFLAG Inc. over the medical care. The group has more than 600 members in Texas. Meachum in July issued an order blocking the investigations against two families of transgender children who had sued the state. Meachum’s order Friday also blocked the state from investigating the family of another teen who had sued, though the family said after the lawsuit was filed that they learned the investigation against them had been dropped. Meachum wrote that without the order, the families would “suffer probable, imminent, and irreparable injury in the interim.” The ruling was the latest against the state’s efforts to label gender-affirming care as child abuse. The Texas Supreme Court in May allowed the state to investigate parents of transgender youth for child abuse while also ruling in favor of one family who was among the first contacted by child welfare officials following the order by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Gov. Spencer Cox took to Twitter on Saturday night to call out the behavior of University of Oregon fans during a game against Brigham Young University. UO’s student section, The Pit Crew, has since issued a public apology, as have university officials. In a video posted to Twitter, Oregon fans in the school’s student section can be seen chanting “(expletive) the Mormons.” BYU is a private university sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Cox retweeted the video, calling it “religious bigotry alive and celebrated in Oregon.” Other videos and photos of attendees who also allegedly participated in the chanting were posted on Twitter. The Pit Crew on Twitter issued an apology Saturday night, saying its members “do not condone or support any hateful speech directed towards one’s religion and are ashamed of those who participated.” In contrast, BYU kicked off the game by honoring former Oregon tight end Spencer Webb before the game, running onto the field with a flag bearing Webb’s No. 18. Webb, who would’ve been a junior this season, died in July during an outing at Triangle Lake.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The U.S. Department of Labor is getting involved after finding some businesses in the state have failed to protect teenage workers. There has been a national trend of increased child-labor law violations, which had been steadily decreasing until 2015, when the numbers began to tick up again. The Department of Labor’s Northern New England office said it “has taken strong enforcement actions” including conducting investigations and engaging in outreach in order to decrease federal labor violations at businesses across the region. A news release from the labor department cited examples of violations in the food service industry this year at McDonald’s and Dunkin’ franchises. At nine New England McDonald’s locations run by Coughlin Inc., 142 workers ages 14 and 15 worked more hours than federal law permits. And an investigation found 18 workers ages 14 and 15 illegally operated an oven or a fryer without a device to automatically raise and lower the basket. Two minors were burned, and the company paid $109,125 in penalties. Vermont Donut Enterprises LLC and related companies running 12 Dunkin’ franchise locations were also cited for not adhering to restrictions on 14- and 15-year-old workers. There were 44 violations involving hours worked and 17 violations for operating high-speed ovens. A 16-year-old was illegally allowed to drive a vehicle between two locations. Six minors received burns, and the company was fined $15,737 in civil penalties.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has rewritten the state’s model policies for the treatment of transgender students, issuing guidance for school divisions that would roll back some accommodations and tighten parental notification requirements. The new model policies from the Virginia Department of Education, which were posted online Friday, say students’ participation in certain school programming and use of school facilities like bathrooms or locker rooms should be based on their biological sex, with modifications offered only to the extent required under federal law. The policies also say that students who are minors must be referred to by the name and pronouns in their official records, unless a parent approves the use of something else. Regarding parental notification, the guidelines say school divisions may not encourage teachers to conceal information about a student’s gender from his or her parents. And they say parents must be given an opportunity to object before counseling services pertaining to gender are offered. The guidance is subject to a 30-day public comment period that opens later this month. Then, in accordance with a 2020 state law, local school boards must adopt policies that are “consistent with” the department’s but may be “more comprehensive,” the document says.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: After 21/ 2 years of inspection and repair work, authorities have reopened the West Seattle Bridge, the main route between the peninsula of West Seattle and the rest of the city. The Seattle Department of Transportation announced that the bridge had reopened Saturday night, even as crews continued removing some barricades and detour signs. Officials closed the span in March 2020 after cracks were found to be growing rapidly. The repair work included 60 miles of steel cables that form the new backbone of the bridge. Each of the cables was anchored into new specialized concrete blocks woven into the structure. The department said crews also installed a network of reinforced carbon fiber sheets wrapped inside and outside the bridge walls and injected 240 gallons of epoxy into cracked concrete. Authorities say the bridge is now much stronger and more resilient to seasonal temperature changes and will last for decades to come. Engineers will continue to monitor the bridge using cameras, sensors and inspections.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Republican Gov. Jim Justice on Friday signed into law a ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, making West Virginia the second state to enact a law prohibiting the procedure since the U.S. Supreme Court’s June ruling overturning its constitutional protection. The bill will go into effect immediately, except for the criminal penalties, which will go into effect in 90 days, Justice said. He described the legislation on Twitter as “a bill that protects life.” “I said from the beginning that if WV legislators brought me a bill that protected life and included reasonable and logical exceptions I would sign it, and that’s what I did today,” he said. The ban has exemptions for medical emergencies and for rape and incest victims until eight weeks of pregnancy for adults and 14 weeks for those under the age of 18. Victims must report their assault to law enforcement 48 hours before the procedure. Minors can report to the police or a doctor, who then must tell police. The bill requires abortions to be performed by a physician at a hospital – a provision that at least two Republican lawmakers have said was intended to shut down abortions at the Women’s Health Center, which has provided the procedure since 1976 and was the state’s sole abortion clinic. Providers who perform illegal abortions can face up to 10 years in prison.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A local alderman whose name appears on the membership rolls of a far-right extremist group has resigned, citing safety concerns for his family. Madison Alderman Gary Halverson was among hundreds of elected officials, military members and law enforcement officers who were on a leaked list of Oath Keepers members, the group that’s accused of playing a key role in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Halverson said his resignation follows some vandalism at his house, which he said has triggered symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder for his wife. “For anyone who has PTSD, or lived with someone who does, knows that when something happens that is triggering, it is absolutely terrifying, and that terror can last for days or weeks or longer,” Halverson said in a statement. He did not specify what damage was done to his property or how it might be linked to his Oath Keepers membership. Halverson was elected in April 2021 and had one year left in his term. He said he joined the Oath Keepers in mid-2020 without vetting the organization. “I thought I joined an organization that welcomed veterans who cared about our democracy,” Halverson said earlier this month. “I was misled and I terminated the membership two months later in Aug 2020.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State transportation officials have asked the Biden administration to ease proposed federal requirements to receive funding toward a network of electric vehicle chargers. EVs account for 0.1% of vehicle registrations in Wyoming, and state Department of Transportation Director Luke Reiner told federal officials that it would be “irresponsible and illogical” to spend now on requirements that include four charging ports at stations every 50 miles. It will be more than 20 years before there’s enough EV adoption in the state to worry about lines at a four-port station, Reiner said. So instead of concentrating solely on major highway corridors, Reiner said, the federal money should also be used in areas away from interstates that attract lots of tourists, such as Yellowstone National Park. “Most of our EVs will be tourist traffic,” Reiner said Wednesday. “The idea is if you’re a nice lady from Iowa with an electric car, and you want to get to Yellowstone, we want to get you there. ... We want to make sure these stations are in populated areas so there’s more chance of success.” Wyoming asked for exceptions from the mileage requirement for 11 stretches of highway. Federal officials have not yet responded, Reiner said, and the state’s plan is still pending.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}]}
