But that temporary arrangement “could be rescinded at any time”, said The Times .\n\nThe territory was not included in the UK-EU post-Brexit trade deal, and was left outside the customs union. A temporary “pre-deal” arrangement was introduced in 2020, which effectively allowed freedom of movement at the Spain-Gibraltar border to avoid disruption, while letting Gibraltar remain a British territory.\n\nSeven years on from the referendum, the 35,000 or so inhabitants of Gibraltar, who describe themselves as British and who vehemently rejected a joint sovereignty plan with Spain in 2002, “still have no idea what their future relationship with the EU will be”, said the newspaper.\n\nSince the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, the “Rock” – which voted 96% to remain – has been “in a state of nervous limbo”, said The New European.\n\nTime is running out for an agreement to be reached on Gibraltar’s relationship with the EU and its potential inclusion in the Schengen common travel area. Next month’s snap Spanish elections give the issue “an extra edge”, said the Daily Mail . The polls increasingly predict a clear swing to the right, which takes a far harder line on Gibraltar than the incumbent, socialist-led left-wing coalition.\n\nControl over who flies in and out has been “a bone of contention”, and the facility is managed by Spain, Gibraltar and the UK under the 2006 Córdoba Agreement. But with the UK and Gibraltar now outside the EU, that arrangement “becomes additionally complex”, said the paper.\n\nDowning Street has dismissed Spain’s demand to oversee control of Gibraltar’s airport, which is technically on an RAF base despite the runway lying on “the narrow isthmus of land between the Rock [ Gibraltar ] and the Spanish frontier”, said The New European .\n\nTalks over the status of Gibraltar, its relationship with the EU and its land border arrangement with Spain have stalled as long-term tussles over the sovereignty of the British overseas territory have flared up.\n\nFor about a year, talks have been continuing to establish a common travel area between Gibraltar and the EU’s Schengen zone, effectively making it a de facto Schengen member, which would remove the need for most controls at the border.\n\nThis is vital for Gibraltar’s economy, said the Financial Times. The Rock is “as wealthy as it is cramped”: a “freakishly overdeveloped tiny place not even 3 square miles in size” that relies on 15,400 cross-border commuters from Spain to “double the size of its workforce every day”. Without the workers, the economy “would grind to a halt”.\n\nNo agreement would mean a hard border between Gibraltar and Spain, which could subject workers to long delays at one of only two entry points along a 1.2km border, for vehicles and pedestrians. It would also wreak havoc on trade, as Gibraltar imports almost all of its goods.\n\nThe EU, the UK, Gibraltar and Spain have all suggested a deal is close, but in May, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez’s ruling Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE), and the left-wing coalition it leads, was trounced in local and regional elections, while the centre-right Partido Popular (PP) and far-right Vox party made astonishing gains.\n\nThe centre-left coalition that had lowered tensions with Gibraltar now looks in serious peril in this month’s general election. Meanwhile, the Spanish right “uses Gibraltar as a whack-a-mole for energising a nationalist audience”, said Jacobin.\n\nWhat are the two sides?\n\nIn principle, Spain and Gibraltar agree on a need for smooth cross-border relations, said the FT. But “bigger matters are at play”.\n\nSpain refuses to recognise British sovereignty of the territory, which was originally ceded to the UK “in perpetuity” in the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713.\n\nSpain’s official position, both on the left and right, has always been that the British overseas territory belongs to Spain. Successive conservative governments have attempted to take at least partial control of the Rock.\n\nThe UK, meanwhile, relies on Gibraltar as a gateway to both the Mediterranean and Atlantic, located in a crucial shipping lane.\n\nNow, said the Daily Mail, “there appears to be a standoff” over the Spanish proposal about Gibraltar’s airport, which would effectively allow Spain jurisdiction.\n\nThat is “not something that Gibraltar can tolerate”, Vice-Admiral Sir David Steel, the governor of Gibraltar, told The Times.\n\nBritish diplomats accused the Spanish government of “making unacceptable demands”, said The Times. The UK would not allow anything that would “compromise sovereignty” of the British overseas territory, said Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson.\n\nSpain claimed the treaty was ready to sign and that the UK and Gibraltar were the obstruction, with the UK “quibbling” over small details of a treaty that would actually recognise UK sovereignty, said the paper.\n\nWhat is the likely outcome?\n\nIf the July election results mean the conservative PP party must rely on a coalition with the hard-right Vox to form a parliamentary majority, as the polls suggest, “there will be even more belligerence” over Gibraltar, said the FT. For Vox, “Gibraltar is visceral”.\n\nIn July 2021, the general secretary of Vox, Macarena Olona, called Gibraltar a “pirate cave”, and its leader, chief minister Fabian Picardo, “the biggest pirate at the helm”, said The New European. Vox leader Santiago Abascal has said any deal with the UK would have to surrender Gibraltarian sovereignty to Spain.\n\nIf a PP-led government rejects the negotiations and the current arrangement, Gibraltar would be left outside the EU’s Schengen zone with a hard border. That would be a “catastrophe”, John Isola, head of Gibraltar’s chamber of commerce, told The Times.\n\n“We now have a very narrow window to get a deal over the line,” The Times quotes a British diplomat as saying. “It is possible, but we are not optimistic. There are certain red lines which we are not prepared to compromise over.”\n\nIf Vox comes to power, a Spanish official told the paper, “the deal is as good as dead”.", "authors": ["Harriet Marsden"], "publish_date": "2023/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/961551/quiz-of-the-week-31-june-6-july", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 31 June - 6 July | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

Our limited newsletter series guides you on lifestyle changes to minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety.\n\nCNN —\n\nYou probably know that composting banana peels and eggshells can help reduce your negative impact on the environment. But did you know that, once you die, you can do that with your body, too?\n\nHuman composting — also known as natural organic reduction or the reduction of human remains — is the practice of placing a dead body in a reusable vessel with biodegradable materials that foster the transformation into nutrient-dense soil that can be returned to loved ones or donated to conservation land.\n\nThe notion of going green even in death might sound far-fetched, but California has become the latest state to sign a human composting bill into law, set to go into effect in 2027. Washington became the first state to legalize human composting in 2019, followed by Oregon, Colorado and Vermont.\n\nAdvocates of human composting hope it can help slow the climate crisis driven by burning fossil fuels that produce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane. Cremations require lots of fuel — cremating one corpse emits an estimated 418 pounds of carbon dioxide into the air, the equivalent of driving 470 miles in a car, according to Chemical & Engineering News, a publication of the American Chemical Society. In the United States, cremations account for 1.74 billion pounds of carbon dioxide emissions each year, according to Green Burial Council Inc., an organization that oversees certification standards for cemeteries, funeral homes and product providers engaged in sustainable burial practices.\n\n“Human composting … uses much less energy than cremation, which uses fossil gas to create heat of over 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit,” said Katrina Spade, founder and CEO of Recompose, a licensed green funeral home in Seattle. “When human composting transforms the organic material of our bodies, carbon is also sequestered in the soil created. Rather than being released as carbon dioxide gas through exhaust during a cremation, the carbon matter contained in each body returns to the earth.”\n\nCristina Garcia, the California Assembly member who introduced the state legislation, said wildfires and extreme drought are reminders that climate change is real, and that methane and carbon dioxide emissions must be reduced. “For each individual who chooses (natural organic reduction) over conventional burial or cremation, the process saves the equivalent of one metric ton of carbon from entering the environment,” Garcia said in a September news release.\n\nRecompose, Spade’s company, became the first human composting facility in the US when it opened in December 2020. Spade thought of human composting in graduate school after learning about livestock mortality composting, when farm animals are recycled back to the land, she said.\n\nHuman composting happens in steel cylinders known as vessels at Recompose. Sabel Roizen\n\nThe industry is new, and there is little research on how much better human composting is for the environment compared with traditional burials, cremation or green burials. And the process isn’t carbon-free since it still involves machinery operated by electricity and transportation of bodies, materials and remains, said Ed Bixby, president of the Green Burial Council.\n\nAs interest in more sustainable end-of-life options grows, transparency about the practice is crucial, Bixby said. A recent National Funeral Directors Association survey that found 60.5% of respondents were interested in exploring “green” funeral options because of potential environmental benefits, cost savings or other reasons.\n\n“With our families, we never want them to be disturbed or upset believing something that isn’t,” Bixby said. “If you’re going to do something, if it’s environmentally conscious, we think that’s wonderful. But we want to be sure that people understand what they’re buying into.”\n\nReducing death’s environmental and financial impact\n\nAt Recompose, human composting happens in a steel cylinder that’s 8 feet long and 4 feet tall, Spade said. A body is placed in the vessel on a bed of wood chips, alfalfa and straw.\n\n“Human composting creates an environment in which beneficial microbes thrive, with a specific moisture content and ratio of carbon and nitrogen materials,” Spade said.\n\nOver the next 30 days, everything inside naturally decomposes. One body creates a cubic yard of soil amendment — a substance added to soil to improve its texture or health — which is removed from the vessel and cured for two to six weeks. Afterward, it can be donated to conservation projects, or a certain amount can be returned to loved ones. But the amount loved ones receive can depend on what a state allows since the soil would still be legally considered human remains with regulations on what people can do with them, Bixby said.\n\nThe practice also avoids the introduction of nonbiodegradable materials — such as concrete or plastic vaults, steel caskets or lacquers — to the atmosphere or land, and forest depletion for wood caskets, Bixby said. Human composting would also protect funeral home workers from exposure to high levels of formaldehyde, which has been found to cause myeloid leukemia and rare cancers.\n\nHuman composting could lower the financial footprint of end-of-life arrangements, too. The median cost of a funeral with cremation in the US in 2021 was $6,971, and the median cost of a funeral with a viewing and burial was $7,848, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. But the median burial estimate doesn’t include a plot, headstone or other cemetery costs associated with a traditional burial, which can often double the cost, Spade said.\n\n“Recompose strives to keep the price for human composting comparable to other death care options,” Spade said.\n\nWho’s a candidate for composting?\n\nRecompose has composted more than 200 corpses into soil since opening nearly two years ago and has more than 1,100 people signed up for Precompose, the company’s prearrangement program, Spade said.\n\n“We hear from our clients that knowing that their body — or that of their loved one — will be able to return to the earth is deeply comforting,” Spade said.\n\nNot everyone is eligible for human composting. Natural organic reduction destroys most harmful pathogens, but there are three rare diseases that disqualify a body from undergoing human composting, Spade said: Ebola, tuberculosis and diseases caused by prions, which are abnormal, transmissible pathogenic agents that can cause abnormal folding of certain brain proteins.\n\nThe list of states allowing human composting may soon grow longer. A bill in New York state has passed both legislative houses and is on its way to the governor’s desk, Spade said. And in Massachusetts, state Reps. Jack Lewis and Natalie Higgins are leading a bill to legalize human composting there.\n\nMost funeral homes, however, might not be quick to adopt the practice, Bixby said. Once a permit is issued, direct cremation can be done the same day, he added. A burial typically takes three to five days, while human composting can take up to 120.\n\n“The problem I see, as far as this growing, is that you can’t do high volume,” Bixby said. “As long as this process is, having five or six (vessels) doesn’t do a lot of good. … As a businessman, my feeling is this really won’t gain much ground for that main reason.”\n\nHe added, “It doesn’t make a lot of practical sense. And I hate to make things about money because it shouldn’t be, but at the end of the day, when you’re providing a service, it has to be about the income because you have to keep the lights on.”", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/14/president-biden-king-charles-speak-first-time-since-queens-death/10376984002/", "title": "President Biden, King Charles speak for first time since queen's death", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden on Wednesday personally offered condolences to King Charles III in his first conversation with the new king since the death of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n\"I recalled her kindness, dignity, and constancy – and how she deepened the friendship between our nations,\" Biden tweeted.\n\nBiden also told the king he hopes \"to continue a close relationship with him.\"\n\nThe White House has not said what meetings Biden might have with Britain’s new prime minister or others while in England for the queen’s funeral.\n\n'Used beans' and 'The Talking Hat':Queen Elizabeth's visits with presidents didn't always go as planned\n\nBiden on a bus?:Brits say president, other world leaders to be escorted to queen's funeral in coaches\n\nBiden had known the queen for three decades and had met her three times, most recently in June 2021, when she hosted him and the first lady at Windsor Castle during their visit to the U.K. to attend the Group of Seven leaders' summit.\n\nAfter that visit, Biden told reporters the queen was \"very gracious\" and said he invited her to the White House.

She was born in 1975 into a family that she herself has described as “to the left of Labour,” Britain’s main left-wing party. She grew up in parts of the UK that didn’t traditionally vote Conservative, moving between Scotland and the north of England.\n\nIn contrast with her privately educated cabinet colleagues, Truss went to a state school in the Yorkshire city of Leeds, and later won a place at Oxford University. There she was an active member of the Liberal Democrats, a centrist opposition party that has long been an effective opponent to the Conservatives in large parts of England.\n\nDuring her time as a Liberal Democrat, Truss supported the legalization of cannabis and the abolition of the royal family – positions that are at total odds with what most would consider to be mainstream Conservatism in 2022.\n\nTruss says she joined the Conservatives in 1996, just two years after she gave a speech at a Liberal Democrat conference calling for the end of the monarchy.\n\nEven during her time as a Liberal Democrat, her peers questioned her sincerity and spotted traits that they say they still see in her today.\n\n“I honestly think she was playing to the gallery back then, whether she was talking about decriminalizing drugs or abolishing the monarchy,” Neil Fawcett, a Liberal Democrat councilor who campaigned with Truss in the 1990s, told CNN. “I think she is someone who plays to the gallery with whatever audience she is talking to, and I genuinely don’t know if she ever believes anything she says, then or now.”\n\nTruss has certainly continued to capture the attention of her audience. Since joining the Conservatives and becoming a lawmaker, she has fervently supported almost every conceivable ideology. She served loyally under three prime ministers in several different cabinet jobs, most recently as foreign secretary.\n\nMost notably, she supported remaining in the European Union in the UK’s referendum in 2016. At the time, Truss tweeted that she was backing those who wanted to remain in the bloc because “it is in Britain’s economic interest and means we can focus on vital economic and social reform at home.”\n\nTruss now backs Brexit, saying that her fears before the referendum that it could cause “disruption” were mistaken.\n\nTruss greets US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at a G7 summit in Liverpool last December. Phil Noble/Pool/Getty Images\n\nRecently, the new leader even went so far in burnishing her Brexiteer credentials as to refuse to call French President Emmanuel Macron an ally. When asked if he was friend or foe during a live broadcast, she said the “jury’s out.”\n\nThere is a debate within the Conservative Party as to how real this support of Euroskepticism is. Some think Truss was reluctantly following government orders, which opposed Brexit, in 2016. Others find that argument inconceivable.\n\nAnna Soubry, a former Conservative cabinet minister and anti-Brexit campaigner, told CNN that Truss “had the most cover out of any of us to support Brexit. Her brief at the time included the farming community, who supported Brexit on the whole. I sat around the cabinet table and heard everyone’s reason for doing what they did and find it hard to believe she’s changed her mind quite this much.”\n\nOn the other hand, Gavin Barwell, who served as former Prime Minister Theresa May’s chief-of-staff, said that, after the Brexit vote, “Truss made a decision very quickly that there wasn’t room for a compromise. If you were to do it, it needed to be done fully. And as the stalemate dragged on, she argued that a binary choice was coming between leaving with no deal and Brexit being reversed, and the latter would be catastrophic for the government.”\n\nTruss has been compared to Margaret Thatcher, who also wore a fur hat on an official visit to Moscow. Maxim Shemetov/Reuters\n\nThe closer she has edged to power, the more Britons have wondered what a Truss premiership would look like. She has campaigned to lead on the most conservative of agendas. She has pledged to slash taxes from day one, tear up EU regulations and encourage private sector growth with low corporation tax. She has said she will not impose a windfall tax on energy companies despite their posting huge profits during the current cost-of-living and energy crisis.\n\nTruss faces a challenge of forging a path for the Conservative Party, which has been in power for 12 years and has been bitterly divided over Brexit for half that period. Dan Kitwood/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThese sorts of policies were, of course, red meat to the Conservative members who ultimately voted for her. And while some of those who know her question how much she actually believes in them, there is little doubt she will put her full effort into implementing them and making her impact immediately felt.\n\nIt’s possible that a Truss government will ultimately look a lot like Johnson’s, but with a greater emphasis on cutting taxes, shrinking the state and, potentially, an even harder line on Europe.\n\nCritics have said the tax cuts she’s promised would lead to even greater inflation and rises in interest rates amid a forecast recession. Questions were also raised over a pledge Truss made to cut public sector pay, allegedly saving the public $8.8 billion. Her economics were questioned by her critics, and the uproar over perceived callousness toward public sector workers forced Truss to U-turn.\n\nJulian Glover, a journalist and speech writer to former Prime Minister David Cameron, was a university contemporary of Truss and remembers traits in her that are still recognizable today: determined but unfocused.\n\n“We only passed each other briefly and she was in a different year to me, but despite that, she stands out in my memory as a sort of strange, unfocused force, hugely in favor of action and change,” Glover told CNN. “It was always hard to see the aim of it all, or where it might lead, except that she would be at the center of it.”\n\nRoger Crouch, who succeeded Truss as president of Oxford University Liberal Democrats, told CNN that he remembers a woman who was “determined, single-minded and willing to challenge orthodox and prevailing, often male, wisdom.”\n\nUnlike many of those who knew Truss in her younger years, Crouch, who is now a teacher, thinks her opinions haven’t changed a huge amount since the 90s. “Liz was always more of a privatizing, libertarian liberal so there is a consistent thread of thought there. I remember a student discussion group in which she advocated privatization of lamp posts.”\n\nThose who know Truss say that while her views have changed over the years, she has always been determined and single-minded. Carl Court/Getty Images\n\nPrime Minister Truss will have a hard time uniting her party, which has been in power for 12 years and has been bitterly divided over Brexit for six of them.\n\nShe will also have to lead the country through its worst cost-of-living crisis in decades. Inflation is at a 40-year high, energy bills are set to increase by hundreds, possibly thousands, of pounds a year, and the UK is forecast to enter a recession before the end of the year.\n\nIn July, inflation rose above 10% for the first time in 40 years, driven largely by the rising cost of energy, food and fuel. According to the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% by the end of the year. The central bank also predicted that the UK will enter a recession before the end of 2022.\n\nAnalysts are skeptical that Truss’ tax-cutting policies will do much to help citizens. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research group focusing on public finances, said last month that the leadership contestants, who were both promising tax cuts and lower government spending, “need to recognise this even greater-than-usual uncertainty in the public finances.”\n\nThis winter, many families will have to make a grim choice between heating their homes and eating. And for a party that has been in power for more than a decade, it’s hard to deflect the blame for that onto anyone else.\n\nHer supporters see the chance for a fresh start in Truss. They believe that with Brexit less in the spotlight and the scandals that led to Johnson’s downfall soon to be a distant memory, the party will turn its focus to remaining in power and winning a historic fifth consecutive general election.\n\nAfter a vicious battle between Truss and Rishi Sunak (left), some question whether the new prime minister can keep the party in power at the next election. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nFor her detractors, it is more complicated. During this leadership contest those who have supported her rivals feel they have been unfairly maligned simply for disputing that Truss should be handed the keys to Downing Street.\n\nWhen it comes to running the country, this could be a problem for Truss. She had the support of fewer MPs than her rival Rishi Sunak during the early stages of the contest and the bad blood between the two camps has worsened over time.\n\nAnd for all Truss’ determination and single-mindedness, she takes over a party torn apart by infighting and suffering in the polls during a domestic crisis. So she may find her key objective – making her party electable at the next general election after so many years in power – too hard a task to achieve.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/09/08/camilla-queen-consort-meaning-explained/8028017001/", "title": "Why is Camilla queen? The royal title of King Charles' wife, explained", "text": "King Charles III now presides over the British monarchy. And by his side: Queen Camilla.\n\nWait a second. When Queen Elizabeth II, who died Sept. 8, 2022, reigned for her 70 years, her better half wasn't King Philip but rather HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. As with many things royal, it's complicated.\n\nCamilla's new title was set in motion in February 2022, when Elizabeth decreed during festivities marking her seven decades on the throne that the Duchess of Cornwall should be known as Queen Consort, as opposed to Princess Consort, when Charles ascended to the throne.\n\n\"Queen Consort\" is the fancy name for the wife of a reigning king, which the United Kingdom has not had since 1952, when King George VI died and his widow, Queen Elizabeth, became the Queen Mother.\n\nConfused? You're not alone. We shall endeavor to explain.\n\nWhat is a queen consort?\n\nAll previous wives of British or English kings were queen consorts (that includes all six of Henry VIII's wives, at least while they were married to him). In the 20th century, there were two: Queen Mary, wife of King George V, and Queen Alexandra, wife of King Edward VII (Queen Elizabeth II's grandmother and great-grandmother, respectively).\n\nHandy hint: Here's how you can tell the difference between the two Elizabeths: Queen Elizabeth II had a Roman numeral after her name, signifying her as the second sovereign of that name, not a consort.\n\nAlso for the record, there have been only six British or English reigning queens among the 41 monarchs since 1066 – Mary I, Elizabeth I, Mary II, Anne, Victoria, Elizabeth II – so it's easier to tell them apart.\n\nWhat does a Queen Consort do?\n\nAs with the first lady of the United States, there's no job description, no official duties and no salary. But there's high visibility, high pressure and high expectations from the public whose taxes pay for the monarchy.\n\nIn general, a queen consort's job is to support the king in any way she can. Job No. 1 is to birth heirs, but that isn't an issue for Charles, 74, and Camilla, 75, who each have children from their previous marriages. The royal succession is set for three more generations: After Charles comes his elder son, Prince William, 40, and after that William's elder son, Prince George, 9.\n\nAs the wife of Charles for the past 17 years, Camilla has already been doing what a queen consort would do: She is a royal patron to scores of charities and good causes, accompanies her husband on royal tours, meets thousands of people every year, and is gracious and charming with everyone.\n\nOne no-no: getting involved in political matters.\n\nWho could be a model for Queen Camilla?\n\nQueen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, who became queen consort after her brother-in-law King Edward VIII abdicated in 1936, helped save the British monarchy by steeling her husband, who was nearly undone by the pressures of being an unexpected king, especially during World War II.\n\nShe went with him everywhere, visiting bombed-out Londoners in the East End and spreading her brand of royal magic that people remembered fondly many decades later. When Buckingham Palace was bombed in 1940 and the king and queen narrowly escaped harm, she said she was glad because it \"makes me feel I can look the East End in the face.\"\n\nWhen she died in 2002 at age 101, an estimated 200,000 people filed past her casket at the Palace of Westminster over three days. The line stretched more than a mile along the River Thames.\n\nDo we have to call her Queen Consort Camilla?\n\nNo, Queen Camilla will do. It's nicely alliterative and the \"consort\" part is understood.\n\nThe official palace press operation will always refer to her as \"Her Majesty\" in any news release, but American media rarely use HM or HRH, for \"Her Royal Highness,\" in referring to Camilla now.\n\nHowever, Buckingham Palace officially identified her as Queen Camilla for the first time in April when revealing its invitation design for King Charles' coronation. Camilla will be crowned alongside her husband at the ceremony on May 6.\n\nThe title was notable because it marks a step in the remarkable transformation of a woman once derided as a homewrecker because of her role in the breakdown of Charles’ marriage to the late Princess Diana.\n\nWhy isn't Camilla the Princess of Wales?\n\nBecause of Diana, the late Princess of Wales, who long blamed Camilla for the breakup of her marriage to Charles (even though that wasn't all Camilla's doing) and because public fury at Camilla remained when she and Charles were married in 2005, eight years after Diana's death in a car crash in Paris.\n\nAt the time, it was decided that Camilla would take one of Charles' lesser titles, Duchess of Cornwall, to help soothe public feelings.\n\nThe title Princess of Wales is now held by Prince William's wife, the former Kate Middleton. Following Queen Elizabeth's death, King Charles named William and Kate the Prince and Princess of Wales, making Kate the first to hold the title since Diana's death in 1997. In fact, she is one of only three princesses to be known as Princess of Wales since 1901.\n\nHow come men married to sovereign queens aren't called 'King'?\n\nBecause by sexist definition, a king outranks a queen, and if she is the heir – the elder daughter of a king – and she has no brother, as in the case of Elizabeth II, then she is the sovereign and not her husband. He has to walk a few paces behind her for the rest of their married life.\n\nThat's especially true if he's foreign-born, as was the case for Prince Philip.\n\nWill Queen Camilla be crowned?\n\nYes. The most important head at any coronation is that of the sovereign, but the queen consort is crowned, too.\n\nAnd according to The Mail on Sunday, Camilla will be crowned with the Queen Mother’s platinum and diamond tiara, created for George VI’s coronation in 1937. The crown features thousands of diamonds, including the infamous 105-carat Koh-i-Noor diamond from India, which came into British hands and the British Crown Jewels by murky means in the colonial era. It was last seen in public resting on the Queen Mother's casket at her funeral.\n\nBy contrast, when Elizabeth II was crowned in Westminster Abbey in June 1953, she was alone on the throne above the Stone of Scone, and she alone received St. Edward's Crown from the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nIf King Charles dies, will Camilla be queen?\n\nWhile we call her Queen Camilla, she will never be the reigning queen. Only members of the royal family who are born in the direct line of succession can become the monarch.\n\nWith Prince William and his son Prince George the next two in line for the throne after King Charles, a reigning queen is unlikely to come anytime soon. (There have only been six reigning queens in British history since 1066.)\n\nMore royal news\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/18/health/how-to-stay-cool-without-air-conditioning-wellness/index.html", "title": "How to stay cool without air conditioning | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: This story was first published in 2020 and has been updated.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhether you’re without power, enduring extreme heat or trying to save money, there are ways to feel comfortable without artificial cooling.\n\nHeat can foster fun summer activities, but the body shouldn’t be too hot for too long, as too much heat can harm your brain and other organs, according to the US National Institutes of Health. Sweating is the body’s natural cooling system, but when that’s not enough, there’s increased risk for developing the heat-related illness hyperthermia — signs of which include heat cramps, heat edema and heat stroke. Heat combined with high humidity exacerbates this risk, since the air’s saturation level makes sweat accumulate on the skin, preventing the body from cooling naturally.\n\nStaying cool can be done by using some basic supplies and knowing how to manipulate your home to control its temperatures. Here are 14 methods for doing so.\n\nStay hydrated\n\nWhen you’re hot and flushed, hydrating yourself is the first and foremost step to cooling down, said Wendell Porter, a senior lecturer emeritus in agricultural and biological engineering at the University of Florida.\n\nShutterstock\n\nThe temperature of the water doesn’t matter since your body will heat it, he added. If your body is suffering from the heat and needs to cool itself, it can’t do that without enough moisture, since the body cools itself by sweating.\n\nTake a cold shower or bath\n\nTaking a cold shower or bath helps cool your body by lowering your core temperature, Porter said.\n\nShutterstock\n\nFor an extra cool blast, try peppermint soap. The menthol in peppermint oil activates brain receptors that tell your body something you’re eating or feeling is cold.\n\nUse cold washrags on your neck or wrists\n\nShutterstock\n\nPlace a cold washrag or ice bags (packs) on your wrists or drape it around your neck to cool your body. These pulse points are areas where blood vessels are close to the skin, so you’ll cool down more quickly.\n\nUse box fans\n\nPlace box fans facing out of the windows of rooms you’re spending time in to blow out hot air and replace it with cold air inside.\n\nShutterstock\n\nIf the weather in your area tends to fall between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit in the mornings and evenings, opening the windows on both sides of the house during those times can facilitate a cross-flow ventilation system. If you do this, you can opt to use or not use the fans, but the fans would help cool the house faster, Porter said. The outdoors can pull the hot air from your home, leaving a cooler temperature or bringing in the breeze. Just be sure to close windows as the sun comes out, then open them when the weather is cool again.\n\nJust resting near a fan would reduce your body temperature as well.\n\nClose your curtains or blinds\n\nIf you have windows that face the sun’s direction in the morning through afternoon, close the curtains or blinds over them to “keep the sun from coming directly into the house and heating up (the) inside,” Porter said.\n\nShutterstock\n\nYou could also install blackout curtains to insulate the room and reduce temperature increases that would happen during the day.\n\nIf you do turn the air conditioning on, don’t set it below 70 degrees Fahrenheit in an effort to cool the house faster, said Samantha Hall, managing director of Spaces Alive, an Australia-based design research company helping to create healthy, sustainable buildings.\n\n“It just runs for longer to reach that temp and will keep going until you start to feel a bit chilly and is then hard to balance,” she added. Instead, keep the unit temperature as high as possible while still comfortable.\n\nSleep in breathable linens\n\nCotton is one of the most breathable materials, so cotton sheets or blankets could help keep you cool through the night.\n\nShutterstock\n\nThe lower the thread count of the cotton, the more breathable it is, Porter said. That’s because higher thread counts have more weaving per square inch.\n\nSleep in the basement\n\nIf you can’t sleep through the night because you’re too hot, try sleeping somewhere besides your bedroom, if that’s an option. Heat rises, so if you have a lower or basement level in your home, set up a temporary sleeping area there to experience cooler temperatures at night.\n\nDon’t refrigerate or freeze blankets or clothing\n\nCommon advice for staying cool without air conditioning includes refrigerating or freezing wet socks, blankets or clothing then ringing them out to wear while you sleep. But this isn’t a good idea, Porter said.\n\nBecause of “the amount of energy they can absorb from your body that night, they will be warm in just a matter of minutes,” he said. “And then you’d have damp stuff that would mold your mattress. So you definitely don’t want to do that.”\n\nClose the doors of unused rooms\n\nIf no one’s using a room that doesn’t have vents or registers, close the door to that area to keep the cool air confined to only occupied areas of the house.\n\nUse the exhaust fan in your kitchen and/or bathroom\n\nFlip the switch for the exhaust fan in your kitchen to pull hot air that rises after you cook or in your bathroom to draw out steam after you shower.\n\nInstall energy-efficient light bulbs\n\nIncandescent light bulbs generate a higher temperature than LED light bulbs do. To make the switch, watch for sales on energy-efficient bulbs, then slowly replace the bulbs in your house, Porter said.\n\nShutterstock\n\nSwitching light bulbs can save money but won’t reduce a lot of heat in the home, Hall said. However, if you focus on switching the bulbs in areas you’re sitting near, that would make a more noticeable difference, Porter said.\n\nCook in the morning, with a slow cooker or outside\n\nShutterstock\n\nOven heat can spread throughout your house. Keep the heat centralized in one area, such as a slow cooker. Or, cook outdoors on a grill to keep the heat outside.\n\nEnjoy frozen treats\n\nEating an ice pop or ice cream to cool down may help for a moment. But don’t go overboard on the sugar if you’re overheated or at risk of being overheated, Porter said.\n\nShutterstock\n\n“Sugar would run your metabolism up and you’d start feeling internally hot,” he said. “So the cool treat might be good, but the extra sugar might not.”\n\nResearch what your state offers\n\nIf you’ve tried everything and still can’t beat the heat at home, you could look online for any local programs that are offering ductless air conditioners.\n\nDepending on your state, some cooling centers — air-conditioned public facilities where people might go for relief during extremely hot weather — may be open and taking precautions to ensure they’re as safe as possible. You could start by checking with your local utility offices, as they would know who is offering certain programs, Porter recommended.\n\nREAD MORE: Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

Just over six weeks later, she was engulfed by a hurricane of her own making.\n\nIt was a humiliating end to a calamitous premiership marked by failed economic policies and a deeply divided ruling party.\n\nHow did it come to this? Here are the lowlights – and lowerlights – of Truss’ term as Britain’s shortest-serving prime minister.\n\nSeptember 5: Truss takes over\n\nLiz Truss delivers a speech outside 10 Downing Street on her first day in office Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nTruss is declared the winner of the Conservative Party leadership contest on September 5 after her predecessor, Boris Johnson, is forced to step down following a series of ethics scandals.\n\nThe omens aren’t good. The country is facing a bruised economy, a spiraling cost of living crisis and a crumbling healthcare service. Truss, who served as foreign secretary in Johnson’s government, also faces huge diplomatic challenges in the face of Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n\nIn her first speech as prime minister, in Downing Street on September 6, she tells the country that “together we can ride out the storm.”\n\nShe says her priorities included tackling soaring energy prices, improving the UK’s energy security and fixing the National Health Service.\n\nSeptember 8: Queen Elizabeth II dies\n\nJust two days into Truss’ premiership Queen Elizabeth II dies at the age of 96, sending the country into a period of national mourning.\n\nTruss pays tribute to the Queen as a symbol of stability who ruled through crises, tragedies, political scandals, pandemic and recessions.\n\n“Queen Elizabeth II was the rock on which modern Britain was built,” the new prime minister says. “Our country has grown and flourished under her reign.”\n\nLiz Truss speaks at the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey in London. Phil Noble/Pool/Reuters\n\nThe period of mourning gives Truss a breathing space, the chance to take a break from a marathon leadership campaign that lasted most of the summer.\n\nThere is also a hope that the moment will inspire a new, unifying approach to political debate, whatever people’s personal politics.\n\nThat doesn’t last.\n\nSeptember 23: A disastrous ‘mini-budget’\n\nIt’s Truss’ first big move as prime minister. Her finance minister and closest friend in politics, Kwasi Kwarteng, unveils a sweeping plan to extricate the country from recession, which includes a swath of tax cuts that will be funded by higher government borrowing.\n\nThe plan’s a huge gamble – the biggest tax cuts in 50 years, without a clear plan on how to pay for them. Usually, big fiscal statements in the UK are audited independently by the Office for Budget Responsibility. But Kwarteng says there was no time for such an audit – a move that stuns financial markets and sends the pound plunging.\n\nChancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveils a \"growth plan\" in the House of Commons on September 23. Jessica Taylor/UK Parliament/Reuters\n\nThe prime minister later defends her government’s controversial tax cuts in an exclusive interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n\nShe says that by cutting taxes, her government is “incentivizing businesses to invest and we’re also helping ordinary people with their taxes.”\n\nBond prices subsequently collapse, sending borrowing costs soaring, sparking mayhem in the mortgage market and pushing pension funds to the brink of insolvency.\n\nOctober 14: Truss fires Kwarteng\n\nThe economic turmoil and the prospect of higher mortgage rates force Truss to walk back key components of her financial plan.\n\nAfter ditching her plan to slash the highest rate of income tax, she fires Kwarteng in October in a desperate attempt to salvage her position.\n\n“It was right, in the face of the issues we had, that I acted decisively to ensure that we had economic stability,” Truss says.\n\nIn a letter posted on Twitter, Kwarteng says he agreed to step down at Truss’ behest.\n\nTruss appoints former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt as Kwarteng’s replacement, making him Britain’s fourth finance minister in just over three months.\n\nOctober 17: Hunt ditches Truss’ fiscal plan\n\nJust three days into the job, Hunt says he will scrap “almost all” tax measures announced by his predecessor, in an effort to calm spooked markets and restore the government’s credibility.\n\nA proposed cut to the basic rate of income tax from April 2023 is postponed “indefinitely.” And while the government says it will still guarantee energy prices for households and businesses through this winter, it won’t commit to capping prices beyond next spring.\n\nThe moves amount to a gutting of Truss’ flagship “growth plan” and leave her in a perilous political position.\n\nWhile investors show support for Hunt’s new plan, the opposition Labour Party is not appeased.\n\n“All the Chancellor’s statement underlines is that the damage has been done,” lawmaker Rachel Reeves tweets.\n\nOctober 19: Key ally quits Cabinet\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman announces her departure from Truss’ Cabinet, as claims emerge of chaos and “bullying” during a parliamentary vote the same day.\n\nBraverman says she stepped down as Home Secretary over the use of a personal email address that violated ministerial rules, but also launches a thinly veiled criticism of Truss’ leadership in her resignation letter.\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman was forced to resign from Truss' Cabinet. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\n“The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes. Pretending we haven’t made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can’t see that we have made them, and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics,” Braverman writes.\n\nAllegations also emerge on Wednesday of some ruling Conservative Party lawmakers being physically dragged to vote with the government against the ban on fracking for shale gas.\n\nPoliticians later share accounts on Twitter of angry scenes of shouting and altercation in parliament.\n\nOctober 20: Truss quits\n\nAfter a chaotic six-week spell in Downing Street, Truss announces her resignation.\n\n“I recognize though given the situation I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party,” she says.\n\nTruss says she has tendered her resignation to the King, and a leadership election will take place within a week. She will remain UK prime minister until her successor is chosen.\n\nHer swift exit as prime minister prompts calls for an early general election in Britain.\n\n“After 12 years of Tory failure, the British people deserve so much better than this revolving door of chaos,” Labour leader Keir Starmer says after Truss announces she will resign. “We need a general election, now.”\n\nBut a fresh election is no certainty before 2025, even as Britain prepares for its fifth leader in just over six years – and its third since the last ballot.", "authors": ["Sana Noor Haq"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/09/uk/royal-family-king-charles-iii-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Royal family: As King Charles III takes the throne, big changes lie ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGod save the Queen, long live the King.

As sovereign, he has chosen to take the name King Charles III.\n\nAll rights and responsibilities of the Crown now rest with King Charles III.\n\nHe becomes head of state not just in the UK but in 14 other Commonwealth realms including Australia and Canada. He will become head of the 56-member Commonwealth, although that is not a hereditary position, after his succession to the role was agreed by Commonwealth leaders at a meeting in London in 2018.\n\nHe has become head of the British Armed Forces, the judiciary and the civil service, and he is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. He is the Fount of Honour, which means all honors, such as knighthoods, will now be given in his name.\n\nThe United Kingdom does not have a codified constitution, so the role of monarchy is defined by convention rather than law. He has a duty to remain politically impartial, which means he will come under greater scrutiny if he continues to express the views he is known for.\n\nHe has championed alternative medicines and organic farming techniques. In 1984, he hit out at the “glass stumps and concrete towers” of modern architecture. He has spent decades warning of the dangers of climate change. In the so-called “black spider” memos, he raised the issues he was concerned about directly with ministers.\n\nIn a BBC documentary to mark his 70th birthday, Charles acknowledged having ruffled feathers with his past interventions. But he promised not to meddle in controversial affairs once sovereign, saying he would operate within “the constitutional parameters.”\n\nElizabeth stayed “above politics” and never expressed herself in any way on any issue and as a result she rarely divided opinion. She managed to retain popular support and cross-party support in parliament, which was the one body with the power to dethrone her.\n\nWe will never know what she discussed in her regular audiences with her prime ministers, beginning with Churchill, but Charles is a more outspoken character. Will he go quiet on policy matters in public but continue to lobby in private? Will the prime minister act on it?\n\nThe prime ministerial audiences are one of several constitutional duties to which King Charles III will be expected to step up and they will bring him in regular contact with policymakers. He appoints the prime minister, opens parliamentary sessions, approves legislation and official appointments, receives the credentials of foreign ambassadors and hosts world leaders on state visits.\n\nCharles has also adopted the symbolic position as Head of Nation, meaning he becomes the symbol of national identity, unity, and pride. He represents continuity and celebrates excellence on behalf of the country. That’s why we see the monarch opening national events and leading commemorations.\n\nPeople would look to Elizabeth in times of crisis, but will they rally around King Charles III in the same way? He is more divisive not just because of his honest views but also because of the bad taste still left from his acrimonious divorce from his immensely popular first wife, Diana.\n\nAll the official royal residences including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle will now be under his control. There are also other residences such as Balmoral in Scotland and Sandringham in Norfolk which the Queen owned privately – and the nation will have to see to whom she leaves them in her will.\n\nEither way, Charles’ wealth has ballooned. By far the biggest slice of the family’s fortune, the £16.5 billion ($19 billion) Crown Estate, now belongs to him as reigning monarch. But under an arrangement dating back to 1760, the monarch hands over all profits from the estate to the government in return for a slice, called the Sovereign Grant.\n\nThe estate includes vast swathes of central London property and the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It has the status of a corporation and is managed by a chief executive and commissioners — or non-executive directors — appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the prime minister.\n\nThe grant, which covers the cost of his official duties and amounted to £86.3 million ($99.2 million) for the 2021/2022 financial year. He will take charge of the Royal Collection, which includes one of the most valuable art collections in the world. He also picks up the Duchy of Lancaster, a private estate dating back to 1265, which was valued at about £653 million ($764 million) according to its most recent accounts. Income from its investments cover official costs not met by the Sovereign Grant, and helps support other Royal family members.\n\nKing Charles III has become one of the richest men in England overnight.\n\nCamilla\n\nCharles and Camilla attend the Order of the Garter Service at St George's Chapel on June 13, 2022 in Windsor, England. Toby Melville/Getty Images\n\nFor years, the big question around Charles’ wife surrounded her title. At the time their wedding was announced in February 2005, the official statement said: “It is intended that Mrs Parker Bowles should use the title HRH The Princess Consort when The Prince of Wales accedes to The Throne.” That was a very clear signal that Camilla would not use the title of Queen. Her office at Clarence House distanced itself from that statement in the intervening years, however, saying it was a matter for the reigning monarch.\n\nThen, in February 2022, the Queen expressed her desire for her daughter-in-law to be known as Queen Consort when Charles became King in a message marking the start of her platinum jubilee year – a statement that appeared to resolve the issue for good.\n\nThe Queen’s wishes were welcomed by the couple themselves. That same weekend, a statement released by a spokesperson said they had been “touched and honoured by Her Majesty’s words.”\n\nWhere will the couple live? Well, traditionally the new monarch would move into Buckingham Palace but in 2011, the BBC reported that Charles was considering moving his entire court to Windsor and turning Buckingham Palace into an events center. That would be a dramatic and controversial shift but might also assert King Charles III as the new boss.\n\nWilliam and Catherine\n\nWilliam and Catherine are pictured with their children, George, Charlotte and Louis, and the Queen, Charles and Camilla at Buckingham Palace during platinum jubilee celebrations on June 5, 2022. Toby Hancock/CNN\n\nUp until now, Charles has been responsible for covering the costs of his heir, Prince William.\n\nWilliam has now inherited his father’s titles of The Duke of Cornwall, which comes with an estate which last year delivered an income of £23 million ($26 million). That money now goes straight to William and he becomes independently wealthy.\n\nHis new title is HRH The Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge and tradition dictates that, as first in line to the throne, he also becomes Prince of Wales. And Catherine becomes Her Royal Highness, The Princess of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge.\n\nWilliam and Catherine will be able to solidify their own independent court, which is currently based at Kensington Palace in west London, in an apartment that was refurbished shortly after their marriage. It seems unlikely that William would want to move, so the King’s former residences, including Clarence House and Birkhall in the Scottish Highlands, will likely remain vacant until Charles offers them to other members of the family, or finds an alternative use. The family resides at Adelaide Cottage in Windsor during school term time.\n\nPrince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis will follow their parents’ titling. They are now Their Royal Highnesses Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis of Cornwall and Cambridge. Colloquially they are likely to be known as George, Charlotte and Louis Wales.\n\nHarry and Meghan\n\nMeghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry react as they attend the annual One Young World Summit in Manchester, north-west England on September 5, 2022. Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt’s unlikely that Charles’ second son, Harry, will be offered a royal office unless he and wife Meghan return to their royal duties, and the King would also need to confirm that they can continue to use Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate, which is part of the royal estate. They currently live with son Archie and daughter Lilibet in California but were allowed to continue using Frogmore as their official residence during the Queen’s reign.\n\nWhen Harry and Meghan announced in early 2020 that they were stepping back from royal duties, they said they would “work to become financially independent.” The terms of the split stipulated that while the pair would always remain part of the family, they would no longer use their HRH titles.\n\nAs grandchildren of the monarch, Archie now automatically becomes Prince Archie of Sussex while Lilibet will be Princess Lilibet of Sussex. Whether they use those titles will only become known the first time their parents refer to them publicly.\n\nPrince Andrew and other family members\n\nKing Charles III also becomes responsible for distributing roles, responsibilities and resources to other members of the royal family.\n\nCharles has never been close to his brother Andrew, who stepped back from royal duties over his links to the late disgraced financier, Jeffrey Epstein. In January 2022 he was stripped of his HRH title, as well as others associated with the military and charity roles. That raises the question of whether the new King continues to allow Andrew to use his Buckingham Palace apartment and offers financial support.\n\nThen there are his other siblings, Princess Anne and Prince Edward, and more distant relatives such as the Gloucesters and Kents who retain royal residences at Kensington.\n\nPrincess Anne attends a service at St Giles' Cathedral on June 30, 2022 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nCharles will need to decide how much family support he needs to carry out his duties and who he wants to offer it. Then he can reveal what support he offers in return. Many of these decisions would already have been taken and the first telling signs of where his loyalties lie will be seen in who gets to keep which residences and especially who gets an upgrade.\n\nAnne and Edward, and his wife Sophie, The Countess of Wessex, are expected to continue with their public duties following decades of dedicated service but the new King needs to balance that against pressure for a slimmed down monarchy in austere times.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/advice/2022/01/14/how-get-refund-nonrefundable-hotel-room/9171760002/", "title": "How to get a refund on a nonrefundable hotel room", "text": "Christopher Elliott\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nLook at your travel itinerary closely. Notice anything different? That's right, your hotel reservation may be totally nonrefundable. Yes, even during a pandemic.\n\nSo if you have second thoughts about traveling, and want to get a refund on a nonrefundable hotel room, you might be out of luck.\n\nSometimes, you don't even have a choice. Consider what happened to Liam Goodman. He booked a last-minute nonrefundable hotel room in New York from Priceline. When the property ran out of rooms and he had to stay in another hotel, Priceline pocketed his money.\n\n\"Priceline says I never checked in and was a no-show,\" says Goodman, a photographer from Beacon, New York.\n\n► USA TODAY Travel newsletter: Get the latest headlines in your inbox daily\n\nNonrefundable hotel rooms are becoming more common\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that nonrefundable (or \"prepaid\") hotel rooms are becoming more common. No one tracks and reports the number of nonrefundable hotel rooms in a systematic way. The deal is simple: You pay in advance for the hotel room(s) and you get a modest discount. There's no chance for a refund, even if you change your mind within 24 hours of making the reservation, unlike airlines.\n\nOK, did you check your itinerary yet? If you're stuck with one of these nonrefundable hotel rooms, don't worry. There are ways to get your money back. But maybe the best strategy is to avoid these tricky hotel reservations in the first place.\n\nGoodman wishes he had. He could have avoided the trouble by asking his original hotel to \"walk\" him to a comparable property, which is a hotel industry standard practice. Instead, he contacted Priceline for help – and it turned him down. I asked Priceline about his case. It reviewed its records and discovered that he wasn't a no-show, after all. The online agency offered him a full refund.\n\n► Small planes, cheap tickets but no help by phone: The inside scoop on budget-friendly Breeze Airways\n\nSo you want a refund for a nonrefundable room?\n\nI asked frequent travelers how they've received refunds for nonrefundable rooms. Turns out, many of them were able to get their money back under certain circumstances.\n\nWhen the hotel isn't as advertised. I've seen many cases where the hotel fell short of expectations. All bets are off when that happens. Take a lot of photos and appeal to the highest level possible – and if necessary to your credit card company. If the answer is still \"no,\" you might be able to salvage your stay. For example, when Heidi Vanderlee discovered she'd have to share a bathroom with another guest in her London hotel, she appealed to her online travel agent. After a lot of back and forth, the online agency fixed her reservation, allowing her to upgrade to quarters with a private bathroom. \"Could have been a much worse outcome,\" says Vanderlee, a publicist who lives in New York.\n\nWhen you're sick. That's what Grant Sabatier discovered recently when he fell ill and canceled a nonrefundable hotel room in Washington, D.C. A valid medical excuse can secure a full refund, particularly if it's COVID-19. But he had to call the hotel three times before it saw things his way. \"This has only worked for me when booking directly with a hotel,\" adds Sabatier, the founder of the financial advice site Millennial Money.\n\n► Bad news for United passengers: Airline says 3,000 employees COVID-19 positive, plans more flight cuts\n\nWhen your circumstances change. Hotels understand that your plans can change. Chris Michaels recently asked for a refund for two nonrefundable nights at a chain hotel in Chicago. \"In a friendly manner, I explained to a front-desk employee that I was part of the large tournament in town and that my team had been eliminated from the tournament. I also said I was a rewards member of the chain, and I've stayed at that location in the past,\" recalls Michaels, the founder of a personal finance site Frugal Reality. \"The hotel offered to charge me a $50 cleaning fee to get out of the remaining balance for the night. Needless to say, I paid it and headed home.\"\n\nWhen you have a death in the family. But don't expect it to be easy. Alex Beene had to cancel a nonrefundable reservation once because a relative died. The hotel forwarded him to a \"skeptical\" manager. \"But when I offered to provide documentation, he offered to go on and refund my stay and offered me condolences,\" says Beene, who works for the state of Tennessee. \"Just the idea that you have written justification for canceling a nonrefundable stay will show the hotel how serious you are about the claim.\"\n\n► 'We found out while we were flying': Last-minute cruise cancellations leave travelers scrambling\n\nWhat if you don't have a case?\n\nFace it, most of the time people just want a refund on a nonrefundable room without a valid reason. And why not? Hotels can often resell the rooms, so it's only fair that we should receive at least some of the money back, right?\n\nFrequent hotel guests like Anna DiTommaso, who owns a web design firm in Dallas, say it's worth a try, anyway.\n\n\"The hotel has the legal right to keep the money,\" she says. \"But I've found that if you have a reasonable excuse for canceling the room, most places will offer you a refund without you even having to ask.\"\n\nI agree. \"Prepaid\" rooms and nonrefundable rates are not customer-friendly. The discounts are too small, and the risks too big. Often, guests don't even know they have a nonrefundable rate until it's too late. Yep, hotels bury the terms in their fine print, just like other travel companies.\n\nBottom line: Nonrefundable hotel rooms shouldn't exist. But they do. Now you may have a way around them.\n\n► Hours in line or a $110 test: How the COVID test shortage is 'frustrating' Puerto Rico visitors\n\n3 ways avoid getting stuck with a nonrefundable room\n\nTravel insurance. If you have to cancel your hotel stay for a covered reason, you can receive reimbursement for your nonrefundable hotel cost from your insurance company. Seven Corners CEO Justin Tysdal recommends a \"cancel for any reason\" benefit. \"It allows you to cancel your trip for any reason you wish,\" he says. \"That way, should anything unexpected occur, you can cancel your trip and receive at least 75% of your nonrefundable trip cost back.\"\n\nChange the date of your reservation. Sometimes, nonrefundable hotel rooms can be changed to a future date. Andy Abramson, who runs a communications firm in Los Angeles, says for some hotels, once you move the date you can ask for – and receive a refund. \"I've used this trick several times.\"\n\nResell the room. Yes, it's possible. \"You can resell your nonrefundable hotel bookings to other people and receive a refund that way,\" says Galena Stavreva, CEO of SpareFare.net, which facilitates these room changes. She says hotels allow for changes of the name of the main guest under the reservation. Booking.com and Expedia facilitate name changes as well. You can recover some or all of your hotel room costs.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/14"}]}

Leaked emails obtained by the Daily Mail suggested that the Conservatives “used nearly £60,000 of party funds” on the “lavish makeover” and had earmarked specific donations. The decor was said to have included “hand-crafted” £840-a-roll gold wallpaper designed by interior decorator Lulu Lytle.\n\nJohnson had clashed horns with the commissioner and the standards committee on at least two prior occasions. In 2018, as an MP, he was ordered by the watchdog to apologise over the late declaration of £52,000 in book royalty payments. And just three months before becoming PM the following summer, Johnson was criticised for taking nearly a year to register his 20% stake in a Somerset property worth more than £100,000. The committee said that Johnson’s disregard for the 28-day time limit set for MPs to register such financial interests reinforced “their previous view that he had displayed an over-casual attitude towards obeying the rules of the House”.\n\nLittle more than nine months after Johnson became PM, The Observer revealed that the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards had launched an investigation into a ten-day holiday that he and his partner Carrie Johnson (then Symonds) had taken on the Caribbean island of Mustique between Boxing Day 2019 and 5 January 2020. The Tory leader had said that the £15,000 post-election break was funded by party donor David Ross. But Johnson’s declaration in the register of MPs’ interests “was later contradicted by Ross”, said the paper, which noted that it was “the first time a serving prime minister has been investigated by the commissioner”.\n\nHere are the most significant allegations that Johnson and his government have faced.\n\nHe has also refused to apologise over the row that erupted last week after the independent Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards recommended that Tory MP Owen Paterson be suspended . Johnson has fallen foul of the committee more than once before too, both prior to and after entering Downing Street.\n\nInstead of attending the emergency debate on Monday afternoon, Johnson fulfiled what Downing Street said was a “long-standing engagement” at Hexham General Hospital in Northumberland. During his visit, the PM declined to answer reporters’ questions about recent “cash for House of Lords seats” allegations.\n\nJohnson’s own adviser on standards, Christopher Geidt, concluded that while the ministerial code had not been broken, the PM had “unwisely” allowed the refurbishment “to proceed without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded”. The Institute of Government said the episode “highlighted concerns both about the way the money was managed, and about the failure of the prime minister, and possibly the Conservative Party, to make full declarations and answer questions”.\n\nNo. 10 denied any wrongdoing, in what has since been dubbed the “cash for curtains” scandal.\n\n8 July 2021: Mustique row verdict\n\nJohnson was cleared by the committee examining his Mustique trip. Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone found that the PM was right to name Ross on the Register of Members’ Financial Interests, because the Tory donor had “facilitated the visit” by arranging Johnson’s accommodation through a local holiday company.\n\nThe regulator’s report noted that this involvement only came to light as a result of their own enquiries. Given that Johnson had been “twice reprimanded by the previous standards committee in the last parliament in the space of four months”, said the report, the PM might have been expected “to go the extra mile” to ensure there was no uncertainty about his holiday arrangements.\n\n3 November 2021: Paterson furore\n\nThe PM backed a bid last week to overturn the six-week suspension of Tory MP Paterson, a former environment secretary under David Cameron, for breaking lobbying rules. Johnson ordered his party to vote for an amendment that would halt the suspension recommended by the standards committee and instead create a new watchdog group with a built-in Tory majority.\n\nAn analysis by Business Insider found that of the 248 Conservative MPs who followed their leader’s instructions, 22 had been investigated by the existing watchdog since the 2019 election. And 19 “had claims against them upheld by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards”, the news site reported.\n\nAfter the government won the amendment with an 18-vote majority, Starmer said that it was “no surprise” to see the Conservative Party “yet again wallowing in sleaze”.\n\n“The rot starts at the top,” the Labour leader added.\n\n4 November 2021: rapid U-turn\n\nLess than 24 hours after the vote, Johnson changed his mind. Amid outrage both from within the Tory party and beyond, the government announced that separate new votes would be held on improving the standards system and the outcome for Paterson. Hours later, Paterson announced his resignation from his role as North Shropshire MP and “the cruel world of politics”.\n\nIn a separate development, The Telegraph revealed that Conservative chiefs had been handed the initial findings of the “cash for curtains” investigation, to give the party an opportunity to respond ahead of the commission’s final ruling.\n\n7 November 2021: Lords seats allegations\n\nThe government has become embroiled in a new sleaze row after The Sunday Times reported that House of Lords seats were being offered to Conservative donors who contribute more than £3m to the party.\n\nAccording to a investigation by the paper and independent political website openDemocracy, multimillionaire donors “appear to be guaranteed a peerage if they take on the temporary role as the party treasurer and increase their own donations beyond £3m”.\n\nThe peerage of one such donor – billionaire businessman Peter Cruddas – was reportedly pushed through by Johnson against the recommendation of the Lords Appointments Commission.\n\nThe PM’s decision to “override what we did... left a bad taste in my mouth”, an unnamed commission member told the joint investigation.\n\nResponding to the claims, a Conservative spokesperson said: “We do not believe that successful businesspeople and philanthropists who contribute to political causes and parties should be disqualified from sitting in the legislature.”", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson"], "publish_date": "2021/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/954760/owen-paterson-how-the-pms-u-turn-sparked-fury-within-the-conservative-party", "title": "Owen Paterson: how the PM's U-turn sparked fury within the ...", "text": "“It is hard to imagine a more shambolic end to a more tawdry affair,” said Tom Peck in The Independent. First, a group of Owen Paterson’s Tory colleagues “tore up the rule book to try and save him”. Then, when that caused uproar, they decided “to stick the rule book back together”, and cut him loose.\n\nFaced with being suspended again, his career in tatters, the MP resigned, bidding farewell to the “cruel world of politics”, as if he were the victim of a monstrous injustice, and not a man who had been found guilty of serious breaches of the lobbying rules. He left politics last week unrepentant: he had, he said, done nothing wrong.\n\nThe road to Paterson’s resignation began in 2019, said Felicity Lawrence in The Guardian, when this newspaper discovered he’d repeatedly sought access to ministers and regulators on behalf of two companies – the clinical diagnostics firm Randox, and Lynn’s Country Foods – without always declaring that between them, they were paying him over £100,000 a year (far more than his MPs’ salary).\n\nPaterson insisted he’d not breached rules against paid advocacy, because he had been raising issues of public safety. But following a two-year investigation, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone, found against him.\n\nHe may have used his initial approaches to raise “serious wrongs”, she said, but he’d used the follow-up ones to promote a Randox product (a system for testing for antibody residues in milk), and make the case for regulatory reforms that would have disadvantaged one of Lynn’s commercial rivals. These amounted to “egregious” breaches, whether witting or not.\n\nThe matter was then passed to the MPs on the cross-party Standards Committee, who recommended that Paterson be suspended from Parliament for 30 days, a move that might have triggered a by-election.\n\nConclusive case\n\nThe case against Paterson was pretty conclusive, said Stephen Bush in the New Statesman. He complained that 17 of his witnesses had not been interviewed, but their written testimony had been considered, and there was no suggestion that they had evidence to alter the facts as established.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2021/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/954712/is-sleaze-crisis-turning-point-boris-johnson", "title": "Is the 'sleaze crisis' a turning point for Boris Johnson? | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

With Margot Robbie playing Barbie opposite Ryan Gosling’s Ken in Greta Gerwig’s comedic look at their “perfect” world, “Barbie” was supposed to open July 21 in Vietnamese theaters.\n\nThe reports cited Vi Kien Thanh, director general of the Vietnam Cinema Department, as saying the National Film Evaluation Council made the decision. It said a map in the film shows China’s “nine-dash line,” which extends Beijing’s territorial claims far into waters that fall within areas claimed by Vietnam and other countries.\n\nThe “nine-dash line” is an arcane but sensitive issue for China and its neighbors that shows Beijing’s maritime border extending into areas claimed by other governments and encompasses most of the South China Sea. That has brought it into tense standoffs with the ASEAN nations of Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines, with Chinese fishing boats and military vessels becoming more aggressive in the disputed waters.\n\nAsked about the issue at a daily briefing on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said, “China’s position on the South China Sea issue is clear and consistent.”\n\n“We believe that the countries concerned should not link the South China Sea issue with normal cultural and people-to-people exchanges,” Mao said.\n\nPhotos:Margot Robbie re-creates pink 'Barbie' outfits for movie premieres, press tour\n\nHowever, China is exceedingly sensitive when it comes to how its national image and border claims are portrayed in entertainment and by businesses. For example, it has routinely retaliated against companies from hotels to airlines that it believes have suggested that self-governing Taiwan – with its own political system, country code and currency — is anything other than a part of China.\n\nCompanies almost always acquiesce to Chinese complaints, fearing they risk being locked out of the huge, lucrative Chinese market. That includes Hollywood films deleting or adding scenes based on the expected response on the ruling Communist Party and the highly nationalistic public.\n\n‘She’s everything. He’s just Ken.’:Why women are relating to the 'Barbie' movie poster dissing Ken\n\nWhen an international court ruled in 2016 that the “nine-dash line” has no basis in law and the Philippines was entitled to an exclusive economic zone in part of the area claimed by Beijing, China rejected the ruling.\n\nWarner Bros. offices were closed Tuesday for the July 4 holiday.\n\nIn 2019, Vietnam ordered showings of “Abominable” canceled after moviegoers complained about a scene showing the “nine-dash line.” Politicians in the Philippines called for a boycott of all DreamWorks releases to protest the scene, and Malaysia ordered the scene to be cut from the movie.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/961551/quiz-of-the-week-31-june-6-july", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 31 June - 6 July | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

It was released in the Philippines on February 23.\n\nA two-second frame in the movie contains an image of the so-called nine-dash line, which marks China’s claims in the South China Sea, a strategic waterway. The scene “is contrary to national interest,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe U-shaped line is a feature used on Chinese maps to illustrate its maritime territory in a region where Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei, the Philippines and Malaysia all have competing claims.\n\nA 2016 ruling by an arbitration tribunal in The Hague invalidated China’s claims to almost the entire waterway through which about $3 trillion worth of ship-borne trade passes annually. Beijing did not participate in the court proceedings and does not recognize the ruling.\n\nSony’s Columbia Pictures Industries Inc was ordered to stop screening the film and has complied, the Foreign Ministry said.

During the preview, the patches on Cruise’s jacket, which originally bore flags that represent Taiwan and Japan, appeared to have been swapped out and replaced with two ambiguous symbols in the same color scheme.\n\nThat omission had angered some critics, prompting speculation that the change was made to appease Chinese censors and the film’s Chinese backer, Tencent (TCEHY). At the time, Tencent (TCEHY) Pictures, a subsidiary of the Shenzhen-based tech giant, was an investor of the highly anticipated sequel to the 1986 classic.\n\nNow, however, the company has pulled out. The Wall Street Journal reported last week, citing unidentified sources, that Tencent had relinquished its role as a financier of the film in late 2019, amid geopolitical concerns between China and the United States.\n\nThe firm was worried about falling out of line with officials in Beijing for promoting a movie that celebrated the American military as US-Chinese relations soured, according to the report. Tencent and Paramount (PGRE) Pictures, the studio behind the film, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA sensitive topic\n\nChina and Taiwan have a complex relationship. Beijing’s communist leadership has long claimed Taiwan, a self-governed democratic island, as part of its territory, despite having never ruled over it.\n\nAs part of its campaign, the Chinese government has pressured multinational companies to refer to Taiwan as a Chinese territory, in exchange for accessing its lucrative market.\n\nThe drive has been largely successful, with players like United Airlines (UAL), Delta Airlines (DAL), Marriott (MAR), American Express (AXP), and Goldman Sachs (GS) falling in line. Hollywood films have also been increasingly censored over the years as China grew in importance to the global box office.\n\nChinese and Japanese relations have also long been fraught, with tensions flaring in recent years over disputed islands in the East China Sea.\n\nIn the trailer of \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" two jacket patches that had originally shown the Japanese and Taiwanese flags (left) appeared to have been swapped out and replaced with two ambiguous symbols in the same color scheme. @markmackinnon/TWITTER\n\nNow, the film’s update is likely to anger some fans and officials in mainland China.\n\n“There’s a high probability Beijing will ban the release and monetization of ‘Top Gun’ in China,” said Chris Fenton, former president of DMG Entertainment and author of the book “Feeding the Dragon: Inside the Trillion-Dollar Dilemma Facing Hollywood, the NBA, and American Business.”\n\n“There’s also a probability the Chinese government will blackball the studio, filmmakers, and actors from the market for an extended period of time,” Fenton added. “We’ve witnessed similar punishments in the past.”\n\nSince 2020, China’s strict “zero Covid” restrictions have left many cinemas shuttered for extended periods of time, including in Shanghai and Beijing. That’s in sharp contrast with how moviegoers elsewhere have recently flocked back to theaters around the world.\n\nCurrently, “Top Gun: Maverick” has not been released in mainland China, and does not have a set opening date.\n\nBut Fenton noted “that may have been a forgone conclusion anyway,” given the heightened geopolitical tensions between the world’s two largest economies.\n\n“A film strongly promoting Western ideals and US military hegemony probably never stood a chance for approval,” he said.\n\nHe also noted that the Chinese film market has recently eschewed Hollywood movies in favor of other titles. In recent months, patriotic propaganda war movies have topped the box office domestically.\n\n“That’s a likely calculation that led to the decision [for producers to include Taiwan’s flag],” said Fenton. “The global goodwill generated by reinstating the flags easily outweighs any potential revenues from China.”\n\nThe move delighted fans in Taiwan: Social media users there cheered the decision online this week, with some calling it a “pleasant surprise.”\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick,” in which Cruise reprises his role as Navy fighter pilot Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, has already smashed box office records, taking in more than $300 million worldwide, according to IMDB’s Box Office Mojo.\n\nPaul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst for Comscore, said that the latest round of blockbusters, including “Top Gun” and “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” were still able to enjoy “massive international success” despite limitations from “some countries.”\n\n“Hollywood is starting to realize the aggravation of attempting to please China’s fickle and unpredictable censors is no longer worth the potential payoff,” said Fenton.\n\n— CNN’s Beijing bureau and Jessie Yeung contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Michelle Toh Wayne Chang", "Michelle Toh", "Wayne Chang"], "publish_date": "2022/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/16/media/avatar-2-china-box-office-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "'Avatar: The Way of Water' could be a 'life saver' for China's cinemas ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nJames Cameron’s “Avatar: The Way of Water” has premiered in China, 13 years after the original film took the country by storm. It’s expected to be a shot in the arm for the world’s second-biggest film market, which has been battered by the country’s stringent zero-Covid policy.\n\nThe highly-anticipated sequel debuted in mainland China on Friday, the same day as its global release. Beijing had previously banned multiple Hollywood films in recent years amid rising US-China tension and tightening censorship of US-related content.\n\nBy Friday afternoon, “The Way of Water” had grossed 104 million yuan ($15 million) in its first day of sales, setting this year’s opening day box office record for an international film in China.\n\nA poster of film 'Avatar: The Way of Water' is seen at a cinema on December 11, 2022 in Beijing, China. VCG/VCG/Getty Images\n\nMore than 1.4 million people have said on ticketing app Maoyan that they “want” to see the sequel, making it the most anticipated film of 2022. Before Friday, it had already crushed the record for advance ticket sales, beating this year’s No.1 box office winner so far, “The Battle at Lake Changjin II.”\n\n“When Avatar 1 was released, I was just in junior high school … I just remember that it was the first time that I watched a 3D film and was deeply shocked by the special effects,” Nissi Hu, who is from the northern Chinese city of Dalian, told CNN.\n\nAfraid of being infected with Covid at the cinema, she put on protective clothing, an N95 mask, and sprayed alcohol on her body and hands while watching the sequel on Friday. The protective clothing felt suffocating during the three-hour screening.\n\n“My 3D glasses were covered with fog, and then I secretly unzipped the protective suit a bit,” she admitted, adding: “I didn’t feel bored. I immersed myself in the plot and enjoyed an unprecedented audio-visual feast.”\n\nShot in the arm\n\nThe “Way of Water” is expected to buoy China’s pandemic-depressed box office. Over the past three years, thousands of cinemas have been forced to suspend business, reopening when the situation improved only to have to shut again. The instability caused many of them to go bankrupt.\n\nBy mid-December, China’s box office reached only 28.8 billion yuan ($4.1 billion), down nearly 40% from last year. Today, the country has more than 12,000 cinemas.\n\n“It’s a lifesaver for us,” the state-owned National Business Daily quoted a cinema manager in the eastern city of Jinan as saying late last month.\n\nThe premiere comes as China is starting to reemerge following years of aggressive lockdowns and quarantines. Earlier this month, China dismantled parts of its repressive zero-Covid policy after a rare spate of nation-wide protests against pandemic restrictions.\n\nAs cities eased curbs, movie theaters opened their doors. On Friday, 9,300 cinemas were open for business, 75% of the country’s total, according to data compiled by Maoyan. That’s up 110% from two weeks ago.\n\nThe “Way of Water” accounted for 80% of screenings scheduled for Friday, the Maoyan data showed.\n\nAnalysts expect the sequel to bring millions of people back to cinemas and believe it has a high chance of becoming China’s biggest international release ever. China Securities, a Beijing-based brokerage firm, predicted the film could generate 5 billion yuan ($717 million) at the Chinese box office and attract between 80 million to 120 million viewers.\n\nThat sum would make “The Way of Water” the No.1 foreign film in China, surpassing “Avengers: Endgame.” In 2019, the Avengers sequel grossed $610 million in China, nearly a quarter of its global sales.\n\n“Avatar 2’s release is a symbolic event for China’s importing of foreign films,” analysts from China Securities said Wednesday. “We expect more Hollywood output to come to China.”\n\nCovid fears\n\nCovid could, however, stand in the way of the film setting a new box office record.\n\nA negative test result is still required at many cinemas across the country. The quick spread of the disease has also kept many residents at home.\n\n“The solid pre-sales data tell us that people have a strong desire to watch Avatar 2,” said analysts from Hangzhou-based Zheshang Securities. “But there’s the risk of them not wanting to go to cinemas fearful of contracting the virus.”\n\nIn 2010, the original Avatar premiered in mainland China, immediately setting off a frenzy and resulting in months of ticket shortages, according to state media outlet Paper.cn. The film topped the box office for 11 consecutive weeks and generated $198 million in sales.\n\nMore than a decade later, its sequel has generated similar enthusiasm, even if its reception is being tempered by the threat of Covid.", "authors": ["Laura He Cheng Cheng", "Laura He", "Cheng Cheng"], "publish_date": "2022/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/felixvailgone/2016/12/29/felix-vail-gone-one-wife-dead-two-other-missing-jerry-mitchell/95895894/", "title": "GONE", "text": "Jerry Mitchell\n\nDecember 30, 2016\n\nMy office telephone rang, and a woman asked, “Would you be interested in writing about a serial killer living in Mississippi?”\n\n“Yes, I would,” I replied.\n\nThe woman’s name was Mary Rose. She told me her missing daughter, Annette, had been married to a man named Felix Vail, and that Annette wasn’t the only one gone. She knew of two others.\n\nA day after Mother’s Day, May 14, 2012, I met the 64-year-old, bright, short-haired woman and followed her to the property in Montpelier, Mississippi, where she planned to confront Vail.\n\nShe told me what she was going to say to him: “You may never go to jail, but I want you to know that I know and a lot of others know that you took the lives of these three women. You haven’t really gotten away with it.”\n\nWe parked and walked up to his gate, which was locked. She told me he lived down this path.\n\nI followed her over the gate, and we walked down the path, the tall weeds blocking the light.\n\nWhen we reached a clearing, we could see two trailers — a silver one gleaming in the sun and a second one 28 feet long and damaged.\n\nI followed her to the silver trailer. She knocked. No one answered.\n\nShe checked the door. Locked.\n\nCupping her hands, she peeked inside and saw no one.\n\nSo where is this Felix Vail guy?\n\nI turned around and noticed a patch of woods next to the trailers.\n\nWhen I looked back, Rose was marching toward the damaged trailer. I hurried to catch up.\n\nShe checked the front door. Locked.\n\nCircling the trailer, she noticed the back window was missing. She pulled the plastic off the window and slipped inside.\n\nShe opened the front door. Now I could see.\n\nShe rummaged through the trailer and began tossing things she found.\n\nA machete clanked on the floor. Another machete clanked beside it. Then another. Then another.\n\nThen a long sword clanked. Then another. Then another.\n\nA chill ran up my spine, and I glanced back at the woods. Could he be watching us?\n\nFelix Vail discovered he could disappear.\n\nThe blond boy stepped into the sandbox where he liked to play on the family’s dairy farm in the community of Montpelier a half-hour north of Starkville, Mississippi.\n\nHe figured out that, if he stood in the sandbox where a tree blocked his mother’s view, she couldn’t see him.\n\nHe would take one step back, then another, then another, slipping farther and farther away.\n\n“She’d come and find me out there in the orchard 100 yards away,” he recalled in a series of recorded conversations he had with undercover private investigator Gina Frenzel. “I’d be fine or climbing one of the trees.”\n\nHe drifted off for hours at a time, and later, overnight.\n\nHe began testing other boundaries, tasting what he called the “nonsexual” parts of a girl in the neighborhood.\n\nWhen his mother caught him and scolded him, he slid down the wall, crying. “I just crumbled,” he recalled. “I just wanted to die. It was the only time in my life.”\n\nWhat upset him most was he couldn’t do it anymore. “It wasn’t a wrong thing until she was told it was wrong,” he said. “Damn ego, my mother. She totally polluted her son with ego and lies.”\n\nAt school, he excelled. In fifth grade, he made straight A’s, but five times the teacher noted he was “inclined to mischief.”\n\nHe also excelled on the farm. At age 16, he produced 130 bushels of corn in a 5-acre contest, topping every farmer in Clay County.\n\nHis father, Ray, gushed to the newspaper, “I thought my patch was good, but he beat me easily. His is the best I’ve ever seen.”\n\nA year later, Vail volunteered for the military, hoping to be a pilot. When he took an aptitude exam, “I scored the highest score,” he recalled.\n\nBut the military found him unfit for military service. “They said I was not the kind of person who would follow orders,” he recalled, “and that I would be a disciplinary problem.”\n\nOther signs of trouble arose. After his mother announced the family couldn’t keep their mother cat’s offspring, he scooped up the kittens and shot them, recalled his sister, Kaye Faulkner.\n\nWhen a charismatic evangelist came to town, he became one of about a dozen teenage boys who responded to an “altar call” at the Montpelier Baptist Church.\n\nHe told his family he believed he had been called by God to preach.\n\nOn the day he delivered his 10th sermon, he said he felt an “infinitely greater” power, which he compared to sticking his finger in a light socket. “I started getting electrical rushes and thrills and tingles and ... sweat popping out.”\n\nHe later wrote that he saw a “being” that day, “shimmering like a moon-sized sun with infinite energy radiating out from it in all directions at once.”\n\nSuddenly, he said he knew the deepest thoughts of parishioners. “I knew who was screwing who.”\n\nHe never preached again.\n\nFateful meeting\n\nBy the time Felix Vail received his diploma from Montpelier High School in 1957, he was already working an enviable job at one of several plants surrounding the Cities Service (later known as CITGO) refinery in Sulphur, Louisiana — thanks to his favorite uncle, a supervisor there.\n\n“I’m making lots of money,” he recalled. “I have two cars, a motorcycle and a boat. I’m dating about 20 women.”\n\nSlender and 6 feet tall, he drove his Karmann Ghia convertible to nearby Lake Charles, where he hung out at the country club and strolled across the McNeese State College campus, searching for the prettiest women he could find.\n\n“He told me he was an ordained minister,” recalled Cynthia Miller, a student then. “I asked, ‘Where’s your Bible?’ He said, ‘I don’t have it with me.’ ”\n\nShe said he took her to a McNeese football game and afterward asked her for sex. She turned him down.\n\n“Suppose the world ends tomorrow,” he said. “You’ll never know.”\n\n“Well,” she replied, “then I’ll never know.”\n\nSome, however, took him up on his offer. “The majority of women were available to me just for the asking,” he recalled.\n\nMany noticed his light blond hair and piercing blue eyes. “He looked,” one sorority member recalled, “like he had been kissed by heaven.”\n\nMary Horton noticed him.\n\nShe had grown up in the Louisiana swamps, where Cajun food and music overflowed.\n\nShe became homecoming queen at Eunice High School, where she graduated and began attending McNeese State College. She was so popular all five sororities invited her to join.\n\nShe chose Chi Omega, and her friends marveled at how, no matter what, she seemed to find the good in people.\n\nHer cute figure and perky personality captivated many men, and the football team nominated her for the homecoming court.\n\n“All of us horny men were secretly in love with her,” recalled Vail’s friend, Bob Hodges. “She was a doll, very sweet. I would have lifted that girl up on high.”\n\nBy 1960, she began to date Vail, who took her to company shrimp boils, where they stuffed themselves and danced the night away.\n\n“I am so deliciously happy!” she wrote in one of many letters to a childhood friend. “Felix and I have been doing some really unusual things this week and having fun.”\n\nDriving around in his blue Lincoln with a white hardtop, the couple visited an African-American church, played 45s at his relatives, dined at A&W Root Beer and sipped from the same glass of lemonade.\n\nBut their relationship was not all bliss.\n\nOn June 20, 1960, Mary confided, “I really do love Felix, but I don’t think that I like him anymore. He really is sweet, but we don’t see eye to eye on things.”\n\nShe talked of being miserable with Vail and asked her friend to set her up on a date with someone else, hoping Vail would leave her.\n\n“I never could break up with anyone,” she wrote. “I always keep hoping when there is no hope.”\n\nIn response to that date, Vail came to her, sharing that he was suffering from a disease.\n\n“What disease?”\n\n“Mary.”\n\nShe welcomed his words. “He did all the talking, and I just listened. I really had nothing to say — I mean, about us,” she wrote. “He said he’s changed. I have to.”\n\nThe couple dated again, and she continued to see others.\n\nShe joined classmate Kelley McFarland at a house party, and McFarland later heard Vail was so angry he wanted to kill him.\n\nMcFarland said he tracked down Vail at a bar on Cities Service Highway and approached Vail, who responded, “I’d rather not talk about it here.”\n\nThe two men met in the dark woods. Although McFarland sensed Vail’s anger, he and Vail exchanged no blows and went their separate ways.\n\nAfter this, Mary described herself as “miserable,” writing that “Kelley and Felix (were) threatening to kill one another.”\n\nVail remained jealous, she wrote. “Felix says that he doesn’t even want me to walk around the block with another boy now, and I know just what kind of miserable feelings he’s going through. It’s just tearing me up, and I can’t do anything.”\n\nShe reiterated her love for Vail in letters. “He’s going to move to Lake Charles next week, so he’ll be closer now.\n\nOne night at a pool party, Vail “walked up to Mary and just slapped the heck out of her,” recalled her former boyfriend from high school, Leonard Matt.\n\nHe wanted to retaliate, but others held him back.\n\nBefore fall ended, Vail told Mary he wouldn’t give her a Christmas gift because he didn’t believe in giving at designated times.\n\nShe planned to buy him something anyway, “even if it’s a lollipop,” she wrote her friend. “This is one thing I love, and it won’t change for me.”\n\nWhen her friends questioned his refusal to give, she defended him, calling him a “wonderful person.”\n\nIn an Oct. 12, 1960, letter, Mary confided, “I say things that I don’t mean when I’m angry — like at Mom and Felix, for example, and I usually say the ugliest things to the ones that I love most because they are capable of hurting me the most. You always hurt the ones you love, the ones you shouldn’t hurt at all.”\n\nSadness and fear\n\nFelix Vail and Mary Horton married on a sunny day, July 1, 1961, in Eunice, Louisiana. When he slipped on her wedding ring, she nudged him, reminding him to say the marriage vow. As they headed for their honeymoon in Orange, Texas, rain pelted their gray convertible, drenching them before they could get the top back up.\n\nThat fall, she dyed her hair brown, back to her original color, and began her job as a second-grade teacher at Moss Bluff Elementary School.\n\nFellow teacher Myrtis Quinilty gave her a ride each day. She said they decided to join a local gym together because “Felix did not want her to lose her figure.”\n\nWhen December came, Mary worried she might be pregnant, and Quinilty said Vail didn’t want a child.\n\nA fellow teacher drove Mary to the doctor, where she learned the news. “We had been so careful and still I got pregnant,” Mary wrote.\n\nFor a week in February 1962, the couple celebrated a “real honeymoon” in Acapulco, Mexico, where they rode in a boat, soaked in the sun, ate lobster and listened as a band serenaded them.\n\nBack home, Mary dyed her hair blond. Vail worked the late-night shift and often stayed gone. When he returned, he talked about playing golf and bowling in leagues.\n\nMary wrote in a May 3, 1962, letter, “Felix hasn’t been acting so sweet earlier, but I haven’t helped. I never stand up for him or say anything nice to him.”\n\nHer sister-in-law, Sue Jordan, told her the only reason Vail believed Mary wanted to get married was to have a baby — not because of him.\n\nAfter Mary heard this, she wrote her friend, “I can see, looking back, from many things I said how they could have been misunderstood.”\n\nShe insisted “we are very happy now,” but her sadness seeped through, writing how unattractive she felt being pregnant.\n\nShe switched her hair color to baby blonde. A month later, she tried silver blonde.\n\nOn the couple’s first anniversary, they greeted their baby, Bill, whom she adored and sang to.\n\nWithin a month, she suspected she might be pregnant again.\n\n“My stomach has begun to get larger, and I don’t eat much,” she wrote. “It kind of excites me in a way.”\n\nShe talked of expanding her skirt. “Wonder if it’s not a tumor or something else. It hurts when you press my stomach on the right.”\n\nInside the Maree Apartments, where they lived in Lake Charles, strange things happened. One morning, the couple awoke to find their front door had been removed from its hinges.\n\nAnother time, they found the front door on their apartment wide open. Nothing was missing.\n\nMary began receiving threatening calls.\n\n“She was afraid,” Quinilty recalled. “Mary told me, ‘Felix and I decided it must be somebody watching because he only calls when he’s not here.’ ”\n\nDespite her fear of drowning and of anything that crawled, Vail took her by boat into a wildlife reserve, where she saw an alligator sunning itself before slithering into the water.\n\nWhen they spotted snakes curled up on the muddy bank, Vail blasted them with his shotgun. Dirt rained down.\n\nHe gunned the 40-horsepower motor, taking her way out into the Gulf of Mexico “until we couldn’t see the camps anymore,” she wrote, “and the water was so rough that I was a little scared.”\n\nShe heard “a funny creaking noise, and I just knew that the boat had sprung a leak because we had hit the waves so hard like at Acapulco.”\n\nVail bailed water, and they made it home.\n\nShe confessed to several Chi Omega sisters that her husband had done “something awful” in Mississippi. She wouldn’t say what.\n\nShe spoke with her mother about divorcing him, recalled her brother, Will Horton. Their mother, Lillie Mae Horton, a devout Catholic, urged her daughter to stay and work things out.\n\nDeath and disappearance\n\nDarkness had long enveloped Shell Beach on Oct. 28, 1962, when Vail drove up in his boat at 7:30 p.m., saying his wife, Mary, had accidentally fallen into the Calcasieu River while they were laying trotlines.\n\nAfter two days of searching, authorities recovered her body near the spot where he had told authorities she disappeared.\n\nHer funeral followed the next day, Halloween.\n\nHer former roommate Cynthia Miller, attended with her husband, wearing a black maternity dress.\n\nWhen she walked up to Vail to share her condolences, he replied, “I’m sorry y’all couldn’t come to our party.”\n\n“What party?”\n\n“We called y’all, but y’all weren’t home.”\n\nThe words stunned her because “I never got a call from him,” she recalled. “My husband didn’t like him at all.”\n\nThe more she pondered, the more puzzled she grew. “What is he talking about a party at a funeral? Mary is dead.”\n\nFour days after the funeral, deputies arrested Vail at work, hauling him to jail and questioning him. He refused to take a lie detector test.\n\nThe coroner ruled the death an “accidental drowning,” and Vail walked free from jail days later.\n\nMonths later, he picked up his son, Bill, from the Louisiana home of his late wife’s aunt and headed for Mississippi.\n\nFelix Vail traded the Mississippi hills for the San Diego cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. His brother, Ronnie, was stationed there in the Navy, doing four tours in Vietnam, where he earned three bronze stars.\n\nVail left his son, Bill, behind with his mother and father, who continued to operate the family’s dairy farm in Montpelier.\n\nIn 1965, Mercy Hospital employed him as a technician, and he began working for Dr. Ivan Baronofsky, an open-heart surgery pioneer who had been chief of surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.\n\nFellow surgeon Dr. Elliot Senderoff recalled Baronofsky’s experimentations, including a wild one that failed to curb angina with X-rays. “He was always having ideas about ways to do things.”\n\nVail oversaw a kennel of 40 dogs for the heart research and helped operate a heart-lung machine. At night, he took college courses in English and speed-reading, working toward a college degree.\n\n“I have to go to bed,” he wrote his mother, Nell Rose, in a March 9, 1965, letter. “It is 10 p.m., and we have surgery tomorrow at 7:15 a.m. I will have help with the pump on this one, but after it, I’ll have to operate it alone. I hope the first patient doesn’t die. Quite a few people do in heart surgery, so it is possible.”\n\nHe urged her to lie about his whereabouts. “You can tell people about my job, but tell them I am in Alaska.”\n\nWithin a few months, he returned to Mississippi and took his son, Bill, back with him. From that point forward, Bill split time between California and Mississippi.\n\n“I kept changing my accent so as not to attract attention,” Bill said in an interview he recorded months before his 2009 death from cancer.\n\nWhen “love-ins” began at the park, Vail visited them, watching people listen to music, roll around in the grass and smoke marijuana.\n\nAfter an affair with a married nurse, he traded his medical work for life as a hippie, hitchhiking, bicycling and exploring. For months, Bill lived on a farm run by a religious cult called the Holy Order of MANS.\n\nHe said his father made him try marijuana and LSD as a child. “He thought it would enlighten my mind. I didn’t like it.”\n\nAs for companions, “my father went through more girlfriends than I could count.”\n\nOne of them was Robin Sinclair. She met Felix Vail at a San Diego bus stop in 1967.\n\nThe 17-year-old slender brunette was spending the summer with her sister when he approached her.\n\n“He was into the metaphysical, getting in touch with the subconscious,” she recalled. “He was a different person than I had ever met before.”\n\nThey began dating. When summer break ended, she returned to the San Francisco Bay area without him.\n\nIn October 1968, while listening to Iron Butterfly and other bands play at a concert, Vail appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. She saw it as a sign they belonged together.\n\n“He was always on a very even keel, like he was a little detached and studying everybody,” she said. “He was the observer.”\n\nVail had his young son with him, and they bounced from place to place.\n\nBill “was neglected,” Robin recalled, “and Felix let him smoke pot. Bill would just run wild. He would make some friends with people at a hamburger stand, and they fed him.”\n\nAt the time, she said, “I was young and naive and concerned with my next joint. I didn’t worry about any of that.”\n\nAfter being evicted for failing to pay rent, they watched another couple’s home over the Christmas holidays, she said.\n\nBefore the pair returned, she learned she was pregnant, sharing the news with Vail. “He said, ‘Well, I don’t think you’re emotionally stable enough to handle the pregnancy.’ ”\n\nWhen morning came, Vail had vanished with his son, she recalled.\n\n“A friend told me that he went back to Mississippi, that it was time for his son to go to school and that he didn’t want to be with me.”\n\nHeartbroken, she moved back in with her parents. “There was no place to go, and I was sick, sick, sick.”\n\nIn August 1969, she gave birth to her daughter, Simone, and penned Vail an angry letter.\n\nTwo months later, he showed up, and she told him, “Get out of here. I don’t want to see you again.”\n\nVail and Sharon Hensley meet\n\nFelix Vail spent time in a second-story apartment on Nob Hill in San Francisco.\n\nOne night, a neighbor above him knocked on his door, saying they were filming upstairs and had run out of electrical plugs. Could they plug their extension cord into one of his outlets?\n\nVail agreed, and the neighbor invited him to watch them make their porn film. He stepped upstairs, glimpsing the writhing bodies.\n\nOne day while housesitting at a high-rise apartment, he stripped and stepped out onto the balcony, soaking up the sun. Some time later, he looked up to see a brunette joining him.\n\nShe was 20 with long, dark hair. Her name was Sharon Hensley, so attractive that she had modeled while growing up in North Dakota.\n\nThey became friends and then more than friends, despite him being a decade older.\n\nVail handed her a copy of “The Grape Cure,” the 1928 book in which author Johanna Brandt claimed a combination of fasting and eating grapes had cured her of stomach cancer.\n\nDespite physicians condemning the diet as “quackery,” Vail and Hensley became believers, filling a bathtub with grapes they collected from vineyards.\n\nThey hitchhiked across California, living off the land. Vail’s 8-year-old son, Bill, accompanied them as they slept near vineyards and orchards.\n\nHe recalled his father sharing how his mother died. “(He said) he and my mother were out fishing …, that a boat had come by and caused a big wave and knocked my mother out of the boat and she didn’t know how to swim, had on no flotation and immediately sank and drowned. My father said he almost died trying to rescue her.”\n\nThen one summer day, when his father thought he was outside playing, he overheard his father sobbing and speaking to Sharon.\n\n“He told her that he had murdered my mother,” he recalled. “I heard the girlfriend saying, ‘Oh, I know you just must feel responsible for it.’ … He said, ‘No, you don’t understand. I really did kill her.’ ”\n\nEmotions flooded Bill. He wanted to hit his father. Then run. Then cry.\n\n“I was just so angry with my father,” he said. “He was actually a good father in many ways, but still how do I reconcile what I’ve just heard? I couldn’t.”\n\nShortly after that, the trio hiked to Mexico’s Baja Desert, where they camped and fasted, “which is miserable for an 8-year-old,” he recalled.\n\nHe decided to pray. “I really started talking to God, and just said, ‘God, get me home.’ ”\n\nTo him, home meant Mississippi, living with his grandparents.\n\nAfter their desert trip, the trio trekked north until they reached a vineyard near Merced in in central California, where Bill met a 13-year-old migrant worker.\n\n“He was very curious about me living with no shirt and no shoes,” he recalled. “We got to be friends.”\n\nIt was Aug. 21, 1970, when Bill began to share the story of his father with his new friend. “The more he heard of my story, he said, ‘Why don’t you just turn him in to the police?’ ”\n\nWhen Bill heard those words, “It was like ‘ding.’ The light came on,” he recalled. “He told me there was a town about two miles away, and I started walking right then.”\n\nIn the town of Livingston, he found the police station, where he told officers he was hungry and tired of using the drugs his father gave him, that he wanted to go back to school and live like other kids, and that he had overheard his father admit to killing his mother.\n\n“At first, they didn’t believe me, just kind of shooed me out, said, ‘Yeah, kid, go away,’ but I was committed,” he said. “I was not going to take ‘no’ for an answer.”\n\nHe camped out on the front steps until one detective listened.\n\nAt a beach along the Merced River, authorities found his 31-year-old father and 21-year-old Sharon Hensley, carrying a bag filled with LSD capsules.\n\nTheir only food? A bag of grapes.\n\nPolice charged the couple with LSD possession and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\n\nNewspapers across the U.S. printed stories about the arrests, and the National Enquirer published a photograph of the towheaded boy playing with a “lawn toy instead of drugs after being placed in a foster home.”\n\nVail received a six-month jail sentence, plus three years’ probation, after pleading guilty to a lesser charge of LSD possession.\n\nCalifornia authorities shared their information with Louisiana authorities. Once again, the district attorney in Lake Charles passed on prosecuting Vail for murder.\n\nBill returned to Mississippi to live with his grandparents, who gained full custody.\n\nOn Jan. 23, 1971, he saw his father and Sharon Hensley in their driveway.\n\nHe stood frozen, wondering where he could run. “I really thought he was going to kill me,” he said. “My grandmother came back out and reassured me that he wasn’t going to hurt me.”\n\nAfter a while, he and his father sat down and spoke, and his father said he did not blame him for time spent in prison, Bill recalled. “He actually blamed the girlfriend, which was strange ‘cause she had nothing to do with it.”\n\nVail’s family questioned how he and Sharon could legally be in Mississippi when they were supposed to be serving their time on probation in California. They soon realized they couldn’t.\n\nA day later, the sheriff came. He told Vail’s family he had a cablegram from California, asking him to pick up the couple for questioning.\n\nVail’s mother told the sheriff she didn’t know where her son was.\n\nFour days later, Vail and his girlfriend, Sharon, hid on a car’s floorboards as his family transported them out of town. At the bus station in Grenada, Mississippi, the family gave the couple enough money to return to the West Coast.\n\n“Don’t know if (it) was the right thing to do,” Vail’s mother wrote the Hensley family. “We definitely feel that they both need psychiatric help. But there seems to be no way that can be arranged. So God help them, and us, is our prayer.”\n\n‘She believed in love’\n\nSharon Hensley grew up in the state capital of Bismarck, North Dakota, where buffalo once roamed free on the hills. A post-World War II baby born five days before Christmas in 1948, she dated football players and belonged to the high school’s Demonettes, an award-winning dance team founded by a former Rockette.\n\nOne summer day, she and her best friend, Connie Woodworth, stepped into the Missouri River and nearly drowned. Another time, when they drove with their boyfriends on a gravel road, Sharon panicked rounding a curve, and the car rolled three times.\n\nThrown clear, she rushed to check on her friends. When she discovered they were OK, she wept, Woodworth recalled. “She was a person who cared deeply for her friends and family.”\n\nThe girls graduated in 1966, and Sharon attended Bismarck Junior College, where she took classes in dancing and acting, performing in a play with her older brother, Frank.\n\nYounger brother Brian adored his sister. Although she was 11 years older than him, when the radio brimmed with Beatles songs in 1964, Sharon and her girlfriends played the records and had him dance with them.\n\nWhen summer came, he tagged along with them as they sunbathed on the river’s sandbars. “It was heaven for a 6-year-old,” he said.\n\nThey picnicked, played volleyball, snapped Polaroids and tossed a new toy called the Frisbee, he recalled. “I just remember sunshine and happiness.”\n\nIn 1967, Sharon discovered she was pregnant. Wanting to escape her hometown, she followed her brother Frank and other classmates to San Francisco, where thousands of other young people were already gathering for the “summer of love.”\n\n“She believed in love,” Brian recalled. “She believed in happiness. She believed in flowers and beads.”\n\nAfter arriving in the Bay area, she stayed in a home for unwed mothers, where she gave birth to a girl she named “Cherry” after the popular Neil Diamond song. She told friends she wanted to keep the child, but was unable to.\n\nTwo years after leaving for California, Sharon was in jail and her mother, Peggy, headed there with a $5,000 cashier’s check to bail her out. “I’m going to get Sharon and bring her home,” she announced.\n\nBut when she returned, Sharon wasn’t with her.\n\n“She said she had lost her daughter,” Brian recalled. “She cried almost every night.”\n\nDepression overwhelmed his mother. “She was never the same after that.”\n\nIn the summer of 1972, Sharon appeared unannounced with Vail at her childhood home in Bismarck. They had been hitchhiking, eating macrobiotic foods, meditating and practicing yoga.\n\nThe more the family witnessed, the more horrified they became. Sharon wore a mini-skirt with no panties and had armpit hair and leg hair like a man, Brian recalled. “I thought she was freaking way out.”\n\nShe had been losing weight and with it some of the curves that made her a model. She was also losing clumps of hair.\n\nShe seemed brainwashed, Brian said. “You could just tell she was not the same person, that this guy was controlling what she was saying.”\n\nIf someone asked her a question, “either Felix would answer the question for her, or she would look at Felix while she was giving the answer.”\n\nBrian went one day with Vail to the Elks Club, where his father was a member. “They had a workout room, and Felix gets totally naked.”\n\nVail tested out the exercise equipment then strolled into the steam room, where “these older gentlemen just freaked out on him because he was hippie looking and walking around naked.”\n\nThe men forced Vail to leave. When he objected, insisting he was a guest of Harry Hensley, one man shot back, “The hell you are. I know Harry Hensley better than that.”\n\nBrian said he traveled with the couple to a small grocery store. While Vail distracted the clerk, Sharon stuffed jars of grape juice into a duffle bag. “I could even hear the bottles clanging.”\n\nWhile the clerk questioned what was going on, Sharon dashed out with the bottles. When the clerk tried to pursue her, Vail stood in the way.\n\n“We got away,” Brian recalled. “The cops didn’t come.”\n\nThe couple left North Dakota and traveled to Mississippi, where they stayed with Vail’s family. On the dairy farm, they helped paint the family home.\n\nThe couple also sunbathed in the nude, drawing more than a few glares from neighbors.\n\nPeggy Hensley received a telephone call from Sharon, who said she and Vail were heading to New Orleans and then to Miami to make pornographic films.\n\n“What daughter tells her mother she’s going to do a porno?” Brian asked. “I think it was a cry for help. That’s what my mom thought.”\n\nHe said his mother wanted to travel south in hopes of getting her daughter back, but his parents were unable to do that.\n\nIn early 1973, Sharon telephoned and talked of traveling to South America, where she and Vail would eat natural foods and write a book, Brian recalled.\n\nIt was the last conversation any family or friends had with his sister.\n\nSharon’s last letter contained a picture, which showed her holding a pen and sitting at a table at the home of Vail’s parents. She captioned the Polaroid: “Making travel notes.”\n\nWhen Brian gazed at the photograph, all he could see was her sorrow, a shell of the sister he loved.\n\nSharon disappears\n\nIn New Orleans, Sharon Hensley worked as a table dancer at a strip club — something Vail said she had done before in San Bernardino, California, and Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\n“Guys would give her another $100 to dance on their table, rather than go to the next table,” Vail recalled. “She’d make a $1,000 a night sometimes.”\n\nVail left with Sharon for Miami, where they lived in a commune and worked at a health food store not far from the Voyager Inn, where the porn movie, “Deep Throat,” had been surreptitiously shot for $25,000. Now on its way to grossing $600 million, the film helped turn Miami into a mecca for porn flicks.\n\nThe couple managed to get a telephone number for Len Camp, who had worked on the iconic movie, and Vail recalled a man approaching them.\n\n“He asked if we had ever been in movies and did we realize the camera might love us?” Vail recalled. “He didn’t say porn.”\n\nThe couple took him up on the offer, which paid them $500 a day, he said.\n\nWhen they arrived, there was no script. Instead, they ad-libbed sex scenes, Vail recalled.\n\nRather than casting Vail in the part of a sexual stud, the director had Vail take on a different role. “You get on the bed, and you start masturbating,” he recalled. “They walk in and look, and you’re surprised.”\n\nFor him, it was hardly enjoyable. “So much of it was ridiculous.”\n\nMonths passed, and Sharon Hensley’s family never heard from her. Worried, her mother telephoned Vail’s mother.\n\nIn March 1974, Sharon’s mother received a letter from Vail, who wrote that he was in west Florida: “I share your concern about Sharon but then she is of age and she should have the right and freedom from you to decide for herself how she wants to live her time on earth.”\n\nHe wrote that he last saw Sharon about a year ago in Key West with an Australian couple traveling around the world. All he recalled was the first names of the couple, who were talking with Sharon about “island hopping around South America and the West Indies and they talked of stopping in Hawaii for a while, maybe a couple of years in the Philippines, then India, Egypt and the Mediterranean islands and coasts. I don’t know which of these (if any) they decided on or in what order.”\n\nBrian remembered his mother throwing down the letter, not believing a word.\n\n“Felix didn’t remember the boat’s name, the couple’s last name or much of anything else,” he said, “but, boy, he sure had down their travel itinerary.”\n\nIn fall 1975, Vail’s mother wrote the Hensley family about what her son had told her: “He was surprised that you had not heard from Sharon by this time.”\n\nVail told his mother the names of the couple that Sharon left with were Frank and Sally — different names than he gave a year earlier.\n\nVail explained that before Sharon left, she burned all of her identification cards, got new IDs and declared that she would become a completely different person.\n\nHis mother told her family, “My heart goes out to you. I know how hard (it) would be if Felix had gone like that.”\n\nVail’s son, Bill, recalled his father taking him aside and mentioning Sharon. “He said she would never bother anyone ever again.”\n\nThe words upset Bill, who believed his father had just confessed to another killing. “There was not a soul I could tell about it because I had had my experience in court when I was 8,” he wrote. “No one would believe me. It would be my word against his, and no one would believe a 13-year-old.”\n\nWhile riding a bus back home to north Mississippi in 1975, Felix Vail spotted a 17-year-old girl seated behind the driver. He scooted beside Sharon Campbell, who was half his age. He told her how fit she looked, saying he needed someone like her to keep him fit.\n\nIn a 2014 sworn statement, she said she felt flattered and shared her telephone number. Not long after returning home, he showed up in a yellow Volkswagen bug.\n\nDuring one conversation, he shared that his first wife had drowned while they were fishing. She felt sorry for him.\n\nHe talked of California, the mountains and other places he had visited. His words intrigued her, so different from her cloistered upbringing that she had begun to rebel against.\n\nHe wanted her to travel with him, and she told him the only way her parents would let her do that would be if they were married.\n\nOn July 24, 1975, they tied the knot and honeymooned in Gulf Shores, Alabama.\n\nThe couple never consummated the marriage because he was unable to “obtain an erection,” she told Louisiana prosecutor Hugo Holland.\n\nAfter their honeymoon, the couple, along with her 1-year-old son, traveled to Clinton, Oklahoma, where Vail said he had a job.\n\nDuring the day, he left, and she and her son hung out at the hotel, swimming in the pool.\n\nSeveral weeks later, she went with Vail to visit his relatives in Louisiana. There, she said a niece told her, “You probably need to know that he killed his first wife.”\n\nShe said the niece continued, saying, “Yeah, they arrested him. … We all believed that he did it. … He drowned her out of a boat.”\n\nThe teenage bride discounted what she was hearing, thinking he would be in prison if he had killed someone.\n\nBut as months passed, she concluded he “had no value in the female gender,” she said. “He hated women.”\n\nShe later traveled with Vail to his parents’ home in Montpelier.\n\nWhile there, he “was outdoors doing something around that yellow (Volkswagen) bug,” she said. “I walked out there. I don’t think he knew I was coming out there.”\n\nHe opened a compartment, and she said she saw “sinister, surgical looking saws of all shapes and sizes in a neat, neat formation. They were so clean … like you would see in a surgery clinic. I mean, they were that sterile.”\n\nTo her, the sight screamed evil. “It scared me. I said, ‘I’m not going anywhere with you.’ ”\n\nShe left, annulled the marriage and never looked back.\n\nIn 1977, Vail joined a crew for Western Geophysical, a seismograph company with an office in nearby West Point, Mississippi.\n\nThey traveled across the U.S., stomping geophones into the ground. The devices helped locate oil and natural gas pockets.\n\nMost of the crew were in their 20s. Vail was the exception. Fit, thin and tan, he wore a pageboy haircut, but his craggy neck gave away that he was approaching 40.\n\nMembers of the crew said Vail regarded eating meat as unholy, but believed marijuana and LSD were “God’s creations,” giving insight into the divine.\n\nWhen the crew discovered Vail missing one day, they retreated to find him hanging from a tree. He was meditating, arms crossing his chest.\n\nWorking with the crew that summer, Vail found himself in jail again.\n\nOn June 28, sheriff’s deputies arrested him near Bath, New York, less than an hour and a half south of Rochester, on a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance.\n\nVail explores ‘enlightenment’\n\nOn a bus heading back to Mississippi, Vail ran into a woman named Ella from Holland. “She was rich,” he said. “She had made her money in Transactional Analysis.”\n\nThis new approach to psychoanalysis had become a national rage, fueling such bestsellers as “I’m OK, You’re OK” and “Games People Play.”\n\nElla planned to attend the International Transactional Analysis Association Conference in San Francisco, but in the meantime, “she was going to see America,” Vail recalled.\n\nHeading for New Orleans, she exited the bus instead with Vail and went with him to his childhood home of Montpelier. From there, they rode together on his motorcycle across the country until they arrived at the symposium in August 1977.\n\n“It was one of the most interesting weeks,” Vail recalled.\n\nWhile there, he listened to speakers about Transactional Analysis, which describes parent, adult and child “ego states” when people interact with each other\n\nVail recalled a presentation from a group known as the “Frog Pond,” which believed that people could have their lives transformed, just as fairy tales described frogs being transformed into princes or princesses.\n\nDuring that presentation, the Frog Pond people shared sexual research, Vail said. “Normally, orgasms are only a few seconds. They found a way to sneak into the orgasm and hold the orgasm … (for) several hours.”\n\nAfter the conference, Vail headed south, reconnecting with an old friend, Brian Biedebach, and a San Diego native named Carolyn, whom he had dated in 1975 in Placerville, California. Their romance had flourished in that old Gold Rush boomtown, but when she returned from work one day, Vail had vanished like the prospectors.\n\nNow reunited, the pair resumed their relationship. They married on Christmas Eve 1977 and rented a modest house in San Bernardino. “He decided he had allergies to everything,” she recalled. “We had to scrub the house from top to bottom and put plastic on things.”\n\nWhile she worked at her job, he never found one, other than trying to grow marijuana once in the back yard.\n\nShe covered all the couple’s expenses, paid to get his teeth fixed and even bought him a Karmann Ghia. “I was paying for so many things, I was starting not to trust him.”\n\nHe signed a note to repay her for the car, but she said she “never saw a dime.”\n\nShe had long been frugal with her earnings as a teacher, saving $23,000 toward a future home.\n\nWhen Vail learned of this, he became upset she wouldn’t give him some of it, telling others, “Carolyn doesn’t believe in community property.”\n\nShe did pay about $600 (the modern equivalent of nearly $2,400) for him to attend the Erhard Seminars Training (known as est), where trainers promised participants they could break free from their pasts.\n\nWhen Vail returned home, he kept her up all night, saying he should be an est trainer “because he was so much more enlightened,” she recalled.\n\nHe insisted they drive two hours to San Diego to talk with her mother, trying “to alienate me from my mother by convincing me that she never loved me,” she said. “How stupid was that. How stupid was I.”\n\nThe marriage disintegrated soon after the couple went on a double date with Biedebach and Alexandra Christiansen. While they drove in a car together, Carolyn said Christiansen glared at Vail in the rearview mirror and asked, “So why did you get married?”\n\nThe next day, Vail left with Christiansen.\n\nCarolyn said she soon found out he also had an affair with a neighbor. “I was so furious.”\n\nShe telephoned Vail’s mother and detailed what had happened. “Doesn’t this surprise you?” she asked.\n\n“No,” his mother replied.\n\nThat response confirmed that he had “a history of behaving this way,” she recalled. “If your parents don’t defend you, there’s something wrong there.”\n\nWhen he showed up later to collect a few things he left behind, she had friends serve him with divorce papers.\n\n“He was not responsible. He was immoral. But, boy, he knew it all.”\n\nAfter taking the divorce papers, Vail backed his car all the way across the property until he smashed into her MGB sports car.\n\nAbout a month later, he telephoned and told her, “I love you.”\n\nUtilizing a phrase popular in est circles, she replied, “I got it.”\n\nShe never looked back, moving more than 100 miles away. “He was so mentally deranged I couldn’t get far enough away.”\n\nAnnette\n\nIn summer 1981, Mary Rose and her teenage daughter, Annette Craver, greeted people at a friend’s yard sale in the Montrose neighborhood in Houston, Texas, not far from Rice University. They had contributed a few items before their move to San Antonio.\n\nThey had just returned from a vacation in Mexico, and Annette felt heartsick, still infatuated with a boy named Adolfo, who was unable to join her in America. Two years earlier, her father, a Vietnam veteran, had died in a car crash in Mexico.\n\nWhile people poked through stacks of clothes and books, Vail pulled up on a motorcycle and spoke with Annette, a singer-songwriter who at 15 was so bright she was starting her senior year at a private school aimed at those entering the medical profession. He was 41 and had done some carpentry work in the area.\n\n“When I saw her, I thought, ‘That’s going to be my new girlfriend,’ ” he recalled.\n\nAfter moving with her daughter to San Antonio, Rose struggled to find work and relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nAnnette boarded with an art teacher near her high school and dreamed of becoming a midwife, assisting with three births. Vail began to visit her there.\n\nIn April 1982, Rose and her daughter invested in a Tulsa home that had a rental cottage behind it. Rose began renovating both of them.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Annette joined her mother in Tulsa. Vail appeared a few days later.\n\nHe convinced Annette to leave with him on his motorcycle. They lived off the $500-a-month Social Security check that she received from her father’s death, Rose recalled. “It was over one year before I saw her again.”\n\nThat fall, Annette became pregnant and underwent a painful abortion. “Ideally, we should have been ready to have it, go off into the woods and live happily ever after, but as it was neither of us was ready (me mainly),” she wrote. “That sure shot down my ‘I can’t wait to have a baby’ trip.”\n\nThe couple rode south of the border, stopping near Cancun at Isla Mujeres, where her old boyfriend lived, Annette wrote in a Dec. 4, 1982, letter to her mother. “The first couple of nights I looked everywhere for him.”\n\nShe confessed, “Felix has come close to leaving me a couple of times already because of my fantasy that Adolfo was better than anyone I could ever be with, including him.”\n\nSeven months later, she saw her old flame. “He’s teaching children, doing artwork,” she wrote her mother in a postcard. “He asked about you.”\n\nThe couple trekked to Sausalito, California, to see friends.\n\nJerry Woodall recalled seeing the couple outside. “They were in a sleeping bag at 10 in the morning, about 20 feet away. Felix was on top of her and having sex. Annette was looking at me, grinning and waving.”\n\nHis then-wife, Meredith McMackin, recalled the scene as “just embarrassing. We were trying to ignore it.”\n\nShe recalled Vail as a “very handsome” and “spiritually enlightened” man who seemed to have it all together.\n\nShe noticed, too, “this coldness and controlling aspect to his personality. Annette was so open and alive, but I think he just totally dominated her. He would try to convey that he was this higher form of being. At first, I thought maybe he was evolved, but then I realized it was this arrogant act.”\n\nLater that summer of 1983, police in California arrested Vail for violating probation a dozen years earlier.\n\nAnnette telephoned Woodall, who gave her $200.\n\nAfter Vail walked free from prison, he and Annette decided to marry. Because she was only 17, she needed permission.\n\nShe told her mother that she loved Vail, that the couple was already “spiritually married” and that the couple would marry in Mexico if she refused.\n\nNot wanting to lose her daughter completely, Rose said OK.\n\nOn Aug. 15, 1983, the couple married in Bakersfield, California.\n\nFour months later, Annette turned 18, making it possible for her to collect more than $98,000 on life insurance policies taken out by her late father. Accompanied by Vail, she withdrew all the money in cash from a San Antonio bank. She bought a Fiat convertible that Vail liked and paid for his dental work.\n\nIn a letter to a friend, she described her husband as “a separate entity from his family. I’ve met them all, and we visit but infrequent. And Felix has established his own code of ethics which free him from any obligation.”\n\nOne day in April 1984, Rose returned home to find Annette waiting on her doorstep. She spoke of divorcing Vail and enrolling in college.\n\nShe talked, too, of Vail’s temper, Rose recalled. “She confessed to me that she had lied to me about Felix breaking his hand by dropping a pot on it. She said the truth was Felix took a swing at her face. She dodged the blow, and he hit the wall.”\n\nA few weeks later, Vail showed up, Rose said. “They fought almost constantly. He left after a few days. He was insanely jealous of her, would go into a rage when she talked of her desire to go out with younger men.”\n\nShe and Annette worked on renovating the two homes, enjoying their time together, she recalled. “We started a garden.”\n\nAnnette received a letter from Vail, who vowed their time apart would fuel their love. “After we hung up,” he wrote, “I went out to a park and ran and hung and talked with god and smoked some and shot some pool and rode with the top down out through the marsh playing ‘Iron Butterfly’ [“In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida”] and bathing every inch of your body-spirit being with love.”\n\nHe referred to their being apart as “deprivation jail” — “only this time it’s your ego that is our (my) jailer.”\n\nThe idea of her cutting away ego’s “feeder roots and creating roots between your spirit and the cosmic ground of loving makes me hot for you,” he wrote her. “My mind is kissing you everywhere.”\n\nVail returned to her daughter’s life, Rose recalled. “Annette told me, ‘Felix is the wisest person in the world, and I can’t make decisions without him.’ ”\n\nHis influence on Annette grew stronger. She compared Vail to God, Rose said.\n\nThe reunited couple insisted Rose leave. “They became very angry and adamant about me getting out and deeding the place over to Annette.”\n\nRose said Annette fell under Vail’s control and became hostile, accusing her of being a thief.\n\nShe felt devastated. “I have never felt so low in my life.”\n\nWhen thoughts of taking her own life swept over her in spring 1984, she said she realized she had to leave to survive, heading to California to stay with family and friends.\n\nBefore departing, she deeded the house to Annette for $7,000.\n\nWhen Rose later spoke to Annette about the two cats she left behind, Yawni and Puff, Annette shared that Vail had killed them, calling them “a bother.”\n\nIn a July 24 letter, Rose encouraged her daughter to keep their communication open and continue her education. “I feel afraid that you are allowing all of Felix's attitudes to become yours and hope that you will be able to sort out what is true and what is manufactured through his fear.”\n\nBy the time that letter arrived, Annette had already added Vail to the deed. A month later, she deeded him both homes.\n\nAs fall neared, the couple told neighbors they were leaving on vacation. When Vail returned to Tulsa in October, he was driving the Fiat alone.\n\nA neighbor, Wende Austin, asked where Annette was. Vail replied that Annette had a lot of money on her when they parted company and that she might see some people she knew in Denver.\n\nUpon learning that Annette had failed to return, Rose telephoned Vail. “He told me that while they were camping, Annette had a sexual dream about being with other men in Mexico, and she wanted to go there,” she recalled. “He claimed that the dream made them both realize that she should have her freedom.”\n\nThe next day, she said Vail told her he had put Annette on a bus with $50,000, but gave no further details.\n\nHis explanation made no sense to Rose, who wondered how her daughter could have been carrying this much cash since the couple hadn’t planned in advance to split up.\n\nOn Oct. 22, 1984, Rose filed a missing person’s report. She told the Tulsa Police Department that each person who talks with Vail “gets a different story about the amount of money that Annette took with her and where she might be. We all believe that he knows where she is or has done something with her.”\n\nFelix Vail answered the door, seeing Detective Dennis Davis and another officer from the Tulsa Police Department. It was Jan. 22, 1985, and Vail had been expecting them.\n\nWeeks earlier, he had dropped off a photograph of Annette at Davis’ request. Two weeks before that, Vail had filed for divorce, citing an inability to find her after a “diligent search.”\n\nHe invited the officers in, and they chatted for more than two hours.\n\nDavis said her mother, Mary Rose, mentioned her daughter had received more than $90,000 from her father’s estate.\n\nVail confirmed that was true, saying the couple had spent much of that money traveling in foreign countries. He said they kept their money in cash because they didn’t trust banks and that he had found about $10,000 in cash when he returned home.\n\nThe next day, Vail telephoned a lawyer, who promised to talk with the officers and tell them to “leave me alone,” he wrote in his journal.\n\nBy the time Davis returned five days later, Vail had a detailed alibi: The couple left Tulsa between noon and 3 p.m. Sept. 13, 1984, and stayed the night in a hotel in Claremont, Oklahoma. After two nights of camping on the river, Annette awoke and told Vail she had decided to leave him. He took her to the Trailways Bus Station in St. Louis and left before she bought the ticket.\n\nHe told the officers she told him she was headed for Denver, where she planned to get a fake ID card and leave for Mexico.\n\nThey asked Vail if he would take a lie detector test. He said no.\n\nAfter the officers left, Vail wrote in his journals about Annette’s mother, Rose. She is “making Davis dance, and he’s trying to make me dance.”\n\nVail claimed Annette had bought a gun. “I regret some not letting Annette kill her [mother] when she wanted to & Annette is free of her (at least as long as she stays incommunicado).”\n\nHe wondered what to do about Rose. “Now how do I get free of her short of giving her the property?” he asks in his journal. “One way (that I don’t know how to do) is prove to Davis she is manipulative old whore who’s [sic] motivation is accusing me (of whatever) is mostly money and very little if any parental concern for Annette.”\n\nHe scribbled a letter to Rose. He blamed her for the “bad things” in Annette, saying she had “stymied the love between us to the point where we both decided that she could get more ... from miscellaneous emotionally and sexually hungry men than she was getting from me.”\n\nHe wrote that after the couple came back from Costa Rica, Annette “began seeing friends and relatives ... and doing what she called completing her relationships with them for the purpose of getting ready to drop everybody and start over.”\n\nHe wrote that she “disappeared herself from you because she realized that you probably would never voluntarily stop re-energizing in her and superimposing on her the same value system you live by that makes her see you and your mother (and herself partially) as zero self image whores for approval in the form of male attention as prerequisite to the periodic and temporary permission to feel good about yourselves.”\n\nVail explained the two left each other “with no plans to communicate in the future … I have not the slightest idea where she might have gotten to by now. I will tell you that I love the spirit part and very much respect her right to freedom and so I also assure you that even if I did know, I would not tell you.”\n\nHis response felt like a cold slap to Rose. She could feel police interest in her daughter’s disappearance growing cold, too. Perhaps they would be less skeptical if she talked to them in person.\n\nShe returned to Tulsa in April 1985, letting Vail know she would be in town.\n\n“Dear Mary, I would like to see you to [sic],” he wrote her. “I think it could be more than lovely to be with you some. I look forward to it. Love, Felix.”\n\nWhen she arrived, she was unable to reach him and grew worried about her daughter. She slipped inside the rental cottage where her daughter had lived. All of Annette’s clothes were gone, and so were nearly all her possessions, including the diary she kept.\n\nInside a Barbie suitcase, Rose found a photograph of her daughter and several of her identification cards. She also located things that Annette had written, including a Feb. 17, 1984, note that contradicted Vail’s claim that the couple had spent most of her inheritance on their travel to Mexico and Central American countries.\n\nInstead, the note detailed how they used the money to buy the Fiat, pay off all of Vail’s loans, and deposit $36,000 into Louisiana Savings. “As of today, we have $41,600 in cash.”\n\nRose shared the information with police.\n\nDetective Davis showed up again, “acting like Columbo with two more questions,” Vail wrote in his journal.\n\nHe had told Davis before that he and Annette kept their money in cash. Now he acknowledged the couple divided the money into smaller cashier’s checks.\n\nAfter a while, Davis left. Vail hoped the answers satisfied the detective.\n\nHe dreamed about Annette in bed “with this great big ugly fat guy,” he wrote in his journal. “She was feeling dumb and ridiculous for having let him into her and being at the same time as high as she could be … (from) the energy of his desire and attention.”\n\nVail never heard again from the detective, who closed the missing person’s case.\n\nRose kept telephoning, hoping to talk with Vail. She tried him at home in Tulsa. She tried him at his parents’ home in Mississippi.\n\nOn Sept. 14, 1985, she finally reached him in Tulsa. When she asked about Annette’s missing clothes, he told her he had given all of them to charity.\n\nWhen Rose asked about Annette’s whereabouts, he refused to say where she was.\n\nShe mentioned that she was talking to police. When she pressed for more details about what happened to all the money that Annette inherited, she said Vail shot back, “That’s all you really care about — her money.”\n\nShe hung up.\n\nEach day in his journals, Vail wrote about his encounters with women. He hopped from bed to bed, sometimes in the same night.\n\nWhen the sex was good, he described it as “electric” and “mutually orgasmic.” When he was unable to have sex with a woman, he blamed it on her “fat.”\n\nWhen problems arose in the relationships, he blamed their egos, never his own.\n\nDecember came, and temperatures dipped below freezing. Vail watched television, “vibrating on commercials.”\n\nHe thought about Annette. He had told Tulsa police she was schizophrenic and suicidal. Now he wrote that everyone he had met 3 or older was “schizo.”\n\nLess than two weeks before Christmas, he stepped out into the snow at 1 a.m. After watching the movie, “The Hotel New Hampshire,” he returned to the icy white, this time in his bare feet. “It’s coming down in bigger flakes now & around 2 inches, it is magic to walk & frolic in it, falling & fallen, clothes on & clothes off.”\n\nBurning bridges\n\nFed up with the lack of progress in her daughter’s disappearance, Rose returned in 1987 to Tulsa, where she began working at her old job as a manager for the Bakery on Cherry Street.\n\nShe spent thousands on private investigators. When they were unable to locate Vail, she decided to look herself.\n\nTipped off that he was staying at someone’s house, she went there with a friend and found him sitting outside.\n\n“So where did Annette go?” she asked.\n\n“Mexico.”\n\n“Where in Mexico did she go?”\n\nHe told her that he and Annette had made a pact they would contact each other after five years.\n\nHe never looked up, never stood up and never looked her in the eye.\n\nShe walked away, shaking her head in disbelief. She didn’t believe a word.\n\nVail became fast friends with Tulsa native Scott Porter, an expert in martial arts who held more than one black belt.\n\nVail believed he was a martial arts expert, too, after practicing flying kicks into a mattress.\n\nEach morning, he and Porter worked out, lifting weights together before hitting a Chinese buffet.\n\nOver lunch, Vail shared that he had never felt bound by society’s rules, Porter recalled. “He dropped his silverware and began eating with his hands like a caveman.”\n\nAt nights, the pair played pool, drank beer and sometimes visited strip clubs in Tulsa, where Vail tucked dollar bills into the strippers’ panties. “Tulsa had more churches than gas stations,” Porter said, “but also more strip clubs than anywhere else I’ve lived.”\n\nBack home, Vail listened to the songs of Porter, who still dreamed of a career in music.\n\nThe two men reminisced about the women missing from their lives. Vail, at 45, had been married to Annette, just 18, and Porter, at 28, had dated Rose, who was 36.\n\nPorter had driven Rose to California before returning home alone. “My heart was absolutely broken,” he recalled. “She needed to move on, and I didn’t.”\n\nNot long after Annette vanished, Rose telephoned Porter and shared her suspicions that Vail had something to do with her daughter’s disappearance.\n\nPorter began examining each word his friend spoke.\n\nWhile he discussed his hopes of reuniting with Rose, he noticed Vail never mentioned that possibility with Annette.\n\nOne night, Vail seemed more open. “He was crying like a baby,” Porter recalled, “angry it didn’t work out differently.”\n\nVail explained that Annette “wanted to ‘recreate’ herself and that she didn’t want any contact with any portion of her past life. She wanted to totally break with herself.”\n\nWhile Vail talked of breaking with the past, Porter was busy searching for his.\n\nHe had been adopted and decided to move to Minnesota to reconnect with his birth parents. While there, he met his future wife, Jennie.\n\nReturning to Tulsa with a small son and another on the way, he renewed his friendship with Vail, who was so kind he later watched the boys while the couple went out on dates.\n\nOnce, during a discussion of fidelity, Porter said Vail shared that he felt “nobody could ever be faithful to one person.”\n\nMonths later, Vail “starts hitting on my wife,” Porter said.\n\nUpset about this, he took Vail on a walk and confronted him.\n\nVail denied it all, Porter recalled. “He said, ‘No, no, she was hitting on me.’ ”\n\nAs they crossed the Arkansas River Bridge, a fleeting thought ran through his head. “I was wanting to throw Felix off and wondering if I’d get away with it.”\n\nViolence and jealousy\n\nVail began dating Beth Field. She was attracted to his intelligence, and the pair grew close.\n\nArguments followed, and he kept calling her a “whore.” During a December 1987 argument, he became so violent he ruptured her eardrum, according to court records.\n\nShe told Vail there was no justification for physical violence, and she said he replied, “If you quit behaving like a whore, I’ll quit hitting you.”\n\nShe recalled discussing the issue with a therapist. “I finally told this woman, ‘It’s all very nice, but one of us is going to be dead before this works.’ ”\n\nField took the advice of a close friend and attended an intensive 10-day meditation course in August 1988 on Colorado’s Western Slope. To her surprise, Vail came, too.\n\nAfter the course, she received a telephone call from Rose, sharing details about the disappearance of her daughter, Annette.\n\nFrom that point forward, Field said she began to examine Vail’s words more closely, realizing “the probability that he had taken Annette’s life.”\n\nHe told Field he and Annette had gone camping, that she decided she wanted to get away from her mother and that he had helped her set up an opportunity for her to change her name and move on.\n\nVail denied any involvement in Annette’s disappearance.\n\n“Then one time,” Field recalled, “he said, ‘What if I said yes?’ ”\n\nFour months after the meditation course, he entered her home unannounced. Already drunk, he accused her of “imagined promiscuity,” according to the court order.\n\nHe slapped her, struck her and threw her across the bedroom.\n\n“Will I get out alive?” she asked.\n\n“It depends on what you tell me,” Vail replied.\n\nThe judge gave her a protective order, requiring Vail to keep his distance. Two weeks later, the sheriff reported that Vail was nowhere to be found.\n\nField said she felt caught in a “sick, addictive relationship, and it took quite some time to fully unravel it.”\n\nOver time, her attachment to him began to fade.\n\nWhile Field was visiting a meditation center in Texas in 1990, Vail arrived and castigated her, and she felt the same anger and defensiveness rising up as before, she said.\n\nShe walked away to compose herself, and when she returned, she sat down next to him. “I told him, ‘There is a part of you that goes off, and it’s sick and it’s dangerous.’ ”\n\nShe said he looked at her and asked, “Really?”\n\n“Yes, really.”\n\nThis time, the message seemed to soak in.\n\nVail left the next day, and with a single exception about five years later, she did not see him again.\n\nMary Rose moved to Ashland, Oregon, in 1989, working as an administrator for a private Waldorf School. She was hoping for a quieter life than the one she had in California.\n\nMore than a year later, she visited a psychic, asking if she could talk about her daughter Annette.\n\nThe psychic put her hands over her forehead and spoke. “Oh, my gosh, this is not something I usually talk about when I see images like this.”\n\nShe never shared what she saw, but Rose knew her daughter was dead and that she needed to get to the bottom of this.\n\nIn the summer of 1991, she removed the back seats from her Toyota van and put in a makeshift bed for sleeping. She made curtains to hang over the windows.\n\nShe had previously talked by telephone with Felix Vail’s sister, Sue Jordan, who now lived in Canyon Lake, Texas.\n\nNow Rose decided to drive the more than 2,000 miles there, hoping she might find out more in person.\n\nJordan answered the door and invited her in. The two women sat in the living room, and Jordan recalled the last time she saw Annette. In October 1984, the family attended the Cam-Cal Fair in Sulphur, Louisiana, along with Vail and Annette.\n\n“She told me Felix was giving Annette a hard time,” Rose recalled. “He criticized the way she was dressed.”\n\nDays after the fair, the couple left together, and a few days after that, Vail returned alone, “extremely distressed, eating meat and drinking alcohol,” she said Jordan told her.\n\nThat struck Rose as strange because Vail was a longtime vegetarian.\n\nJordan shared that Vail told her that Annette wanted to leave, that he took her to a bus station and that she left with some Mexican men, heading for Mexico.\n\nJordan also mentioned that Vail’s first wife had drowned. That was news to Rose.\n\nBefore she left, she said Jordan remarked, “Oh, you know, there was another woman that disappeared. I remember her mother calling my mother for years, checking to see if they’d heard from her. I think her name was Sharon.”\n\nAfter the conversation, Rose sat down at a typewriter, pecking out every word she could remember. She also telephoned the public library in Lake Charles.\n\nThe librarian remembered the 1962 drowning of Vail’s first wife, Mary. She recalled that he had taken out life insurance policies on his wife prior to her drowning. She also said the insurance companies were suspicious and didn’t pay the full value.\n\nThe librarian made copies of those newspaper articles and mailed them to her.\n\nAfter reading them, Rose reached out to Mary’s family in Louisiana, speaking to Will Horton. He shared his suspicions about Vail and a copy of the 1971 National Enquirer article. When she read it, she learned that Sharon’s last name was Hensley.\n\nThat solved one problem, but created another. Where was Sharon Hensley from? She had no idea.\n\nIn 1994, she read in the newspaper about Dolores Strehlow’s disappearance from Medford, Oregon, seven years earlier. Police had just arrested her husband, thanks to the work of Detective Terry Newell.\n\nShe contacted Newell, who was able to help her find the family of Sharon Hensley.\n\nWhen Rose dialed the Hensley family, Sharon’s mother, Peggy, answered.\n\n“Do you happen to know who Felix Vail is?” Rose asked.\n\n“You bet I do.”\n\n“We need to talk.”\n\n‘A fraud, bum and kind of a joke’\n\nNow back in Mississippi, Vail lived with his mother and father in their home in Montpelier.\n\n“Beginning lucid in the daily conscious waking dreaming and in the nightly sleep dreaming is the beginning purpose of this journal,” he wrote May 6, 1988. “A 24-hour-a-day lucid conscious spirit presence is my nature. … Starting tonight all the dreams go in this book.”\n\nIn one dream, he made his “fat” wife (whom he called “my cow wife”) disappear so he could be with a beautiful, black-haired woman.\n\nDuring the day, he worked some on the family’s farm. He also tinkered with his Fiat and used his gravity boots to hang upside down in a barn.\n\nOne day, he “chased off a poor three-legged hound dog,” he wrote in his journals. The next, he “shot the 3-legged dog and cleaned up the garbage.”\n\nHe detailed winning pool games and bedding women, sometimes having sex in a grain bin, an old bus or their homes while their husbands are away. “We are amping each other’s electric in a way we both desperately need right now in our lives,” he wrote Feb. 28, 1992.\n\nIn 1992, Robin Sinclair telephoned a Mississippi newspaper, wanting to buy an advertisement to remind Vail that he had a daughter he had never met.\n\nThe newspaper put her in touch with Vail, and the two began to write letters and talk on the telephone.\n\nIn one note, Vail “stated he had never gotten over me,” she recalled.\n\nShe felt confused by his words, she said, because she was already living with a man who made her happy — and who would become her future husband.\n\nWhen Vail arrived a few months later, she said the same magic she had felt more than two decades earlier had vanished. “I realized that he was a fraud, bum and kind of a joke.”\n\nPursuit for justice\n\nMary Rose contacted everyone she could think of, including the FBI.\n\nThe detective who had helped her before, Terry Newell, made contact with Jim Bell, a national expert in serial killings working for the FBI.\n\nWhen Rose talked with Bell, she felt she had hit the jackpot.\n\nHe was interested in working on the Vail case if he could swing the time. He remained busy with active serial killer cases, helping train task forces across the U.S.\n\nVail’s son, Bill, told Rose that he was willing to testify, as long as authorities provided protection to his family.\n\nBoth the Tulsa police and the district attorney’s office in Lake Charles revived their investigations into Vail, now considered a suspected serial killer.\n\nBell suggested the victims’ families gather with authorities at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, to share information on Vail.\n\nHe was unable to work on the case and left the FBI in 1995. The meeting in Quantico never materialized, and the cases involving\n\nVail grew cold again.\n\nRose felt devastated. She had worked so hard to make something happened and nothing had. She knew the other families felt devastated, too.\n\nShe sought counseling to help her cope with the grief.\n\nOne night, she listened to a recording of Annette performing her songs, including “Sunset in Winter”: “I’m dying, leaving orange tears, blood upon your face … Throw me gilded kisses, silent sorrow, but do not stay up and wait for me, for I may not return.”\n\nTears streaked down her cheeks. She knew Annette would never return.\n\n‘Not the man I know’\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Vail began dating a woman in Mississippi. At the time, he was 55, and she was 44.\n\n“In 10 years, I never saw a temper,” the woman said.\n\nShe recalled Vail taking care of his parents before their deaths. “Felix was very attentive,” she said. “He was just a kind man.”\n\nAlthough he never worked a job, she said he was the most frugal person she ever met. “He could probably live off $300 a month. He got rental money from the house in Tulsa.”\n\nOne day, she tried to step across the swollen creek in front of her house. Knocked off her feet, the current dragged her downstream.\n\n“If I had died in the creek,” she said, “I would have been added to the list of people that Felix supposedly killed.”\n\nShe knew of the allegations that Vail had something to do with Annette Vail’s disappearance, but she was unaware of Sharon Hensley’s disappearance or suspicions surrounding Mary Horton Vail’s death.\n\n“That man,” she insisted, “was not the man I know.”\n\nRose moved to western Massachusetts, hoping to heal.\n\nIn the fall of 1997, family members and friends held her hands during a memorial service for Annette, whose songs played.\n\nAt night, Rose sometimes stepped outside, gazing at the stars and pondering the past.\n\nShe fumed at herself for letting Annette marry Vail, for failing to stand up to him and for leaving Annette behind in Tulsa.\n\nHer anger boiled toward Vail. Why, she wondered, was he not behind bars?\n\nA dozen years later, she read about a local support group for parents whose children had died.\n\nWould she fit in? She didn’t know, but decided to go anyway.\n\nShe shared stories about Annette, passing around her pictures and poetry.\n\nRose’s work with support groups and sessions with a local therapist helped her do something she had been unable to do for a quarter century — release the heavy burden she felt she had been carrying since her daughter’s disappearance.\n\nAfter a therapy session in which she had sobbed at Annette’s loss, she returned home and listened to one of her daughter’s songs.\n\nAnnette strummed a guitar, and her voice rose. Her mother felt the joy of her daughter and her all-too-brief life, finally able to listen to the music without weeping.\n\nSon’s mixed feelings\n\nVail’s son, Bill, became an Eagle Scout and graduated from Mississippi State University in the top 5 percent of his class.\n\nHe became a mechanical engineer, working for corporations such as Sinclair Oil, and remained active in church and Boy Scouts.\n\nIn 1984, Bill married his wife, Janet. Years later, he received a call from Rose and then from authorities.\n\n“They asked, ‘Did I believe he may have murdered her (Annette)?’” Bill said. “And I said, ‘Yes, I believe based on past experiences, it was entirely possible.’ ”\n\nHe explained his complicated feelings to Rose.\n\n“Felix is a mixture of opposite extremes — he is capable of incredibly unselfish love, and simultaneously he is capable of doing the incredibly selfish and black things he has done,” he wrote. “He values, even demands, honesty and integrity, yet he admittedly will lie whenever it is convenient.”\n\nVail held mixed feelings toward Bill.\n\nIn a letter to his son, he bragged about him holding “center stage with a whole room full of PhDs by simplifying logic sequence problems for them when you were 5.”\n\nBut in his journals, he criticized his son’s Christian faith as “herd animal mentality,” saying, “Ego finally took him over.”\n\nIn a letter, Vail told Bill that after death, he and his half-sister, Simone, should “split up whatever ‘stuff’ I will have accumulated … I love you both equally with all the heart I have.”\n\nBill replied in a letter: “I have always loved you. I can’t help but love you.”\n\nBut barricades remained to their relationship, the biggest of which was “the murder of my mother,” he wrote.\n\nHe mentioned the pain of learning about these two other missing women and recalled what his father had told him about Sharon Hensley.\n\n“I was so angry that you told me because there was absolutely no one I could talk to about it,” he wrote. “I had to keep it to myself knowing that no one would believe you had killed her based on those words, at least not in court.”’\n\nDiagnosed with esophageal cancer, Bill heard from doctors that he didn’t have long to live. “Now,” he told his uncle, Will Horton, “I’ll get to be with my mom.”\n\nMonths before dying in 2009, Bill talked about his father in a recorded interview with his pastor at Grace Church in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\n“Part of me loves him,” he said. “He was a good father. I know that’s hard to believe given what he’s done. ... I have to keep a distance because of what he’s able to do — for my family’s sake.”\n\nOn Jan. 3, 2009, Bill died, and Vail wrote in his journal, “I feel a large empty hole in my being where his life presence has been for 47 years.”\n\nHe then wrote about getting a good haircut.\n\nVail drove to Kansas, but skipped the funeral. If he had attended, he would have heard the recording, his son detailing how he overheard his father talk about killing his mother.\n\nWhen Vail learned of the recording, he wrote Pastor Tim Howey, asking for a copy: “Bill never mentioned to me in his whole life any of the negative stuff about drugs and murder that had been put in his mind about me.”\n\nVail blamed his son’s statements on “false memories,” saying, “I have not known about it until now and am stunned.”\n\nAs for the accusations of murder, he wrote, “I have saved several people’s lives. I have never taken any.”\n\nOn May 14, 2012, I went with Mary Rose as she tried to confront Felix Vail about her missing daughter, Annette. He wasn’t there, but she found a stack of machetes and swords in one of his trailers.\n\n“Could DNA tests be done to see if there is blood on these?” she asked.\n\nI was wondering the same thing.\n\nShe handed me a spiritual tome by the Holy Order of MANS. When I opened it, I read the words, “Look not into the past, for it is no more.”\n\nBefore we left the area, Vail’s sister, Kaye Faulkner, stopped us. She wanted to talk.\n\nRose and I sat in her living room as she spoke about attending the 2009 funeral of Bill Vail. “Bill said he overheard Felix saying he killed his mother.”\n\nShe turned to me. “You should get a copy of that recording.”\n\nShe was convinced, she said, that Felix had killed all three women.\n\nShe was surprised he was still alive. Last year, a tornado smacked his trailer, and he had somehow survived, receiving only minor injuries.\n\nI told her I was interested in talking to her brother. She gave me his cellphone number. She also shared the numbers for her other brother, Ronnie, and her sister, Beth.\n\nWhen Felix Vail didn’t answer, I left him a message that I was interested in speaking with him about these women’s disappearances. Ronnie promised to speak to his brother on my behalf.\n\nOver dinner, Rose opened two manila folders filled with hundreds of pages of documents she had collected on Vail.\n\nThere was the judge’s protective order for Beth Field after Vail had beaten her a second time and the National Enquirer article on the 1970 arrests of Felix Vail and Sharon Hensley.\n\nRose showed me similarities between the two letters Vail wrote — one to her after Annette disappeared and the other after Sharon disappeared.\n\nIn each letter, he insisted to the families that the women had gone away because they wanted to disappear, start over and leave their pasts behind.\n\nWas he the one who really wanted to leave his past behind?\n\nRose shared the 1962 autopsy report on Vail’s wife, Mary, and a stack of newspaper clippings on her drowning in Lake Charles.\n\nVail told deputies that he and his wife had gone trotline fishing, that she was shining a flashlight and that when she warned him about a stump, he jerked the boat to avoid it, and she accidentally fell out. He told them he dove into the water, but was unable to save her.\n\nLake Charles\n\nArriving in Lake Charles, I stood along the Calcasieu River, examining the place where Vail told deputies his wife had drowned.\n\nThe dark, swift river, which bore the Atakapa word for “crying,” swept by as I stood on the dirt.\n\nReassembling this case was going to be even tougher than I thought. Whatever reports the sheriff’s office had made at the time had all been lost.\n\nI stopped by the Southwestern Louisiana Genealogical and Historical Library, which shared copies from old city directories, and I began tracking down those who had lived in the Maree Apartments with Felix and Mary Vail.\n\nOne of them was Judson McCann II. When he finally answered the door, he invited me inside his apartment, filled with photographs of him deep-sea fishing.\n\nHe had been close with Vail, and Mary Vail’s death had always shocked him. He said he couldn’t believe she would be out on the river at night.\n\nHe also couldn’t believe Vail’s claim that he was laying trotlines. He and Vail golfed, but he never recalled Vail fishing. Instead, Vail used his boat to waterski.\n\nMcCann described Vail as a ladies’ man. “Many nights, his car wouldn’t be home, and Mary would be there with the lights on.\n\nWhen Felix was gone, it wasn’t because he was trotline fishing.”\n\nAnother close friend, Bob Hodges, told me that when Mary drowned, “I’ll be truthful with you, that was the end of my friendship with Felix.”\n\nHe never knew Vail to fish and described Vail’s explanation about how his wife drowned as “horse manure. That’s what I think of that story.”\n\nThe odds of one man having one wife drown and two others disappear seemed beyond belief.\n\nI decided to ask criminologist James Alan Fox of Northeastern University what the odds of such a scenario would be. “Smaller than the threshold of chance,” he said. “Either he tends to select partners that lead higher risk lives or something else is going on that’s more nefarious.”\n\nThe family of Vail’s wife, Mary, told me she had been a member of Chi Omega. I contacted a librarian from McNeese State University, who pulled out the old yearbooks and created a list of the members between 1957 and 1961. She shared the list, and I began contacting them.\n\nThey talked of how much she feared drowning. “Nobody believed it was an accident,” her college roommate, Sandra Sudduth Pratt, told me.\n\nI shared the Oct. 30, 1962, autopsy report with renowned pathologist Dr. Michael Baden of New York City.\n\nHis conclusion? Foul play took place in her death.\n\nThe report showed large bruises with bleeding into tissues on the left side of the neck, which he said suggested she suffered forceful neck trauma before entering the water.\n\nThere were also hemorrhagic bruises to the right calf and left leg above the knee, which he said were consistent with a struggle before her submersion.\n\nMost convincingly of all was the scarf authorities found around her neck that extended 4 inches into her mouth, which suggested traumatic asphyxia before entering the water, he said.\n\n“Somebody had to push that scarf into her mouth. She had to have that scarf wedged in her mouth before she went in the water.”\n\nJoining forces\n\nA half-century after his sister, Mary, drowned, Will Horton went out onto the Calcasieu River and gazed at the place where she breathed her last.\n\nHe never knew she died in this section of the river that snakes north of downtown Lake Charles. He had always believed she had drowned much farther south.\n\nHe said he had looked up to his sister, seven years older than him. “It’s haunting. I keep wanting to talk with her.”\n\nHe told me Mary Rose had contacted him in the 1990s. “You could have knocked me over with a feather when I found out there were two other women.”\n\nHe and Rose bonded in their common cause for justice. She shared letters Vail had written and other documents she had been saving since 1984. Horton shared his sister’s autopsy report, death certificate and other documents his family had been saving since her death in 1962.\n\nHe said he told Rose, “No matter what happens, this is going to be for all three women.”\n\nA cousin put him in touch with former detective “Rabbit” Manuel, who had headed up the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Office’s investigation back in 1962.\n\nManuel had worked thousands of cases, but he had never forgotten Mary’s death, Horton said. “He said Felix’s story just didn’t add up. The fishing tackle was dry. The trotline was dry. The boat was dry. Even Felix’s cigarettes were dry, despite him telling the deputies he dove straight in the water to save Mary.”\n\nHe and Manuel met with “Lucky” DeLouche, who directed the Violent Crimes Task Force, an elite unit that investigated homicides.\n\nThree young detectives took notes as they talked. Manuel shared details from the case, saying deputies wanted to prosecute, but the district attorney wouldn’t let them. Horton shared the autopsy report, Vail’s letters and his belief that Vail was a serial killer.\n\nHorton said DeLouche replied, “This absolutely fits the profile of a serial killer.”\n\nThe other detectives agreed.\n\nThe task force discussed sending Vail’s son, Bill, in to secretly record a conversation with his father. Horton objected, saying that might put Bill in jeopardy.\n\nDeLouche left the task force, and the case grew cold again.\n\nHorton gazed out at the Calcasieu River as Calcasieu Parish Deputy Ron Johnson guided the boat. He had fished and dived in this river since the 1960s.\n\nJohnson led us north of the old Halliburton docks, where newspaper articles said Mary’s body had been recovered.\n\nHorton said his sister feared drowning and refused to swim where she couldn’t see the bottom. “Mary was scared of the dark water, so why was she out there? And why was she out there without wearing a life preserver?”\n\nHe wondered why Vail had failed to seek help closer, rather than boating back toward Shell Beach, more than 5 miles south, especially since he claimed to have trouble cranking his engine.\n\nHe questioned Vail’s story about running trotlines, saying he had waterskied in that high-powered boat many times, but “I never saw a fishing pole. I never saw a tackle box.”\n\nHe said ski boats aren’t designed for trotline fishing because they sit up too high on the water.\n\nHe said a ski boat sits up high on the water, but a boat that sits close to the water is needed to run trotlines. “Felix didn’t even have a trolling motor.”\n\nHe questioned Vail’s claim that Mary fell from the boat when he steered to avoid a stump.\n\nJohnson said dredging during World War II enabled Navy ships, oil tankers and other vessels to use this waterway. He said a trotline can’t survive such traffic, and that’s why fishermen place their trotlines elsewhere.\n\nHorton said Vail never explained to the family what happened that night.\n\n“Our family had a lot of questions, but we never got any answers.”\n\nAnother disappearing act\n\nShortly after Rose rummaged through the old trailer, looking for clues, Vail disappeared again.\n\nHe returned on Labor Day weekend in 2012, only to sell his 17 acres and depart. He left his storm-damaged trailer behind, but the machetes and knives that had lined his floor were gone.\n\nI telephoned his brother, Ronnie, who told me, “I don’t know where he went. He probably doesn’t want anyone to know where he is.”\n\nRonnie, who had worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for 22 years, told me when he heard allegations of the disappearances of these women, “We were all just shocked.”\n\n“Did the FBI ever interview you?”\n\n“No. I’m surprised they haven’t.”\n\nAfter my story on Felix Vail, “Gone” appeared in The Clarion-Ledger on Nov. 11, 2012, I traveled to Montpelier to meet a man who had telephoned me.\n\nWesley Turnage grew up with Vail and recalled a conversation he had in the months following his 1963 graduation from Montpelier High School.\n\nHe said he had car trouble one day, and Vail gave him a ride to the Knickerbocker Manufacturing Co. in nearby West Point, where they both worked.\n\nDuring that drive on Mississippi 46, he said Vail talked first of his son, Bill, and then of his deceased wife, Mary, calling her his “ex-wife” — a word that struck Turnage as strange since the two were not divorced at the time of her death.\n\nHe said the longer Vail spoke, the angrier the man got. “You could see a rage in his eyes.”\n\nVail referred to Mary as a “bitch,” saying she thought another child would help solve their marriage problems, Turnage recalled.\n\nHe quoted Vail as saying, “She wanted to have another kid. I didn’t want the one I got. I fixed that sorry bitch. She will never have another one.”\n\nTime marched on, but he said he never forgot what Vail told him. “It’s like 9/11. Some things stick in your mind.”\n\nI returned to Lake Charles, puzzled by how Vail dodged an indictment in the 1962 death of his first wife, Mary.\n\nHer brother, Will Horton, joined me in the Calcasieu Parish clerk’s office as I pored through stacks of records, trying to find out more information about the grand jury that met on the case Jan. 7, 1963.\n\nFlipping through the pages, I noticed a lot of criminal cases had been dismissed in 1962. When I added them up, I realized then-District Attorney Frank Salter Jr. had the judge dismiss 882 criminal cases — more than three cases for each working day.\n\nHorton told me the original detectives in the case told him that Salter wouldn’t allow them to present the evidence they had collected against Vail.\n\nThat matched the stories I had heard from grand jurors’ families.\n\nHorton left while I continued to dig. A half hour later, he called me to let me know he was talking with District Attorney John DeRosier.\n\n“He’s from Eunice, just like me,” Horton said.\n\nI walked over and met DeRosier, a Vietnam veteran who viewed himself as the guy wearing the white hat and battling the bad guys. He even kept a life-size cutout of John Wayne in his office.\n\nHe said he would be willing to reopen the case if there was enough evidence.\n\nAfterward, I telephoned a retired lawyer who had known Salter.\n\nThe cheerful, white-haired man, who built boats and model airplanes, greeted Horton and me at the door, inviting us to join him at the kitchen table.\n\nA talented attorney in both civil and criminal court, Russell Tritico Sr. had won a 1980 civil judgment, forcing chainsaw manufacturers to put chain brakes on their products.\n\nThe 84-year-old retired lawyer recalled the corruption of those days. He worked back then under his uncle, Joe, who represented then-Sheriff “Ham” Reid, accused of taking bribes but never convicted.\n\nTritico said the sheriff was so paranoid, he stayed in his patrol car, and he never answered the telephone at home unless he heard the right sequence of rings.\n\nHe described Salter as a longtime prosecutor whose “close friends were mostly what I called hoodlums.”\n\nIn the 1950s, Salter began his legal career as an assistant district attorney for then-District Attorney Ed Shaheen, but when the senior prosecutor sought re-election in 1960, Salter ran against him.\n\nTritico said the major issue Salter raised was Shaheen had dismissed too many cases. “Then Frank becomes DA and does the same thing.”\n\nDismissals became business as usual, and defense lawyers showered office secretaries with gifts, especially at Christmas, he recalled. “It was easy money. Of course, the victim might not be happy.”\n\nHe knew about the 1962 death of Mary Horton Vail.\n\nWhen his uncle, Joe, ran against Salter in 1966, her death became a political issue. The candidate showed a photograph of her body after it was recovered from the river as proof of Salter’s political favors.\n\nI asked Tritico about Cities Service, and he told me the company was like the General Motors of the Lake Charles area. I knew Vail’s uncle, Thomas Finnie, had worked there as a supervisor and had arranged for Vail’s job.\n\nIn searching for Salter’s obituary, I had run across the one for his father, who also worked at Cities Service. When I visited Finnie’s 94-year-old widow, Virginia, she confirmed the couple’s friendship with the district attorney.\n\nI shared what Vail said about trotline fishing that night, and Tritico shook his head. The longtime fisherman questioned why Vail would have traveled so many miles up the Calcasieu River when he could have laid trotlines not far from where he kept his boat.\n\n“You don’t run trotlines in deep water.”\n\nFinding Felix\n\nSo where had Vail gone? Had he just disappeared like the women he professed to once love?\n\nI telephoned more of his relatives and friends. They were just as clueless as me.\n\nWeeks after “Gone” was published, I received a telephone call from a man who had read my nearly 9,000-word story online. We discussed Vail, the case against him and his disappearance before the man volunteered, “I know where he is.”\n\n“You do?”\n\n“Canyon Lake, Texas. Would you like his post office box?”\n\n“You bet.”\n\nBack in Jackson, I telephoned Enzo Yaksic of Boston, the founder of the Serial Homicide Expertise and Information Sharing Collaborative. No matter what questions I had about serial killers, Yaksic had the answers, thanks to a huge database he had amassed.\n\nMy search for answers in the Vail case led Yaksic to contact Armin Showalter, acting chief for the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit, which specialized in serial homicide investigations.\n\nYaksic shared a copy of “Gone” with Showalter, who in turn contacted Calcasieu Parish Deputy Randy Curtis, now taking on the Vail case.\n\nCurtis telephoned me, explaining that he was a 20-year law enforcement veteran who had been transferred from the Violent Crimes Unit to the Forensic Cold Case Division. After reading “Gone,” he called back, wondering if I knew where Vail was these days.\n\n“Canyon Lake, Texas,” I said.\n\nDays later, the deputy telephoned with news that the FBI had discovered Vail purchased property at 737 Shadyview Drive in Canyon Lake.\n\nOn Jan. 18, 2013, Curtis decided to confront Vail. He found the suspected serial killer at that address, living in a storage shed so large it could be a home.\n\nCurtis said he read Vail his rights before asking him about the death and disappearances of the women.\n\nVail refused to say anything, accusing families and The Clarion-Ledger of lying about him.\n\nThe whole time, Vail couldn’t stop smirking.\n\nThe sight of that smirk angered Curtis, who worked days, nights and weekends on the case.\n\nOne day, he called to tell me he had found something. Big.\n\nConsensus: Vail killed Mary\n\nNot long after this call, Will Horton shared the number of his cousin, who was in the same rosary group with a caretaker for 90-year-old Isaac “Sonny” Abshire Jr.\n\nI drove to Lake Charles and sat down with the man, who was finishing his lunch in front of the television. He remembered Vail well. The pair had worked together at a chemical plant next to the Cities Service refinery in nearby Sulphur. They refrigerated the chemical butadiene, used to produce tires.\n\nAbshire described Vail as “my helper” and “a good worker. I liked him.”\n\nVail was looking for a place closer to his girlfriend, Mary Horton, who was living in Lake Charles. Needing the cash, Abshire offered him a room for rent.\n\nHe accepted, and Mary became a frequent visitor. “I was kind of like a big brother to her. She was a sweet little girl.”\n\nAfter the couple decided to get married, Vail moved out.\n\nAt work, his disposition soured. He talked about how ugly his wife was when she was pregnant and that he didn’t like his baby.\n\n“Even a dog loves their children,” Abshire said he replied.\n\nOn the Friday before her drowning, the couple visited, bringing their infant son, Bill. Mary confided in Abshire, asking if he\n\nthought Vail could take her baby away.\n\nTwo nights later, word came that Mary had drowned in the Calcasieu River.\n\nDeputies contacted Abshire’s father for help in the search.\n\nAbshire and two fellow workers went out the next day to drag the river. The next morning, Oct. 30, 1962, he returned with one of them, Jimmy May, to continue dragging.\n\nWhile they were talking, “something popped up. A guy with binoculars asked, ‘Does she have blonde hair?’ I said, ‘Yes, that’s her.’ ”\n\nThey recovered the body, and Abshire could never forget what he saw. Her body was rigid, and a scarf was wrapped around her neck before going into her mouth. “It had a big ol’ knot in it.”\n\nThe deputies on the boat boiled in anger, all voicing the same opinion — that Vail had killed Mary. “They believed it was foul play.”\n\nA deputy shared copies of photographs taken that day, and Abshire had held onto them ever since, placing them in a folder he marked “Keep.”\n\n“You hung onto these photos for 50 years?” I asked.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHe told me he gave the photos to Deputy Curtis. He also handed over a copy of the 1962 sheriff’s report, which listed 15 points suggesting Vail’s guilt.\n\nDespite being behind on major bills, Vail had managed to pay an entire year’s premiums in advance for a $50,000 life insurance policy on his wife. He had a second life insurance policy on her for $8,000, which promised to pay double if she died by accident.\n\nDeputies reported that witnesses said Vail told them he didn’t love his wife, that she was stupid and that she looked vulgar.\n\nDeputies also reported that Vail had “sexual relationships with other females and at least one male.”\n\nMost witnesses they talked to felt he was capable of killing his wife.\n\nVail told deputies that his wife was wearing an off-white leather jacket when she went into the water. But she wasn’t wearing the jacket when her body was recovered.\n\nInside his boat, deputies found two life preservers. Mary had not been wearing one, despite her fear of drowning.\n\nAs for the trotline, deputies found it coiled inside Vail’s tackle box.\n\n“That’s why,” Abshire told me, “they thought it was fishy.”\n\nWhen he returned to work, he told his co-workers what he witnessed.\n\nWord spread, and he said his boss hauled him in and told him to stop sharing what he saw.\n\nEventually, Abshire faced off with Vail. “He said he had lawyers that were ready to sue me for everything I had for all I was saying about him.”\n\n“Get your lawyers ready,” he said he replied. “I want to get on the (witness) stand and tell everybody what happened.”\n\nAfter some time passed, Abshire said Vail telephoned him, asking if he still wanted to tell everything to the lawyers.\n\n“Get ‘em,” Abshire said he replied. “I’m still ready to talk. I want to get on the stand and tell ‘em what I know.”\n\nNot long after, Vail left town.\n\nI asked him if he believed Vail had killed his wife.\n\n“Oh, my God, yes.”\n\nMarriage made in hell\n\nOver gumbo and crawfish étouffée, Steve Horton talked about his aunt Mary, whom his family adored so much that he and his wife had named their daughter after her. He showed me her 1962 death certificate, signed by the coroner, Dr. Harry Snatic. The certificate said she “fell from (the) boat while fishing and accidentally drowned.”\n\nHorton detailed the many errors. Snatic had put down the wrong date of her birth. The wrong date of her death. The wrong occupation (“housewife” rather than “teacher”).\n\nHe pointed to the neat signature, “William Vail.” It looked nothing like the handwriting of William Felix Vail that I was familiar with.\n\nHe then directed me to the date of Vail’s signature, Oct. 31, 1962.\n\n“That was the same day as the funeral, which was in Eunice,” he said. “How could he have signed this in Lake Charles?”\n\nHorton shared other documents, which showed Vail had failed to pay any money toward the $1,014 bill for his wife’s funeral, her headstone or her burial plot.\n\n“Dear Sir, I would have contacted you sooner if I had known anything definate (sic) about when I can pay you,” Vail wrote\n\nArdoin’s Funeral Home in 1963. “Thank you for your patience and I’ll be in your office the first part of April to settle the bill. Yours truly, Felix Vail.”\n\nVail never showed and never paid, despite receiving thousands on two life insurance policies he took out on his wife.\n\nThe funeral home won a $1,306 judgment in Mississippi against Vail. He still didn’t pay.\n\nIt was during a bridge game in 1969 that Mary’s mother learned Vail had never put a penny toward the funeral, Horton told me.\n\n“She was so embarrassed, she went and paid.”\n\nI spoke with funeral home operator Gene Ardoin. He remembered Mary as “a beautiful girl. They had a marriage not made in heaven, but made in hell.”\n\nTrip to Canyon Lake\n\nWhen I drove into the Canyon Lake neighborhood where Vail lived, I saw deer grazing on the lawns.\n\nPaperwork I copied at the courthouse showed David Thomason had deeded his property to Vail after he paid the back taxes.\n\nDigging into Thomason’s background, I discovered he and Vail shared something in common — each had a wife who died in an “accidental drowning.”\n\nI decided to dig deeper.\n\nThomason’s estranged wife, Kathey, had drowned in Canyon Lake on July 3, 2005. Her family still had questions.\n\nHer mother, Cathy Simon, still lived in Canyon Lake. She told me her daughter tried to get away from Thomason, who was charged twice with assault but was never prosecuted. “She was terrified of him.”\n\nOn the back lot of Vail’s property, I could see the boat Kathey supposedly fell from and drowned.\n\nFriends told me Thomason was out of town at the time.\n\nIf he did take out a life insurance policy on her, I couldn’t find it, but I did find that insurance companies had shelled out more than a half million in proceeds to him, including $215,400 for a house fire that the fire marshal had ruled a suspicious arson.\n\nVail now lived on this property, and when I pulled up outside his home, I noticed there were no windows. The padlocked fence had barbed wire across the top.\n\nI called out his name and told him I was interested in speaking to him about the missing women. There was no answer.\n\nOn March 10, 2013, I received an email from Gina Frenzel, a redheaded private investigator, whose colleagues nicknamed her “Batgirl.”\n\nObsessed with serial killers, she had read the e-book version of “Gone” before going online to discover Felix Vail was now living in Canyon Lake.\n\nThat was only an hour and a half away from her home in Kerrville, Texas, where her grandfather had been chief of police for 20 years.\n\n“I’m a licensed private investigator,” she wrote me. “Let me know if you need any help.”\n\nI promised I would. Later, I sent a second email, saying I would like to find out more about the suspicious burning of David Thomason’s house on the property where Vail now lived.\n\nOn April 3, she tried to talk to Thomason, and when she was unable to, she telephoned and said she was going to see Vail.\n\n“He won’t talk to you,” I told her.\n\n“Wanna bet?” she replied.\n\nShe called back later with the news that Vail had indeed talked. She told him she was an investigator looking into Thomason’s fire, and he had spoken almost nonstop to her.\n\nShe returned several more times, recording each of her conversations with Vail, who shared details about his life and lectured her about the dangers of ego, even as his own ego overwhelmed their conversations.\n\nHe claimed to have a genius-level IQ surpassing 140 and talked of memories from the womb, saying he could “feel the sunshine” on his mother’s belly.\n\nI shared information from Frenzel’s visits with the expert, Yaksic. He provided many hours of advice and insights, saying Vail seemed “more in line with a cult leader” than a suspected serial killer.\n\nFo", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/29"}]}

{"question_id": "20230707_11", "search_time": "2023/07/08/01:59", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/10/19/nuclear-waste-great-lakes/1417767002/", "title": "Radioactive nuclear waste sits on Great Lakes shores", "text": "More than 60,000 tons of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel is stored on the shores of four of the five Great Lakes — in some cases, mere yards from the waterline — in still-growing stockpiles.\n\n“It’s actually the most dangerous waste produced by any industry in the history of the Earth,” said Gordon Edwards, president of the nonprofit Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility.\n\nThe spent nuclear fuel is partly from 15 current or former U.S. nuclear power plants, including four in Michigan, that have generated it over the past 50 years or more. But most of the volume stored along the Great Lakes, more than 50,000 tons, comes from Canadian nuclear facilities, where nuclear power is far more prevalent.\n\nIt remains on the shorelines because there's still nowhere else to put it. The U.S. government broke a promise to provide the nuclear power industry with a central, underground repository for the material by 1998. Canada, while farther along than the U.S. in the process of trying to find a place for the waste, also doesn't have one yet.\n\nThe nuclear power industry and its federal regulator, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, point to spent nuclear fuel's safe on-site storage over decades. But the remote possibility of a worst-case scenario release — from a natural disaster, a major accident, or an act of terrorism — could cause unthinkable consequences for the Great Lakes region.\n\nScientific research has shown a radioactive cloud from a spent fuel pool fire would span hundreds of miles, and force the evacuation of millions of residents in Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, Toronto or other population centers, depending on where the accident occurred and wind patterns.\n\nIt would release multiple times the radiation that emanated from the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011 — a disaster that led to mass evacuations, no-go zones that exist to this day, and a government ban on fishing in a large, offshore area of the Pacific Ocean because of high levels of radioactive cesium in the water and in fish. The fishing industry there has yet to recover, more than seven years later.\n\n“The Mississippi and the Great Lakes — that would be really bad,” said Frank von Hippel, senior research physicist and professor of public and international affairs emeritus at Princeton University.\n\nAdded Jim Olson, environmental attorney and founder of the Traverse City-based nonprofit For Love of Water, or FLOW: “The fact that it’s on the shorelines of the Great Lakes takes that high consequence that would be anywhere and paints it red and puts exclamation marks around it.”\n\nSpent nuclear fuel is so dangerous that, a decade removed from a nuclear reactor, its radioactivity would still be 20 times the level that would kill a person exposed to it. Some radioactive byproducts of nuclear power generation remain a health or environmental hazard for tens of thousands of years. And even typically harmless radioactive isotopes that are easily blocked by skin or clothing can become extremely toxic if even small amounts are breathed in, eaten or drank, making their potential contamination of the Great Lakes — the drinking water supply to 40 million people — the connected Mississippi River and the prime agricultural areas of the U.S. a potentially frightening prospect.\n\nClick on map locations for nuclear site details:\n\nAll numbers approximate. U.S. site wet pool storage data from 2011; dry cask storage data from 2014, and may include some quantity of spent fuel listed as wet pool-stored in the 2011 survey. Sources: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, U.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. Department of Energy, Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission\n\nEstral Beach, an out-of-the-way neighborhood along western Lake Erie in Monroe County's Berlin Township, is literally in the shadow of the cooling towers of the Fermi 2 nuclear power plant, where more than 600 tons of spent nuclear fuel remains stored.\n\n\"I think it's a disgrace,\" said Ken Evanoff, who lives less than a mile from the reactor.\n\n\"All of us can complain about it, but there ain't nothing that's going to be done about it, in the long run. When is it going to change?\"\n\nA block closer to the plant in Estral Beach, Craig Borowski has lived with Fermi 2 out his window for three decades.\n\n\"It's always in the back of your mind,\" he said. \"It's like a war zone, and that waste is the collateral damage of our existence. It's the easiest path to take versus doing the right thing.\"\n\nFor five years, Michigan residents, lawmakers, environmental groups and others around the Midwest have, loudly and nearly unanimously, opposed a planned Canadian underground repository for low-to-medium radioactive waste at Kincardine, Ontario, near the shores of Lake Huron.\n\nMeanwhile, spent nuclear fuel, vastly more radioactive, sits not far from the shores of four Great Lakes — Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario — at 15 currently operating or former nuclear power plant sites on the U.S. side. In Michigan, that includes Fermi 2; the Donald C. Cook nuclear plant in Berrien County; the Palisades nuclear plant in Van Buren County, and the former Big Rock Point nuclear plant in Charlevoix County, which ceased operation in 1997 and where now only casks of spent nuclear fuel remain.\n\nNeither the U.S. nor the Canadian government has constructed a central collection site for the spent nuclear fuel. It’s not just a problem in the Great Lakes region — more than 88,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel, an amount that is rising, is stored at 121 U.S. locations across 39 states.\n\nStephen Tait is a spokesman for DTE Energy's Fermi 2 nuclear plant, where the stores of spent nuclear fuel near the shores of Lake Erie date to when the plant started commercial operation in 1988.\n\n“Our canisters and buildings are able to withstand the impacts of natural disasters, man-made objects, terrorist attacks, wide-bodied commercial aircraft impacts,” he said.\n\n“All of our used fuel is stored, maintained and protected with safety as our top priority.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpent nuclear fuel isn’t only radioactive, it continues to generate heat. It requires storage in pools with circulating water for typically five years before it can be moved into so-called dry-cask storage — concrete-and-steel obelisks where spent fuel rods receive continued cooling by circulating air.\n\nIn practice, however, because of the high costs associated with transferring waste from wet pools to dry casks, nuclear plants have kept decades worth of spent fuel in wet storage. Plant officials instead “re-rack” the pools, reconfiguring them to add more and more spent fuel, well beyond the capacities for which the pools were originally designed.\n\n“The prevailing practice in the United States is you re-rack the pools until they are just about as dense-packed as the nuclear core,” von Hippel said.\n\nOnly in recent years have nuclear plants stepped up the transition to dry cask storage because there’s no room left in the wet pools. Still, about two-thirds of on-site spent nuclear fuel remains in wet pools in the U.S.\n\nThat’s a safety concern, critics contend. A catastrophe or act of terrorism that drains a spent fuel pool could cause rising temperatures that could eventually cause zirconium cladding — special brackets that hold the spent fuel rods in bundles — to catch fire.\n\nSuch a disaster could be worse than a meltdown in a nuclear reactor, as spent nuclear fuel is typically stored with nowhere near the fortified containment of a reactor core.\n\n“The long-term land-contamination consequences of such an event could be significantly worse than those from Chernobyl,” a 2003 research paper by von Hippel and seven other nuclear experts stated.\n\nThe reference is to the worst nuclear power disaster in world history, the April 1986 reactor explosion at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the former Soviet Union, now a part of the Ukraine, where 4,000 to 90,000 are estimated to have died as a result of the radiation released. A study by the University of Exeter in Great Britain, released this June, found that cow’s milk from farms about 125 miles from the Chernobyl accident site still — more than 30 years later —- contains the radioactive element cesium at levels considered unsafe for adults and at more than seven times the limit unsafe for children.\n\nAllison Macfarlane, a professor of public policy and international affairs at George Washington University, served as chairman of the NRC during the Obama administration from July 2012 until December 2014.\n\n“What I think needs more examination is the practice of densely packing the fuel in the pool,” she said.\n\nThe NRC does not regulate how much fuel can be in a pool, in what configuration it’s placed, and how old the fuel is, Macfarlane said.\n\n“We did consider doing more study of this situation, what potential hazards may exist from densely packing spent nuclear fuel pools, and my colleagues declined to support me on that,\" she said.\n\n“What you worry about are the kinds of situations you can’t yet imagine — which is what happened at Fukushima.”\n\n\n\nOn March 11, 2011, following a magnitude-9.0 earthquake and an ensuing, 50-foot tsunami, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan lost cooling capabilities for four of its six reactors. The cores became damaged and radiation was released into the atmosphere, making it the world’s second-worst nuclear power industry accident after Chernobyl.\n\nBut it’s what happened — or almost happened — at the plant's Unit 4 spent-fuel pool that gives nuclear watchdogs nightmares.\n\nA hydrogen explosion four days into the disaster left the building housing the Unit 4 spent-fuel pool in ruins. The pool was seven stories up in a crumbling, inaccessible building.\n\nIt \"was so radioactive, you couldn’t put people up there,” von Hippel said. “For about a month after Fukushima, people didn’t know how much water was in the pool. They were shooting water up there haphazardly with a hose, trying to drop it by helicopter.\"\n\nTwo weeks after the earthquake and tsunami, the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission secretly conducted a worst-case scenario study of the ongoing disaster. The biggest fear that emerged: that a self-sustaining fire would start in the Unit 4 spent fuel pool, spreading to the nearby, damaged reactors. That, they found, would release radiation requiring evacuations as far away as 150 miles, to the outskirts of Tokyo and its more than 13.4 million residents.\n\n“That was the devil’s scenario that was on my mind,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said during a special commission’s 2014 investigation of the accident.\n\n“Common sense dictated that, if that came to pass, then it was the end of Tokyo.”\n\nThe worst-case-scenario report was not released for nearly a year. “The content was so shocking that we decided to treat it as if it didn’t exist,” the Japan Times quoted a senior Japanese government official as saying in January 2012.\n\nWhat kept the spent fuel rods covered with water in Unit 4 was a miraculous twist of fate: The explosion had jarred open a gate that typically separated the Unit 4 spent fuel pool from an adjacent reactor pool.\n\n“Leakage through the gate seals was essential for keeping the fuel in the Unit 4 pool covered with water,” a 2016 report on the Fukushima accident by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine concluded.\n\n“Had there been no water in the reactor well, there could well have been severe damage to the stored fuel and substantial releases of radioactive material to the environment.\"\n\nIt’s a startling “very near-miss,” said Gordon Thompson, executive director of the Institute for Resource and Security Studies in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\n“Given wind directions that are common in Japan, they could have been looking at removing the population of Tokyo for decades, or centuries,” he said. “You’re talking tens of millions of people that would have to relocate. That’s the bullet that Japan dodged.”\n\nFollowing Fukushima, the NRC required U.S. nuclear power plants to install instrumentation showing real-time water levels in spent-fuel pools even in the event of a power outage. Consideration was also given to speeding up transfer of spent-fuel from wet pools to dry casks, but NRC officials rejected that.\n\n\"In 2013, the staff evaluated whether there would be a significant enhancement to safety by expediting the transfer of fuel from pool to cask,\" NRC officials told the Free Press in an email. \"The conclusion was that the increase in safety would not be significant enough to warrant requiring expedited transfer. The timing of transfer to cask is therefore a business decision for the licensee rather than a safety issue.\"\n\nThe nuclear power industry and regulators “try to maintain that everything is safe and secure, and it’s really not,” said Kevin Kamps, a nuclear waste watchdog for the nonprofit Beyond Nuclear, an anti-nuclear power and weapon organization based in Maryland.\n\n“It’s incredibly irresponsible to keep these pools as jammed full as possible because of the risk it adds and because they’re going to have to empty these pools eventually, anyway.”\n\nAdded Thompson, “Even that realization about Japan has not budged the U.S. nuclear industry or the NRC’s willingness to tolerate the risk at nuclear plants.”\n\nThe U.S. nuclear industry sees Fukushima differently — in some ways as a success story.\n\n“At Fukushima, you not only had a tsunami, you blew up the buildings … and you still did not drain the pool,” said Rod McCullum, senior director for fuel and decommissioning at the Nuclear Energy Institute, the trade association for nuclear utilities in the U.S.\n\n“Those pools and those casks withstood explosions and earthquakes and tsunamis, all on the same day.”\n\nA scenario where a fire can occur by the draining of water from a spent-fuel pool “has never been demonstrated,” McCullum said. He noted safety measures added in the U.S. since Fukushima include the ability to provide extra pumps and water supplies, in minutes or hours, should a spent fuel pool become breached and lose water — even if the disaster required that the resources be brought in by air from farther away.\n\nBut McCullum also acknowledged the shock waves through the global nuclear power industry caused by the Japanese disaster.\n\n“After Fukushima, we never say anything is impossible,” he said.\n\n\n\nIt wasn’t supposed to be this way.\n\nAfter the U.S. dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in 1945, ushering the end of World War II, the U.S. military continued to experiment with bigger, more lethal nuclear bomb capabilities. But a simultaneous push also began to harness the “pollution-free” potential of nuclear power.\n\n“In the United States, when the nuclear industry was established in the 1950s and 1960s, the assumption was that the spent nuclear fuel would be reprocessed,” Thompson said.\n\nA plutonium reprocessing facility was opened in New York state in the early 1960s, operated for six years, and then folded amid skyrocketing costs and various mishaps. President Jimmy Carter banned reprocessing in 1977 because of the costs and concern about the proliferation of plutonium.\n\nCarter’s decision was the correct one, said Edwin Lyman, senior scientist in the Global Security Program at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. But “it did leave the utilities in a lurch,” eliminating a method they’d planned to use for dealing with their growing nuclear waste stockpiles.\n\nBy 1980, 77 nuclear power plants were storing increasing amounts of spent nuclear fuel on-site. Two years later, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in January 1983. It created a timetable and a procedure to create a permanent, underground, central disposal site for high-level radioactive waste. It also declared that the federal government would “take title” to all high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel at plant sites nationwide, and, in return for payment of fees by the industry, would dispose of the waste at a new, central repository site “beginning not later than Jan. 31, 1998.”\n\nAfter a few years of site evaluation, in December 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to designate one site, Yucca Mountain, Nevada, as the permanent, national nuclear waste repository location. Some called it the “Screw Nevada Bill,” Thompson said.\n\n“Very quickly, the political difficulties of developing a repository started becoming apparent,” he said. “The thinking was, ‘Nevada has a relatively small congressional contingent. There’s already a radioactive nuclear weapons test site there, anyway. Let’s just shove it there.’ All other options were then off the table.”\n\nNot surprisingly, Nevada fought back. The legal and political battle went on for more than a decade. The 1998 deadline for a repository came and went. In 2010, the U.S. Department of Energy under President Barack Obama ended its pursuit of a Yucca Mountain repository, amid pressure from powerful Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, who became Senate majority leader in 2007.\n\nBy 2014, having paid more than $39.8 billion in fees to the U.S. Nuclear Waste Fund, with no promised central repository taking away their still-rising stockpiles of spent fuel, nuclear utilities sued the federal government, and won a series of settlements.\n\n“Every day, the taxpayers of America are paying $2.2 million for keeping this spent nuclear fuel on nuclear power plant sites — over $800 million a year,\" McCullum said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration has signaled a willingness to revive the Yucca Mountain plan, but it remains more wish than near-reality.\n\n“The lesson we’ve learned is these projects take so long, you really can’t impose them on local populations,” von Hippel said. “You have to get consent.”\n\n\n\nIn August 2002, al-Jazeera reporter Yosri Fouda got an anonymous call offering him an incredible interview with two of the biggest fugitives from justice on the globe: al-Qaida leaders Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the so-called mastermind of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh.\n\nWrote London’s The Guardian about Fouda’s account at the time: “After two days in a run-down hotel (in Karachi, Pakistan), he was passed through a chain of people before being blindfolded, put in a car (trunk) and driven to an apartment building. He was taken to a flat strewn with laptop computers and mobile phones and occupied by two men whom he recognized as Bin al-Shibh and Mohammed.\n\nAmong the things Fouda said he learned in his interview: That the initial targets for what became the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks included two, unspecified U.S. nuclear power plants.\n\n\"It was decided to abandon nuclear targets for the moment,\" Fouda said Mohammed explained to him. \"I mean for the moment,\" Mohammed added.\n\nAl-Qaida leaders feared an attack on U.S. nuclear facilities “might get out of hand,” Fouda said he was told.\n\nNoted Kamps of the nonprofit Beyond Nuclear, “We’re relying on the moral restraint of a terrorist organization not to attack nuclear plants.”\n\nThat startling revelation was later amplified in the 9/11 Commission’s report, which not only noted Mohammed’s account, but that 9/11 ringleader and hijacker Mohammed Atta, in July 2001 meetings with Bin al-Shibh in Spain, “mentioned he had considered targeting a nuclear facility he had seen during familiarization flights near New York.”\n\nThe plan was ultimately scuttled because Atta “thought a nuclear target would be difficult because the airspace around it was restricted, making reconnaissance flights impossible and increasing the likelihood that any plane would be shot down before impact,\" the 9/11 Commission report states.\n\nEdwin Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists said the nuclear facility in question was probably Indian Point in New York, about 25 miles north of New York City. In an ironic twist, the supposed heightened security measures that discouraged Atta from a nuclear plant strike don’t exist, Lyman said.\n\n“In fact, there was no such protection,” he said. “There is no no-fly-zone around nuclear plants.”\n\nIt's still not an outright prohibition. After 9/11, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a \"notice-to-airmen\" stating: “In the interest of national security and to the extent practicable, pilots are strongly advised to avoid the airspace above, or in proximity to such sites as power plants (nuclear, hydro-electric, or coal), dams, refineries, industrial complexes, military facilities and other similar facilities. Pilots should not circle as to loiter in the vicinity over these types of facilities.”\n\nPersonnel at nuclear plants \"voluntarily report to us and to local law enforcement whenever they see a plane loitering in the vicinity,\" NRC spokesman David McIntyre told the Free Press. \"Such pilots may be greeted by local law enforcement upon landing and further advised not to fly over or loiter over a plant.\"\n\nThe policy also applies for remote-controlled drones, McIntyre said.\n\nIn a Great Lakes region where magnitude-9.0 earthquakes and tsunamis aren’t a potential threat to stockpiles of spent nuclear fuel, terrorism remains possible.\n\nThe NRC is understandably vague in its discussion of the nuclear power industry’s preparedness to thwart or withstand acts of terrorism — but asserts that facilities are, indeed, prepared. The agency has implemented security requirements for spent-fuel storage in accordance with a “design basis threat,” an outlined list of potential threats codified in U.S. law, including “a single group attacking through one entry point, multiple groups attacking through multiple entry points … well-trained (including military training and skills) and dedicated individuals, willing to kill or be killed.” The scenarios include land- or water-borne vehicles with bombs. Notably, they do not include attacks from the air.\n\n“We have highly trained and highly armed security forces at U.S. nuclear plants,” said McCullum of the Nuclear Energy Institute.\n\n“They actually drill this. Force on force. 'Mission Impossible'-type attacks on nuclear facilities and they have to defend them, again and again and again.\n\n“We don’t believe in magic. We believe in concrete and steel and gates and guns.”\n\nBut von Hippel, the senior research physicist and professor emeritus from Princeton University, has reviewed security preparedness at nuclear facilities — including the classified reports not available to the public — and has remaining concerns.\n\n“A previous National Academies study I reviewed (in 2006) pointed out a variety of different scenarios their security arrangements don’t cover,” he told the Free Press. “There were two versions of the report, one unclassified version, but specifics about the scenarios that were of concern were classified. We reviewed the issue again in 2016 and concluded they had not resolved the issues.”\n\nIt’s an economic issue, von Hippel said. Threats beyond those specifically listed \"would be up to the military, up to the federal government,\" he said.\n\n“How exactly is the government supposed to do that? I guess it’s really by intelligence. Because government isn’t there at the plant. Like we should have been able to do with 9/11, we should be able to see the threat coming. That’s the thinking.”\n\nAs spent nuclear fuel moves to dry casks, the threat of terrorism, while not heightened over wet pools, becomes a more particular focus, von Hippel said.\n\n“You worry more about terrorism and less about an accident with dry casks,” he said. “They’re air-cooled, passive, so there’s no machinery that can malfunction, no loss of coolant potential. You’re really worried about somebody blowing a hole into a dry cask and making sure the maximum amount of radioactivity comes out.”\n\nThompson, the executive director of the Institute for Resource and Security Studies at Cambridge, sees “a big void in national security planning” when it comes to terror threats at nuclear facilities.\n\n“The NRC’s position on beyond design basis threats is essentially that this is a matter for the national security apparatus — it’s not our job, so somebody else will take care of it,” he said. “But if you look at the Pentagon, Homeland Security, I think you will look in vain to find any part of that apparatus that is addressing that area that the NRC says is not its job.”\n\n\n\nAsk Zion, Illinois, Mayor Al Hill what the federal government’s broken promise on taking spent nuclear fuel away means in his community, and you’ll get an earful.\n\nAt the city of about 25,000 on the shores of Lake Michigan, 45 miles north of Chicago, just south of the Wisconsin border, twin reactors operated from 1968 to 1998. The facility shut down one year after Illinois deregulated electric utilities.\n\nThe community knew it had “unwritten understandings” with the nuclear facility, Hill said. Some were positive, some negative.\n\n“We knew we’d have an unsightly nuclear power plant sitting there for years and years,” he said. “It limited the recreation opportunities on the lakefront for residents and nonresidents.”\n\nIn return, the plant owner, ComEd, paid more than $19 million a year in taxes to the city, local schools, the park and library district, Hill said. The plant provided 800 jobs and a payroll of about $40 million.\n\nNow, with the plant gone and demolished, what remains is a field of concrete and steel obelisks, 65 in all, containing 2,226 spent nuclear fuel assemblies.\n\nNow there are no positives, only negatives, Hill said.\n\n“There was never an understanding, it was never part of the equation, that these spent-fuel rods were going to be here, and we were going to serve as a de facto interim nuclear storage facility,” he said.\n\nIt has “severely inhibited” economic development opportunities on the lakefront, Hill said.\n\n“I’ve been told on more than one occasion, when we’ve been trying to get somebody to develop here, that there’s no way they will come while that nuclear waste is still next door,” he said. “(They’ve said), ‘The perception is you guys all glow in the dark.’ ”\n\nChris Daisy owns Zion Cyclery, a bicycle shop on Sheridan Road in Zion a few blocks away from the dry casks of spent nuclear fuel. He says his business is an anomaly, doing well and bringing in customers from other, nearby cities.\n\n\"Our downtown, compared to other downtowns in the county, we're doing terribly,\" he said.\n\n\"There's zero foot traffic in Zion. There's absolutely no one walking downtown here during the day.\n\n\"We're basically turned into a de facto nuclear waste dump because what was promised to be taken out of here has never been taken out.\"\n\nWhile the federal government is paying nuclear utilities for its failure to develop a central repository for spent fuel, that money isn’t coming to communities like Zion, left holding the nuclear waste bag, Hill said.\n\n“This is where the spent fuel rods are going to be for the foreseeable future,” he said. “I understand there’s a movement afoot to get Yucca Mountain moving again. But that’s going to be a battle, and that’s going to take a lot of years.\n\n“Our position is, if we’re going to serve as a spent-fuel rod storage facility, we should be compensated. The federal government should be compensating us for that.”\n\nThe negative economic impact is only part of the concern, Daisy said. Always looming in the background, however remote the possibility might be, is the potential of the unimaginable.\n\n\"These days, in an age of terror attacks, you don't want a bunch of spent uranium sitting on the shore of Lake Michigan,\" he said. \"It doesn't make sense.\"\n\n\n\nBecause nuclear power is much more widely used in Canada — the province of Ontario alone has 20 nuclear reactors at three plants — it also generates much more nuclear waste.\n\nIn Ontario, nearly 52,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel is stored on-site at nuclear plants along Lakes Huron and Ontario.\n\n“There’s a huge amount of high-level, radioactive waste stored right along the water,” said Edwards, the president of the nonprofit Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility.\n\nLike the U.S., Canada is seeking a long-term storage solution that will involve a central underground repository. Unlike the U.S., the Canadian government is seeking willing hosts, promising jobs and economic activity. The Canadian Nuclear Waste Management Organization has trimmed a list of 22 interested communities down to five. Two of those finalists are on the shores of the Great Lakes: Huron-Kinloss and South Bruce, Ontario, near the Bruce nuclear reactor on Lake Huron, where a proposed underground storage facility for low-to-intermediate radioactive waste is already drawing controversy.\n\nFinal site selection is planned by 2023, with the underground spent nuclear fuel repository in operation by the 2040s, Ontario Power Generation officials said.\n\n“The current way to store (spent nuclear fuel) is safe, but it requires greater controls, such as a nuclear response force to ensure the safety of the facility, the safeguarding,” said Karine Glenn, director of the waste and decommissioning division of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission.\n\n“Internationally, the consensus has been that the best way to manage the fuel on a long-term basis — we’re talking thousands of years — is to put it in a repository and seal it off from human intrusion.”\n\n\n\nDespite a half-century of evidence to the contrary, the continued position of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is that highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel will not stay on-site at locations around the Great Lakes and elsewhere — it will be moved to that still-aspirational central repository, somewhere.\n\nInterim storage facilities have been recently proposed for west Texas and near Carlsbad, New Mexico. The proposed facility in Andrews, Texas, would hold about 44,000 tons of the waste, stored above ground and accepted in 5,000-ton phases. Officials predicted it could begin accepting waste by 2021.\n\nThe proposed southeast New Mexico facility would store up to 110,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel in underground storage casks meant to hold the waste for about 40 years, per the license application.\n\nBut many hurdles remain, and some question whether yet another temporary solution helps much.\n\nEven if a central repository is one day approved, another complication arises — how to get two generations of the most dangerous industrial waste man has ever created from sites all over the country to one point.\n\n“You can’t just wave a magic wand and teleport the wastes out to New Mexico — that’s going to take 50 years,” said Kamps, the radioactive waste analyst with the nonprofit Beyond Nuclear.\n\nCritics, with gallows humor, have dubbed the years of required trips down highways and railways “Mobile Chernobyl.”\n\n“We would be transporting this stuff for decades over road and railways,” Edwards said. “It would make the potential for problems and accidental release even worse.”\n\nEdwards' proposed solution: Pulling the waste away from shorelines, and encasing it in much more hardened, protective enclosures, and monitoring it appropriately.\n\nNo nuclear power-using country, anywhere in the world, has yet successfully built and used a long-term, underground repository for spent nuclear fuel.\n\n“It’s true that we have to do something with the waste of some sort,” Edwards said. “But it’s not true that we have a solution. We have ideas of how we might possibly handle it. But we don’t know if that’s really going to be effective.”\n\nGermany, in the 1980s, tried using an abandoned salt and potash mine to store barrels of nuclear waste over 30 years, the Asse II mine. It’s now prompting a cleanup that may take 30 years and cost nearly $12 billion U.S. dollars. The government has disputed the contention of workers at the mine that they were exposed to excessive levels of radiation, causing an unusual number of cancers.\n\nMeanwhile, many U.S. nuclear plants are reaching their designed lifespans, and with wind and solar increasingly competitive as energy sources, utilities are taking hard looks at whether to stay in the nuclear business.\n\nNuclear power is projected to drop as a percentage of the world’s power generation mix from 10 percent in 2017 to just 5.6 percent by 2050, a report issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency this summer found.\n\nThat could mean more communities hosting casks of dry-stored spent nuclear fuel, and nothing else. If central repository solutions aren’t found, within years, the re-licensing of some early dry-cask storage facilities will come into play, as they meet a lifespan they were never expected to reach.\n\n“The age of nuclear power is winding down, but the age of nuclear waste is just beginning,” Edwards said.\n\nContact Keith Matheny: 313-222-5021 or kmatheny@freepress.com.

Mario M. Cuomo Bridge and past New York City on the way to the seaport in New Jersey.\n\nThere, cement-and-steel casks of spent fuel, weighing as much as 100 tons, would be placed on rail cars for the 2,600-mile trip west to Yucca Mountain.\n\nWhen the idea was first broached, state and local officials railed against the thought of nuclear waste floating down the Hudson.\n\n“Any plan that involves the shipping of nuclear waste on a barge down the river past New York City raises enormous health, environmental and security concerns,” said then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-NY.\n\nFormer New Jersey Sen. Robert Torricelli also noted that New Jersey ports shouldn’t be used “as rest stops for nuclear material.”\n\nNew momentum for the plan\n\nMore than a decade later, the debate has taken on greater urgency. As more and more nuclear power plants either shut down or announce plans to close — victims of the cheap price of abundant natural gas — communities are anxious to get rid of spent fuel so they can find new uses for valuable property on waterfront locales that include the Pacific Coast, the Connecticut River and the Hudson River.\n\nThey accuse the federal government of failing to make good on a decades-old promise to find a place for the nation’s nuclear waste and say they should be compensated for being turned into “de-facto” nuclear storage sites.\n\nAmong them is Buchanan Mayor Theresa Knickerbocker, who holds out little hope that the political hurdles to shipping nuclear waste out of Indian Point can be overcome.\n\n“Everyone is going to push back,” Knickerbocker said. “You’re going to get a lot of political pushback. It’s known as NIMBY (Not In My Backyard). If they haven’t resolved this in 30 years, you have to move on.”\n\nThe hardest pushback has come from Nevada, which has argued that the transportation of nuclear waste exposes communities across the country to unhealthy amounts of radiation.\n\nWhen then-President George W. Bush designated Yucca as a repository in February 2002, a few months after the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center, then-Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman told the Los Angeles Times that sending waste to Nevada will expose “millions of Americans in 43 states to potential nuclear holocaust.”\n\n“All it takes is one terrorist with a TOW (anti-tank) missile obtained on the black market to take out a truck carrying this deadly substance, and we get Chernobyl in our backyard,” Goodman told the Los Angeles Times in February 2002. “This is the stuff of our worst nightmares.”\n\nEnergy Secretary Spencer Abraham countered, saying moving fuel by truck and rail was a better alternative to having it sitting in communities around the U.S.\n\nBarge versus Tappan Zee\n\nSpearheading Nevada’s opposition for nearly three decades has been Robert Halstead, the executive director of Nevada’s Agency for Nuclear Project in Gov. Brian Sandoval’s office. Halstead cites statistics suggesting that spent nuclear fuel would travel through 330 congressional districts in 44 states on the road to Yucca.\n\n“We don’t have as many railroads as we used to have, so we’ve got a few that go cross country and they go through downtown Chicago, they go through downtown Salt Lake City,” Halstead said. “They go through downtown everywhere, just about, so the rail shipments really have a problem avoiding things.”\n\nSome 15 years ago, Halstead traveled to Westchester County for a look at some of the proposed routes spent fuel would take out of Indian Point.\n\n“At one point DOE had a plan on the table to make truck shipments out of Indian Point across the Tappan Zee Bridge,” Halstead said. “How crazy is that? That’s why they ended up considering a barge option.”\n\nThe precise transportation routes are still being studied, according to a follow-up to the 2002 DOE report released in 2008. That report designated rail cars as the preferred mode of transport and barges as an option for removing fuel from Indian Point and other facilities without access to rail. Instead of the Port of Jersey City, it designates the Port of Newark, some 55 miles away, as the site for loading the fuel onto railcars.\n\nA DOE spokesman could not be reached for comment on why the port changed but, the 2008 report notes, the DOE considered a number of locations for the transfer to railcars.\n\nManna Jo Greene, the environmental director of Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, a watchdog group, questioned whether the canisters used to transport fuel out of Indian Point will be robust enough to withstand a mishap.\n\n“I am aware that most of the nuclear facilities around the country want the waste off site but that is a double-edged sword in terms of the safety considerations about transportation,” Greene said.\n\nRichard Webster, the legal director of Riverkeeper, the Hudson River environmental group, said that, with the uncertainty over naming a repository, the focus should be on improving or \"hardening\" on-site storage.\n\n“It’s always about to happen and nothing happens,” Webster said. “All they really need to do is make sure fuel can be stored safely on the site.”\n\nIndian Point's fuel problem\n\nAt Indian Point, some 1,100 spent fuel assemblies are already stored in 34 cement casks on a cement pad on site and more will be added in the years to come after they are cooled in pools located next to the plant's two reactors.\n\nGreene thinks more could be done to disperse the casks of spent fuel across Indian Point's entire 240-acre property so they’re not lined up like “bowling pins” on a pad. But such a plan would likely render the rest of the property unusable, a prospect that doesn’t sit well with communities around Indian Point looking for ways to generate revenue from the site.\n\nBuchanan and the Town of Cortlandt, together with the Hendrick Hudson School District, stand to lose $32 million in annual tax revenues in the years after 2021, when Indian Point’s two reactors will be shut down.\n\n“We don’t want it ever to become a distressed community,” Cortlandt Supervisor Linda Puglisi said at a meeting of the Indian Point Task Force last month.\n\nCLOSING: After Indian Point, where will we get electricity?\n\nTHE STORY: Indian Point to close by 2021 under deal\n\nENTERGY: Costly litigation a factor in shutdown decision\n\nNevada opposes Yucca\n\nIn 2002, Bush selected Yucca Mountain as the nation’s first geologic repository for nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The decision followed years of study at a cost of $15 billion, most of that financed by surcharges in the electric bills of U.S. ratepayers.\n\nIt produced a 2002 report so meticulously detailed that the DOE calculated the number of nuclear fuel shipments needed to remove spent fuel from each power plant and just how many kilometers each would travel over urban, suburban or rural terrain.\n\nFrom New York’s three upstate nuclear power plants – R.E. Ginna, Nine Mile Point and James A. FitzPatrick – more than 230 shipments of spent fuel would travel by rail through Pennsylvania and Ohio before heading west 2,500 miles.\n\nOnce at Yucca Mountain, a 150,000-acre site where the average annual precipitation is seven inches, tens of thousands of metric tons of spent nuclear fuel would be entombed in underground tunnels so that decaying radioactive isotopes could cool down over the course of thousands of years.\n\nNevada, led by then-Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid, railed against the Yucca plan and in 2010 the Obama administration withdrew an application to license Yucca that was before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nBut in June, a bill to restart the Yucca licensing process, sponsored by Illinois Rep. John Shimkus, a Republican, passed the House Energy and Commerce committee by a 49-4 vote and could come up for a house vote as soon as this month.\n\nPHOTO GALLERY: Tour Yucca Mountain\n\nThe Trump administration has set aside $110 million to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process and another $10 million to develop interim storage facilities.\n\nMuch is on the line.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office says the nation’s inventory of spent nuclear fuel is growing by 2,200 metric tons a year and is expected to total nearly 140,000 metric tons by 2067.\n\nKeeping the fuel where it is has proved costly.\n\nThe federal government has already paid out more than $6 billion to compensate the owners of commercial reactors for reneging on a promise to take their waste by 1998. That figure is expected to grow by another $25 billion. In March, the state of Texas sued the DOE to force the agency it to live up to its promise to open Yucca.\n\nPlant closings challenge small towns\n\nSmall towns in Vermont, Illinois and Wisconsin that once benefited from millions of dollars in property taxes generated by nuclear power plants are trying to come up with ways to close gaping holes in their budgets.\n\nSeveral have thrown their support behind a bill in Congress that would set aside $100 million to compensate communities that are home to spent nuclear fuel until a permanent repository is opened.\n\nAfter 30 years of false starts, groups on both sides of the debate question whether Yucca will ever open. Congressional watchdogs say that even if the House backs the Shimkus bill, success is not assured in the Senate. A companion bill has yet to be introduced.\n\nThey are, however, encouraged by the possibility of a compromise in the form of an interim storage site in New Mexico. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is considering a license application submitted by New Jersey-based Holtec to develop the site. Shimkus’ bill provides at least $50 million in funding for a single interim site for the years 2020-2025.\n\n“I’m hoping this bill is the start of a grand legislative compromise,” said Rod McCullum, the point person on used fuel issues for the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade group for the owners of the nation’s commercial reactors. “The government is bleeding a ton of money in liability for not doing anything. But as you see plants like Vermont Yankee and Dover, Indian Point and Oyster Creek shut down, you’re seeing a lot more interest in moving used fuel.”\n\nA looming transportation issue\n\nCritics are concerned that even if a repository were to open in the next few years, little planning has gone into developing costly transportation routes.\n\nShimkus’ bill does not directly address the transportation issue except to require that any route to Yucca not pass through Las Vegas.\n\nAt a hearing last month, David Victor, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, urged members of a House subcommittee investigating the spent fuel issue to address the transportation issue.\n\n“Under plausible yet optimistic scenarios, (interim storage) facilities could be open in the early 2020’s,” said Victor, who chairs a community panel overseeing the decommissioning process for the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) in San Diego. “Spent fuel at SONGS (and many other sites) would be ready for shipment then. It would be a pity if all the work done to open storage and permanent disposal facilities falters for lack of attention to transportation.”\n\nSan Onofre shut down in 2012, leaving tens of thousands of spent fuel rods on a site overlooking the Pacific Coast.\n\n“For years, Yucca Mountain has been a political lightning rod in ways that made it exceptionally difficult – at times, impossible – to move forward with that site,” Victor said. “The prospect of consolidated interim storage might prove politically more tractable because, when combined with consent-based siting, it allows communities to nominate themselves to become storage sites.”\n\nCalifornia Rep. Darrell Issa, a Republican whose district includes San Onofre, co-sponsored the Shimkus bill and is a proponent of interim storage.\n\n“I know for an absolute certainty taxpayers are already on the hook at this point for tens of billions of dollars over the next century, but this is a 10,000-year problem in need of a low-cost, safe solution,” Issa said at last month’s House hearing.\n\n'Screw Nevada 2'\n\nAnti-nuclear groups fear that putting nuclear waste on the nation’s rails and rivers will expose greater numbers of people to dangerous amounts of radiation. They say creating interim sites will only exacerbate the problem since, eventually, the fuel will need to go to a permanent site.\n\n\"Moving it twice really doesn't make sense,\" said Greene, Clearwater's environmental director.\n\nThe Maryland-based anti-nuclear group, Beyond Nuclear, has countered the Shimkus’ bill by highlighting the impact it could have on communities across the U.S.\n\n“We used to use the slogan ‘When it comes to nuclear waste transportation, we all live in Nevada,’” said Kamps. “Most of the country is going to be impacted by these shipments whether it’s by rail, truck or barge.\"\n\nHalstead recently reprised a phrase adopted decades ago when Nevada was trying to head off plans for Yucca Mountain.\n\n“They hate it when I say this is ‘Screw Nevada 2’,” Halstead says.\n\nNuke fuel movements\n\nNuclear Energy Institute's McCullum says he's unpersuaded by such arguments. He says hundreds of shipments of Navy fuel have criss-crossed the country for decades on the way to sites in Georgia and Idaho.\n\nThe NRC says 1,300 spent fuel shipments have been completed safely in the United States over the past 35 years. Four were involved in accidents but none resulted in the release of radioactive material, the commission notes.\n\n“Transportation as a problem is really a red herring,” McCullum said. “It’s something that the anti-nuclear establishment and to an extent the Nevada opposition has used as a lever to try to gain support. Certainly, if you’re going to vote against Yucca Mountain because Harry Reid is the Senate Majority leader and you don’t want to tell your constituents you’re voting to strand nuclear waste in your community, you’re going to explain your vote by saying ‘Well I don’t think the transportation is safe.’ That’s politics.”\n\nThe NRC, which regulates civilian use of radioactive materials, works closely with the Department of Transportation to coordinate a plan for the safe transport of spent fuel. It requires that casks be constructed with walls of steel and shielding materials five to 15 inches thick and be able to survive tests involving impact, puncture, fire and submersion in water. Rail containers can weigh as much as 150 tons and can carry up to 20 tons of spent fuel.\n\nA 2016 study done for the DOE by Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee found that there have been 25,400 shipments – totaling roughly 87,000 metric tons – of spent fuel worldwide without injury or loss of life due to radioactive material.\n\nMeantime, as the debate over a permanent repository continues in Congress, Puglisi and others are pushing for state legislation that would give towns the ability to tax spent fuel.\n\n“We need to be able to assess them as a ratable,” Puglisi said during the task force meeting last month.\n\nAssemblywoman Sandy Galef, D-Ossining, is drafting a bill that would allow towns to classify spent fuel rods as real property for taxing purposes.\n\n“Having the spent fuel there intrudes on our ability to use the site for other uses,” Galef said. “I think the people who live around the plant would like it to disappear and go someplace else.”\n\n2002 Dept of Energy Report on Spent Nuclear Fuel Transportation (PDF)\n\n2002 Dept of Energy Report on Spent Nuclear Fuel Transportation (Text) \">2002 Department of Energy Report on Spent Nuclear Fuel Transportation\n\n2002 Final Environmental Impact Statement on Yucca Mountain (Summary)\n\n2008 US Department of Energy Supplemental Report on Spent Nuclear Fuel Transportation", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/15/stanislaw-burzynski-cancer-controversy/2994561/", "title": "Doctor accused of selling false hope to families", "text": "Liz Szabo\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLINDEN, N.J. — On the last day of his life, Josia Cotto's parents gave him a choice.\n\nThe 6-year-old boy had been fighting an inoperable brain tumor for 10 months. When his mother, Niasia Cotto, found him in his bed, unresponsive and unable to open his eyes, \"we knew there was nothing else that we could do,\" she said.\n\nAn ambulance took Josia to a hospice room at a local hospital. His parents covered him in a soft, blue-and-white blanket, hugged him and held his small hand for the last time.\n\n\"We told him the choice was his, whether to keep fighting or be in peace with God,\" said his mother. \"He chose.\"\n\nJosia's parents would have paid any price to save him.\n\nA Texas doctor, two months, earlier, had given them one: $25,000 upfront, by cash or check.\n\nClinging to hope, the Linden, N.J., couple took Josia to see Stanislaw Burzynski, a Houston doctor claiming to be able to do what no one else can: cure inoperable pediatric brainstem tumors.\n\nVirtually any other doctor might have recited the same sad statistics: Although doctors can now cure 83% of pediatric cancers in the U.S., there is usually no hope for kids with Josia's tumor. Perhaps 5% survive five years.\n\nBurzynski — an internist with no board certification or formal training in oncology — has said publicly that he can cure half of the estimated 200 children a year diagnosed with brainstem tumors. The Cottos were told that treatment could cost over $100,000, mostly out of pocket, because insurance plans often refuse to cover Burzynski Clinic treatments.\n\nBurzynski, 70, calls his drugs \"antineoplastons\" and says he has given them to more than 8,000 patients since 1977.\n\nHe originally synthesized these sodium-rich drugs from blood and urine — the urine collected from public parks, bars and penitentiaries. Although they've been made in a lab since 1980, they still carry a distinctive and unpleasant odor. And while the experimental drugs have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, Burzynski has described them like the holy grail of cancer therapy: safe, natural and highly effective. He has also prescribed them as a treatment for AIDS, lupus and other conditions.\n\nSome patients are convinced that he saved their lives.\n\nMary Jo Siegel of Ventura, Calif., says she believes Burzynski cured her lymphoma. James Treadwell from Coronado, Calif., credits Burzynski with curing his brain tumor. Jenny Gettino of Syracuse, N.Y., says Burzynski cured her daughter of an infant brain tumor.\n\nYet the National Cancer Institute says there is no evidence that Burzynski has cured a single patient, or even helped one live longer. He has not backed up his claims by publishing results from a randomized, controlled trial — considered the gold standard of medical evidence — in a respected, peer-reviewed journal.\n\nAnd Burzynski's drugs pose a risk of serious harm, including coma, swelling near the brain and death, according to the NCI and informed consent documents that patients sign before beginning treatment. While Burzynski has touted his treatments as an alternative to chemotherapy, a 1999 NCI study found that antineoplastons can cause many of the same side effects as conventional chemo: nausea, vomiting, headaches, muscle pain, confusion and seizures.\n\nMany blame the system for failing to protect patients.\n\n\"He's a snake oil salesman,\" says pediatric oncologist Peter Adamson, a professor of pediatrics and pharmacology at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"This has gone on for so many years, it's really unbelievable.\"\n\nFor 36 years, critics say, Burzynski has been selling false hope to desperate families at the most vulnerable time of their lives.\n\n\"When you want so hard to believe something, you end up listening to your heart and not your head,\" says Lisa Merritt of Armuchee, Ga., whose husband, Wayne, was treated briefly by Burzynski in 2009. The couple say that Burzynski misled them about the type of treatment that would be offered, as well as the cost. Burzynski, she says, is \"the worst kind of predator.\"\n\nThere are many reasons why Burzynski has been able to stay in business so long. He has benefited from state laws that limit the Texas Medical Board's authority to remove his license, as well as the ability of terminally ill patients to collect damages. His devoted followers are willing to fight for him. He also has exploited the public's growing fascination with alternative medicine and suspicion of the medical establishment.\n\nAt times, Burzynski also has had an especially influential ally: the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nFDA CHANGES COURSE\n\nAlthough \"there were some stormy relations with the FDA\" in the past, Burzynski said in an interview, \"now, we have a productive relationship.\"\n\nFor years, the FDA tried to prevent Burzynski from prescribing unapproved drugs.\n\nIn 1995, a federal grand jury indicted Burzynski on 75 felony charges, including criminal contempt, mail fraud and violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. As a condition of his bail, a judge ordered him to stop prescribing antineoplastons. For a time, it looked as if Burzynski might never treat another patient.\n\nDozens of Burzynski's patients flocked to Washington to defend him, arguing that taking away antineoplastons was akin to a death sentence. Siegel, who credits Burzynski with curing her lymphoma 22 years ago, has testified on his behalf five times — once at his criminal trial and four times at hearings on Capitol Hill.\n\nFacing both a political and public relations firestorm, the FDA in 1996 abruptly changed course. It offered to allow Burzynski to continue treating patients, but only through an official trial.\n\n\"With one stroke of the pen, the FDA made legal what it had previously said was illegal,\" says Burzynski's attorney, Richard Jaffe.\n\nYet even Jaffe has acknowledged that the trial — now in its 17th year — was more about politics than science. In his 2008 memoirs, Galileo's Lawyer, Jaffe called it \"a joke.\"\n\n\"It was all an artifice, a vehicle we and the FDA created to legally give the patients Burzynski's treatment,\" Jaffe said.\n\n\"With political help, you can get the FDA to say yes,\" says Siegel, 63.\n\nThe indictments led to two trials. In 1997, one of Burzynski's criminal trials ended in a hung jury; the other, an acquittal.\n\nToday, the FDA refuses to comment on Burzynski.\n\nNO NEW DRUG APPLICATION\n\nEven his staunchest supporters wonder why Burzynski's drugs are nowhere close to receiving FDA approval.\n\n\"He's curing cancer,\" says Siegel, who co-founded the Burzynski Patient Group to spread the word about his therapies. \"So why, why won't the FDA approve it?\"\n\nLike many of Burzynski's supporters, Siegel suspects that the medical community and drug industry are aligned against him.\n\n\"Why does a doctor who can produce such extraordinary results continue to be attacked today?\" Siegel asks. \"The reason is because Dr. Burzynski and his patented discovery pose the greatest threat to an entrenched medical monopoly.\"\n\nIn fact, the FDA hasn't had a chance to approve Burzynski's drugs. He has never officially asked.\n\nAlthough Burzynski said he has completed 14 intermediate-phase studies, he has yet to file a new drug application, the final step toward getting a drug approved.\n\nThat hasn't stopped Burzynski from using his relationship with the FDA to recruit patients.\n\nStacey Huntington says she took her daughter to see Burzynski last year partly because the FDA's oversight made his therapies seem safer and more promising. \"My fear took us to Houston, and the hope he gave us made us proceed,\" says Huntington, of Chehalis, Wash.\n\nIn an interview, Burzynski said developing new drugs is complex and takes time.\n\nYet the FDA has approved 108 cancer drugs since Burzynski began his trial.\n\nCure rates for one type of pediatric brain tumor — medulloblastoma — are now 85%, according to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. Doctors can cure 95% of kids with Hodgkin lymphoma (a cancer of the lymph system), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (a blood cancer) and retinoblastoma (an eye tumor).\n\nFran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, describes the FDA's tolerance of Burzynski as \"outrageous.\"\n\n\"They have put people at risk for a long time,\" says Visco, an attorney and breast cancer survivor. \"That's completely unacceptable. How can anyone look at these facts and believe that there is a real clinical trial going on ... rather than just using the FDA and the clinical trial system to make money?\"\n\nBurzynski dismisses criticism of his work, referring to his detractors as \"hooligans\" and \"hired assassins.\"\n\nAs for criticism from former patients, Burzynski says, \"We see patients from various walks of life. We see great people. We see crooks. We have prostitutes. We have thieves. We have mafia bosses. We have Secret Service agents. Many people are coming to us, OK? Not all of them are the greatest people in the world. And many of them would like to get money from us. They pretend they got sick and they would like to extort money from us.\"\n\nHistory will vindicate him, Burzynski says, just as it has vindicated other persecuted medical \"pioneers,\" such as Louis Pasteur. In the future, Burzynski says, everyone will use his therapies, and the cancer treatments used today — such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation — will be regarded as barbaric. \"There will be a time when people will see the light,\" he says, \"and our treatments will be used by everyone.\"\n\nFDA IMPOSES NEW RESTRICTIONS\n\nThe FDA's patience with Burzynski apparently wore out after Josia died.\n\nIn a report sent to the FDA after the boy's death, Burzynski's staff acknowledged that his last blood sample, taken the day he passed away,showed a blood sodium level of 205 millimoles per liter, a level that is typically fatal. Burzynski's staff blamed that reading on a \"false laboratory report based on a contaminated sample.\"\n\nYet hypernatremia is one of antineoplastons' most common side effects, known to doctors for two decades.\n\nOne of Burzynski's own informed consent documents — the form that patients sign before they begin treatment — put the risk at 21%.\n\nOn July 30, 2012 — six weeks after Josia's death — the FDA forbade Burzynski from giving antineoplastons to any new children.\n\nSix months later, the FDA expanded its \"partial clinical hold,\" forbidding Burzynski from giving the drugs to new adult patients, according to the Burzynski Research Institute's 2013 filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. About 10 patients who were already receiving antineoplastons were allowed to continue, to avoid interruption of care.\n\nAccording to FDA inspections performed after Josia's death, Burzynski has failed to report at least 18 hypernatremia cases.\n\nThe FDA publicly announced the restrictions on Burzynski's clinical trial for the first time in September.\n\nAccording to the FDA, the Burzynski institutional review board — an outside body charged with protecting patients — failed that most basic duty. In a letter announcing the restrictions, the agency said it has \"no assurance\" that the board was \"adequately protecting the rights and welfare of the human subjects.\"\n\nThe FDA based its decision on \"objectionable conditions\" and a \"continuing pattern of deficiencies found during the last three inspections,\" the letter said.\n\nFDA inspectors also faulted Burzynski personally, as principal investigator of the study, according to inspections conducted from January to March. Copies of these reports were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. Addressing Burzynski, the inspectors wrote, \"you failed to protect the rights, safety and welfare of subjects under your care.\"\n\nInspectors charged Burzynski, as principal investigator, with a variety of other serious offenses, some dating to 2001. Among them:\n\n• Inflating success rates in 67% of cases, by inaccurately reporting how tumors responded to treatment.\n\n• Destroying patients' original records.\n\n• Failing to report \"unanticipated problems\" to the institutional review board — sometimes for six or seven years.\n\nIn the inspections conducted this spring, officials noted four cases from 1998 or 1999 in which patients were hospitalized for serious issues — such as pneumonia, lack of consciousness or bleeding in the skull — that Burzynski researchers failed to report until 2005. The FDA found similar problems in a 2001 inspection, when officials noted that Burzynski failed to report problems such as pneumonia, blood infections and pancreatitis, a life-threatening inflammation of the pancreas.\n\n• Failing to protect patients from overdosing.\n\nForty-eight patients suffered a total of 102 drug overdoses from 2005 to 2013.\n\nWhile the overdoses made some of these patients excessively sleepy, one had a seizure and another was hospitalized in intensive care with a breathing tube.\n\nThis represents a continuing problem, dating to reports of overdoses in inspections as early as 2001.\n\nBurzynski's review board also repeatedly rubber-stamped his requests to give patients antineoplastons outside of a clinical trial, the FDA's September letter suggests. In some cases, those decisions were made without consulting patients' medical records, or were made not by oncologists, but by a single member of the board, a \"water rehabilitation\" specialist with no medical training.\n\nAlthough researchers do sometimes provide experimental drugs outside of clinical trials, exceptions should be rare, with perhaps one or two cases per trial, Adamson says. In Burzynski's case, these \"compassionate use\" exceptions were common, FDA records show.\n\nEnrolling patients for compassionate use can be lucrative. Although researchers cannot charge for experimental drugs, Burzynski does bill patients for related supplies and services.\n\nIn Burzynski's defense, Jaffe notes that inspection reports represent preliminary findings. The FDA has not yet issued final conclusions.\n\nAnd Burzynski has taken issue with many of the FDA's findings.\n\nIn his written response about the FDA's claims that he inflated his success rates, Burzynski said that he \"complied with all criteria for evaluation of response and made accurate assessments for tumor response.\"\n\nAs for overdoses, Burzynski said in an interview that his staff works hard to train patients and their families to administer antineoplastons correctly.\n\nNone of the overdoses was fatal, he said.\n\n\"The amount of medication that these patients receive is not dangerous,\" Burzynski said. \"At worst, they would sleep for a few hours.\"\n\nVisco, the breast cancer advocate, says she's encouraged to hear that the FDA has put Burzynski's trial on hold.\n\n\"It is about time that the FDA stepped in to stop Burzynski from subjecting more patients to harm,\" she says. \"I do not know why it took so long.\"\n\nBURZYNSKI STILL HAS OPTIONS\n\nThe FDA can't put Burzynski out of business. No matter what happens to his trial, Burzynski holds a license to practice medicine in Texas.\n\nSo does his son, Gregory Burzynski, a doctor who's helping to carry on his father's business. As vice president of the Burzynski Clinic, his son, 34, works closely with his father and \"oversees many operations\" of the clinic, according to its website.\n\nThese days, doctors at the Burzynski Clinic are looking beyond antineoplastons. They mostly prescribe chemotherapy.\n\nThat's a huge shift. During Burzynski's criminal trial in the 1990s, patients who rallied to his defense carried signs reading, \"Say No to Chemo.\"\n\nBut the Texas Medical Board, which has repeatedly tried and failed to put Burzynski out of business over the years, still questions Burzynski's care.\n\nThe board charged Burzynski in 2010 with violating state medical standards by prescribing legal cancer drugs in \"random\" and unapproved combinations, with no known benefits but clear harms.\n\nBurzynski got those charges dropped in 2012, by successfully arguing that he didn't sign any of the prescriptions in question.\n\nBurzynski is scheduled to go before the medical board again in January, based on a complaint filed by Stacey Huntington, whose daughter was treated with antineoplastons for a brain tumor. At the meeting, a board panel \"will hear the case and make recommendation to the full board about what disciplinary action, if any, is appropriate.\"\n\nHuntington, who paid Burzynski nearly $34,000 for about six weeks of care, says she's concerned about both billing irregularities and the quality of her daughter's treatment. Her daughter, Abra Hall, 27, developed a life-threatening blood infection called sepsis after leaving the clinic to continue treatment at home. The infection developed in a catheter in Hall's chest, which was used to administer the antineoplastons, Huntington says. One month after developing sepsis, Hall was hospitalized again with a lung infection. Hall also developed serious complications from high doses of steroids, Huntington says.\n\nHuntington says she decided to speak out to prevent other families from being taken advantage of.\n\n\"When you get a diagnosis of cancer, you are pretty vulnerable,\" she says. \"I think they take advantage of that.\"\n\nCOTTOS NOT SURE WHAT TO THINK\n\nNo one told Josia's parents about any of this.\n\nNot Burzynski. Not the FDA.\n\nJose and Niasia Cotto had no idea that their son's death prompted an investigation by the FDA, until they were contacted by USA TODAY.\n\nThe Cottos had long believed that Burzynski could have cured their son if only they had taken Josia to see him first, before giving him radiation and chemotherapy. They had even hoped to launch a non-profit, A Life for Josia Foundation, to help other children with cancer gain access to Burzynski's treatment.\n\nNow, they don't know what to think.\n\nAlthough more than a year has passed since they lost their son, the Cottos say they see reminders of him everywhere. Niasia, 32, says she feels his presence in simple things, such as the light of a bright star on a dark night.\n\n\"He's still with us,\" says Jose, 33. \"I know God had his plan and his purpose for Josia.\"\n\nContact Szabo: lszabonull@usatodaynull.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/16/us/alaska-snow-crab-harvest-canceled-climate/index.html", "title": "Alaska: Billions of snow crabs have disappeared from the waters of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Alaska snow crab harvest has been canceled for the first time ever after billions of the crustaceans have disappeared from the cold, treacherous waters of the Bering Sea in recent years.\n\nThe Alaska Board of Fisheries and North Pacific Fishery Management Council announced last week that the population of snow crab in the Bering Sea fell below the regulatory threshold to open up the fishery.\n\nBut the actual numbers behind that decision are shocking: The snow crab population shrank from around 8 billion in 2018 to 1 billion in 2021, according to Benjamin Daly, a researcher with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.\n\n“Snow crab is by far the most abundant of all the Bering Sea crab species that is caught commercially,” Daly told CNN. “So the shock and awe of many billions missing from the population is worth noting – and that includes all the females and babies.”\n\nThe Bristol Bay red king crab harvest will also be closed for the second year in a row, the agencies announced.\n\nOfficials cited overfishing as their rationale for canceling the seasons. Mark Stichert, the groundfish and shellfish fisheries management coordinator with the state’s fish and game department, said that more crab were being fished out of the oceans than could be naturally replaced.\n\n“So there were more removals from the population than there were inputs,” Stichert explained at Thursday’s meeting.\n\nBetween the surveys conducted in 2021 and 2022, he said, mature male snow crabs declined about 40%, with an estimated 45 million pounds left in the entire Bering Sea.\n\n“It’s a scary number, just to be clear,” Stichert said.\n\nBut calling the Bering Sea crab population “overfished” – a technical definition that triggers conservation measures – says nothing about the cause of its collapse.\n\n“We call it overfishing because of the size level,” Michael Litzow, the Kodiak lab director for NOAA Fisheries, told CNN. “But it wasn’t overfishing that caused the collapse, that much is clear.”\n\nLitzow says human-caused climate change is a significant factor in the crabs’ alarming disappearance.\n\nSnow crabs are cold-water species and found overwhelmingly in areas where water temperatures are below 2 degrees Celsius, Litzow says. As oceans warm and sea ice disappears, the ocean around Alaska is becoming inhospitable for the species.\n\n“There have been a number of attribution studies that have looked at specific temperatures in the Bering Sea or Bering Sea ice cover in 2018, and in those attribution studies, they’ve concluded that those temperatures and low-ice conditions in the Bering sea are a consequence of global warming,” Litzow said.\n\nTemperatures around the Arctic have warmed four times faster than the rest of the planet, scientists have reported. Climate change has triggered a rapid loss in sea ice in the Arctic region, particularly in Alaska’s Bering Sea, which in turn has amplified global warming.\n\n“Closing the fisheries due to low abundance and continuing research are the primary efforts to restore the populations at this point,” Ethan Nichols, an assistant area management biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, told CNN.\n\nStichert also said that there might be some “optimism for the future” as a few, small juvenile snow crabs are starting to appear in the system. But it could be at least three to four more years before they hit maturity and contribute to the regrowth of the population.\n\n“It is a glimmer of optimism,” Litzow said. “That’s better than not seeing them, for sure. We get a little bit warmer every year and that variability is higher in Arctic ecosystems and high latitude ecosystems, and so if we can get a cooler period that would be good news for snow crab.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/watchdog/2018/02/14/dupont-pompton-lakes-pollution/806921001/", "title": "DuPont downplayed pollution in a New Jersey town for years", "text": "For decades, an underground plume of toxic chemicals — about eight football fields wide and covering 140 acres — has lurked beneath 400 homes in the shadow of a now-shuttered munitions plant in suburban North Jersey.\n\nThe groundwater contaminated with cancer-causing solvents migrated from a century-old DuPont facility, nestled in the hills of Pompton Lakes, which produced ammunition that helped America win two world wars.\n\nThe solvents, used by DuPont to clean machinery, were dumped with wastewater for decades into four unlined lagoons near the edge of the company's property. The toxic stew seeped down into the soil and migrated with the groundwater off the company's site, eventually vaporizing up through the soil into the basements of nearby homes, posing a health risk to residents.\n\nThe solvents remain today — more than 30 years after they were discovered, and after countless public meetings, debate and study — beneath homes and backyards where DuPont workers and other residents raised families, played with children and planted vegetable gardens.\n\nBut now, a trove of government documents and emails obtained by The Record and NorthJersey.com reveal for the first time how extensively DuPont — the chemical giant that gave the world non-stick pans, stain-resistant carpets, nylon and other ubiquitous products — worked behind the scenes for more than three decades to keep secret and then downplay the extent of overall contamination from the site and the potential health risks they posed.\n\nThe company pushed back against regulators and chose not to tell residents that the cancer-causing chemicals could be vaporizing up from the groundwater into their homes, those documents reveal.\n\nThe plume of chemicals remains largely unaddressed, even as many residents blame DuPont for elevated levels of cancer and for other illnesses in their neighborhood.\n\n\"This was our home, and they did this, and we were lied to — lied to,\" said Helen Martens, who moved to the Pompton Lakes neighborhood in 1977. \"I lost all faith in the law, and in our town elected officials, and DuPont. I couldn't believe they had done this to people.\n\n\"I love my home,\" the 72-year-old said. \"I just fear it.\"\n\nThe Record reviewed hundreds of state and federal government emails and 100 boxes filled with government documents, obtained through open records requests, and conducted more than 70 interviews with residents, regulators, lawyers and environmental experts.\n\nThe investigation reveals that:\n\nDuPont told residents in 1997 that vapors from cancer-causing solvents weren't entering homes – even though the company was aware of the potential for the solvents to vaporize and had not conducted tests beneath or inside any houses.\n\nthat vapors from cancer-causing solvents weren't entering homes – even though the company was aware of the potential for the solvents to vaporize and had not conducted tests beneath or inside any houses.

That prevented unsuspecting residents from acting on their own to protect themselves, while potentially breathing cancer-causing vapors in their homes. Even as residents were kept in the dark, regulators pushed DuPont to test for vapors. The company was \"adamantly opposed.\" Internal government documents show why: DuPont didn't want test results that could be used against the company by residents in an ongoing suit about other pollution from its Pompton Lakes facility.\n\nThen, as part of the settlement of that suit, DuPont required residents to sign a release that kept them from suing DuPont if additional pollution was discovered.\n\nOnly after those releases were signed did DuPont test for vapors. But when residents were finally told about the danger in their homes and tried to sue, a judge said those who signed the releases were out of luck.\n\nThe Record and NorthJersey.com's investigation also found:\n\nDocuments dating to 1979 show the company's behavior on the vapor intrusion issue was part of a larger, decades-long pattern in which DuPont obscured and then downplayed the extent of various toxic pollutants migrating off its property.\n\non the vapor intrusion issue was part of a larger, decades-long pattern in which DuPont obscured and then downplayed the extent of various toxic pollutants migrating off its property. Experts say it is hard to definitively link a particular polluted site to specific cases of cancer or other illness.

Still, a door-to-door canvass by The Record of more than 50 households in the plume neighborhood identified many cases of various cancers that have been linked in studies to solvents that have been found in the plume, as well as other diseases, across multiple generations. A federal regulator told The Record she pushed to have the DuPont site added to the Superfund list so it could receive more federal money and contractor support, enjoy potentially quicker approvals for cleanup measures, and take into account public input. But state and local political leaders, including Bob Martin, the state's top environmental official under then-Gov. Chris Christie, blocked those efforts.\n\n\"It always seemed to me that the company was trying to slow-walk the problem,\" Judith Enck, former regional administrator of the federal Environmental Protection Agency during the Obama administration, said in a recent interview. \"They worked hard to pay as little money as possible and stretch it out over a long period of time, and sadly I think they are succeeding at that.\"\n\nThe delays at times generated expressions of frustration. At one point in 2007, for instance, Frank Faranca, a state regulator, emailed DuPont about vapor testing beneath homes: \"I find it increasingly hard to believe that it has taken this long to do the work. If you are truly trying to protect human health, it should not have taken this long.\"\n\nThe Pompton Lakes residents affected by the plume of vaporizing solvents are not alone.\n\nIn New Jersey and across the nation, vapor intrusion is a growing concern, and not only for newer contaminated sites that are just starting to be cleaned. Over the past decade, for instance, New York's environmental agency has revisited 147 legacy sites that had already been considered cleaned up to check for vapor intrusion.\n\nDuPont — which had a gross profit in 2016 of more than $10 billion — has spent money in Pompton Lakes over several decades to address some aspects of its legacy of pollution.\n\nA $50 million cleanup of Pompton Lake is underway to remove lead and mercury that washed into the lake sediment. DuPont also spent $70 million in the early 1990s to remove and replace soil tainted with lead and mercury from the backyards of homes that lined Acid Brook, a stream that runs through the DuPont property and through the adjacent neighborhood before it empties into Pompton Lake.\n\nDuPont spent nearly $40 million to settle lawsuits in connection with the mercury and lead contamination over the years, and offered a \"groundwater benefits program\" — payouts of $5,000 each to residents who promised not to sue the company.\n\nBut far less has been done to address the source of the vapor intrusion, which affects a much greater area.\n\nThe company built a $1.2 million pump-and-treat system to prevent more chemicals from leaving its property. And since 2008, DuPont has paid to install and cover the operating costs of venting systems intended to remove the harmful vapors from homes.\n\nStill, the underground plume of chemicals remains beneath 400 homes. One pilot study to test a method to treat the chemicals failed. A second controversial pilot study awaits state approval. There is no plan to buy out residents who have seen their property values plummet.\n\nDuPont declined to discuss its former operations in Pompton Lakes, referring all questions to Chemours, a spinoff it created in 2015. Chemours inherited about 170 contaminated DuPont sites nationwide, including the 600-acre Pompton Lakes site in Passaic County.\n\nChemours calls the Pompton Lakes cleanup challenging and said its goals ultimately mesh with those of residents.\n\n\"The remediation of a complex site like Pompton Lakes is a lengthy and complicated process,\" Chemours spokeswoman Robin Ollis Stemple said by email.\n\n\"While we all wish that this could be done more quickly, Chemours is committed to doing the work in a way that is thorough, science-based, protective of people and the environment and in accordance with all guidance\" provided by regulators.\n\n\"While this takes time, we believe this is the right approach for the Pompton Lakes community,\" she added. \"Ultimately, Chemours and the community have the same goal: to complete protective remediation and return the site to productive use.\"\n\nBut many wary residents — some of whom suffer from an array of illnesses — say they have been betrayed for decades by DuPont and let down by regulators and elected officials. They say they have no confidence the plume will be addressed. Some said they feel trapped, and want nothing more than to escape the neighborhood they once loved.\n\n\"I wind up with Stage 4 kidney failure,\" said longtime resident Ron Merlino. \"Guess what,\" he said. \"Buy our homes. Get us out of here. They should have got us out of here as soon as they knew we were getting poisoned in our own homes.\n\n\"It's time to go,\" Merlino added. \"I can't wait to get out.\"\n\nToday, more than three decades after regulators became aware toxic chemicals were migrating off the DuPont site, the plume of contamination remains unaddressed beneath more than 400 homes, making it one of the country's larger vapor intrusion sites.\n\nHere's how that happened.\n\nBecause it plays such an ominous role in their lives, some Pompton Lakes residents refer to the contaminated groundwater beneath their homes simply as \"The Plume.\"\n\nMany residents insist the plume of solvents has caused dozens of cases of brain, cervical, kidney and other cancers, as well as other illnesses.\n\nTheir argument was bolstered by a 2009 state health study that showed kidney cancer rates among women in the neighborhood were elevated and that non-Hodgkin lymphoma among men was elevated compared with the state average. New Jersey's rate of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in men is among the highest in the country.\n\nThe Health Department said in its 2009 study that while it could not definitively link the elevated cancer rates to solvents in the plume, \"the contaminants cannot be ruled out as a potential cause.\"\n\nWhen asked to comment on the array of illnesses among residents living above the plume, Chemours said in an email, \"It is an unfortunate fact that illnesses, including cancer, occur in all communities and neighborhoods in the state and the country.\"\n\nResidents say the plume has pushed down property values and prevented people from cashing in on life savings tied up in their homes.\n\nThe state first concluded solvents were migrating off the DuPont site and under homes as early as 1984, documents show. In 1988 the state and DuPont signed an agreement that required DuPont to drill monitoring wells to determine the extent of the plume — and to clean the contaminated groundwater.\n\nThe state Department of Environmental Protection called cleaning the plume a priority. Private wells in the neighborhood were the initial concern. Most were used to water lawns and fill swimming pools. But a few provided drinking water.\n\nRichard Marsh, a former DuPont employee and longtime resident, recalled a neighbor who had multiple dogs die from tumors.\n\n\"He fed them well water,\" Marsh said. \"My dogs never died of tumors. We used municipal water.\"\n\nThe solvents in the plume — TCE and PCE — belong to a group of chemicals called volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, which easily evaporate in the air. Private wells in the neighborhood, tested in 1985 and 1986, had volatile organic compounds as high as 5,592 parts per billion. One well had 408 parts per billion of PCE and 167 parts per billion of TCE.\n\nThe state drinking water limit for either of those solvents is 1 part per billion — the equivalent of one drop of solvent in an Olympic-size swimming pool — illustrating their potency.\n\nGiven the health concern, DuPont had the wells disconnected and the homes hooked up to municipal water.\n\nNot until 2001 — 17 years after the plume was identified — did regulators first mention in private exchanges with DuPont about the potential for the plume to be a health threat to residents through toxic vapors seeping into homes.\n\nVapor intrusion occurs when contaminants in the groundwater turn to vapor, move up through tiny spaces in the soil and enter basements through cracks in foundations or openings for utility lines.\n\nScientists have known about the threat for decades.\n\nTests for toxic vapors were conducted at the infamous Love Canal in upstate New York in the mid-1980s, and a few years later, vapor intrusion tests were conducted in residential areas of Rochester, New York, near a contaminated Kodak facility.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the federal Environmental Protection Agency issued some guidance on dealing with vapor intrusion at Superfund sites.\n\nNew Jersey was among the first states to focus on it. The state issued guidance in 1999 to test indoor air. The science was evolving rapidly, said John Boyer, a vapor intrusion expert with the state. Over the next few years the EPA and state Department of Environmental Protection put out new guidance on how to handle vapor intrusion, reflecting the evolving science.\n\nDuPont was aware of the potential for the solvents in the Pompton Lakes plume to vaporize into homes as early as 1997, documents show. But they told residents it wasn't happening, even though they had not tested the air in homes, or the soil underneath.\n\nHere is an excerpt from a letter DuPont sent residents in September 1997:\n\n\"… in addition to monitoring the groundwater plume, DuPont has also investigated the potential for vapor emissions to occur from the plume. (M)easurements … provide no indication of vapor migration.\"\n\nBut the measurements weren't taken under or inside people's homes. They were conducted in an old dry well on DuPont's former property.\n\n\"As far as the assumptions they were making, the science really wasn't there,\" said Boyer, the state vapor intrusion expert. \"There was no basis for us to disagree, I guess, at that point. But as time went on, the science got better, and as we moved forward we started recognizing this was more of a problem than we may have anticipated.\"\n\nChemours, in an email to The Record, said the best environmental investigation practice requires sampling \"where concentrations are likely to be highest,\" and the old well site was in the direct path of the groundwater flowing from the DuPont site \"where contamination would be expected to be highest.\"\n\nChemours also said \"the science of understanding vapor intrusion continued to evolve after 1997.\" It noted that DuPont conducted tests in the plume neighborhood from 2003 to 2005, though not under or inside homes.\n\n\"The data collected up to that point indicated that there was no vapor intrusion pathway,\" Chemours said.\n\nThough residents would be told nothing about vapor intrusion until 2008 — more than a decade after DuPont's 1997 letter — internal DEP and EPA emails and documents show that as early as March 2001 the regulators worried that vapors could be a health risk.\n\nIt took seven years for residents to be alerted.\n\nBecause the state at the time had little regulatory power on vapor intrusion, they relied on the federal EPA's push.\n\n\"We did not have the regulatory gun in a holster,\" said DEP spokesman Larry Hajna.\n\nAt a meeting in March 2001, regulators told DuPont that vapor intrusion \"must be addressed.\"\n\nAnd an EPA document a few months later noted that because the solvents were detected in elevated levels in monitoring wells in the neighborhood, \"indoor air may be of concern at off-site locations in the residential community.\"\n\nThe issue should be investigated, the report said.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nMore than a year later, in March 2003, DuPont and the regulators held a private meeting, documents show. The regulators underscored that \"there are potential impacts of the plume on people in the residential houses … through indoor air.\"\n\nBut that message was not conveyed to the residents.\n\n\"The public has a right to know about a problem,\" Enck, the former EPA regional administrator, said in a recent interview.\n\n\"I think it's crucial for government regulatory agencies but also for big companies to share information early,\" said Enck, who left the EPA in January 2017 after seven years. \"Unfortunately that didn't happen here.\"\n\nInstead, DuPont made it clear to the agencies that the company opposed sampling homes in the plume. In April 2003, an EPA official noted in an internal email: \"DuPont to fight if indoor air sampling required.\"\n\nDuPont sent a report a few months later saying there was no vapor intrusion — a report that relied on the same 1996 test of the dry well on DuPont's former property.\n\nThe state disagreed.\n\nAn agency memo noted that samples from monitoring wells in the plume neighborhood found elevated levels of PCE and TCE, which indicated the need to test for vapor intrusion. The 2003 memo also questioned DuPont's assumptions.\n\nIt noted that other wells had not been tested since 1995, so \"it is questionable whether one can conclude … that the concentration levels in the off-site plume are decreasing.\"\n\n\"If you know there's contamination and it's inexpensive and easy to mitigate, then do it,\" said Lenny Siegel, executive director of the Center for Public Environmental Oversight, which advocates for victims of environmental pollution.\n\n\"If you can install mitigation systems, just do it,\" he said. \"If installed properly they are effective.\"\n\nChemours defended DuPont's decision not to alert residents about the potential for vapor intrusion until 2008.\n\n\"In 1997, the science of vapor transport from groundwater … (was) still developing,\" Chemours wrote. \"We understand that DuPont followed relevant, applicable guidance as it was developed by regulatory agencies over time, and that DuPont communicated with residents appropriately.\"\n\nThat explanation does not sit well with some plume residents.\n\n\"The safest thing obviously is to move the people out,\" said longtime resident Cheryl Rubino. \"They should not be exposed to the contamination. But for those who don't want to go — make them whole. It's not fair what's happened to these people. Their homes, their investments, their life savings are in their house. They will always need to disclose the contamination.\n\n\"Personally, I don't feel it's going to get cleaned up,\" Rubino said. \"I really don't. It's too difficult and too expensive. And there's going to be a very difficult and long haul, and it will not happen before my mother dies, and it will not happen before I die.\"\n\nDuPont adamantly opposed testing for cancer-causing vapors beneath the Pompton Lakes neighborhood because it didn't want the test results to become a cudgel the public could use against the chemical giant in court, documents and emails reviewed by The Record and NorthJersey.com show.\n\nAnd as DuPont pushed back against regulators, Pompton Lakes residents, unaware of the vapors potentially seeping into their homes, continued to use their basements to do laundry, check their computer email, play video games — all while potentially breathing in the dangerous vapors.\n\nDuring that seven-year period when the public was kept in the dark about the potential danger lurking beneath their homes, not only did DuPont resist regulators who had pressed for vapor tests — at times the regulators' own bungling exacerbated the delays, according to dozens of internal emails and government documents obtained by The Record and NorthJersey.com.\n\nDocuments show that DuPont was unhappy with the regulators from the state and the federal EPA for pushing to have vapor tests conducted.\n\nIn an August 2003 email to officials at the EPA's Region 2, which covers New Jersey, DuPont complained that \"generally we feel that Region II wants more documentation and investigations tha(n) we have experienced with other Regions.\"\n\nA month later, DuPont and the regulators met to discuss ways to test for vapor intrusion in the plume. An internal EPA memo, uncovered by The Record and NorthJersey.com through a public records request, summarized the meeting.\n\nIt noted that if the geology of the site made it impossible to use generic testing methods, DuPont would need to conduct air sampling beneath and inside plume homes, \"which DuPont has adamantly opposed. They are involved in several citizen suits and they are concerned that such an assessment could be detrimental to the cases.\"\n\nIn other words, DuPont told environmental officials that if the tests showed elevated levels of solvent vapors, that could be used against them in ongoing lawsuits related to other contaminants that had left DuPont's property.\n\nOne of those suits had been filed on behalf of Pompton Lakes residents in 1998.\n\nThe case, Agnes v. DuPont, focused on health impacts and falling home values allegedly caused by mercury and lead that had washed off the DuPont site and into backyards, brought there by Acid Brook. The case also looked at solvents that contaminated private wells.\n\nBut it didn't focus on vapor intrusion, since the public had not yet been told it was a concern.\n\nWhen DuPont settled the Agnes case, the public remained uninformed about the danger of vapor intrusion.\n\nThe settlement provided most residents $950, a third of which went to their lawyers. In exchange, DuPont required residents to sign a release in which they relinquished their right to sue DuPont in the future over any illness other than cancer related to contamination from DuPont's Pompton Lakes site.\n\nWhen they signed those releases, residents were still in the dark about the ongoing talks between regulators and DuPont about vapor intrusion.\n\nAfter DuPont told the public in 2008 that tests indicated vapor intrusion was occurring, residents filed another suit, this time focused on vapor intrusion.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Dennis M. Cavanaugh ruled that 113 of the residents had no standing to sue DuPont because they had signed the 2004 releases — even though they knew nothing about vapor intrusion at the time.\n\n\"We were basically told after the fact — after giving them amnesty, if you will, that, oh, by the way — there is contaminated groundwater under your home, there are gases that are potentially seeping through the cracks in your basement, and they are carcinogenic,\" recalled longtime resident Jefferson LaSala.\n\nDuPont declined to comment on any aspects of its Pompton Lakes operations for this series. Chemours, a spinoff company that inherited responsibility for 170 of DuPont's contaminated sites across the country, including Pompton Lakes, told The Record in an email that \"there was no effort\" by DuPont \"to delay testing\" in the plume because of the lawsuits.\n\nDelays abounded, however, lasting years. Emails show that some delays were caused by DuPont, and some by regulators.\n\nMeanwhile, residents continued to use their basements, unaware they could be breathing cancer-causing vapors.\n\n\"I worked on vapor intrusion in upstate New York 20 years ago — it's not brand new,\" Enck, the former EPA regional administrator overseeing New Jersey during the Obama administration, told The Record. \"One of the most basic things is you do indoor air samples to decide if there is a problem and need a widespread solution.\"\n\nAt the same time, the state DEP had only a handful of vapor intrusion cases by 2005. \"So there was no precedent, no standard approach,\" recalled John Boyer, the DEP's vapor intrusion expert. \"We sort of broke ground when it came to the DuPont case in how to go about doing things.\n\n\"We were sort of feeling our way through this process,\" Boyer said.\n\nAnd DuPont didn't help.\n\nThe company submitted multiple reports over several years using screening levels and other factors the regulators had already rejected as lax or inappropriate, stalling the agencies in the process.\n\n\"History shows that in the absence of an active community and regulators, most polluters will drag their feet,\" said Lenny Siegel, executive director of the Center for Public Environmental Oversight, which advocates for victims of environmental pollution. \"They will try to do study after study showing the contamination isn't as bad as everyone thought. They are responsible to their shareholders.\"\n\nIn their 2010 book \"The Polluters,\" authors Benjamin Ross and Steven Amter, scientists who ran an environmental consulting firm, wrote that \"one of the industry's common tactics can be summed up as ‘spill, study, and stall.' When outside pressure to do something about pollution became strong, a study of the problem would be launched as an alternative to expensive action.\"\n\nEnck agreed.\n\nCompanies such as DuPont \"know how to tie regulatory agencies in knots,\" she said. \"They spend money on scientists who just question everything an agency wants to do.\"\n\nWhile the DEP and EPA kept prodding DuPont to test for vapor intrusion in Pompton Lakes, at times the regulators themselves dropped the ball, inadvertently exacerbating DuPont's delay, and causing residents to be victims of bureaucratic bungling.\n\nFor instance, early in 2004 DuPont sent an email to the DEP asking it to approve some sampling procedures. When the EPA asked three months later for the test samples, DuPont said it hadn't conducted the tests because it never heard back from the state.\n\n\"We prefer feedback before we proceed,\" DuPont wrote.\n\nA DEP official countered that he never received DuPont's correspondence, and besides, he was overwhelmed with work. \"I have to keep switching between my other 17 hazardous waste sites, which leaves me little time to devote to any specific project,\" he wrote. \"If any one project becomes a high priority, that gets 100% of my attention, and everything else gets dropped.\"\n\nLater that day, he acknowledged that he found DuPont's earlier email.\n\n\"Since my desk is buried beneath a Solid Waste landfill, I could not determine if I got the document,\" he wrote, somewhat sarcastically.\n\nThe new sampling was scheduled for Aug. 9.\n\nOn Sept. 14, the EPA followed up, asking for results.\n\nOn Dec. 22, the EPA asked again for the results.\n\nMore than a week later, DuPont replied: \"We had some problems with the last set of samples.\"\n\nWhen samples were taken at seven homes in early 2008, results showed elevated levels of PCE in all seven, and elevated TCE in six.\n\nA hydrogeologist hired as an expert for resident plaintiffs in a 2010 court case said that, since the solvents had likely been in the groundwater since the 1940s, \"vapor intrusion must have also occurred in the neighborhood for decades.\"\n\nAfter the 2008 test results, DuPont installed vapor intrusion systems on more than 330 homes to suck the vapors out from beneath the foundations and release them into the outside air to dissipate. In 2014, tests at Lakeside Middle School, adjacent to the plume, did not detect toxic vapors above state safety standards.\n\nHowever, the source of those vapors — the plume of contamination in the soil — is still there, unaddressed. Chemours has proposed a new pilot study to flush water into the ground to create a barrier between the vapors and the homes, but residents worry it will raise the water table and flood their basements with contamination.\n\n\"We're dealing with a very affluent company that knows science,\" said Enck, the former EPA regional administrator. \"They make billions of dollars every year, and someone inside the company has to take a very close look at the toxic legacy here and decide to do something differently.\n\n\"I think we need a new set of experts inside the company addressing this, because the old way is not working,\" Enck said.\n\nShe urged New Jersey's new governor, Phil Murphy, to make the site a priority. \"I think the community members are raising very legitimate concerns,\" Enck said.\n\nThe test results showing vapor intrusion in Pompton Lakes came nearly eight years after regulators first started raising concerns to DuPont about the potential for vapor intrusion in the neighborhood.\n\nThey arrived 11 years after DuPont told residents vapor intrusion was not occurring in the plume.\n\nAnd it was nearly 25 years after state environmental officials first suspected solvents were migrating off the DuPont site and under adjacent homes.\n\nWhen DuPont told Pompton Lakes residents in June 2008 that vapor intrusion could be occurring in their homes, the company said it would pay to install vapor mitigation units on each home in the plume.\n\nThe systems work by sucking the toxic vapors out from under a home and sending them up through a pipe, which releases them to the outside air, allowing them to dissipate.\n\nThe vapors came from the cancer-causing solvents PCE and TCE, which had contaminated a plume of groundwater beneath about 400 homes. The solvents had migrated off DuPont's former munitions facility nearby, and had moved their way up through the soil and into some basements.\n\nDuring tests to determine the extent of vapor intrusion in the neighborhood, two-thirds of samples taken beneath homes showed that PCE levels exceeded the state standard of 16 parts per billion. Levels were as high as 6,800.\n\nSimilarly, a third of samples tested high for TCE. The state standard was 11 parts per billion. Readings were as high as 1,200.\n\nAs for indoor air results, elevated levels of PCE were in 29 percent of the samples. The state standard was 1 part per billion, and readings were as high as 68.\n\nIn its 2010 report on the test results, DuPont said this about providing the vapor mitigation systems: \"DuPont believes that proactively offering systems to those residents located above the groundwater plume is an appropriate measure while efforts continue to assess potential remedial technologies for implementation in the offsite groundwater plume.\"\n\nThe company could have \"proactively\" provided those systems eight years earlier, when regulators first raised concerns about the potential for vapor intrusion.\n\n\"Companies are always free to proactively take steps to protect public health when they have contaminated communities,\" former EPA regional administrator Judith Enck said in a recent interview.\n\nIn December 2009, a state Health Department study found that women living in the plume had elevated rates of kidney cancer and men had elevated rates of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The Health Department said it could not definitively link the elevated cancer rates to the solvents in the plume — but \"the contaminants cannot be ruled out as a potential cause.\"\n\nBy that time, homeowners had grown so distrustful of DuPont that many refused to let the company's contractor into their homes to install the vapor mitigation systems. In some cases, their lack of faith was warranted.\n\nEarly in 2009, the Pompton Lakes building inspector failed 22 of the venting systems because the top of the outdoor pipe was installed too close to a window or chimney. Eventually, regulators allowed homeowners to choose their own state-approved contractors to install the systems. More than 330 homes in the plume neighborhood now have vapor mitigation systems.\n\nBut today, nearly 30 years after DuPont signed an agreement with New Jersey to clean up the groundwater plume — which is the source of those cancer-causing vapors — the land beneath the homes remains contaminated.\n\nBlasting caps and explosive powder have played a major role in the history of Pompton Lakes and neighboring Wanaque for more than a century.\n\nEven before DuPont arrived on the scene, several smaller companies made explosive powder in those towns as far back as the 1880s.\n\nThe first plant on the Wanaque portion of the future DuPont site was built in 1886 by H. Julius Smith, who had patented a spark-fired blasting cap filled with mercury fulminate.\n\nIn 1894, the American Smokeless Powder Co. took over production on the property. Its smokeless powder was a vast strategic improvement for soldiers over black powder, which had produced smoke that obscured enemy targets during battle and also gave away the location of the soldiers doing the shooting.\n\nThe Haskell Plant, as it was known, was purchased in 1898 by Laflin & Rand, which expanded the site. The factory was so important that American troops were stationed to guard it during the Spanish-American War.\n\nDuPont acquired control of Laflin & Rand in 1902, and set up its DuPont Electric Exploder Company, which included blasting cap and powder production facilities on the west side of Lake Inez along the Wanaque River. The facility would play a key production role in World War I.\n\nIn 1908, DuPont opened the DuPont Cap Works in the Acid Brook Valley.\n\nInitially the company made mercury fulminate as a powder to use in its blasting caps, then later switched to lead azide.\n\nTroops were stationed around the facility during World War I to guard against any potential sabotage by foreign agents.\n\nWith good reason.\n\nAn incident in January 1917 provided a stark reminder of the danger posed by the materials on the site. Some 400,000 pounds of smokeless powder ignited, causing explosions that could be felt as far away as Massachusetts. Houses shook in Brooklyn, windows shattered in Westchester County, and telephone and telegraph service throughout North Jersey was disrupted, according to a New York Times story at the time of the disaster: \"At the Pompton Lakes Hotel the floors were forced up and the guests ran to the street in terror, many not fully dressed.\"\n\nDuPont built a series of homes just south of its plant around World War I to house employees. The neighborhood became known as DuPont Village.\n\nIn 1926, DuPont shuttered its Wanaque facility and consolidated operations to the southeast, in Pompton Lakes.\n\nAs the nation ramped up for World War II, so did DuPont's hiring at its Pompton Lakes site. Employment peaked during the war at about 7,500, providing steady, well-paying jobs for many in the area.\n\nIn fact, DuPont provided more than jobs — it provided a way of life, a sense of community, even recreational opportunities such as athletic teams.\n\nIn 1943, amid World War II, operations and staff at the Pompton Lakes site had grown so large that DuPont introduced a monthly newsletter, aptly named \"The Exploder.\"\n\nThe first issue noted that it was created \"to unite the thousands of workers at the plant in a spirit of harmony, friendliness and above all, grim determination to keep at its peak the production for which we have taken solemn obligation.\"\n\nThe newsletter provided personal updates on workers in various parts of the sprawling facility, including the \"Twisting Line,\" \"Inspecting Line\" and \"Coiling Line.\"\n\nThat first issue also warned against absenteeism.\n\n\"They're beginning to use some pretty sharp words, including ‘deserter' for those who are absent without excuse from war plants,\" it read. \"The way to get to work every day is to bear constantly in mind that somewhere out in the Pacific or in Africa, some teenage son or somebody's husband may reach out desperately for ammunition to protect himself against the fiendish enemy and find that there isn't any…production was short that day you stayed out to get your hair set.\"\n\n\"The Exploder\" even had New Yorker-style cartoons, including one in which a female employee holds out a cup to a woman on another assembly line and says, \"Can you lend me a cup of Thermite — I just need a little to finish up a batch of incendiaries!\"\n\nAfter World War II, DuPont operations in Pompton Lakes slowly declined, until the plant closed in 1994.\n\nRemnants of structures — primarily concrete footings, stone and concrete foundations and masonry walls — remain on the 600-acre property, along with Cannonball Road, which had served as the facility's spine.\n\nFounded in 1802 as a gunpowder mill on the Brandywine River in Delaware by chemist and industrialist E. I. du Pont, who had fled the violence of the French Revolution with his family in 1799.\n\nHeadquartered in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nPlayed key role in making blasting caps and other ammunition at its Pompton Lakes facility for the U.S. military during both world wars.\n\nPlayed a major role in the Manhattan Project, which ultimately developed nuclear weapons for the United States during World War II.\n\nInvented Nylon, Lucite, Dacron, Mylar, Kevlar, Tyvek, Lycra, Teflon, Corian, Stainmaster carpets, and other now-ubiquitous products.\n\nIn 2015 spun off a separate company, Chemours, which inherited responsibility for cleanup of more than 170 of DuPont's contaminated sites, including Pompton Lakes.\n\nHad $10 billion in net profit in 2016.\n\nIn September 2017 completed a $130 billion merger with Dow, another chemical industry giant, to become DowDuPont. DowDuPont is expected to break into three independent, publicly traded companies focused on agriculture, materials science and specialty products.\n\nAbout the Project\n\nJames M.

July 20, 2020, marks 51 years since the moon landing.\n\nYou know the photo: Buzz Aldrin, standing on the moon and saluting the American flag.\n\nZoom in. What's really in the image? Why is the flag waving? Where are the stars? And how did those shadows get there?\n\nTo commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, USA TODAY spoke with experts at NASA and reviewed its archives to explain the most notable details in the famed photo. Spoiler alert: Not everything went as the space agency planned it.\n\nThe flag, a topic of many a conspiracy theory, probably toppled over when the astronauts departed, and medals for Soviet astronauts lie on the surface as well.\n\nHere's the backstory of what you're seeing in the photograph.\n\nWho's in the suit? And how we got to the moon in the first place\n\nOn July 20, 1969, around 11:40 p.m. EDT, the scene depicted in one of the most iconic photos ever taken unfolded.\n\nAstronauts Neil Armstrong and Aldrin were more than 110 hours into the historic moon landing mission when they planted a U.S. flag. Video of the event was broadcast to millions back on Earth.\n\nInteractive:The new race to the moon\n\nAldrin stepped to the side to raise his hand in salute. Armstrong stepped back to photograph the moment.\n\n\"It's such an iconic image,\" said Jennifer Ross-Nazzal, a historian for the Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"This has become part of American culture. ... You see this photo in textbooks.\"\n\nThe photo was taken during the Apollo 11 mission, the first manned moon landing. Aldrin and Armstrong landed in the Sea of Tranquility on the lunar surface as Command Module Pilot Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit.\n\nThe mission came amid an intense space race with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both the United States and the USSR rapidly advanced in technological achievements of spaceflight, a national security concern during the nuclear arms race.\n\nSpace race:Apollo 11 moon landing celebrated as pioneering milestone, but it was really about winning the space race\n\nThough the Soviet Union sent the first person into space, the United States took the lead in the space race when it landed two men on the moon.\n\nAbout the flag: It fell over\n\nPhotos of the U.S. flag planted on the moon have been topics of conversations concerning patriotism and conspiracies ever since the world first saw stars and stripes on the lunar surface.\n\nHowever, the flag probably isn't still standing.\n\nThe working presumption at NASA is that the flag fell, said John Uri, manager of the Johnson Space Center History Office. Aldrin said he thought he saw the flag tip over from the exhaust when the lunar module lifted off, and the shadow of the flag is not visible in satellite images.\n\nCelebrating 50 years:NASA put a man on the moon. Now, the Smithsonian is putting a rocket on the Mall\n\nUri said later Apollo missions placed flags farther from their lunar modules to prevent them from tipping over. It's likely that the colors have faded over the years from extreme exposure, Uri said.\n\nWhy isn't the flag drooping?\n\nAs expected, hoisting a flag presented NASA engineers with a number of technical problems, Anne Platoff wrote in a paper in August 1993 for NASA on the history of the Apollo 11 flag.\n\nBecause the moon has no substantial atmosphere, NASA scientists led by Jack Kinzler designed a horizontal crossbar to support the flag and keep it from drooping down, Platoff wrote.\n\nA hem was sewn across the top of the 3-by-5-foot nylon flag so the bar could go through, then be lifted and locked into place at a 90 degree angle. The flagpole had a base that allowed it to more easily be driven into the moon's surface, and a red circle was painted at 18 inches from the bottom to help judge how deep it needed to go.\n\nThe astronauts struggled to drive the flag's base beyond 6 to 9 inches deep into the surface, which probably contributed to the flag falling.\n\nThe flag traveled to space tacked onto the ladder on the lunar module, so the astronauts could access it when they walked on the moon. A protective shroud was built to protect the flag from the heat from the engines.\n\nPacking the flag involved a 12-step process and five people, Platoff wrote. Eleven steps were needed to mount the flag on the ladder. The astronauts were able to access it by removing pins and Velcro it was attached to. (And no, NASA didn't invent Velcro during the Apollo missions, though it did popularize its use.)\n\nWhat caused the ripples in the flag?\n\nMany say the flag in the photo looks like it's flowing in the wind. Conspiracy theorists cite this as evidence the moon landing was filmed in a warehouse with air conditioning creating the ripple. That's false.\n\nThe horizontal crossbar was supposed to give a slight wavy effect as in a breeze, Platoff wrote, and Aldrin and Armstrong said they had trouble pulling the flag out all the way.\n\nWhat you can't see: A golden olive branch and hidden messages\n\nThe flag was among various commemorative items that Aldrin and Armstrong left on the moon's surface.\n\nA stainless steel plaque noting the feat of the first manned moon landing, a silicon disc with messages from world leaders in tiny text and a small pouch with an Apollo 1 patch, medals honoring two Soviet astronauts and a small gold olive branch were also left on the moon, according to NASA.\n\nThe patch commemorates Apollo 1 astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee, who died in a launchpad fire in 1967.\n\n7 things on the moon:Here's what the Apollo 11 astronauts left on the moon\n\nAs for the Soviet medals, Aldrin and Armstrong honored Vladimir Komarov, who died during the Soyuz 1 mission when his parachute failed, and Yuri Gagarin, the first human in outer space. NASA did not officially acknowledge at the time that the Soviet items were left on the moon.\n\nAldrin's book \"Men from Earth,\" published in 1989, detailed the full contents of the packet they left, according to NASA.\n\nThe flag serves as \"a sign of what America really accomplished,\" Ross-Nazzal said. Though there were concerns that it would appear that the United States was \"claiming\" the moon, that was never the intention, she said.\n\n\"It shows a sense of accomplishment and proof that we've been there,\" she said.\n\nWhy the footprints are so distinct\n\nAs Armstrong put it, \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\"\n\nWhen Aldrin and Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface, they left well-defined footprints created by the outer boots of their spacesuits.\n\nVoices:My tio's unlikely journey from communist Cuba to key figure in Apollo 11 moon landing\n\n\"If we went back there today, the footprints would still be there,\" Uri said. NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter can show the disturbed topsoil in areas on the moon where lunar modules have landed, rovers have roamed and astronauts have walked, he said.\n\nThe Apollo 11 crew described the lunar regolith, or soil, as \"almost a little bit like wet sand,\" Uri said. In reality, the regolith is made of rocks that have been ground up into a fine material over many years under the bombardment of micrometeorites and solar wind radiation. Because the moon has no atmosphere, liquid water or wind erosion, the regolith probably remains well-preserved, Uri said.\n\nThere were even some fears that when a lunar module landed on the moon, the surface would be so thick with dust that it would sink, Uri said.\n\nIs that a moon rock in the bottom right corner?\n\nYes. Though the moon's surface is mostly made up of the fine regolith, various rocks are scattered throughout.\n\nThe white specks seen in the background of the photo are probably lunar rocks reflecting light.\n\nThe astronauts found two main types of rocks at their landing: basalts and breccias, according to the Universities Space Research Association.\n\nThe basalts are 3.6 billion to 3.9 billion years old and solidified from molten lava. The breccias are fragments of older rocks broken up over the years by meteorites hitting the moon. Small rock fragments are sometimes fused under the intense heat and pressure of the impacts, forming breccias.\n\nAldrin and Armstrong collected samples of the regolith and up to 50 rocks during their mission.\n\nThe sky is black in the photograph. Why are there no stars in the background?\n\nWhen people think of what it would be like in space, they might conjure images of a star-filled expanse. Though the stars are definitely there, none is visible in Armstrong's photo.\n\nConspiracy theorists who say NASA fabricated the moon landing cite this as evidence; however, there is a scientific explanation.\n\n\"The only time the astronauts really saw the stars clearly was when they were orbiting the moon and in the shadow of the moon,\" Uri said.\n\nSunlight reflecting off the moon's surface washed out any of the light the stars emitted, Uri said, making them invisible in the photographs. Even the Earth's own shine could be bright enough to block out the stars, he said.\n\nPoll:Americans support NASA but not a return to the moon\n\nThe cameras did not use long enough exposure times to document the stars. Rather than focusing on space, the purpose of taking photos was to document the engineering feat of landing on the moon, Uri and Ross-Nazzal said.\n\nArmstrong took most the photos the public associates with the landing. He used a 70mm Hasselblad, though NASA heavily modified the camera, so it would be easier to use while in a spacesuit. A variety of other cameras were also used during the mission.\n\nAccording to the Universities Space Research Association, cameras operated using a trigger and were mounted on the front of the astronauts' spacesuits, which discredits a popular conspiracy theory about not being able to see a camera in the reflection in Aldrin's helmet in one photo Armstrong took. (We can thank NASA's later work for the creation of small enough cameras for an essential device in our modern lives: the camera phone.)\n\nWhat made the long dark shadow behind the flag?\n\nThe lunar module, the spacecraft Aldrin and Armstrong used to get from the main command and service module in lunar orbit to the moon's surface, is seen in the top left of the photograph.\n\nThere were no external lights brightening up the photos and video taken of the mission. The light comes from sunlight and reflections off the moon's surface, the astronauts' suits and the lunar module.\n\nBuzz Aldrin's golden visor is shiny for a reason\n\nEach piece of the astronauts' spacesuit is meticulously designed and serves a very specific purpose.\n\nWhat's in the square pack on Aldrin's back? The Personal Life Support System, or PLSS, according to Cathleen Lewis, spacesuit curator at the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum.\n\n\"It provided oxygen, carbon dioxide cleaning, suit cooling, electronic communications to the astronaut,\" Lewis said.\n\nLewis said the suit was made from as many as 26 layers of material, including layers of Mylar, Dacron, Beta Marcasite and Kapton. The suit's outer layer is Teflon-coated Beta cloth.\n\n\"Inside the suit, there are layers of high temperature nylon, fabric dipped in rubber, molded rubber, steel restraints, aluminum connectors, rubber gaskets, a double brass pressure zipper,\" Lewis said.\n\nThe gloves they wore were constructed from a fabric called Chromel-R, a woven stainless steel that insulated their hands. The fingertips of the gloves were made from silicone rubber for sensitivity, according to the Air and Space Museum.\n\nMysterious gray spots:What caused mysterious gray spots to appear on Neil Armstrong's Apollo 11 moon landing glove?\n\nTo protect Aldrin's eyes from the intense sun exposure, his helmet had inner and outer visors.\n\n\"Worn on top of the clear bubble helmet, the visor had shades and an outer visor that was a plastic with a monomolecular layer of gold. The gold acted as a sunscreen, much in the way that sky goggles do,\" Lewis said.\n\nThey could have tripped on those wires in the bottom left\n\nIn the bottom left side of the photo, a series of cables appear to run along the moon's surface toward the lunar module.\n\nIt was those wires, powering a video camera, that allowed millions of people worldwide to watch Aldrin and Armstrong during their extravehicular activity, the official name for their moonwalk.\n\nBecause it was such a historic mission, NASA \"wanted to share the experience with rest of the world,\" Uri said.\n\nArmstrong set up the camera so most of their activities would be visible to the millions back on Earth, according to the Universities Space Research Association. The setup went smoothly, but the wiring created a tripping hazard for Armstrong and Aldrin.\n\nAccording to Ross-Nazzal, the public affairs office at NASA pushed hard to get TV cameras on board spaceflights as early as the time of the Gemini missions.\n\nThe astronauts and engineers feared the added weight and operation of the cameras would create unnecessary complications, and even when the first live televised mission occurred, Apollo 7, resistance persisted within NASA, Uri and Ross-Nazzal said.\n\n\"Pubic affairs thought the public needed to see what was going on and get excited about what was happening,\" Ross-Nazzal said. \"While the U.S. did it first, we really brought everyone else along.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/environment/958531/what-is-geoengineering-and-can-it-save-the-planet", "title": "What is geoengineering – and can it save the planet? | The Week UK", "text": "The failure of world leaders to reach key agreements at Cop27 has spurred scientists’ efforts to develop radical methods to limit global warming.\n\nGeoengineering is “one of the most controversial and consequential climate change-fighting tactics yet”, said The Daily Beast’s science writer Tony Ho Tran, and refers to “technologies and innovations that can be used to artificially modify the Earth’s climate”.\n\nCountries worldwide including the US are exploring different forms of geoengineering. The White House last month announced a five-year research plan to explore solar radiation management.\n\nWhat is geoengineering?\n\nGeoengineering “sounds futuristic”, wrote Robert Litan for Foreign Affairs. But the basic concept has been around since 1965, when scientific advisers to then US president Lyndon Johnson “suggested that some kind of tinkering with the planet’s mechanics might be necessary”.\n\nSince then, this tinkering has included developing methods to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, and fertilising the ocean to stimulate phytoplankton growth. Other projects range from influencing the weather to reflecting solar heat.\n\nThe concept of geoengineering is becoming more mainstream “as the pace and destructiveness of extreme weather events seem to be quickening beyond even some of the most pessimistic forecasts”, said Litan. “Geoengineering might finally have its moment.”\n\nThe US is investigating a geoengineering technique that “essentially involves spraying fine aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight away from the Earth”, said Ho Tran on The Daily Beast. Although that “sounds a bit bonkers”, he wrote, the world has witnessed “inadvertent solar radiation management” before. The 1816 eruption of the Tambora volcano in Indonesia resulted in temperatures dropping by as much as 3C in Europe and North America that summer.\n\nUnesco last week held a panel on the scientific advancement and ethical challenges of climate engineering at Cop27 . The UN agency said that arguments were “increasingly being made for the consideration of other actions to counter the heating effect of greenhouse gases”.\n\n“The consideration of such methods, however, raises a host of ethical concerns and questions,” Unesco added.\n\nWhy is it controversial?\n\nCountries worldwide are “increasingly using technology to change conditions in the atmosphere, oceans and ice to improve weather to their advantage or lessen global warming”, said Tracy Raczek, former climate advisor to the UN secretary-general. But in an article for London-based think-tank Chatham House, Raczek warned that the “results of these interventions can cross borders, and what may be good for one country may not be good for its neighbours”.", "authors": ["Fred Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/07/24/pakistan-one-worlds-leading-victims-global-warming/809509002/", "title": "Pakistan is ground zero for global warming consequences", "text": "Abdul Salam\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nPakistan contributes less than 1 percent of the world's greenhouse gases blamed for causing global warming, yet its 200 million people are among the world's most vulnerable victims of the growing consequences of climate change.\n\nThe nation is facing ever-rising temperatures, drought and flooding that threaten health, agriculture, water supplies and hopes for development of a society that ranks in the bottom quarter of nations, based on income per person.\n\nPakistan is among 10 countries affected most by climate change, according to the 2018 Global Climate Risk Index released by the public policy group Germanwatch.\n\nBridging the Middle East and South Asia, Pakistan is in a geographic location where average temperatures are predicted to rise faster than elsewhere, increasing 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) by the year 2100, according to a 2012 World Wildlife Fund report.\n\nThis past April 30, the temperature in the southern city of Nawabshah soared to 122.4 degrees Fahrenheit (50.2 degrees Celsius), the hottest day on earth ever recorded in April, the Pakistan Meteorological Department and World Meteorological Organization said. It was even hotter in the southern city of Turbat on May 28, 2017, when the temperature hit a sizzling 128.3 degrees Fahrenheit (53.5 Celsius).\n\n“We are planning to move to other places due to extreme heat in our area,\" Nawabshah resident Azhar Rashid said in an interview. \"We are surprised by every new summer here starting with high temperatures that badly affect our daily routine and jobs.”\n\nSo far this year, more than 60 people have died from the heat in Karachi, the country's largest city. Many more die of heat-related illnesses across the country, but exact numbers of deaths are not kept.\n\nIn June 2015, more than 1,200 people died from the heat nationwide and 65,000 were treated for heat illnesses, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority for the Karachi region reported.\n\nDepleting water supplies are another problem in a country where 60 percent of the land receives less than 10 inches of rain per year. Rivers are mainly fed by the Hindu Kush-Karakoram Himalayan glaciers, which are melting rapidly due to global warming.\n\nMore:Global warming risk: Rising temperatures from climate change linked to rise in suicides\n\nMore:Climate Point: Summer is getting warmer, faster\n\nMore:CSI Earth: Human 'fingerprints' detected in Earth's seasonal temperature changes\n\nMuhammad Akmal, a professor at Peshawar Agriculture University, said Pakistan's rising temperatures are also being boosted because forests are being destroyed as people clear areas for housing and other development. The trend also is resulting in less fertile land for farming.\n\nAkmal said global warming is extending summer-like weather to virtually the entire year, from January until November.\n\nAt the same time, “the rise in the use of vehicles causes heat and more ozone-destroying gases that transform the environment into a furnace,” he said.\n\nPakistan, which has the world's sixth-largest population, is projected to add nearly 100 million people by 2050, causing great strains on its resources. Plus, ambitious plans for economic development could mean the country increases carbon emissions by 300 percent over the next 15 years, as more cars clog roads and demand for electricity expands, according to projections.\n\nThe country's government has pledged to reduce emissions by 2030, as required by nations that signed the Paris Climate Accord, but it has not said how it will accomplish that given its development hopes.\n\nFeeding the growing population will be a challenge as the melting of glaciers and higher water evaporation rates caused by hotter temperatures will mean less irrigated water and smaller harvests of staples such as wheat and rice.\n\n“Recently we have seen devastating results of this growing mess,\" said Aamir Amjad, senior program coordinator at the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom, a liberal policy group. \"Humans are forced to migrate and switch their livelihoods, the yield of crops has decreased ... (and) \"the cycle of extreme weather has either expanded or intensified.”\n\nDespite all these environmental challenges, climate change has not been a major issue debated during the campaign for a new national assembly to be elected Wednesday. Instead, issues such as corruption and improving social services have dominated the debate among candidates.\n\nDuring the last five years, only the Pakistan Movement for Justice party, favored to score gains in the election, focused on environmental issues in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province by launching a program to plant a billion trees to reduce heat across the province.\n\n“We need to teach new generations about the environment and encourage researchers to conduct empirical studies on climate change issues,\" Amjad said. \"Their findings will help to streamline policies.”\n\nA 2017 report by the Asian Development Bank concludes that northern parts of the country will suffer the biggest increases in temperatures and that water per capita will decrease at an alarming rate in coming years.\n\nThe report also warned that extreme climate change events, such as heavier rains that cause flooding, will damage the country's gas, oil, and power infrastructure. Warmer temperatures also may affect the efficiency of nuclear plants, it said.\n\n“There is a need to develop drought- and heat-tolerant crops that show optimum performance even with changes in climate patterns,” the report said. It also called for construction of water storage systems, investment in renewable energy, \"improved weather forecasting and warning systems, retrofitting of critical energy infrastructure, and construction of dikes or sea walls.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/31/pumpkin-surgeons-wild-exhibit-white-house-groundskeeper-news-around-states/50888775/", "title": "Pumpkin surgeons, 'Wild' exhibit: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: Descendants of the steamship owner responsible for illegally bringing 110 African captives to America aboard the last U.S. slave ship have ended generations of public silence, calling his actions more than 160 years ago “evil and unforgivable.” In a statement released to NBC News, members of Timothy Meaher’s family – which is still prominent around Mobile – said what Meaher did on the eve of the Civil War “had consequences that have impacted generations of people.” “Our family has been silent for too long on this matter. However, we are hopeful that we – the current generation of the Meaher family – can start a new chapter,” said the statement, which came amid the release of “Descendant,” a new documentary about the people who were brought to the United States aboard the slave ship Clotilda and their families. The film was acquired by Netflix and Higher Ground, the production company of Barack and Michelle Obama. The Meaher family has started meeting with leaders of the community in and around Africatown, the community begun by the Africans in north Mobile after they were released from slavery in 1865, the statement said. Clotilda Descendants Association President Jeremy Ellis said the organization had been in contact with the Meaher family by email, and members hope for face-to-face talks.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said Alaskans want results, not “partisan political rhetoric,” as she faced Donald Trump-backed Republican rival Kelly Tshibaka in a televised debate Thursday. Tshibaka questioned the value of Murkowski’s seniority and said it’s time for a change. Murkowski “cannot accomplish in the next six years what she hasn’t been able to accomplish in the last 21 years,” Tshibaka said. Murkowski, who has held the seat since late 2002 and is the most senior member of Alaska’s congressional delegation, said the race is about “who can best deliver for Alaska.” She pointed to and defended her record. The debate, held less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 ranked-choice election, also included Democrat Pat Chesbro, who has significantly trailed Murkowski and Tshibaka in fundraising. The other candidate on the ballot, Republican Buzz Kelley, who finished fourth in the August primary, last month suspended his campaign and endorsed Tshibaka. Trump, who came to Alaska in July for a rally with Tshibaka and Sarah Palin, whose U.S. House run he’s endorsed, participated in a tele-rally for Tshibaka last week. He called Murkowski “one of the worst senators even imaginable,” criticizing her for voting for the “insane impeachment” and for opposing Brett Kavanaugh’s U.S. Supreme Court nomination.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A federal judge refused Friday to bar a group from monitoring outdoor ballot boxes in Maricopa County – where watchers have shown up armed and in ballistic vests – saying to do so could violate the monitors’ constitutional rights. U.S. District Court Judge Michael Liburdi said the case remained open, and the Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans could try again to make its argument against a group calling itself Clean Elections USA. A second plaintiff, Voto Latino, was removed from the case. Liburdi concluded that “while this case certainly presents serious questions, the Court cannot craft an injunction without violating the First Amendment.” The judge is a Trump appointee and a member of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal organization. Local and federal law enforcement have been alarmed by reports of people, some masked and armed, watching 24-hour ballot boxes in Maricopa County and rural Yavapai County as midterm elections near. Some voters have complained of voter intimidation after people watching the boxes took photos and videos and followed voters. “Plaintiffs have not provided the Court with any evidence that Defendants’ conduct constitutes a true threat,” the judge wrote. “On this record, Defendants have not made any statements threatening to commit acts of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.”\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Students from Northside High School have made bed frames for children in need. The city’s school district, Rotary Club of Fort Smith, the Community Rescue Mission, and the Sleep in Heavenly Peace organization joined forces on the hand-crafted bed construction project. According to SHP, 3% of children ages 3-17 nationwide do not have a bed in which to sleep. On Friday, 25 students from Northside’s construction class put their knowledge and skills to work in an effort to build beds for needy children. The SHP organization will deliver 30 new beds, along with mattresses and bedding, to area homes. “This project gives our students a chance to serve their community while enhancing their skill set,” Fort Smith Public Schools Superintendent Terry Morawski said. Fort Smith Rotary Club volunteer member Ken Colley said his group was “very excited” to lend a hand. “No kid should sleep on the floor in our town,” Colley said. “Studies have shown that if a child has a good night’s sleep, they will be much more apt to stay alert in the classroom and be able to focus and remember what they learn.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A man who spent more than 38 years behind bars for a 1983 murder and two attempted murders has been released from prison after long-untested DNA evidence pointed to a different person, the Los Angeles County district attorney said Friday. The conviction of Maurice Hastings, 69, and a life sentence were vacated during an Oct. 20 court hearing at the request of prosecutors and his lawyers from the Los Angeles Innocence Project at California State University, Los Angeles. “I prayed for many years that this day would come,” Hastings said at a news conference Friday. “I am not pointing fingers. I am not standing up here a bitter man, but I just want to enjoy my life now while I have it.” “What has happened to Mr. Hastings is a terrible injustice,” District Attorney George Gascón said in a statement. “The justice system is not perfect, and when we learn of new evidence which causes us to lose confidence in a conviction, it is our obligation to act swiftly.” The victim in the case, Roberta Wydermyer, was sexually assaulted and killed by a single gunshot to the head, authorities said. Her body was found in the trunk of her vehicle in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood. A suspect identified through DNA testing last year had died in prison in 2020, according to state officials.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A wildfire that destroyed nearly 1,100 homes and businesses in suburban Denver last winter caused more than $2 billion in losses, making it by far the costliest in Colorado history, the state insurance commissioner said. Commissioner Michael Conway provided the updated estimate this month during a meeting with residents who lost homes to the so-called Marshall Fire in Boulder County and other Colorado wildfires in recent years, The Denver Post reports. The Boulder County fire broke out unusually late in December following months of drought and is blamed for at least one death. Official estimates released days after the fire put the losses at more than $500 million. Experts say the winter grassland fire that blew up along Colorado’s Front Range was rare, but similar events will be more common in the coming years as climate change warms the planet, sucking the moisture out of plants, and as suburbs grow in fire-prone areas. Conway said additional insurance claims and assessments of the scope of rebuilding from the wildfire prompted the new estimate. “We’re estimating now it will be $2 billion in claims if not more,” he told residents. Investigators have yet to determine what caused the Dec. 30 fire, which was fed by winds up to 100 mph and raced from the Rocky Mountain foothills eastward through unincorporated Boulder County and into the cities of Superior and Louisville.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: As part of his campaign to win over blue state voters, the Republican candidate for governor, Bob Stefanowski, is trying to capitalize on any lingering resentment over safety precautions taken at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this month, the businessman pledged never to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for schoolchildren, joining Republicans who made similar promises after a national panel advised the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to add the shots to lists of recommended vaccinations for kids and adults. Stefanowski has complained that the state’s old mask mandate in schools, which ended in most districts in late February after campuses were allowed to reopen for in-person learning with masks in August 2020, lasted too long. In his proposed “Parents’ Bill of Rights,” he said families shouldn’t be “forced by the government to vaccinate or mask their children without any recourse to object.” “It’s up to the person. They should have the choice,” Stefanowski said. Stefanowski’s opposition to mandatory COVID-19 vaccines for “public or private employees or anyone else” is in line with other Republicans who have campaigned this election season on promises to protect individual liberty in public health.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: President Joe Biden returned to his home state to cast his ballot for the midterm election Saturday afternoon. He was joined by his 18-year-old granddaughter Natalie, a first-time voter. The two arrived at the Shipyard Shops polling location on the Wilmington Riverfront at 4:15 p.m., a few hours after the president watched Natalie Biden’s field hockey game at St. Andrew’s in Middletown. The two of them walked through the doors of the polling place hand in hand after greeting a constituent leaving the building. Secret Service and local police officers were posted outside as the Bidens voted, drawing the attention of others who had come to vote early. They took photos and posted on social media, surprised to see the president there. When the Bidens emerged from the voting booths, White House staff said Joe and Natalie Biden placed “I Voted” stickers on each others’ shirts. The president then gave his granddaughter a kiss on the cheek. Joe and Natalie Biden join the more than 17,800 Delawareans who had voted either by mail or in person as of Friday afternoon, according to the Delaware Department of Elections. A department spokesperson said the official count would be updated Monday.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The chief White House groundskeeper as of this month has spent 50 years serving the families – and many of their pets – who have called the mansion home. Dale Haney’s chief responsibility in his post that has spanned 10 presidencies is to care for the vast lawns, colorful flower gardens, hundreds of trees, thousands of shrubs and burgeoning vegetable garden on 18 acres of property surrounding the White House. He also picks out the official White House Christmas tree every year. To honor Haney, President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, surprised Haney last Monday by planting an elm tree on the south grounds. Biden said visitors in future years are “going to be looking at this tree and asking, ‘Who’s Dale?’ ” Haney, 70, joked that he “might still be here.” But Haney is perhaps better known to many at the White House, from staff to Secret Service officers, as the keeper of the president’s pets. “He’s like the whisperer,” said Anita McBride, who was a young aide in the correspondence office in Ronald Reagan’s administration when she first met Haney. These days, Haney is often seen walking Commander, Biden’s German shepherd. Haney started at the White House in 1972 and said he originally planned to work there for just two years.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: An evacuation order has abruptly forced out residents of a 14-story oceanfront building on the same avenue where a condominium collapse killed nearly 100 people last year. The city posted an unsafe structure notice Thursday evening at the Port Royale condominium, Miami Beach spokesperson Melissa Berthier said in an email. A structural engineering report prompted the evacuation of the 164-unit structure, which is in the process of undergoing a required recertification. An engineer discovered that a main support beam identified for repair 10 months ago had shifted, and a crack in the beam had expanded, and other structural supports may need repair as well, the report said. One resident, renovation contractor Marash Markaj, who lived in the building for more than six years, said the damage extends beyond a single support beam. “I’ve seen the issues for many years,” Markaj told the Associated Press. He said he tried to report the issues – including cracks in a column and water standing in the garage area for weeks at a time – to the building management and to the city’s building department. “I was never able to get a response,” he said, adding that he was feeling “unsafe” living in the building and with the way the building’s maintenance was handled.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A man and his family “have faced threats of violence and live in fear” since the movie “2000 Mules” falsely accused him of ballot fraud during the 2020 election, according to a federal lawsuit. The widely debunked film includes surveillance video showing Mark Andrews, his face blurred, depositing five ballots in a drop box in downtown Lawrenceville, a suburb northeast of Atlanta. A voiceover by conservative pundit and filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza says: “What you are seeing is a crime. These are fraudulent votes.” In fact, a state investigation found, Andrews was dropping off ballots for himself, his wife and their three adult children, who all live at the same address. That is legal in Georgia, and a state investigator said there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Andrews. D’Souza’s film uses research from the Texas-based nonprofit True the Vote and suggests that ballot “mules” aligned with Democrats were paid to illegally collect and deliver ballots in Georgia and four other closely watched states. An Associated Press analysis found that it is based on faulty assumptions, anonymous accounts and improper analysis of cellphone location data. State and federal officials have repeatedly confirmed that there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud during the 2020 election that could have changed the outcome of the presidential race.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A former U.S. defense contractor in Hawaii accused with his wife of living for decades under stolen identities of dead babies will get a new attorney, a federal judge ruled Thursday. According to prosecutors, Walter Glenn Primrose and Gwynn Darle Morrison are the real names of the couple who have been fraudulently living for decades under stolen identities, Bobby Fort and Julie Montague. Prosecutors say Primrose spent more than 20 years in the Coast Guard, where he obtained secret-level security clearance. The couple have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy, false statement in a passport application and aggravated identity theft. Assistant Federal Defender Max Mizono filed a motion this month asking to withdraw as Primrose’s attorney, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. During a telephone hearing Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Rom Trader granted the request after a private conversation with Mizono and Primrose. Prosecutors have suggested the case is about more than identity theft. A search of the couple’s home in Kapolei, a Honolulu suburb, turned up Polaroids of them wearing jackets that appear to be authentic Russian KGB uniforms, an invisible ink kit, documents with coded language and maps showing military bases, prosecutors said. Attorneys for the couple have said they are not Russian spies.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Supreme Court says it will not reconsider the clemency case of a terminally ill man who is facing execution for his role in the 1985 slayings of two gold prospectors near McCall. The high court made the decision Friday in Gerald Ross Pizzuto Jr.’s case. The decision means the state remains free to seek a death warrant for Pizzuto. Once issued, the warrant would set his execution by lethal injection in the next 30 days. Deborah A. Czuba, the head of the Federal Defender Services of Idaho’s capital case unit, said in a statement that the Idaho Supreme Court decision was disappointing. “There is still time for Gov. Brad Little to accept the recommendation of his parole commissioners and let Mr. Pizzuto die a natural death in prison,” Czuba said. “If not, our hope is that the State will have enough grace to wait at least until after the Thanksgiving and Christmas season before making Department of Correction employees participate in a needless and traumatizing execution during the holidays.” Pizzuto has spent more than three decades on death row and was originally scheduled to be put to death in June 2021. He asked for clemency last year because he has terminal bladder cancer, heart disease, diabetes and decreased intellectual function.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A mountain lion that roamed residential neighborhoods in the state capital was sedated Friday and taken to a sanctuary that houses big cats, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources said. The young male cat was tranquilized by staff with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services branch and sent to the Exotic Feline Rescue Center in Center Point, Indiana, the state agency said. IDNR wildlife experts, Illinois Conservation Police, the USDA and the Springfield Police Department determined the animal had entered areas of the city where he would be a threat to people or property. The animal, which was fitted last year with a GPS collar by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, had wandered to Illinois from Nebraska. It arrived in Springfield on Wednesday, and IDNR warned residents not to disturb it while the agency tracked its movements. The DNR asked people to leave the mountain lion alone because the animals are a protected species in Illinois, and it’s illegal to kill them unless they pose an imminent threat to person or property. Its appearance in Springfield marks the second time in recent weeks a mountain lion has been detected in Illinois. The DNR said a mountain lion was struck and killed Oct. 16 by a vehicle along Interstate 88 in DeKalb County.\n\nIndiana\n\nCrown Point: A fifth grade teacher in northwestern Indiana charged with felony intimidation after authorities say she told a student she had a “kill list” of students and staff has agreed to stay away from the school. Angelica Carrasquillo, 25, of Griffith, signed a no-contact order Friday without objection when she appeared wearing a green jail uniform in Lake Superior Court, The Times of Northwest Indiana reports. Judge Kathleen Lang affirmed Carrasquillo’s not guilty plea to one felony count of intimidation. Carrasquillo was being held with a bond set at $20,000 surety or $2,000 cash. Court documents say Carrasquillo communicated “a threat to commit murder” on Oct. 12. Once officials at the school where she was employed, St. Stanislaus in East Chicago, learned of the threat, they immediately confronted her and escorted her from the building, the Diocese of Gary said in a message to parents. When Carrasquillo was asked why she wanted to kill herself and others, she reportedly told school officials: “I’m having trouble with my mental health, and sometimes the kids do not listen in the classroom. I also have trauma caused when I went to high school.” But Carrasquillo also allegedly told school officials that “she was only joking about it all.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A judge should allow a law passed in 2018 that bans most abortions to take effect, three years after the measure was ruled unconstitutional, lawyers for Gov. Kim Reynolds argued Friday. Chris Schandevel, a lawyer for the Republican governor, said Judge Celene Gogerty should set aside a 2019 permanent injunction that prevented Iowa from enforcing a law that would block abortions once cardiac activity can be detected. That is usually around six weeks into pregnancy and before many women know they’re pregnant. Schandevel said the injunction rests entirely on an Iowa Supreme Court 2018 decision that guaranteed the right to an abortion under the state constitution and cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992 and 1973 that established abortion rights nationally. All three cases were overruled this year by more conservative courts, and given that, Reynolds’ lawyers argued the judge should reverse the injunction and let the 2018 law take effect. Rita Bettis Austen, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, countered that there is no precedent or legal support in Iowa for a judge to reverse a final judgment entered three years ago. The judge said she would issue a ruling soon.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Voters are being asked to reduce the authority of the governor and other state officials and give legislators a bigger say in how the state regulates businesses, protects the environment and preserves residents’ health. A proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution on the Nov. 8 ballot would make it easier for the Republican-controlled Legislature to overturn regulations written by state agencies and boards – those under the control of the governor but also others in the executive branch of state government. At issue are rules as varied as which shots are required for children attending school and how often hotels must clean guest rooms. Business groups and advocates of smaller government view the measure as reining in unelected bureaucrats. But in the fall campaign’s final weeks, abortion rights advocates have begun warning that it is another attempted power grab by far-right legislators. The November vote comes three months after voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposed amendment to eliminate state constitutional protections for abortion and give lawmakers authority to more tightly regulate or ban the procedure. Those who oppose the regulation amendment have repurposed the “vote no” yard signs from the abortion vote for their fall campaign.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Jefferson County Public Schools has received the largest gift in its history, according to the district, with plans to invest the funds in some of the city’s most disadvantaged schools. A total of $20 million was put forward by philanthropist MacKenzie Scott for Louisville’s public school district, officials said at a press conference Thursday. The money will go toward “direct financial support for JCPS,” district officials said in a release. JCPS Superintendent Marty Pollio said the gift came following an interview with a consulting firm that represents several unnamed philanthropists. Three months later, he said, Scott’s team called to tell him about the planned donation to JCPS. “We also promised this community that we would fund the schools in an appropriate way so that the families in this community would have equity in selection,” Pollio said at the event at the Academy @ Shawnee in Louisville’s West End. “You can’t go to a high-poverty school across America and see something like this.” Pollio said the $20 million influx in cash will help address growing inequity in supplemental funding – cash that schools receive through parent-teacher associations, athletic events, booster clubs and alumni associations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Roads: Authorities are looking for a stolen sign marking a centuries-old tree that inspired author Ernest Gaines. The Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff’s Office said the historical marker identifying the “Miss Jane Pittman Oak” was stolen recently, and the parish government is offering a $500 reward for information leading to its recovery or the thief’s arrest, news outlets report. The tree itself, believed to be about 400 years old, served as partial inspiration for “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,” which gained widespread notice for the internationally acclaimed, award-winning author. The book describes a first-person narrative of a fictional 110-year-old woman born into slavery. Historians have said Gaines regularly walked past the oak tree, which sits along Louisiana Highway 16 in Lakeland, a village in the parish, on his way to the grocery store. In 2008, state officials considered cutting down the oak because its low-hanging branches posed a potential threat to passing cars. But the state ultimately relented amid pushback from Gaines and other activists, opting instead to trim the branches. Tips leading to an arrest or recovery of the marker should be directed to the sheriff’s office at 225-694-3737. Gaines, who died in 2019 at age 86, will be depicted on a stamp next year, the U.S. Postal Service announced last week.\n\nMaine\n\nHallowell: The Maine Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday approved a pair of energy projects that would generate enough wind power for up to 900,000 homes along with construction of a new transmission corridor to get the electricity to the regional power grid. The PUC was required by law to choose the projects to boost transmission capacity and renewable energy in Aroostook County. It chose LS Power Base for a 345-kilovolt transmission project and Longroad Energy’s King Pine for a wind generation project, but it didn’t rule on how how much of the cost would be borne by Maine ratepayers. Together, the net cost of the projects is $1.8 billion over a 30-year period, but they would benefit the state, officials said. An influx of energy into the regional grid would “place downward pressure on electricity prices, benefitting consumers in Maine and throughout New England,” said PUC Chair Philip L. Bartlett II. It’s a similar to the proposed 145-mile transmission line that would be a conduit for 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower to the New England power grid, but it would serve a different purpose. State voters rebuked the New England Clean Energy Connect last November, and work was halted pending the outcome of a lawsuit.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Two legislators have called for an independent review of the state Department of Natural Resources’ handling of repeated complaints against the former manager at Gunpowder Falls State Park. A Baltimore County grand jury indicted former longtime manager Michael Browning last Monday on charges that include rape and assault. The Baltimore Sun reports that state Sen. Sarah Elfreth and Del. Eric Luedtke called for the review in a letter to Jeannie Haddaway-Riccio, Maryland’s secretary of natural resources. “The behavior and lack of accountability described is inexcusable and requires prompt action by the Department to address the issues raised and ensure that a similar situation never happens again,” the letter says. Baltimore County Police arrested Browning, 71, in September and charged him with sexually assaulting a former park employee. According to charging documents, the woman told police she met Browning as a teenager while attending a youth club his wife ran before working with Browning at the park. Police wrote in charging documents that the two had a yearslong consensual relationship. The woman told police that she tried to end the relationship and that Browning raped her 10 to 15 times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Police and school officials are trying to figure out how a 7-year-old child managed to bring a loaded gun to school. Police responded to UP Academy Holland in the city’s Dorchester neighborhood about 3:30 p.m. Thursday for a report of a student with a firearm, police said in a statement on the department’s website. Responding officers confiscated the weapon. No injuries were reported. “I’m speechless. I don’t have the words. This is truly devastating,” Boston Public Schools Superintendent Mary Skipper said in a statement. “We have to ask ourselves how a very young student becomes in possession of and gains access to a firearm.” Mayor Michelle Wu pledged to hold the person who allowed the child access to the gun accountable. “No child should be near a weapon, much less directly endangered at such a young age,” she said. No additional information was released. “The Boston Police Department is focused on the proliferation of guns in our city and keeping access to them away from the youngest among us needs to be a priority for everyone,” Police Commissioner Michael Cox said. The school has about 770 students from kindergarten through fifth grade, according to its website. Police are still investigating.\n\nMichigan\n\nWyandotte:There’s nothing sweet about bringing home a cockroach, so trick-or-treating is off limits in a suburban Detroit neighborhood. Officials in Wyandotte said a cockroach infestation has been confirmed at a vacant home after a tip from a trash hauler. The pests have been moving to other homes. Sidewalks will be closed Monday night on a portion of 20th Street. City engineer Greg Mayhew said a Halloween ban will prevent “further roach migration.” Officials don’t want the bugs hitching a ride on costumes. The city is trying to exterminate the roaches, but “it will take some time,” Mayhew said. Walking the street could help kill the cockroaches, but their eggs still could spread and survive, City Council member Todd Hanna said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Election officials held a public demonstration of voting machines Friday as part of an effort to maintain public trust and transparency in election systems that have drawn coordinated attacks from ex-President Donald Trump and others. Minneapolis Director of Elections and Voter Services Katie Smith showed election judges from around the city how to test the voting equipment: Turn on the tabulator machine, feed the pre-marked set of test ballots into the machine, print off the results, and make sure the results exactly match the ballots. More than two dozen people tested the tabulator machines and assistive voting devices – which help voters zoom in, print and read their ballots with Braille, if needed – at the demonstration at the city’s election and voter services building. Smith said the public accuracy test, which is required under state law, is important because it lets members of the public see their votes are going to be correctly and accurately counted on election night. Around the country, some voters have expressed skepticism about election systems since Trump and others have falsely claimed that widespread voter fraud led to President Joe Biden being elected. After nearly two years, no evidence has shown that voting machines were manipulated to steal the 2020 election or that there was any widespread fraud.\n\nMississippi\n\nMound Bayou: The tiny, all-Black town of Mound Bayou became a safe haven for Emmett Till’s mother as she traveled to Mississippi to testify in the murder trial of two white men who lynched her son in 1955. Hundreds of people – a good portion of Mound Bayou’s 1,500 residents – turned out Thursday evening to watch the movie “Till.” The feature film went into wide release across the U.S. over the weekend after being in limited release since Oct. 14. “This place, this city, is very sacred to the story of Emmett Till,” one of the filmmakers, Keith Beauchamp, told the mostly Black audience in the gymnasium/auditorium of Mound Bayou’s John F. Kennedy High School. The screening happened days after a bronze statue of Till was unveiled about 50 miles away in Greenwood. Beauchamp is one of the producers and writers of “Till,” which largely focuses on Mamie Till-Mobley’s reaction to the loss of her only child and her evolution into a civil rights leader. Mound Bayou was founded by formerly enslaved people in the cotton-growing Mississippi Delta in 1887 as a freestanding community where Black people could thrive amid the hostility of the Jim Crow era.\n\nMissouri\n\nFlorissant: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed testing inside a school closed amid concerns of radioactive contamination, and sampling of soil outside the school has begun, Corps officials said Friday. A suburban St. Louis school board voted last week to close Jana Elementary School in Florissant after testing by a private firm found levels of radioactive isotope lead-210 that were 22 times the expected level on the kindergarten playground. It also found high levels of polonium, radium and other material inside the school, which sits along Coldwater Creek, contaminated decades ago with Manhattan Project atomic waste. The Corps said in a news release that radiation detection instruments were used to scan surfaces inside the school. Sampling of soil outside the school is expected to go on for another two weeks, the Corps said. The agency plans to sample at least 45 spots, with depths ranging from 15 to 28 feet below the surface. Preliminary test results are expected in November. The approximate 400 students at Jana Elementary are taking virtual classes for the next month, then will be reassigned to other schools. Coldwater Creek was contaminated in the 1940s and 1950s when waste from atomic bomb material manufactured in St. Louis got into the waterway near Lambert Airport, where the waste was stored. The result was an environmental nightmare that resulted in a Superfund declaration in 1989.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Two conservation groups have filed a lawsuit against the state and its wildlife management agency, alleging it illegally set hunting and trapping policies and quotas intended to reduce the gray wolf population by making it easier to kill the predators. WildEarth Guardians and Project Coyote filed the lawsuit Thursday in District Court in Helena asking for the new laws and resulting increased quotas to be overturned. Montana’s Republican-controlled Legislature in 2021 passed bills that allowed the state to reduce the wolf population, authorize additional hunting methods, allow extended hunting seasons, allow an individual to kill up to 20 wolves, and allow private parties to offer bounties for hunting or trapping wolves. The conservation groups allege management decisions are being made based on a wolf plan that was created in 2002 and was amended to use a new wolf population model without following state rulemaking procedures and without public participation. The state Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks does not comment on pending litigation, spokesperson Greg Lemon said Friday. Montana officials authorized the killing of 450 wolves during the winter of 2021-22 but ended up shutting down hunting near Yellowstone National Park after 23 wolves from the park were killed, all but five in Montana.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Dueling lawsuits have been dropped by a former candidate for governor and a fellow Republican state lawmaker who accused him of groping her at a political function several years ago. Charles W. Herbster, who lost his bid in May to become the GOP nominee for governor despite an early endorsement from ex-President Donald Trump, sued state Sen. Julie Slama for defamation after she told the Nebraska Examiner that, in 2019, Herbster reached under her skirt and groped her at the Douglas County Republican Party event when she was 22. Slama was one of eight women who accused Herbster of unwanted groping, but Slama was the only one to go on the record with her name. Herbster denied the allegations and painted them as a politically motivated attack. Slama quickly countersued, accusing Herbster of sexual battery. The competing lawsuits had largely stalled in the months since being filed, with both sides seeking delays. Online court records show that both sides on Wednesday submitted motions to dismiss their lawsuits with prejudice, meaning they can’t be refiled. On Thursday, the judge granted the motion. Neither the motion nor the judge’s order addressed why the parties sought to dismiss their respective lawsuits.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A rural county roiled by voting machine conspiracy theories stopped its unprecedented effort Friday to hand-count ballots cast in advance of Election Day. But Nye County officials vowed to reshape their plan and seek another go-ahead from the Nevada Supreme Court, after justices ruled late Thursday that counting methods used last week violated rules they set to prevent the county from allowing early disclosure of election results. “Yesterday’s Supreme Court order requires us to make some changes to our hand count process,” Nye County officials said in a statement issued Friday that promised to “resume as soon as our plan is in compliance with the court’s order and approved by the secretary of state.” Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada said they stood ready to challenge any effort to restart the hand tallies this week and don’t believe there’s any hand-counting scenario that would pass legal muster. The civil rights advocacy group accused Nye County officials of failing to prevent public release of early results before polls close to in-person voting Nov. 8. It argued that reading candidates’ names aloud from ballots within hearing distance of public observers violated the court rule.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Democratic U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster and Republican challenger Robert Burns frequently took jabs and interrupted one another over COVID-19 funding, drug addiction treatment and abortion rights during their first debate Friday for New Hampshire’s 2nd Congressional District seat. Burns said many companies are suffering now because of reckless government spending. “My opponent here talks about the need for the federal government to help build businesses ... I built my business without the help of the federal government,” said Burns, who runs a quality control and pharmaceutical safety company in Bedford. “That’s not true when you consider the Paycheck Protection loan that you took,” Kuster said. Burns responded: “That was 10 years later.” Kuster expressed her support for suboxone medication to treat opioid addiction, saying it is helping her own brother. Burns said statistics have shown that isn’t true and accused her campaign of being funded by its manufacturers. Burns, who says he is pro-life and supported the overturn of Roe v. Wade, was asked to clarify his proposal to form “panels” that would require a second and third opinion when a woman, in his words, is “being forced to have an abortion.” Burns said “probably misspoke a little bit” in his use of the word “panel” and said he was referring to the mental health of the mother.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold Borough: A “significant” piece of historic artwork depicting George Washington at the Battle of Monmouth may be sold by the Monmouth County Historical Association for millions of dollars, drawing opposition from historians who claim the MCHA museum would lose a valuable piece of history. Titled “Washington Rallying the Troops at Monmouth,” the painting by Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze, a legendary German artist, dates to 1857. It recreates Washington’s involvement in the historic battle that occurred in June 1778. “I think it would be pathetically tragic to sell one of the key pieces of the association’s major collection,” said Joe Hammond, a former curator of the MCHA museum and one-time director of the association. “It is a regional collection of national significance, and the painting of Washington rallying the troops at Monmouth is one of the most significant.” But with a price tag that could reach tens of millions of dollars, MCHA officials contend it is worth investigating a potential sale. The new interest is likely the result of a recent multimillion-dollar sale of another Washington painting by Leutze. His famed “Washington Crossing the Delaware” piece fetched more than $45 million in May, according to Christie’s.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The FBI confirmed Friday that it is investigating a report from a Santa Fe-based environmental advocacy group that it received mail containing antisemitic imagery and a suspicious powdery substance inside. FBI spokesman Frank Fisher said in an email that the substance was tested and determined not to be harmful. Further details were not being released in order to protect the integrity the investigation, he said. Conservation Voters New Mexico Executive Director Demis Foster said the group received an envelope Wednesday in the mail that included a brown, powdery substance inside along with a torn-up political flier that the group distributed in support of a Democratic state House representative who is running for reelection. The mail included a reference to the Nazi Party, a swastika and other antisemitic symbols, Foster said. She said first responders including police evacuated the building, and an employee who opened the mail was released unharmed from a hospital after undergoing observation. Foster said she and her employees are working remotely as a precaution, while continuing their advocacy for environmental causes and endorsed political candidates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, who fought poverty and racism and skillfully navigated New York’s power structure as pastor of Harlem’s historic Abyssinian Baptist Church, died Friday at age 73, the church announced. “The Butts Family and entire Abyssinian Baptist Church membership solicit your prayers for us in our bereavement,” the church said on its website. No cause of death was given. Butts began serving as a youth minister at Abyssinian in 1972 and was senior pastor there for more than 30 years. He also served as president of the State University of New York at Old Westbury, on Long Island, from 1999 to 2020. His post at Abyssinian gave Butts one of the most prominent pulpits in the U.S. The church traces its roots to 1808 when a group of Black worshippers who refused to accept segregation at the First Baptist Church of New York City left to form their own congregation. The church’s current home on 138th Street in Harlem is a massive Tudor and Gothic revival structure dedicated in 1923 and designated a city landmark in 1993. Earlier pastors at Abyssinian included Adam Clayton Powell Sr. and his son Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the first African American to be elected to Congress from New York.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The two North Carolina Supreme Court seats up for election in November have taken on extra significance as the outcome could flip the court’s partisan makeup during a period of political polarization. Registered Democrats hold a 4-3 advantage on the court, but Republicans would retake the majority for the first time since 2016 should they win at least one race. The seats carry eight-year terms, so barring unplanned retirements, Republicans would be assured of keeping the upper hand for at least 41/ 2 years if successful. Outside groups are spending big to influence the races. In the two largest television markets alone, two super PACs have committed spending roughly $3 million on ads, according to documents filed with the Federal Communications Commission. In keeping with nonjudicial elections this year, ads have focused on crime and abortion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state auditor said Thursday that an examination of North Dakota’s electoral systems conducted in response to voter concerns found that they are “incredibly secure.” Auditor Josh Gallion said he undertook the review in response to concerns nationally that false claims of election fraud and conspiracies are threats to democracy. “We looked at any potential weaknesses in the election system of our state that could be exploited by someone with nefarious intent,” Gallion said. “The determination after extensive review from our contractor was that our election systems are incredibly secure across our state.” The review found six vulnerabilities to the state’s election system but all were labeled “low risk,” Gallion said. The report identified the vulnerabilities as the the ability for a voter to cast multiple ballots, identity theft of deceased voters, stuffing or discarding valid absentee ballots, equipment tampering, and absentee ballot fraud. Gallion said his office received many inquiries from residents and others about North Dakota’s election security following the 2020 election, fueled by former President Donald Trump’s false claims of election fraud. One inquiry came from MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, who has echoed lies that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The first major retrospective of artist Maurice Sendak’s work since his 2012 death – and the largest and most complete to date – opened this month at the Columbus Museum of Art and runs through March 5, 2023. Most people today know Sendak as the creator of children’s book classics such as “Where the Wild Things Are” and “In the Night Kitchen.” A new exhibition of his work looks at that reputation and a less well-known side of his immense output: his work as a designer for opera, theater, film, and television. “We wanted people to understand that Maurice was actually a serious artist,” said Lynn Caponera, executive director of the Maurice Sendak Foundation in Ridgefield, Connecticut. Though most knew him as an illustrator and picture book artist, “they didn’t see beyond the fact that he did a lot more than that,” she said. “Wild Things are Happening” opened this month at the Columbus Museum of Art and runs through March 5, 2023. It’s the first major retrospective of Sendak’s work since his 2012 death and the largest and most complete to date. The exhibit takes its name from a 1990s advertising campaign Sendak did for Bell Atlantic that featured Wild Things characters promoting “a fast, dependable Internet service.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nBroken Arrow: The deaths of eight family members – including six children found in a burning Oklahoma home – are being investigated as a murder-suicide, authorities said Friday. Police are trying to determine whether both adults were involved in the killings. The children, who ranged in age from 1 to 13, were the victims, Broken Arrow Police Chief Brandon Berryhill said during a news conference. He did not provide their identities, ages or explain their relationships to one another except to say they were family members believed to be living in the home. Police said both adults who live in the home were considered “primary suspects” because they were found dead in the front of the home while the children were all found in a bedroom, where the fire was contained. A police spokesman declined to say whether authorities believe the two adults were both responsible for the killings or whether it could be just one of them. “It’s because investigators are still trying to piece together what happened with eight people dead,” police spokesman Ethan Hutchins said in an email to the Associated Press. Hutchins also said police would not be able to identify the dead adults until the medical examiner’s office has completed its work.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials in the Trump administration compiled extensive intelligence dossiers on people who were arrested, even for minor offenses, during Black Lives Matter protests in Oregon. Initial drafts of the dossiers even included friends of the subjects as well as their interests, but those were later removed and replaced with a note that they would be made available upon request, according to an internal review by the Department of Homeland Security. The dossiers, known by agents as baseball cards, were previously normally compiled on non-U.S. citizens or only on Americans with “a demonstrated terrorism nexus,” according to the 76-page report. It was previously released last year but contains new revelations based on extensive redactions that were removed by the Biden administration. Ben Wizner, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union’s free speech, privacy and technology project, said the report indicates leaders of the Department of Homeland Security wanted to inflate the risk caused by protesters in Portland. The city became an epicenter of sometimes violent demonstrations in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a Minneapolis police officer. But many protesters, including women belonging to a “Wall of Moms” ad hoc group and military veterans, were peaceful.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Authorities say they have recovered a gun believed to have been thrown off a bridge by a suspect after a shooting that injured six people, one critically, outside a church where a funeral was being held. Pittsburgh Public Safety officials said a river rescue team working off the McKees Rocks Bridge on Sunday morning was able to locate a firearm matching the description of the firearm used in Friday’s shooting outside Destiny of Faith Church. Officials said the weapon found had a bullet in the chamber and had been reported stolen in Shaler Township. Nineteen-year-old Shawn Davis of McKees Rocks and a 16-year-old Pittsburgh youth are both charged with attempted homicide, aggravated assault and weapons counts in the noontime gunfire Friday outside the church where a funeral was being held for a man killed in a shooting earlier this month. The service was being livestreamed, and the video showed several people screaming and ducking for cover. It wasn’t clear if any shots went into the church. One person was taken to a hospital in critical condition while four other shooting victims were listed as stable. A sixth person injured trying to escape was also treated.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Backed by Brown University, Vartan Gregorian Elementary School has opened a hands-on, interactive classroom meant to help students explore science, technology, engineering, art and math in a fresh new space. Three groups of fourth and fifth graders were assigned a challenge Friday to figure out a way to raise a tiny flag using three machines and six chain reactions – without electricity. After a couple of false starts, fifth grader Noelle Ingle’s team propelled a tiny ball down a ramp, which struck a series of matchbox cars, which raised a card-size version of the Brown University flag. The room erupted in cheers. The Rube Goldberg machine was the first experiment in Gregorian’s new STEAM lab. Brown University spent approximately $200,000 renovating the dingy third grade classroom, installing new windows, floors and a sink and buying new furniture, including ricochet stools that allow students to wiggle while seated. The university also purchased whiteboards, a smart television and a microscope with up to 1,200x magnification. The shelves are already filled with robot and model car kits, magnetic play tiles and Legos. Brown has had a decades­long partnership with the elementary school, named after Vartan Gregorian, Brown’s larger-than-life president, who served from 1989 to 1997 and died April 15.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials are scheduled to vote Tuesday on a resolution that would restrict children from accessing public library books and electronic materials that are “promoting sexuality.” Local news outlets report the proposed Greenville County Council measure would direct trustees of the Greenville County Library System to order books and electronic materials removed from the county’s 12 libraries. The resolution also orders the library trustees to report “how such books ever found their way into the children’s sections of our public libraries” and to say how they will prevent them returning. As is true nationwide, controversies over materials dealing with LGBTQ and racial themes have been roiling South Carolina schools and public libraries for a year, particularly in the heavily Republican Upstate region. A large number of opponents spoke against restricting books during a Greenville County Council meeting in September, saying it targets books with LGBTQ themes. “These materials are not innately sexualized, they are not innately about sex, they are just about who we are and those should continue to exist,” Tyler Prescott of the Upstate LGBTQ+ Chamber of Commerce told councilors then. Republican Councilor Joe Dill, who is sponsoring the resolution, said in September that the county needs to also consider other people who are offended.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Two critically endangered red wolves have arrived at the Great Plains Zoo from facilities in Texas and Washington. There are fewer than two dozen red wolves living in the wild, the zoo said in a press release, making them the most endangered canid species in the world. The wolves’ placement at zoo is part of a species survival plan, which aims to breed pairs with the greatest possible genetic diversity. “With only around 20 individuals remaining in the wild, the survival of the red wolf species is contingent the concerted help of accredited zoos and conservation partners with species survival breeding and reintroduction plans,” CEO Becky Dewitz said in a statement. “Weare grateful and dedicated to helping save the red wolf from extinction.” The male and female wolves are still getting used to each other and their new habitat, so the path by their enclosure will be blocked for ZooBoo, which takes place this Friday through Sunday. The zoo asks patrons respect the barricades as the wolves adjust.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee Historical Commission is taking applications for awards to honor people or groups that work to study and preserve the state’s heritage. The commission said Thursday that its Certificates of Merit are presented each May, during National Preservation Month. The deadline for submissions is Dec. 31. Patrick McIntyre, State Historic Preservation Officer and executive director of the commission, said the awards program “highlights people and organizations for the work they do in the areas of publication, commemoration, and education regarding our state’s unique history and heritage.” “For 47 years our awards program has offered an opportunity to give thanks and recognition to those working to champion and revitalize Tennessee’s historic places,” McIntyre said. Applications can be found on the commission’s website.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state police chief said Thursday that his department “did not fail” Uvalde during the hesitant law enforcement response to the Robb Elementary School shooting, as a Republican congressman joined angry parents of some of the 19 children killed in the May attack in calling for him to resign. Col. Steve McCraw, the head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, acknowledged mistakes by officers while several Uvalde families confronted him in Austin over multiple outrages: why police waited more than 70 minutes before entering the fourth-grade classroom and killing the gunman, false and shifting accounts given by authorities, and records that remain withheld more than five months later. But McCraw defended his agency, and during a meeting of the state’s Public Safety Commission, made the case that failures uncovered to date did not warrant his removal while saying he was not shirking from accountability. Uvalde families bristled and asked how DPS could not have failed, given that troopers were among the first on the scene. “I can tell you this right now, DPS as an institution, right now, did not fail the community,” McCraw said. “Plain and simple.” Significantly, Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales said for the first time after the meeting that McCraw should also lose his job, becoming the first major figure in the GOP to call for a change at the top of Texas’ state police force.\n\nUtah\n\nSouth Jordan: U.S. Rep. Burgess Owens and Democratic challenger Darlene McDonald agreed on none of the issues addressed Friday in their only debate before the midterm elections, with each largely echoing their party’s talking points on inflation, abortion and infrastructure spending. In an untelevised debate in the basement of a suburban real estate office with an audience of only campaign staff and half a dozen reporters, the Utah Republican blamed Democrats and President Joe Biden for fentanyl being imported across the U.S.-Mexico border, racial division and inflation. Owens accused Democrats of pushing critical race theory – an academic framework that connects the country’s history, including the legacy of slavery, to contemporary racism – and said that it’s destroying the country’s social fabric. “One thing that the Biden administration has accomplished is that they’ve given us a common purpose again,” Owens, one of two Black Republicans in the U.S. House, added. “We now share in what’s called misery, as a people.” McDonald, who is also Black, countered that Owens was spreading falsehoods to drum up fear – about both the nature of protests against police brutality and the idea that critical race theory was being taught in K-12 schools.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: A man charged with the 1989 stabbing deaths of his in-laws in the town of Danby after modern DNA techniques linked him to the crime pleaded not guilty Friday during a court hearing. The arraignment of Michael Louise in Vermont Superior Court in Rutland came two days after he was returned to Vermont from New York to answer charges in the deaths of George Peacock, 76, and Catherine Peacock, 73. He had been scheduled for arraignment Thursday but the hearing was delayed 24 hours. Louise entered the pleas and then was ordered held without bail, said Vermont State Police spokesperson Adam Silverman, who monitored the hearing remotely. Louise, 79, who was married to one of the Peacocks’ daughters, was identified as a suspect about two weeks later after the couple was found dead in their Danby home in September 1989. Investigators at the time developed circumstantial evidence tying Louise to the killings, but there was not enough to charge him, police said in an affidavit filed in the case. Louise told conflicting stories about whether he had traveled to Vermont from his home in Liverpool, New York, on Sept. 13, 1989, the day the Peacocks were believed to have been killed. Their bodies were discovered Sept. 17 after neighbors went to check on the couple.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The U.S. Coast Guard, a crew of scientists and others launched an air and sea mission to rescue 13 people, including a child, from a fishing vessel just moments before it sank in darkness early Friday in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Virginia, authorities said. The 115-foot Tremont fishing vessel collided with the 1000-foot Panamanian-flagged container vessel MSC Rita, about 60 miles from shore, the Coast Guard said in a statement. The Tremont sent out a mayday call that it was taking on water and sinking with 13 people aboard that was received by watchstanders with Coast Guard Sector Virginia, officials said. That call was also heard by Atlantis, a 274-foot ship operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Falmouth, Massachusetts, at about 1:45 a.m., WHOI said in an email to The Associated Press. The captain of the Atlantis contacted the Coast Guard and motored 8 miles west to the fishing vessel. The Coast Guard launched an MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter crew and an HC-130 Hercules airplane crew from its air station in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, the Coast Guard said. It also dispatched a motor lifeboat crew from its station in Chincoteague, on Virginia’s Eastern Shore, and diverted the Coast Guard Cutter Rollin Fritch to assist.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: The city’s dress code ordinance saying bikini baristas must cover their bodies at work has been ruled unconstitutional by a federal court. The decision in a partial summary judgment last week came after a lengthy legal battle between bikini baristas and the city of Everett over the rights of workers to wear what they want, the Everett Herald reports. Everett is about 30 miles north of Seattle. U.S. District Court in Seattle found Everett’s dress code ordinance violated the Equal Protection clauses of the U.S. and Washington state constitutions. The Court found that the ordinance was, at least in part, shaped by a gender-based discriminatory purpose, according to a 19-page ruling signed by U.S. District Judge Ricardo S. Martinez. It is difficult to imagine, the court wrote, how the ordinance would be equally applied to men and women in practice because it prohibits clothing “typically worn by women rather than men,” including midriff and scoop-back shirts, as well as bikinis. Bikini baristas were “clearly” a target of the ordinance, the court also ruled, adding that the profession is comprised of a workforce that is almost entirely women.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Local chefs and surgeons put their carving skills to the test for the Huntington Children’s Museum Pumpkin Carving Contest at The Market’s outdoor patio in downtown Huntington. Jessica McCormick, of Huntington, brought her two children, 10-year-old Iris and 4-year-old Oscar, to the event on Tuesday, which also featured the Marshall Nutrition Program, a dance floor with a fog machine, and other contests and events for kids. “They loved this event last year, and they love checking out the carved pumpkins, too,” said McCormick, who is the vice president of the museum’s board of directors. “We have been waiting for a children’s museum in Huntington since Iris was a baby. I hope everyone will get involved and donate to such a great cause.” Drew Hetzer, of Backyard Pizza and Raw Bar and The Peddler, was one of the local dining legends competing in the contest that also included Jonathan Patterson of Le Bistro and Jordan Hagy of La Famiglia. “I’m sticking with a pizza theme, but with a Halloween twist on it,” Hetzer said. Participating surgeons included doctors Ashleigh Clickett, Courtney Crain, Michael Gentile, Farzad Amiri and Ben Moosavi. “I will attempt carving a breastfeeding mother with a baby,” said Clickett, an obstetrics and gynecology specialist at Valley Health. “Cutting a pumpkin is a lot different than human skin, so it will be much different. I just want to have fun with it and help a great cause at the same time.” Votes for the best pumpkin can be made with donations to Huntington Children’s Museum online at givebutter.com/hcmpumpkin.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: An appeals court is refusing to block a lower court’s ruling prohibiting voters who already submitted an absentee ballot from voiding it and voting again, a rarely used practice known as ballot spoiling. The 2nd District Court of Appeals decided Thursday against hearing an appeal of a Waukesha County circuit court judge’s ruling this month in favor of a conservative group founded by prominent Republicans. That ruling required the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission to rescind its guidance that allowed the spoiling of ballots that had already been cast. Voters who obtained an absentee ballot, but have not yet voted and want to obtain a new one, can still do that. The elections commission held an emergency meeting Friday, less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 election, and unanimously voted to rescind the guidance issued in August detailing how an already cast ballot could be spoiled. Very few voters have actually spoiled their absentee ballots after voting in recent elections, data provided by the elections commission to the Associated Press shows. In the August primary, just 3,519 people cast a new ballot after spoiling their original one, less than 0.3% of all votes cast, the data shows.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Three wolves shot and killed in the state are drawing attention across the border. Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials believe the animals may have belonged to their state’s closely watched North Park wolf pack. The North Park pack, which often crosses into Wyoming where hunting wolves is legal, gained notoriety last year after birthing Colorado’s first known litter of pups in 80 years. Travis Duncan, spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, said in an email that the agency cannot yet confirm whether the slain wolves were in the North Park pack but will continue to monitor the animals “if and when they are next seen in the area.” Duncan added that at least two wolves were seen Friday in northern Colorado. In Colorado, killing a wolf can bring a $100,000 fine and up to a year in prison. But once all four paws are across the border into Wyoming, wolves are in the state’s “predator zone” where anyone can legally hunt the animals without a license. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The difference in state laws could impede Colorado’s planned reintroduction of wolves that was narrowly approved by voters in a controversial 2019 ballot initiative. The introduction is planned for 2023 on the sparsely populated Western Slope.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/03/ukraine-russia-invasion-live-updates/9353494002/", "title": "Fire extinguished at nuclear plant in Ukraine after Russian attacks ...", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Thursday, March. 3. Follow here for the latest updates and news from Friday, March 4, as Russia's invasion continues in the region.\n\nAuthorities in Ukraine said Friday that a fire at Europe's largest nuclear plant after enduring heavy shelling from Russian forces in the southern of Enerhodar has been extinguished.\n\nIn a statement, Ukraine's regional military administration said there was damage to the compartment of reactor No. 1 at the Zaporizhzhia plant in the city of Enerhodar, but it does not affect the safety of the power unit, adding that operational personnel are ensuring its safety.\n\nNo information was immediately available about casualties. Ukrainian officials said that radiation levels in the area weren’t at dangerous levels.\n\nU.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said late Thursday that she had spoken to her counterpart in Ukraine, and said the \"plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down.\"\n\nA White House official said President Joe Biden spoke with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday about the situation at the nuclear plant. The latest information shows no indications of elevated levels of radiation, but officials are monitoring the situation closely, the official said.\n\nIn an emotional speech in the middle of the night, Zelenskyy said he feared an explosion that would be “the end for everyone. The end for Europe. The evacuation of Europe.”\n\n“Only urgent action by Europe can stop the Russian troops,” he said. “Do not allow the death of Europe from a catastrophe at a nuclear power station.”\n\nThe assault renewed fears that the invasion could damage one of Ukraine’s 15 nuclear reactors and set off another emergency like the 1986 Chernobyl accident, the world’s worst nuclear disaster, which happened about 65 miles north of the capital.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council in “coming hours” to raise the issue of Russia’s attack on the nuclear power plant, according to a statement from his office.\n\nQuick links:\n\nGET THE LATEST UKRAINE UPDATES:We'll email you the latest news once a day.\n\nON THE BORDER:Ukrainian refugees describe harrowing journey to Poland\n\nMAPPING AND TRACKING RUSSIA'S INVASION:See the latest on troop movements\n\nLatest developments:\n\n►On Thursday, Ukraine said it has agreed with Russia to create safe corridors backed by cease-fires to evacuate civilians and deliver aid as the parties engaged in a second round of negotiations amid Russia's ferocious assault on its neighbor.\n\n►The Pentagon said it established a direct communication line Tuesday with the Russian ministry of defense “for the purpose of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalation.”\n\n►French President Emmanuel Macron spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin for 90 minutes and now believes “the worst is yet to come,\" a Macron aide told France24.

Wolfsthal, former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security Council, tweeted that the Zaporizhzhia power plant was \"inherently more safe and protected than the Chernobyl.\"\n\nJames M. Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. echoed Jennex's assessment of the danger posed by the Russian attack, saying the fire could result in a \"Fukushima-style meltdown.\"\n\nIn that nuclear incident in Japan, a massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011 destroyed the Fukushima plant’s cooling systems, triggering the meltdown of three reactors and the release of large amounts of radiation, and causing more than 160,000 people to evacuate.\n\nThe Chernobyl disaster, while geographically close, was caused by a different process, Acton told USA TODAY. It was caused by operator error and led to a different level of danger — a situation where the nuclear fuel explodes.

The yacht was recently seized by Germany. The White House called Usmanov \"a close ally of Putin.''\n\nThe Biden administration is also imposing travel restrictions on 19 Russian oligarchs and their 47 family members and close associates. According to the White House, those oligarchs are known for directing, authorizing, funding or supporting Russia’s foreign policy. The administration has taken steps to place visa restrictions on the group.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said the sanctions are cutting off Russia's access to technology and the global financial system, and that they are having a deep impact.\n\n“The goal is to maximize the impact on Putin and Russia and minimize the harm and loss to our allies and friends around the world,” Biden said. “Our interest is in maintaining the strongest unified economic impact campaign on Putin in all history.”\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nFormer Fox producer charged with violating sanctions against Russia for its 2014 takeover of Crimea\n\nFormer Fox News producer Jack Hanick was charged with sanctions violations and lying to the FBI in the first such indictment arising from sanctions over Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the Justice Department said Thursday.\n\nAccording to court documents unsealed in federal court in Manhattan, the 71-year-old Hanick worked for years for Konstantin Malofeyev even after the Russian oligarch was sanctioned for financing Russians promoting separatism in Crimea and elsewhere in Ukraine.\n\nThe indictment said Hanick, a U.S. citizen, “knowingly chose to help Malofeyev spread his destabilizing messages by establishing, or attempting to establish, TV networks in Russia, Bulgaria and Greece, in violation of those sanctions.”\n\nThe indictment comes a day after Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the launch of a task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions and restrictions the U.S. and its allies have imposed for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n-- Josh Meyer\n\nUkrainians in U.S. granted temporary protection from deportation\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security on Thursday announced temporary protected status for Ukrainians living in the United States, which will shield them from deportation for the next 18 months, as Ukraine continues to face ongoing attacks from Russia.\n\n“Russia’s premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine has resulted in an ongoing war, senseless violence, and Ukrainians forced to seek refuge in other countries,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. “In these extraordinary times, we will continue to offer our support and protection to Ukrainian nationals in the United States.”\n\nIndividuals must have continuously lived in the U.S. since March 1 to be eligible for TPS, DHS said. That would apply to approximately 30,000 Ukrainian nationals. Those who attempt to travel to the U.S. after March 1 do not qualify for TPS.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nRussia hammering Ukraine's southern cities\n\nUkraine’s major cities have come under heavy bombardment, a senior Defense Department official said. About 90% of the 150,000 combat forces Putin deployed to Ukraine’s borders are now inside the country, said the official, who described military movements on condition of anonymity.\n\nHeavily populated southern cities along the Black Sea and Sea of Azov were among primary targets as Russia's campaign threatened to cut off shipping. Hennadiy Lahuta, governor of Kherson Oblast, said the government building in the Black Sea port city of Kherson, with a population of almost 280,000, was seized by Russian troops. Units were also bearing down on Mykolaiv, 40 miles to the northwest and home to almost half a million Ukrainians, The New York Times reported. U.S. officials said Russia had fired 480 missiles at Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces failed to capture Mariupol, a city of 450,000 on the Azov Sea, and had \"resorted to a blockade, creating a humanitarian disaster,\" the Ukrainian military said. Food, water and even electricity have been cut off, women and children halted from evacuating. In the vital energy-producing southern city of Enerhodar, a hub on the Dnieper River, Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops on the city’s outskirts, Mayor Dmytro Orlov said.\n\nThe Ukraine military said four large landing ships and three missile boats were moving through the Black Sea in the direction of the Odesa and its 1 million residents. Russian sailors were firing on civilian ships and taking prisoners, according to the military.\n\nRussia has acknowledged that nearly 500 of its troops have been killed in the war and about 1,600 wounded. Ukraine, which has not released casualty figures for its own armed forces, has estimated Russian troop losses at up to 9,000.\n\nUkraine’s State Emergency Service has said more than 2,000 civilians have died, though it was impossible to verify the claim. The U.N. human rights office said it had recorded 227 deaths, including 15 under age 18, and 525 injured, since the start of the invasion on Feb. 24.\n\nZelenskyy says 16,000 foreign volunteers have answered call to fight for Ukraine\n\nUkraine has sent out a call for foreign volunteers to join its fight against the Russian invaders, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there has been a strong response.\n\nIn a video posted online, Zelenskyy said the first 16,000 fighters from other countries \"are already on their way to protect freedom and life for us, and for all.''\n\nWhile many governments are limiting their involvement in the war to sending weapons and other forms of aid, which Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for, others have gone a step further.\n\nThe Czech Republic said Thursday it won’t get in the way of its citizens who decide to join international brigades to help Ukraine. Serving in a foreign army is punishable by a prison term in the Czech Republic, but Prime Minister Petr Fiala said those who fight for Ukraine in this war would be pardoned by President Milos Zeman, with him co-signing it.\n\nCongressmen want oligarchs' assets 'repurposed' to benefit Ukraine\n\nReps. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) and Joe Wilson (R-SC) introduced a bipartisan bill on Thursday to seize any assets from oligarchs whose wealth is linked to the corruption of Vladimir Putin’s repressive regime and “repurpose” them to help Ukraine.\n\nThe legislation authorizes the Biden administration to confiscate any property – including luxury villas, yachts and airplanes – valued over $5 million from Russian oligarchs previously sanctioned by the U.S. government for their involvement in the Kremlin’s invasion and human rights violations in Ukraine.\n\nAny funds gained from asset sales must then be used to benefit the Ukrainian people through the provision of military and humanitarian assistance, post-conflict reconstruction and technology to ensure the free flow of information in Ukraine, the two lawmakers said.\n\n-- Josh Meyer\n\nWhite House seeks $10 billion for Ukraine\n\nThe White House on Thursday requested $10 billion from Congress to aid Ukraine. Much of the aid to Ukraine would be used to support the country’s military in its fight against the Russian invasion, though a significant portion would also go toward humanitarian assistance for Ukrainians fleeing violence or who have been made food insecure by the attack.\n\n“To continue this important work and further support the Ukrainian people, we are requesting $10 billion to deliver additional humanitarian, security, and economic assistance in Ukraine and the neighboring region in the coming days and weeks,” Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, wrote in a blog post.\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\n1 million have fled in 'swiftest exodus this century'\n\nMore than 1 million people have fled the fighting. The mass evacuation could be seen in Kharkiv, where residents desperate to escape falling shells and bombs crowded the city's train station and pressed onto trains, not always knowing where they were headed. The Ukrainian government said at least 34 people were killed and 285 injured, including 10 children, during the shelling of Kharkiv.\n\nIn one week, more than 2% of Ukraine’s population has been forced out of the country, according to a tally from the United Nations, which called the mass flight one of the \"swiftest refugee exodus this century.\"\n\nPutin siege tactics could bring mass destruction, death to Ukraine\n\nPutin's military forces seem poised to adopt siege tactics that could result in enormous civilian deaths and infrastructure damage after their initial assault has failed to topple the Ukrainian government, officials and experts say. The Ukrainian cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol have come under heavy bombardment from airstrikes and artillery – similar to tactics Putin used in Syria and Chechnya.\n\n\"A siege is likely and may last as long as several weeks,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Armed Services Committee. \"He’ll try to wear down resistance in Kyiv and Kharkiv and other major cities, hitting civilian centers with massive explosives, airstrikes and missiles.\" Read more here.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nPutin nuclear talk sparks run on iodine pills\n\nFighting in the vicinity of the former Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine followed by news Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had put his nuclear arsenal on alert has prompted a rush on iodine in some European countries. In Belgium, Pharmacists’ Union’s Michael Storme told the press agency Belga that druggists there had given away 30,000 packs of iodine tablets Monday alone. Some pharmacies in Finland were running out of iodine tablets, which can protect the thyroid gland from the effects of radiation.\n\nThe U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission notes that it is a “very specialized protection\" and says evacuation is the most effective measure because it \"protects the whole body from all radionuclides and all exposure pathways.\"\n\nZelenskyy: Russian soldiers are 'confused children'\n\nIn a video address to the nation early Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Ukrainians to keep up their resistance but didn’t comment on whether the Russians have seized any cities.\n\n“They will have no peace here,” Zelenskyy said, calling on the Russian soldiers to “go home” and describing them as “confused children who have been used.” He said that for Ukrainians this was a patriotic war that won't end until the Russians have been driven out.\n\n\"Wherever they go they will be destroyed,\" Zerenskyy said. \"They will not have one quiet moment. The occupiers will receive only one thing from Ukrainians – resistance. Fierce resistance.\"\n\nBlack and brown refugees are being turned away at European borders\n\nAs increasing reports indicate people of color fleeing Ukraine are facing discrimination at the border, the crisis has once again highlighted a double standard in the way nations treat refugees based on country of origin, race, religion and more, academics and refugees say.\n\nMany of the same European nations that turned away refugees from the Middle East, Africa and Asia in the past are now largely welcoming refugees from Ukraine.\n\n\"It's great that Europe is being welcoming toward Ukrainian refugees. That should be the response,'' said Nell Gabiam, an associate professor at Iowa State University who studies forced migration. \"But it would be even better if that response was applied across the board toward all refugees who are fleeing persecution and war.\"\n\nFilippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, commended governments and citizens for their \"extraordinary acts of humanity and kindness\" but acknowledged some refugees have faced \"a different treatment\" at the border.

And on Monday, the Department of State urged all Americans to leave Russia, which could affect some collegians studying abroad.\n\nThe developments are especially striking given that universities celebrate their openness to cultural exchange, even with controversial governments such as China or Saudi Arabia.

Only 34% of the country's population is fully vaccinated, according to WHO data.\n\n– Jordan Mendoza\n\nBiden banned Russia from US airspace. Here's what the area covers.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced the U.S. is closing off airspace to all Russian flights during his State of the Union address Tuesday, a decision with a sprawling geographic impact because of the numerous territories in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe move is a part of a global effort aimed at isolating Russia from the rest of the world. Cutting off Russian flights to the U.S. will impact airspace over the lower 48 states, Hawaii, Alaska and the American-controlled territories that expand across much of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThose territories include Palau and the Marshall Islands. And under the Compacts of Free Association, a series of treaties between the United States and those territories, the U.S. has access to and controls much of the airspace surrounding the islands.\n\n– Celina Tebor\n\nReport: China asked Russia to delay Ukraine invasion after Olympics\n\nSenior Chinese officials told Russian officials back in February not to invade Ukraine before the end of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, The New York Times reported Tuesday.\n\nThe Times, citing a Western intelligence report and quoting senior Biden administration officials and a European official, said that the Chinese officials had \"some level of direct knowledge about Russia’s war plans or intentions\" before the invasion started last month.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Beijing on Feb. 4 before the Winter Games kicked off in Beijing. According to the Times, it's not clear if conversations about the invasion took place in the meeting between Xi and Putin.\n\nAfter their meeting last month, both leaders issued a joint statement highlighting what they called “interference in the internal affairs” of other states, as Xi and Putin faced criticism from the United States over their foreign and domestic policies.\n\nThe relationship between China and Russia has grown over the past few decades, and the two nations opposed a further expansion of NATO. When Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, China called for peace between the two countries and said the U.S. and its allies were worsening the conflict.\n\n– Charles Ventura, Asha C.

The application for student loan forgiveness officially opened Monday.\n\nStudent loan cancellation – worth up to $20,000 per eligible borrower – could begin as soon as Sunday, October 23, if the court does not intervene, according to the filing from the Brown County Taxpayers Association.\n\nThe request was filed to Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who has jurisdiction over the lower court that ruled on the case. She is likely to refer the matter to the full court.\n\nThe Biden administration is facing several legal challenges over the program, but this is the first to reach the Supreme Court.\n\nThe taxpayer group’s lawsuit has not gained traction at the lower court level. A trial-level federal judge dismissed the case within two days of it being filed, ruling that the group lacked standing to bring the lawsuit.\n\nIn a one-sentence order, the US 7th Circuit Court of Appeals also refused the plaintiff’s emergency request for a pause.\n\nThe Brown County Taxpayers Association, which is being represented by the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, argues that the President does not have the legal authority to implement his student loan forgiveness program.\n\nIn the new filing with the Supreme Court, lawyers for the group argued that the implementation of the program would be a “staggering blow” to the US Treasury and taxpayers.\n\n“We are witnessing a gargantuan increase in the national debt accomplished by a complete disregard for limitations on the constitutional spending authority,” they wrote.\n\nThe Biden administration argues that Congress gave the secretary of education the power to discharge debt in a 2003 law known as the HEROES Act.\n\nThe independent Congressional Budget Office has estimated that Biden’s student loan forgiveness program could cost $400 billion.\n\nHow Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan could work\n\nBiden’s student loan forgiveness program, first announced in August, aims to deliver debt relief to millions of borrowers before federal student loan payments resume in January after a nearly three-year, pandemic-related pause.\n\nWhile the application officially opened on Monday, the Biden administration has agreed in court documents to hold off on canceling any debt until October 23.

The Biden administration, which released a preview of the application Tuesday, aims to deliver debt relief worth up to $20,000 to millions of borrowers before federal student loan payments resume in January after a nearly three-year, pandemic-related pause.\n\nThe motion for a preliminary injunction was heard by District Judge Henry Edward Autrey, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in a federal court in Missouri by state attorneys general from Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska and South Carolina, as well as legal representatives from Iowa.\n\nOne of the judge’s first questions during the hearing was about whether the states have standing to bring the case against the President. He likened standing, a legal threshold to bring a case, to baking a cake.\n\n“You can have all the ingredients for a cake. But it’s hard to make a cake if you don’t have a pan to put the cake in. The pan is the standing,” Autrey said.\n\nAfter hearing from the lawyers for both parties, Autrey declared a recess and told the attorneys they would hear from him soon.\n\nThe states argued in court documents that the Biden administration does not have the legal authority to grant broad student loan forgiveness.

Two of the lawsuits have already been dismissed. One ongoing lawsuit was filed by Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, and another was filed this week by a conservative group, the Job Creators Network Foundation, on behalf of two student loan borrowers in Texas who do not qualify for the full $20,000 in debt relief under Biden’s program.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/politics/biden-student-loan-debt-relief-program-appeals-court-pause/index.html", "title": "Appeals court pauses Biden student debt relief program while it ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA federal appeals court put a temporary, administrative hold on President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program, barring the administration from canceling loans covered under the policy, while the court considers a challenge to it.\n\nThe order from the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals comes in a case brought by six Republican-led states, asking for a preliminary injunction to halt the policy after a district court dismissed the case earlier this week.

No debt has been canceled thus far.\n\nAfter receiving the government’s brief, the Supreme Court asked the plaintiffs for a response by noon on Wednesday, November 23.\n\nAn “erroneous injunction” from a federal appeals court, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the Supreme Court, “leaves millions of economically vulnerable borrowers in limbo, uncertain about the size of their debt and unable to make financial decisions with an accurate understanding of their future repayment obligations.”\n\nGovernment lawyers say that President Joe Biden acted in order to address the financial harms of the pandemic and “smooth the transition to repayment” in order to provide targeted debt relief to certain federal student-loan borrowers affected by the pandemic.\n\nPayments on federal student loans are scheduled to restart in January after a yearslong pandemic pause.\n\nThe program is designed to aid borrowers who are at highest risk of delinquency or default. Once debt cancellation begins, the plan could offer up to $10,000 in student loan debt relief to eligible borrowers making less than $125,000 ($250,000 per household.)\n\nIn addition, borrowers who received a Pell grant can receive up to $20,000 in relief.\n\nThe authority exists under the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003, or the HEROES Act, the administration says. It argues the law exempts the government from otherwise applicable procedural requirements, including notice-and-comment rulemaking.\n\n“Because borrowers who default on their student loans face severe financial consequences – including wage garnishment, long-term credit damage, and ineligibility for federal benefits – Congress specifically authorized the Secretary (of Education) to waive or modify any applicable statutory or regulatory provision as he deems necessary to ensure that borrowers affected by a national emergency are not worse off in relation to their student loans,” Prelogar wrote in Friday’s filing.\n\nThe dispute at hand is brought by a group of states, led by Nebraska, who argue that the student loan debt relief plan violates the separations of power and the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law that governs the process by which federal agencies issue regulations.\n\nThe Biden administration stresses that the challengers can’t show the legal injury necessary to bring the case to court.\n\nBut if the challengers survive that threshold issue, several conservative justices might be interested in the merits of the dispute concerning whether a federal agency has the authority to issue such broad relief. In the past, conservatives on the Supreme Court have looked skeptically at the so-called administrative state which, they say, violates the separation of powers.\n\nA district court held that the states didn’t have the legal right or “standing” to prevail, but the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, issuing a nationwide injunction blocking the program. It relied on the “irreversible impact” the debt forgiveness action would have and the fact that the collection of student loan payments, as well as accrual of interest on student loans would otherwise be suspended while the legal challenges play out.\n\nA separate challenge is also percolating in federal courts brought by two individual borrowers – Myra Brown and Alexander Taylor – who are not qualified for full debt relief forgiveness and who say they were denied an opportunity to comment on the secretary of education’s decision to provide targeted student loan debt relief to some.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue Katie Lobosco", "Ariane De Vogue", "Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/politics/student-loan-forgiveness-supreme-court-amy-coney-barrett/index.html", "title": "Supreme Court delivers one of two legal wins for Biden's student ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFederal courts on Thursday delivered two wins for President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan.

It is our chance for dignity,\" said Melissa Byrne, executive director of We The 45 Million, a coalition that pushed for student loan cancellation. \"Failure to deliver student loan relief is not an option.”\n\nFor months, the White House publicly resisted calls from liberal constituency groups to come up with a Plan B for student loan debt in anticipation of the conservative-majority court striking down Biden's action on student loans.\n\nEven when a majority of Supreme Court justices expressed deep skepticism over Biden's plan during oral arguments in February − signaling they would rule against the president − the White House refused to discuss a potential alternative.\n\nThen came Biden's announcement Friday afternoon.\n\n\"I believe the court's decision to strike down my student debt relief program was a mistake, was wrong,\" Biden said. \"But I'm not going to stop fighting to deliver borrowers what they need, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic scale.\"\n\nSweeping loan forgiveness plan guttedSupreme Court strikes down Biden proposal to forgive debt for millions of borrowers\n\nHow far will the new plan go?\n\nConservatives justices on the Supreme Court ruled that a federal law called the HEROES Act that allowed the Biden administration to \"waive or modify\" the terms of student loans did not give the president the power to offer wholesale forgiveness of that debt.\n\nAll the details of Biden's alternative route and how far it could go aren't clear.\n\nBiden's original action sought to forgive $10,000 for all borrowers federal student loan borrowers and up to $20,000 in debt relief for low-income Pell Grant recipients. The debt cancellation was only available to borrowers with annual incomes less than $125,000 or from households earning $250,000 or less.\n\nThe Education Department generally uses the negotiated rulemaking process to develop policies that affect how the government distributes money meant for financial aid. The government holds a series of meetings with key stakeholders, which could include university leaders, loan servicers, students or others who might be impacted by the decision. That group will attempt to reach a common agreement on the new rules.\n\nIf they do, the government will adopt their guidance. If not, the department will decide if it should move forward with the new policy or could draft its own rule. It will give the public an opportunity to comment before the rules become final.\n\nRelying on the Higher Education Act is not a new idea; some plaintiffs in the case had raised it at the Supreme Court. Two borrowers who sued Biden over student loans claimed in a brief that the only reason the administration avoided relying on it was because of the \"lengthy negotiated rulemaking and notice-and-comment\" that would be required. In other words, they said, it would take longer.\n\nCardona said the administration chose the HEROES Act as its initial path because it offered a \"quicker\" pathway. White House officials stressed the new alternative route could take \"months\" to roll out following the federal review process and periods for public comments.\n\nSome borrower advocacy groups were skeptical of the president's new plan to deliver student loan relief saying he isn't leveraging every tool he has, and the fresh proposal will take far too long. Others warned that the court's decision, while a setback for loan borrowers, will serve as motivation for young voters to come out for Democrats in the 2024 election.\n\n\"President’s Biden plan was a historic action that would have provided life-changing relief to young people,\" said Tzintzún Ramirez, president of NextGen America, a progressive advocacy group for young voters. \"Instead, Republican and partisan forces worked to obstruct this relief – and we know that young voters will remember this come 2024.\"\n\nAnother reprieve for borrowers on payments\n\nIn addition to starting over on student loan forgiveness, Cardona said borrowers who can't make payments when the pause on student loan bills ends in October will have a one-year reprieve on the consequences that come along with missed payments.\n\nLoan forgiveness takes many forms.Only one is blocked.\n\nWhile interest will begin to accrue on those loans during what the department called an \"on-ramp\" period from October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, borrowers who don't make payments won't be reported to credit agencies or have their loans referred to collection agencies.The original pause on payments, first instituted under former President Donald Trump at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, also directed that servicers stop their collection attempts.\n\nDoes Biden have other options?\n\nAnother way legally to achieve the same goal – forgiving up to $20,000 in student loan debt for low- and middle-income households – would be for Congress to act. But Biden lacks the votes for legislative action.\n\nBoth bodies of Congress − including the Democratic-controlled Senate − voted to repeal Biden's student loan forgiveness action, forcing the veto pen of Biden to keep his plan alive before the court's decision.\n\nThe White House also has touted its previous efforts to cancel debt through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. However, it's limited to borrowers working in the public sector.\n\nSome legal experts have argued Biden could propose a narrower plan that still invokes the HEROES Act, although it likely would have a significantly smaller reach.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/14/student-loan-debt-forgiveness-blocked-appeals-court-puts-plan-hold/10592105002/", "title": "Biden student loan forgiveness update: another court blocks plan", "text": "A federal appeals court blocked President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness program, further crushing the hopes of more than 26 million Americans who have applied for the relief, discouraging millions more who were eligible for the boost and potentially killing the president's signature program.\n\nThe 8th Circuit Court of Appeals granted an injunction sought by six Republican-led states that argued Biden exceeded his presidential authority when he cited COVID-19 as a national emergency to cancel student loan debt for millions of borrowers.

The Administration will continue to fight these baseless lawsuits by Republican officials and special interests and will never stop fighting to support working and middle class Americans.”\n\nCan I still apply for the president's student debt forgiveness plan?\n\nThe appeals court ordered a temporary halt of the rollout of Biden's debt forgiveness plan until a final decision.

The act gave the administration authority to forgive student loan debt in association with military operations or national emergencies. The White House cited the COVID-19 pandemic as the national emergency.\n\nUnder the president's plan, borrowers would be eligible for up to $10,000 or $20,000 in debt relief, depending on their income and whether they received a Pell Grant in college. Borrowers must earn less than $125,000 a year or reside in households that make no more than $250,000. As many as 40 million people would qualify for Biden's plan, and some would see their entire balance erased.\n\n'Debt and no degree':Biden cancels as much as $20K in student loan debt\n\nWhat the court said\n\nThe states questioned that authority and argued they would lose money from future tax revenue and via quasi-state agencies that service student loans.\n\nThe 8th Circuit specifically upheld the states' legal standing. The district judge in the case had previously dismissed the case on those grounds, and legal critics said proving standing would be the biggest hurdle for those looking to block the president's debt relief plan\n\nThe judges agreed with the states' argument that the quasi-state student loan servicer, MOHELA, would suffer as a result of the president’s plan to forgive billions in debt, and that that would affect the state of Missouri.\n\n“This unanticipated financial downturn will prevent or delay Missouri from funding higher education at its public colleges and universities,” the judges wrote. “Due to MOHELA’s financial obligations to the State treasury, the challenged student loan debt cancellation presents a threatened financial harm to the State of Missouri.”\n\nThe federal government had requested a limited injunction in its response to the appeals court. The judges denied that request too.\n\n“Given MOHELA’s national role in servicing accounts, we discern no workable path in this emergency posture for narrowing the scope of relief,” they wrote. “And beyond Missouri, tailoring an injunction to address the alleged harms to the remaining States would entail delving into complex issues and contested facts that would make any limits uncertain in their application and effectiveness.”\n\nIn an October letter to Missouri Rep. Cori Bush, a Democrat, MOHELA wrote its executives were, \"not were not involved with the decision of the Missouri Attorney General’s Office to file for the preliminary injunction in federal court on September 29, 2022.\" They added the servicer was, \"faithfully fulfilling its obligations pursuant to its federal loan servicing contract.\"\n\n\"As a governmental entity it does not have shareholders and does not exist to make profits,\" the loan servicer wrote. \"Any available funds above reasonable operating needs and reserves are devoted by MOHELA to student financial aid.\"\n\nWhat could happen if the Biden administration appeals?\n\nIt's difficult to predict how the nation's highest court would respond, should the Justice Department appeal.

He also highlighted the arguments of Republicans, who, Cardona claimed, did not file lawsuits when they reaped the benefits of the Paycheck Protection Program loans from the federal government.\n\n“It’s only when relief is going to working and middle-class Americans that these elected officials have a problem,” Cardona argued in his op-ed.\n\n“This program will help borrowers by providing relief following the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic. President Biden and this administration will never stop fighting for the millions of hardworking students and borrowers across the country – no matter how many elected officials or lawsuits try to stop us,” Cardona added.\n\nLate Friday, a federal appeals court put a temporary, administrative hold on Biden’s student loan forgiveness program, keeping the government from canceling loans covered under the policy while the court considers a challenge to it.\n\nThe order from the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals comes in a case brought by six Republican-led states, asking for a preliminary injunction to halt the policy after a district court dismissed the case earlier this week. The effort is separate from a Wisconsin taxpayers group’s challenge to the program that was recently rejected by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe appeals court gave the administration until Monday to respond to the states’ request, and the states will have until Tuesday to reply to that response. The states had asked the appeals court to act before Sunday, the earliest date the Biden administration had said it would grant student loan discharges.\n\nAfter the ruling on Friday, the White House encouraged borrowers to still apply for relief despite the hold.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was filed last month, was dismissed on October 20 by a lower court judge who ruled that the plaintiffs did not have the legal standing to bring the challenge, CNN previously reported.\n\nThe Biden administration is also facing lawsuits from Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, and conservative groups such as the Job Creators Network Foundation and the Cato Institute.\n\nMany of the legal challenges claim that the Biden administration does not have the legal authority to broadly cancel student loan debt.\n\nLawyers for the government argue that Congress gave the secretary of education the power to discharge debt in a 2003 law known as the HEROES Act, CNN previously reported.\n\nBiden’s student loan forgiveness program, first announced in August, aims to deliver debt relief to millions of borrowers before federal student loan payments resume in January after a nearly three-year, pandemic-related pause.\n\nUnder Biden’s plan, eligible individual borrowers who earned less than $125,000 in either 2020 or 2021 and married couples or heads of households who made less than $250,000 annually in those years will see up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven.\n\nIf a qualifying borrower also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness.", "authors": ["Sarah Fortinsky Sonnet Swire", "Sarah Fortinsky", "Sonnet Swire"], "publish_date": "2022/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/30/supreme-court-ruling-decision-biden-student-loan-live-updates/70371252007/", "title": "Supreme Court blocks Biden plan to forgive student loan debt", "text": "WASHINGTON − The Supreme Court on Friday dashed President Joe Biden's plan to wipe out student loan debt for tens of millions Americans, ending a program that was intended to ease the financial burden on families in the latest significant ruling from the high court that curbs a president's power to act alone.\n\nIn one of the most closely followed cases before the court, with sweeping implications for the balance of power in Washington and the household finances of millions of families, a majority ruled on ideological lines that the Biden administration overstepped its power by attempting to forgive $400 billion in student loans lingering during the pandemic.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote the decision for the 6-3 majority, with the conservative justices lining up behind the idea that a federal law called the HEROES Act that allowed the Biden administration to \"waive or modify\" the terms of student loans did not give the president the power to offer wholesale forgiveness of that debt.\n\n\"The act allows the secretary to 'waive or modify' existing statutory or regulatory provisions applicable to financial assistance programs,\" Roberts wrote, \"not to rewrite that statute from the ground up.\"\n\nThe decision − widely expected for months − drew a sharp rebuke from the court's liberal wing and the White House itself, which vowed to continue working on the issue. But student debt relief has not gained traction on Capitol Hill and Biden's options for meeting his campaign promise to reduce student debt appeared limited.\n\n\"This fight is not over,\" Biden said after the decision. On Friday afternoon, Biden said he would introduce an alternative plan to provide student loan forgiveness, by utilizing the Higher Education Act of 1965.\n\n\"This new path is legally sound. It's going to take longer,\" Biden said. \"In my view, it's the best path that remains to provide as many borrowers as possible with debt relief.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court decision will have the most immediate impact on about 26 million borrowers who applied for relief in the few weeks applications were open, and more than 16 million were approved before a pair of court decisions put the loan forgiveness effort on hold. The administration had estimated that as many as 40 million people would be eligible for relief under the program.\n\nSeveral advocates were quick to note that would have disproportionate impact on students of color, who are more likely to not only borrow but also carry higher debt loads. In that sense, the decision was the second in as many days from the high court to hit minority students particularly hard. On Thursday, the court struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan, who authored the dissent for the court's liberal wing, wrote that \"in every respect, the court today exceeds its proper, limited role in our nation’s governance.\" Kagan wrote that the majority was reading the law far too conservatively so as to \"negate broad delegations Congress has approved.\"\n\n\"The court once again substitutes itself for Congress and the executive branch − and the hundreds of millions of people they represent − in making this nation’s most important, as well as most contested, policy decisions,\" she wrote.\"\n\nThe court's decision, while significant, was not a surprise: The conservative majority has increasingly looked skeptically on efforts by presidents to act unilaterally without explicit approval from Congress. The administration has lost similar legal fights over efforts to extend an eviction moratorium, impose vaccine-or-testing requirements on large employers and curb power plant emissions.\n\nIn those cases and others, the court's conservatives have raised concerns about a presidential administration attempting to circumvent Congress through regulations.\n\n\"The dissent is correct that this is a case about one branch of government arrogating to itself power belonging to another,\" Roberts wrote. \"But it is the executive seizing the power of the legislature.\"\n\nBiden says he will pursue other ways of canceling student loan debt\n\nBiden said Friday that he will pursue canceling student loan debt through an alternative legal authority after the Supreme Court blocked his signature program to eliminate up to $20,000 in student loan debt for millions of Americans.\n\nBiden said his administration will work to forgive student loan debt through the Higher Education Act of 1965, which he said authorizes the education secretary to modify, waive or compromise federal student loan under certain circumstances.\n\n\"This new path is legally sound. It's going to take longer,\" Biden said in White House remarks in response to the court, which ruled his original plan exceeded executive authority. \"And in my view, it's the best path that remains for to provide as many borrowers as possible with debt relief.\"\n\nBiden fears SCOTUS decision could ‘invite more discrimination against LGBTQI+ Americans’\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he’s “deeply concerned” the Supreme Court’s decision Friday to side with a Colorado web designer who refused to provide services for same-sex marriages “could invite more discrimination against LGBTQI+ Americans.”\n\nIn a statement slamming the court’s 6-3 opinion, Biden said, “More broadly, today’s decision weakens long-standing laws that protect all Americans against discrimination in public accommodations – including people of color, people with disabilities, people of faith, and women.”\n\nBiden vowed that his administration remains committed to “rigorously enforce” federal laws protecting Americans from discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. He said he will work with states to “fight back against attempts to roll back civil rights protections that could follow this ruling.”\n\nHe called on Congress to pass the Equality Act to ensure civil rights protections for LGBTQI+ Americans.\n\n“When one group’s dignity and equality are threatened, the promise of our democracy is threatened and we all suffer,” Biden said.\n\nPeople of color will feel impact of Supreme Court's decisions\n\nFriday’s opinion gutting mass student loan debt forgiveness is the second in as many days that hits people of color especially hard. On Thursday, the court struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nBlack and brown students are more likely to borrow and hold a disproportionate amount of student loan debt.\n\nAdvocates were quick to call on the Biden administration to act.\n\n“Our communities often face intersecting forms of discrimination and systemic disadvantages, restricting access to higher education and economic opportunities,” said David Johns, executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition, a Black LGBTQ+ civil rights group. “Our democracy will be weakened as a result of this ruling.”\n\nBiden to announce new actions for student loan borrowers after SCOTUS defeat\n\nPresident Joe Biden will announce new actions to protect student loan borrowers, the White House said Friday after the Supreme Court killed the president’s debt forgiveness plan in a 6-3 opinion.\n\n“While we strongly disagree with the court, we prepared for this scenario. The president will have more to say today,” said a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe official said Biden will make clear in his remarks that “he’s not done fighting yet.” He will also make it “crystal clear to borrowers and their families that Republicans are responsible for denying them the relief that President Biden has been fighting to get to them.”\n\nSupreme Court decision major loss for Biden, families with debt\n\nBiden's attorneys walked into court as underdogs, up against a years-long project by the court's conservative majority to limit the power of federal agencies. The administration has lost similar legal fights over efforts to extend an eviction moratorium, impose vaccine-or-testing requirements on large employers and curb power plant emissions.\n\nThe decision represents a significant loss for students and families who were counting on the relief. Biden's proposal would have forgiven up to $20,000 for some borrowers. The White House seems to have few options for a Plan B and administration aides repeatedly declined to answer questions about next steps while the case was pending.\n\nIt's also a major political defeat for Biden, depriving him of the ability to claim he fulfilled a campaign promise aimed at his political base. Student debt relief emerged as a central issue in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary and progressive groups were leaning on Biden even before the Supreme Court handed down its decision.\n\nRoberts, Kagan engage in unusual exchange over court's role\n\nIn her dissent, Justice Elena Kagan claimed that the majority \"blows through a constitutional guardrail intended to keep courts acting like courts,\" a reference to the Supreme Court's decision that Missouri had standing to sue in the first place. Kagan's words, appeared to harken back to a speech she gave last year arguing that the best way to ensure the court's trust with the public was for courts to \"act like a court.\"\n\nThe point drew an unusual response from Chief Justice John Roberts at the end of his opinion.\n\n\"It has become a disturbing feature of some recent opinions to criticize the decisions with which they disagree as going beyond the proper role of the judiciary,\" Roberts wrote. \"We do not mistake this plainly heartfelt disagreement for disparagement. It is important that the public not be misled either. Any such misperception would be harmful to this institution and our country.\"\n\nWhat the Supreme Court said in its student loan decision\n\nRoberts wrote that the secretary of education had argued that the HEROES Act \"grants him the authority to cancel $430 billion of student loan principal. It does not.\" The act, Roberts said, \"allows the Secretary to 'waive or modify' existing statutory or regulatory provisions applicable to financial assistance programs under the Education Act, not to rewrite that statute from the ground up.\"\n\nJustice Elena Kagan, who read her dissent from the bench, said that \"in every respect, the court today exceeds its proper, limited role in our nation’s governance.\"\n\nOutside the court: ‘My whole future is in front of them.’\n\nThe scene outside the Supreme Court was subdued in the hour before the first opinion came down, with hardly any protesters gathered in the haze and humidity of the morning.\n\nOne person showed up mostly covered in a cardboard box painted black to represent the Bible.\n\nMelissa Byrne, the founder of a group called We the 45 Million was taping a sign to a lectern encouraging the court to allow Biden’s relief effort to stand. Byrne, who is still carrying student loan debt herself, said she was somewhat hopeful for a positive ruling based on how the justices have tossed out other recent lawsuits on standing.\n\n“My whole future is in front of them,” she said. “They have a lot of power.”\n\nSupreme Court’s two Black justices debate affirmative action\n\nThe frequency of unanimous opinions doesn’t mean the term has been free from tension. There have been notable instances of the justices sniping at each other’s arguments, including in the major affirmative action case this week.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, a conservative who is the court’s second Black justice, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, a liberal and the court’s first Black woman, put their disagreement over race-based policies on display in opinions in the affirmative action cases Thursday.\n\n“Rather than focusing on individuals as individuals, her dissent focuses on the historical subjugation of black Americans,” Thomas wrote of Jackson in concurrence. “As she sees things, we are all inexorably trapped in a fundamentally racist society, with the original sin of slavery and the historical subjugation of Black Americans still determining our lives today.”\n\nIn a footnote, Jackson described Thomas’ writing as a “prolonged attack.” His opinion, she wrote, “demonstrates an obsession with race consciousness that far outstrips my or UNC’s holistic understanding that race can be a factor that affects applicants’ unique life experiences.”\n\nStudent loans, LGBTQ cases round out significant term\n\nThe final two cases expected Monday will bring to close a significant term in which the justices agreed far more often than they split along ideological lines.\n\nSome of the most surprising outcomes came in voting rights cases, where the lineups were unusual. Last week, the court shot down a conservative theory that could have given state lawmakers extraordinary power to set election rules in their states with little oversight from courts. That was a 6-3 vote, with Roberts writing for a majority that included two more conservatives and the three liberals.\n\nEarlier this month, the court unexpectedly ruled against Alabama in a challenge to its recently redrawn congressional districts, smacking down an argument for \"color-blind\" redistricting. The 5-4 decision from Roberts brought together one additional conservative and three liberals.\n\nWho’s writing the student debt, LGBTQ opinions?\n\nNobody knows for certain who is writing what but as the term draws to its close there are some clues. That’s partly because each justice generally writes one decision from each sitting – a period of several weeks in which cases are argued.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in the LGBTQ case on Dec. 5, which was the Nov. 28 sitting. The only justice who has yet to write from that sitting is Justice Neil Gorsuch. So there’s a good chance that Gorsuch, who is one of the court’s most ardent supporters of religious rights, will write the majority in opinion in 303 Creative v. Elenis.\n\nThe assignment of the student loan cases, which were argued in late February, are harder to predict because only three justices have written in that sitting. Assuming the case goes to a senior conservative, there’s a good chance it will land with Chief Justice John Roberts or Justice Samuel Alito.\n\nWhere to find the Supreme Court’s student loan decision\n\nThe Supreme Court justices will enter the ornate chamber and take their seats at 10 a.m. EDT and the marshal will kick off the proceedings with the traditional cry of “Oyez! Oyez! Oyez!” Chief Justice John Roberts will then announce which of his colleagues has written the court’s opinion in the first case.\n\nThe justice who authored the opinion – and sometimes the justices writing dissents and concurrences – then read summaries of their positions. These readings can help make sense of the outcome, but they are not streamed. When one case is done, Roberts will announce who has the next opinion.\n\nOpinions become public at the same time they are announced from the bench. So the easiest way to follow along is to head to the opinions section of the Supreme Court’s website.\n\nBiden student loan relief plan in jeopardy\n\nAt issue in the student loan case is Biden's plan to wipe out student loan debt for 26 million Americans, an idea that would cost an estimated $400 billion and that has been on the ropes in federal courts almost from the get-go.\n\nBiden's attorneys walked into court as underdogs in the case, up against a years-long project by the court's conservative majority to limit the power of federal agencies. The administration has lost similar legal fights over efforts to extend an eviction moratorium, impose vaccine-or-testing requirements on large employers and curb power plant emissions.\n\nRace:Supreme Court blocks use of affirmative action at Harvard, UNC in blow to diversity efforts\n\nBiden announced the student loan program in August, honoring a campaign pledge he made before the 2020 election. About 26 million borrowers applied in the few weeks applications were open, and more than 16 million were approved before a pair of court decisions put the loan forgiveness effort on hold. The administration had estimated that as many as 40 million people would be eligible for relief under the program.\n\nBut the effort drew immediate pushback from conservatives, who noted Congress failed to pass legislation that explicitly authorized the forgiveness. Instead, Biden relied on a law passed in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks that gave the Education Department power to \"waive or modify\" loan rules for Americans suffering from an emergency.\n\nSix conservative states and two individual borrowers filed lawsuits over the plan. The states, including Missouri and Nebraska, argued a state-created entity known as MOHELA that services student loans would lose money if the debt was forgiven. The borrowers said they weren't given an opportunity to argue for more relief.\n\nWedding websites: Sweeping implications for LGBTQ rights\n\nThe Supreme Court also decided a second case involving LGBTQ rights and freedom of speech.\n\nIn a decision that could have profound implications for when businesses may turn away customers, a Colorado website designer has argued that a state anti-discrimination law can't be used to compel her to develop same-sex wedding sites. It is the latest in a series of cases to reach the court pitting business owners against LGBTQ customers, although this one focused on free speech rights more than religion.\n\nLorie Smith, the owner of 303 Creative, a Denver-based website design firm, said she didn't object to serving LGBTQ customers – only same-sex weddings. Because Smith's websites are custom creations they represent her speech as well as that of her customers, her lawyers argued. Smith was never approached by an LGBTQ couple seeking a matrimonial website site. Rather, she wanted the high court to invalidate the Colorado law before that could happen.\n\nIn a 6-3 opinion, the court sided with Smith.\n\n303 Creative:Supreme Court backs web developer who didn't want to create same-sex wedding sites\n\nCritics said Smith's argument would allow businesses to skirt anti-discrimination laws.\n\nAfter a landmark victory in 2015 legalizing same-sex marriage and another win in 2020 that banned workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the outlook for LGBTQ rights at the Supreme Court has dimmed in recent years – especially when those rights are in tension with the First Amendment's protection of religious freedom.\n\nAffirmative action: High court hands down major ruling on race\n\nHigher education experts were still parsing the implications of a ruling Thursday that struck down affirmative action admissions policies used by Harvard College and the University of North Carolina to diversify their campuses.\n\nIn one of the year's most closely watched cases, the court ruled along ideological lines that the way the colleges approached race violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. The decision drew a sharp rebuke from the court's liberal wing, who said it rolled \"decades of precedent and momentous progress.\"\n\nCase tracker:Race, religion and debt. Here are the biggest cases pending at the Supreme Court\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, long a skeptic of race-based policies, wrote that too many universities \"have concluded, wrongly, that the touchstone of an individual’s identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their skin.\" The nation's constitutional history, he wrote, \"does not tolerate that choice.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/30"}]}

James Comer of Kentucky, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee. “I want to be clear: This is an investigation of Joe Biden, and that’s where the committee will focus in this next Congress.”\n\nIn a wide-ranging news conference flanked by GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, who is expected to become chair of the House Judiciary Committee, and other Republicans on the oversight committee, Comer said Republicans have made connections between the president’s son, Hunter Biden, and the president that they believe requires further investigation. Comer said his team has spoken with multiple whistleblowers who say they were involved in schemes involving the Biden family, reviewed Hunter Biden’s laptop, and received “previously unknown transactions.”\n\nComer is specifically zeroing in on more than 100 bank activity reports – known as Suspicious Activity Reports – that are allegedly related to the Biden family and says that the Treasury Department has ignored his repeated requests when Republicans were in the minority to hand over them over.\n\nSo far, Comer says he has only seen two of those reports, and he renewed his request for the remainder of them today. Such reports are not always indicative of criminal activity or wrongdoing.\n\nAs part of his investigation, Comer said, “We would love to talk to people in the Biden family, specifically Hunter and Joe Biden.”\n\nThe White House said the investigations are politically motivated and a waste of time.\n\n“Instead of working with President Biden to address issues important to the American people, like lower costs, congressional Republicans’ top priority is to go after President Biden with politically motivated attacks chock full of long-debunked conspiracy theories” spokesmen for the White House Counsel’s office, Ian Sams, said in a statement to CNN.\n\n“President Biden is not going to let these political attacks distract him from focusing on Americans’ priorities, and we hope congressional Republicans will join us in tackling them instead of wasting time and resources on political revenge,” Sams added.\n\nA spokeswoman for Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, Nelly Decker, said the Republicans “rehashed the same, partisan talking points” that have been circulating for years.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback President Biden on his son Hunter: 'I have great confidence in my son. I love him' 01:17 - Source: CNN\n\n“Now that former President Trump is running for office again, House Republicans’ top priority is attacking President Biden and his family in a desperate attempt to return Mr. Trump to power,” Decker said in a statement.\n\nRepublicans had little ability to enforce their document requests while they were in the minority. But once the new Congress is sworn in in January, Republicans will gain subpoena power, a more powerful enforcement mechanism to try to compel individuals and government entities to hand over information.\n\nPrivate attorneys representing Biden family members did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nZeroing in on suspicious activity reports\n\nAt the heart of Comer’s investigation is digging into a series of suspicious activity reports that Republicans claim banks have filed related to Hunter Biden’s financial activities. In a letter to the Treasury Department on Thursday, Comer sought any such reports related to various members of the Biden family, their business associates and companies linked to Hunter Biden.\n\nComer also is seeking communications within the Treasury Department, its financial crimes enforcement division and the White House regarding those family members and related businesses and associates.\n\nWhile Republicans have seized on the suspicious activity reports as evidence that Joe Biden’s son was involved in problematic activities, such reports are not conclusive and do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing. Financial institutions file millions of suspicious activity reports each year and few lead to law enforcement inquiries.\n\nComer sent a letter to a financial adviser, who Comer has said was managing Hunter Biden’s finances, seeking any suspicious activity reports, as well as financial information about Hunter Biden. He is also seeking information from one of Hunter Biden’s former business partners, including communications related to Hunter Biden and Joe Biden’s finances, taxes and debts.\n\nThe letters were part of a new round Comer fired off to various government agencies and individuals Thursday seeking more information to further his probe.\n\nHe also asked the National Archives for flight manifests and other documents related to Air Force Two and Marine Two during Biden’s tenure as vice president, as well as communications related to Russia, Ukraine and Hunter Biden during his vice presidency.\n\nFrom the FBI, he’s seeking any documents related to “foreign intelligence services’ efforts to compromise the Biden family” and information about Timothy Thibault, a former FBI agent that Republicans have accused of politicizing investigations. Thibault has denied wrongdoing.\n\nAnother letter went to Georges Bergés, the gallery owner who showcased and sold Hunter Biden’s artwork. Among the documents requested were communications with the White House and Hunter Biden, discussions about the pricing of Hunter Biden’s work, and rosters of those who attended Hunter Biden’s art shows and purchased his work.\n\nAlleged ‘politicization’ at the FBI\n\nFederal prosecutors have been investigating Hunter Biden since 2018 and have not brought any charges yet. When asked by CNN if they know whether the claims presented Thursday have already been investigated by federal prosecutors, Jordan said: “We don’t know.”\n\nJordan also said that under his leadership, the House Judiciary Committee will look into alleged “politicization” at the FBI. Jordan and other Republican lawmakers previously claimed that they’ve heard from FBI insiders about anti-conservative bias fueling FBI decision-making, especially at the FBI’s Washington Field Office.\n\n“I’ve been in Congress a few years now, and I’ve never seen anything like it,” Jordan said. “Fourteen (FBI) agents come talk to us while we’re in the minority about how political that place has become.”\n\nAccording to Jordan, the alleged politicization might include attempts by the FBI to suppress media coverage of the Hunter Biden story in 2020.\n\nMany of these claims have been circulating in GOP circles during Biden’s administration – with Republicans taking over the House next year, they’ll have an official platform to investigate these matters and put them on full display.\n\nAt least one of the FBI agents that the GOP lawmakers are scrutinizing has previously denied any wrongdoing. The “whistleblowers” are anonymous and haven’t testified at any public Congressional hearings.\n\n“The FBI has testified to Congress and responded to letters from legislators on numerous occasions to provide an accurate accounting of how we do our work” an FBI spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.\n\n“The men and women of the FBI devote themselves to protecting the American people from terrorism, violent crime, cyber threats and other dangers,” the spokesperson said. “Put quite simply: we follow the facts without regard for politics.”", "authors": ["Annie Grayer Sara Murray Marshall Cohen", "Annie Grayer", "Sara Murray", "Marshall Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/politics/trump-mar-a-lago-investigation/index.html", "title": "FBI took 11 sets of classified material from Trump's Mar-a-Lago ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Justice Department removed 11 sets of classified documents from former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence while executing a search warrant this week for possible violations of the Espionage Act and other crimes, according to court documents unsealed and released on Friday.\n\nThe property receipt, which was also released on Friday, for Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home shows that some of the materials recovered were marked as “top secret/SCI” – one of the highest levels of classification.\n\nThe search warrant identifies three federal crimes that the Justice Department is looking at as part of its investigation: violations of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice and criminal handling of government records. The inclusion of the crimes indicates the Justice Department has probable cause to investigate those offenses as it was gathering evidence in the search. No one has been charged with a crime at this time.\n\nThe warrant receipt didn’t detail the subject of these classified documents but did note that federal agents seized just one set marked “top secret/SCI.”\n\nAgents also took four sets of “top secret” documents, three sets of “secret” documents, and three sets of “confidential” documents, court documents show. In total, the unsealed warrant shows the FBI collected more than 20 boxes, as well as binders of photos, sets of classified government materials and at least one handwritten note.\n\nThe warrant, which was unsealed and released publicly following a federal judge’s order, was obtained by CNN ahead of its release. The moment marks an unprecedented week that began with the search – an evidence-gathering step in a national security investigation.\n\nSearch warrant reveals new details about scope of FBI probe\n\nWhile details about the documents themselves remain scarce, the laws cited in the warrant offer new insight into what the FBI was looking for when it searched Trump’s home, an unprecedented step that has prompted a firestorm of criticism from the former President’s closest allies.\n\nThe laws cover “destroying or concealing documents to obstruct government investigations” and the unlawful removal of government records, according to the search warrant released Friday.\n\nAlso among the laws listed is one known as the Espionage Act, which relates to the “retrieval, storage, or transmission of national defense information or classified material.”\n\nAll three criminal laws cited in the warrant are from Title 18 of the United States Code. None of them solely hinge on whether information was deemed to be unclassified.\n\nOne of the less-sensitive items taken from Trump’s resort, according to a the property receipt, was a document about pardoning Roger Stone, a staunch Trump ally who was convicted in 2019 of lying to Congress during its probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. (Trump pardoned Stone before leaving office, shielding Stone from a three-year prison term.)\n\nIt’s unclear how the Stone-related document seized during the search is tied to the broader criminal probe into Trump’s potential mishandling of classified materials.\n\nDuring the search, FBI agents also recovered material about the “President of France,” according to the warrant receipt. The French embassy in Washington declined to respond Friday to the development.\n\nFBI agents searched ’45 Office’ at Mar-a-Lago\n\nThe court documents released Friday also offer new details about the search itself and revealed that FBI agents were only allowed access to specific locations within Mar-a-Lago as they combed Trump’s resort residence for potential evidence of crimes.\n\nThe judge authorized the FBI to search what the bureau called the “45 Office,” an apparent reference to Trump’s place in history as the 45th President. Agents were also permitted to search “all other rooms or areas” at Mar-a-Lago that were available to Trump and his staff for storing boxes and documents.\n\n“The locations to be searched include the ’45 Office,’ all storage rooms, and all other rooms or areas within the premises used or available to be used by FPOTUS and his staff and in which boxes or documents could be stored, including all structures or buildings on the estate,” the warrant says, using the acronym “FPOTUS” to refer to the Former President of the United States.\n\nThe FBI’s warrant application to the judge specifically said that federal agents would avoid areas being rented or used by third parties, “such as Mar-a-Lago members” and “private guest suites.” Trump owns the sprawling estate, and it is his primary residence as well as a members-only club and resort.\n\n“It is described as a mansion with approximately 58 bedrooms, 33 bathrooms, on a 17-acre estate,” FBI agents told the judge in their application, describing the Mar-a-Lago property.\n\nTrump did not oppose release of search warrant\n\nThe FBI search at the resort in Palm Beach, Florida, on Monday was followed by days of silence from the Justice Department, as is the department’s normal practice for ongoing investigations.\n\nThen on Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the department had moved to unseal the search warrant and two attachments, including an inventory list, but also stressed that some of the department’s work must happen outside of public view.\n\n“We do that to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans and to protect the integrity of our investigations,” Garland said, while explaining that he would not provide more detail about the basis of the search.\n\nTrump said in a late-night post on his Truth Social platform Thursday that he would “not oppose the release of documents” and that he was “going a step further by ENCOURAGING the immediate release of those documents.”\n\nThe court had instructed the Justice Department to confer with Trump about its request to unseal the warrant documents and set a Friday deadline to report back on whether he opposed their release.\n\nTrump’s team had contacted outside attorneys about how to proceed, and the former President’s orbit was caught off guard by Garland’s announcement.\n\nIn a pair of posts to Truth Social following Garland’s statement, Trump continued to claim that his attorneys were “cooperating fully” and had developed “very good relationships” with federal investigators prior to Monday’s search at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n“The government could have had whatever they wanted, if we had it,” Trump said. “Everything was fine, better than most previous Presidents, and then, out of nowhere and with no warning, Mar-a-Lago was raided, at 6:30 in the morning, by VERY large numbers of agents, and even ‘safecrackers.’”\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Katelyn Polantz Zachary Cohen Sara Murray Marshall Cohen", "Katelyn Polantz", "Zachary Cohen", "Sara Murray", "Marshall Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/22/politics/secret-service-investigators-text-messages/index.html", "title": "Secret Service identified potential missing text messages on phones ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSecret Service investigators were scrutinizing the phones of 10 Secret Service personnel that contained metadata showing text messages were sent and received around January 6, 2021, but were not retained, two sources told CNN.\n\nThe scrutiny came after the Department of Homeland Security inspector general asked for the text records last year of 24 individuals at the Secret Service who were involved in January 6, but only one text had been produced. After the issue spilled into public view this month, the inspector general launched a criminal investigation into the matter, and lawmakers demanded answers from the Secret Service to go back and find out what happened to the texts that may have been deleted.\n\nBut the Secret Service’s internal investigation ground to a halt after a July 20 letter from the DHS inspector general informed the agency there was an ongoing criminal investigation, directing the Secret Service to stop its own probe.\n\nInvestigators had been working to determine whether the content of the text messages sent by the 10 personnel contained relevant information that should have been preserved, the sources said. Among the 24 Secret Service personnel under scrutiny, 10 other Secret Service personnel had no text messages, and three had only personal records, according to the sources.\n\nThe details of scrutiny of messages from 10 Secret Service personnel caps an extraordinary week of turmoil for the agency, which started with the inspector general demanding answers about potential missing texts and led to a congressional subpoena and a criminal investigation into the matter.\n\nThe text messages at issue may have been deleted when the agency conducted a data migration of phones that began January 27, 2021. According to a letter sent from the Secret Service to the House select committee investigating the insurrection, which has also sought messages around January 6 from the Secret Service, the inspector general asked for records from the 24 personnel in June 2021 – more than two months after the migration had been completed.\n\nMembers of the House select committee have stressed their belief the agency should have done more to preserve records prior to the migration, citing a January 16, 2021, letter from congressional committees to multiple agencies, including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security Office of Intelligence and Analysis, instructing them to preserve records related to January 6.\n\nAn appendix to that letter instructed the head of the intelligence an analysis office, Joe Maher, to circulate that request among relevant DHS components, which could, in theory, include the Secret Service.\n\nAnthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the Secret Service, told CNN the agency conducted an eight-hour search Thursday of various internal message systems to try to determine if the January 16 request was sent to the Secret Service.

Tate Reeves. The National Guard was called up to help distribute bottled water as crews work to get the water treatment plant back online, state officials said.\n\nBut the distribution itself proved unsustainable. Residents of all ages were seen waiting in lines more than a mile long at Hawkins Field Airport for at least two hours Tuesday for just one case of bottled water. The event was supposed to span three hours, but barely ran two as people were eventually turned away when the 700 cases of water ran out.\n\n“I keep saying we’re going to be the next Michigan,” said Jeraldine Watts, 86, who was able to get water at a grocery store Monday night. “And it looks like that’s exactly what we’re headed for.”\n\nWatts was referring to the water crisis in the city of Flint, which has battled water issues since a 2014 water crisis in which lead-contaminated water fed to residents’ faucets.\n\nPeople line up for water in Jackson, Mississippi, on August 30, 2022. CNN\n\nJackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba told CNN’s Pamela Brown the city is working on more water distribution events. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency will provide nearly 30 water trucks to help supplement the city events, the mayor said.\n\n“I have been assured by MEMA that they will supplement those locations with about 28 tanker trucks distributed at various points across the city,” Lumumba told CNN.\n\nExplanations for Jackson’s failing system are complicated: Damage this summer to pumps at the main water treatment facility made failure increasingly likely as the summer progressed, the governor said; and flooding of the Pearl River after heavy rains last week affected treatment processes and therefore the amount of running water the system can provide, Lumumba said.\n\nThis week’s troubles come as the water system has been plagued with problems for years and with the city already under a boil water notice since late July for what the state called a water-quality issue.\n\nThe state is “surging our resources to the city’s water treatment facility and beginning emergency maintenance, repairs and improvements,” Gov. Reeves said. “We will do everything in our power to restore water pressure and get water flowing back to the people of Jackson.”\n\nWater for those in the state’s most populous city would have to be provided “for an unknown period of time,” Reeves said.\n\nThe water shortage is expected to last “the next couple of days,” according to the mayor’s office.\n\nLumumba also announced Monday the city’s public works director – a role that oversees the water treatment facilities – has been reassigned. Marlin King will instead serve as deputy director and Jordan Hillman, the city’s planning and development director, will be the interim public works director, according to Melissa Payne, the mayor’s spokesperson.\n\nKing did not respond to CNN requests for comment. Payne said King’s reassignment “is part of restructuring” and is not a result of the current water crisis.\n\nResidents say faucet water is discolored\n\nState Rep. Ronnie Crudup Jr. said he didn’t have running water Monday, but on Tuesday, discolored water came out of his faucet that he used to flush the toilet. He and his family used bottled water Tuesday morning to brush their teeth, Crudup told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota.\n\nCrudup said that although the city has experienced water issues in the past, rain played a part in the current water emergency.\n\n“It’s been building up for years, but we have had an unprecedented amount of rain in the last two to three weeks, and it just kind of created this havoc, what we are dealing with right now,” he said.\n\nJackson resident Daryl Page told CNN he’s been searching for clean, bottled water since the city’s been under a boil water notice “for a whole month.” He was driving to a distribution site, but as he arrived, he noticed there was nothing there.\n\nFirefighters and recruits for the Jackson Fire Department carry cases of bottled water to residents vehicles, August 18, 2022, as part of the city's response to longstanding water system problems. Rogelio V. Solis/AP\n\n“Everyone is turning around because there is nothing here,” Page said, adding that his next plan of action was to drive to another site in hopes that he could find cases of water there.\n\nBecause of Monday’s failure, officials announced all Jackson public schools will shift to virtual learning Tuesday.\n\nHospitals are also feeling the strain. Jackson’s University of Mississippi Medical Center released a statement Tuesday saying the Jackson Medical Mall air conditioning is not functioning properly “because the water pressure feeding its chillers is too low.” Portable restrooms are being used in locations experiencing low water pressure, the statement said.\n\nThe university medical center statement also said a fire watch was declared for its Jackson-based facilities, “because fire suppression systems are fed by the city water system. Low pressure in the systems may cause them to be less effective.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed on the water crisis in Jackson and the White House has been “in regular contact with state and local officials, including Mayor Lumumba, and made clear that the Federal Government stands ready to offer assistance,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“(The Federal Emergency Management Agency) is working closely with the state officials to identify needs, and the EPA is coordinating with industry partners to expedite delivery of critical treatment equipment for emergency repairs at the City of Jackson water treatment facilities,” she said.\n\nIn an emailed statement Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency said “ensuring all people have access to healthy and safe water is a top priority.”\n\n“We are in communication with officials in Mississippi and stand ready to provide support should the State request federal assistance,” the EPA statement read. “In the interim, we are available to provide technical support and information to Mississippi officials as they navigate their plan to address the immediate concerns at the O.B. Curtis Water Plant.”\n\nLater Tuesday, the governor said FEMA has received the state’s declaration asking the federal government to declare the water shortage a federal emergency.\n\nWater system issues go back decades, mayor says\n\nThe problem this week stems from one of two water treatment facilities in the city: the O.B. Curtis plant, which is run by the city of Jackson, according to the governor.\n\nThe main pumps at O.B. Curtis were severely damaged recently, and the facility began operating on smaller backup pumps about a month ago, around the time the latest boil water notice began in July, the governor said, without elaborating about the damage.\n\nThe governor said he was told Friday that “it was a near-certainty that Jackson would fail to produce running water sometime in the next several weeks or months if something did not materially improve,” the governor said.\n\nThe O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant in Jackson, Mississippi, seen on March 24, 2022. Mark Felix/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut Lumumba said during a Monday news conference that it was only a matter time before the water system failed because Jackson’s water system has been faced serious issues for years.\n\n“I have said on multiple occasions that it’s not a matter of ‘if’ our system would fail, but a matter of ‘when’ our system would fail,” the mayor said, adding that the city has been “going at it alone for the better part of two years” when it comes to the water crisis.\n\nIn early 2020, the water system failed an Environmental Protection Agency inspection. The agency wrote the drinking water had the potential to be host to harmful bacteria or parasites, based on observations of the water’s turbidity, or cloudiness, as well as “disinfection treatment concerns, and/or the condition of the distribution system.”\n\nIn March 2020, the EPA issued an order requiring the city to develop a plan to replace and repair monitoring and treatment equipment, to “address dosing processes for disinfection and pH control” and to take more coliform bacteria samples, among other things.\n\nThe city also has endured weather-related shutdowns.\n\nIn February 2021, a winter storm shut down Jackson’s entire water system, leaving tens of thousands of residents without water for a month amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Residents have been under some sort of boil water notice or advisory several times since that storm, including the state-ordered notice posted in July.\n\n“We were here two Februarys ago when we had system failures, and the world was watching us and the world is watching us again,” Lumumba said during Monday’s news conference.\n\nThe mayor also pointed to recent flooding from the Pearl River as an event that triggered the latest water pressure issues.\n\nBecause O.B. Curtis received additional water from the reservoir during the flooding from last week to this week, the facility had to change the way it treats the water, which has led to the reduction of water being put out into the system and reduced tank levels. This is affecting the water pressure at residents’ homes, he said.\n\n“As one crisis may be diverted, another one rears its head,” Lumumba said Monday during a news conference after addressing the flooding in the city.\n\nO.B. Curtis is meant to provide about 50 million gallons for the city daily. The other plant, which usually provides about 20 million gallons daily, has been approved to ramp up its output amid the shortage, authorities said.\n\nIn July 2021, the EPA and the city entered into an agreement to address “long-term challenges and make needed improvements to the drinking water system.” The EPA recently announced $74.9 million in federal water and sewer infrastructure funds for Mississippi, mentioning Jackson without naming specific projects.\n\nHowever, Lumumba has said it would take $2 billion to fully repair and replace the dated system, which city, state and federal officials say also has too much lead in its water in some places.\n\nLumumba declared a water system emergency Monday. The proclamation noted not only the flooding but also numerous previous “unsuccessful attempts to rectify water system issues.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\nAs for restoring water pressure and flow and performing emergency maintenance and repairs, the state would split the cost with the city, Reeves said Tuesday.\n\n“We will cash flow the operation, and the city will be responsible for half the cost of the emergency improvements that we make,” the governor said in a statement released on Twitter.\n\nAt a Tuesday news conference at the plant, Reeves said he is “encouraged” and at the same time “discouraged” by some of the news coming out of the facility.\n\n“We do have a plan in place to potentially bring in an additional rented pump that will allow us to put at least 4 million gallons of water additionally, hopefully, which will be installed by tomorrow morning. That is progress and will help,” he said.\n\nReeves added there is no time frame as of now for safe drinking water, but that over the next 24 to 36 hours residents will see significant truckloads of clean water start to be delivered to Jackson.\n\nOver the next few days, more than 108 semi-trucks of water are coming into Jackson and seven mega distribution sites will have 36 truckloads of water a day for the public to be able to retrieve, according to Lt. Col. Stephen McCraney, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency director.\n\nSystemic issues also contributed to water crisis\n\nLumumba previously told CNN a lack of political will and years of neglect on a national level has prevented Jackson from getting the help it needs to fix its water and sewer crisis. Besides the infrastructure issues, the plant has also been faced with staffing issues, according to the mayor and governor.\n\n“A far too small number of heroic frontline workers were trying their hardest to hold the system together, but that it was a near impossibility,” the governor said Monday.\n\nJackson’s ongoing water system problems already had some residents reporting low to no water pressure and raw sewage flowing in city streets and neighborhoods before this month.\n\nNow, some residents are taking to Twitter – where #jxnwatercrisis and #jacksonwatercrisis were trending – to post pictures of buckets and even tubs full of brown water coming out of their drains.\n\nSome on social media also pointed to systemic and environmental racism as among the causes of the city’s ongoing water issues and lack of resources, given that 82.5% of Jackson’s population identifies as Black or African American, according to census data, while the state’s legislature is majority White.\n\nNAACP president Derrick Johnson called out the Mississippi governor on Twitter Tuesday.\n\n”.@tatereeves, what are you waiting for!? We demand on behalf of the Jackson communities that you request federal aid from @FEMA and other agencies to ensure people have access to a basic human right: WATER,” Johnson’s tweet read. “Make the damn call. This is personal.”\n\nJackson has undergone drastic changes in the past half century. Its economic decline has occurred rapidly over the past two decades, fueled by population decline and demographic shifts.\n\nThe city’s population shrank from almost 200,000 in 1990 to about 160,000 in 2020. Its decline in population in these three decades was driven almost entirely by White flight. The city was 56% Black in 1990. By 2020, 82% of the city’s residents were Black.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Jason Hanna Nouran Salahieh", "Amir Vera", "Jason Hanna", "Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/politics/supreme-court-roe-v-wade-leak-phone-records/index.html", "title": "Supreme Court Roe v. Wade leak investigation heats up as clerks ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSupreme Court officials are escalating their search for the source of the leaked draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, taking steps to require law clerks to provide cell phone records and sign affidavits, three sources with knowledge of the efforts have told CNN.\n\nSome clerks are apparently so alarmed over the moves, particularly the sudden requests for private cell data, that they have begun exploring whether to hire outside counsel.\n\nThe court’s moves are unprecedented and the most striking development to date in the investigation into who might have provided Politico with the draft opinion it published on May 2. The probe has intensified the already high tensions at the Supreme Court, where the conservative majority is poised to roll back a half-century of abortion rights and privacy protections.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts met with law clerks as a group after the breach, CNN has learned, but it is not known whether any systematic individual interviews have occurred.\n\nLawyers outside the court who have become aware of the new inquiries related to cell phone details warn of potential intrusiveness on clerks’ personal activities, irrespective of any disclosure to the news media, and say they may feel the need to obtain independent counsel.\n\n“That’s what similarly situated individuals would do in virtually any other government investigation,” said one appellate lawyer with experience in investigations and knowledge of the new demands on law clerks. “It would be hypocritical for the Supreme Court to prevent its own employees from taking advantage of that fundamental legal protection.”\n\nSources familiar with efforts underway say the exact language of the affidavits or the intended scope of that cell phone search – content or time period covered – is not yet clear.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not respond to a CNN request on Monday for comment related to the phone searches and affidavits.\n\nThe young lawyers selected to be law clerks each year are regarded as the elite of the elite. (Each justice typically hires four.) They are overwhelmingly graduates of Ivy League law schools and have had prior clerkships with prominent US appellate court judges.\n\nTheir one-year service becomes a golden ticket to prestigious law firms, top government jobs or professorships. Six of the current nine Supreme Court justices are former clerks.\n\nThe escalating scrutiny of law clerks reflects Roberts’ concerns about the breach in confidentiality and possibly further leaks. It also suggests the court has been so far unsuccessful in determining Politico’s source.\n\nRoberts ordered the investigation on May 3, designating the court’s marshal, Gail Curley, to lead the probe.\n\nCurley, a lawyer and former Army colonel, oversees the police officers at the building. She is best known to the public as the person who chants, “Oyez! Oyez! Oyez!” at the beginning of the justices’ oral argument sessions. The marshal’s office would not normally examine the details of cell phone data or engage in a broad-scale investigation of personnel.\n\nThe investigation comes at the busiest time in the court’s annual term, when relations among the justices are already taut. Assisted by their law clerks, the justices are pressing toward late June deadlines, trying to resolve differences in the toughest cases, all with new pressures and public scrutiny.\n\nBecause of protests and security concerns related to the Mississippi abortion case, the court building is surrounded by an 8-foot non-scalable fence and concrete barriers.\n\nThe justices are also resolving a New York dispute that could, based on their remarks during oral arguments in November, expand Second Amendment protection for gun owners. Additionally, the court could further lower the wall of separation between church and state by permitting certain prayer at public schools and requiring public vouchers for religious institutions.\n\nThe draft opinion in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was written by Justice Samuel Alito and appeared to have a five-justice majority to completely reverse the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. That landmark ruling made abortion legal nationwide and buttressed other privacy interests not expressly stated in the Constitution. Some law professors have warned that if Roe is reversed, the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision declaring a constitutional right to same-sex marriage could be in jeopardy.\n\nPublication of the Alito draft opinion has already prompted national protests and dueling state legislative efforts – to further eliminate all options for a woman seeking to terminate a pregnancy or, alternatively, to try to safeguard women’s access to abortion where possible.\n\nBut it is difficult for anyone outside the building to know whether the Alito draft still commands a majority on a court tightly divided on abortion rights and split over how quickly to reverse precedent.\n\nScrutiny of a secretive group\n\nAs the justices continue their secret negotiations, the scrutiny of the law clerks is heating up.\n\nThe clerks have been the subject of much of the outside speculation over who might have disclosed the draft, but they are not the only insiders who had access. Alito’s opinion, labeled a first draft and dated February 10, would have been circulated to the nine justices, their clerks, and key staffers within each justice’s chambers and select administrative offices.\n\nIf tradition was followed, copies were sent electronically and, separately, printed out and hand-delivered to chambers by aides to the marshal.\n\nOther employees connected to the nine chambers would have had some access to the opinion. CNN could not verify that number, but former law clerks say the document could have been sent through regular channels to nearly 75 people. It is not known if court officials are asking employees who are part of the permanent staff, beyond the one-year law clerks, for their phone records.\n\nCell phones, of course, hold an enormous amount of information, related to personal interactions, involving all manner of content, texts and images, as well as apps used. It is uncertain whether details linked only to calls would be sought or whether a broader retrieval would occur.\n\nThere are protocols for handling drafts of court opinions, which circulate electronically on a closed system, separate from the computer system the justices and court employees use to communicate with people outside the court. Yet it is possible for printed copies to leave the building under even innocent circumstances, as work is taken home.\n\nCourt officials are secretive even in normal times.

Read here.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol has concluded that former President Donald Trump was ultimately responsible for the insurrection, laying out for the public and the Justice Department a trove of evidence for why he should be prosecuted for multiple crimes.\n\n“That evidence has led to an overriding and straight-forward conclusion: the central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed,” the committee writes in a summary of its final report released on Monday. “None of the events of January 6th would have happened without him.”\n\nThe summary describes in extensive detail how Trump tried to overpower, pressure and cajole anyone who wasn’t willing to help him overturn his election defeat – while knowing that many of his schemes were unlawful. His relentless arm-twisting included election administrators in key states, senior Justice Department leaders, state lawmakers, and others. The report even suggests possible witness tampering with the committee’s investigation.\n\nThe committee repeatedly uses forceful language to describe Trump’s intent: that he “purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud” in order to aid his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and to successfully solicit about $250 million in political contributions. “These false claims provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.”\n\nThe full report, based on 1,000-plus interviews, documents collected including emails, texts, phone records and a year and a half of investigation by the nine-member bipartisan committee, will be released Wednesday, along with along with transcripts and other materials collected in the investigation.\n\nHere’s what’s in the report summary:\n\nThe committee thinks Trump and others committed crimes, and is referring them to DOJ\n\nThe House committee lays out a number of criminal statutes it believes were violated in the plots to stave off Trump’s defeat and says there’s evidence for criminal referrals to the Justice Department for Trump, Trump attorney John Eastman and “others.”\n\nThe report summary says there’s evidence to pursue Trump on multiple crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make false statements, assisting or aiding an insurrection, conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and John Eastman\n\nThe committee says it also has the evidence to refer Eastman on the obstruction charge, and it names him as a co-conspirator in other alleged criminal activity lawmakers have gathered evidence on.\n\nIn addition, several others are named as being participants in the conspiracies the committee is linking to Trump, including then-DOJ attorney Jeffrey Clark and Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, as well as Trump-tied lawyers Kenneth Chesebro and Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe committee alluded to evidence of criminal obstruction of the House investigation but the summary does not go into detail about that evidence.\n\nSeveral of the individuals named by the committee – including Trump, Eastman and Giuliani – had their own responses Monday.\n\nTrump’s false victory declaration was ‘premeditated’\n\nThe committee outlines 17 findings from its investigation that underpin its reasoning for criminal referrals, including that Trump knew the fraud allegations he was pushing were false and continued to amplify them anyway.\n\n“President Trump’s decision to declare victory falsely on election night and, unlawfully, to call for the vote counting to stop, was not a spontaneous decision. It was premeditated,” the summary states.\n\nThe committee revealed emails from Tom Fitton, president of the conservative group Judicial Watch, from before the 2020 presidential election that say Trump should declare victory regardless of the outcome.\n\nIt also notes that Trump’s top allies, including those who testified before the committee, acknowledged they found no proof to back up the former president’s claims.\n\n“Ultimately, even Rudolph Giuliani and his legal team acknowledged that they had no definitive evidence of election fraud sufficient to change the election outcome,” the summary states, referring to Trump’s then-personal attorney.\n\n“For example, although Giuliani repeatedly had claimed in public that Dominion voting machines stole the election, he admitted during his Select Committee deposition that ‘I do not think the machines stole the election,’” it states.\n\nTrump’s belief that the election is stolen is no excuse, lawmakers say\n\nSources familiar with Trump’s legal strategy in the Justice Department probe have told CNN that his attorneys believe prosecutors face an uphill battle in proving he did not believe the election was stolen despite being told as much by senior members of his own administration.\n\nIn making its case for a Justice Department prosecution of Trump, the House committee took aim at that possible defense.\n\nIn describing why the committee believes Trump’s conduct meet the prongs of each criminal statute, the summary stresses evidence that Trump had been warned that his schemes were unlawful.\n\nTrump raised about $250 million by crying fraud\n\nThe committee says it gathered evidence indicating that Trump “raised roughly one quarter of a billion dollars in fundraising efforts between the election and January 6th. Those solicitations persistently claimed and referred to election fraud that did not exist.”\n\n“For example, the Trump Campaign, along with the Republican National Committee, sent millions of emails to their supporters, with messaging claiming that the election was ‘rigged,’ that their donations could stop Democrats from ‘trying to steal the election,’ and that Vice President Biden would be an ‘illegitimate president’ if he took office,’” the summary states.\n\nSeveral members of Congress are being referred to the House Ethics Committee\n\nThe select committee is referring several Republican lawmakers who refused to cooperate with the investigation to the House Ethics Committee.\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy speaks to reporters at the US Capitol in Washington in November. Michael A. McCoy/Reuters\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, as well as Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona, could all face possible sanctions for their refusal to comply with committee subpoenas.\n\nConcerns about witness credibility and Trump-allied attorneys\n\nThe committee raised concerns that attorneys paid by Trump’s political committee or allied groups were incentivized to protect the former president, saying, “lawyers who are receiving such payments have specific incentives to defend President Trump rather than zealously represent their own clients. The Department of Justice and the Fulton County District Attorney have been provided with certain information related to this topic.”\n\nIn one instance, a witness whose lawyer was being paid by a Trump-allied group was told she could “in certain circumstances, tell the Committee that she did not recall facts when she actually did recall them.” When the witness raised concerns with her lawyer about that approach, the lawyer said, “They don’t know what you know, [witness]. They don’t know that you can recall some of these things. So you saying ‘I don’t recall’ is an entirely acceptable response to this,” according to the report summary.\n\nWhen it came to a specific issue that reflected negatively on Trump, the lawyer told his client, “No, no, no, no, no. We don’t want to go there. We don’t want to talk about that.”\n\nThe committee notes both Trump and his allies attempted to contact witnesses ahead of their committee testimony.\n\n“The Select Committee is aware of multiple efforts by President Trump to contact Select Committee witnesses. The Department of Justice is aware of at least one of those circumstances,” according to the summary.\n\nIvanka Trump and Kayleigh McEnany\n\nThe committee also, in its final report, highlighted two high-profile witnesses – Ivanka Trump and then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany – as being less cooperative than others. They and others “displayed a lack of full recollection of certain issues, or were not otherwise as frank or direct as Cipollone.”\n\nA video of Ivanka Trump is shown on screen during the seventh hearing held by the committee on July 12. Doug Mills/The New York Times/Pool/Getty Images\n\nIn another instance, Trump had an angry conversation with Pence in which he referred to the then-vice president as “The P word,” according to a committee interview with Ivanka Trump’s chief of staff, Julie Radford.\n\nIn Radford’s recollection, the name-calling was upsetting to Ivanka at the time, but when the committee asked Ivanka whether there were any “particular words” her father used in the conversation with Pence, “She answered simply: ‘No.’”\n\nThe summary states: “In several circumstances, the Committee has found that less senior White House aides had significantly better recollection of events than senior staff purported to have.”\n\nAs for McEnany, the committee called her testimony “evasive, as if she was testifying from pre-prepared talking points,” noting she was deposed early in the investigation and wasn’t as forthcoming as others from Trump’s press office.\n\nImpropriety by Trump Justice Department officials\n\nThe report points the finger at two Trump appointees at the Justice Department who the committee believes abused their positions and acted unethically.\n\nClark, the former acting assistant attorney general for the Civil Division, is already well known for trying to weaponize the Justice Department to help Trump overturn the 2020 election. The committee raises the prospect that Clark broke the law. The Justice Department is already investigating Clark and federal agents have searched his home.\n\nJeffrey Clark, speaks during a news conference at the Justice Department in Washington in September 2020. Susan Walsh/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOne of the most egregious things Clark did was draft a letter for the Justice Department to send to election officials in battleground states, urging them to essentially overturn their results. The letter, crafted with help from fellow Trump appointee Ken Klukowski, falsely asserted that the department believed there were problems with the results.\n\n“This was an intentional choice by Jeff Clark to contradict specific Department findings on election fraud, and purposely insert the Department into the Presidential election on President Trump’s behalf and risk creating or exacerbating a constitutional crisis,” the summary states.\n\nIn a new development, the panel flagged its concerns about Klukowski’s conduct.\n\nHe worked for the Trump campaign before joining the Justice Department during the final weeks of the administration. And while at the department’s civil division, he spent some of his time helping Clark with his attempts to overturn the election, “despite the fact that election-related matters are not part of the Civil portfolio,” the summary says.\n\nTrump and others may try this again, committee warns\n\nThe summary’s section outlining the referrals makes a case for why the Justice Department’s prosecutions should extend beyond the rioters who physically breached the Capitol.\n\nThe committee says that Trump “believed then, and continues to believe now, that he is above the law, not bound by our Constitution and its explicit checks on Presidential authority.”\n\n“If President Trump and the associates who assisted him in an effort to overturn the lawful outcome of the 2020 election are not ultimately held accountable under the law, their behavior may become a precedent and invitation to danger for future elections,” the summary says. “A failure to hold them accountable now may ultimately lead to future unlawful efforts to overturn our elections, thereby threatening the security and viability of our Republic.”\n\nThe summary revisits Trump’s infamous phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, where he begged Raffensperger to “find” enough votes to nullify Biden’s victory in the state. The summary also highlights that Trump doxed the leader of the Michigan Senate by tweeting out his cell phone number after he publicly said he wouldn’t undermine the election results.\n\nLawmakers also highlighted the plight of former Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, who previously testified about the abuse they suffered when Giuliani and others in pro-Trump circles falsely accused them of rigging the results in Atlanta.\n\nLike Freeman and Moss, other officials who faced Trump’s ire received death and rape threats and an avalanche of phone calls and emails, and some of them feared for their safety.\n\nPardon requests show that Trump allies knew they were in possible legal jeopardy\n\nThe evidence that Trump allies sought pardons as the administration drew to a close shows that they knew their conduct was legally problematic, the committee argues.\n\nThe summary points to previously public accounts of pardon requests from members of Congress, while providing new details of Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz’s alleged attempt for a pardon, which had been discussed in the public committee testimony of ex-White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson.\n\nCNN previously reported that the McEntee testimony linked Gaetz’s pardon request to a separate DOJ probe; Hutchinson, however, said Gaetz and others asked “blanket” pardons for participants at a meeting where election-related schemes were discussed.\n\nIntelligence and law enforcement agencies knew of threats of violence on January 6, but information didn’t get through\n\nThe summary of the report lays out how the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies were receiving information that January 6 was likely to be violent and shared that information with the White House and US Secret Service.\n\nFor example, on January 3, 2021, Department of Justice officials received an intelligence summary of plans to “occupy the Capitol” and “invade” the Capitol on January 6. According to testimony from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist predicted on a National Security Council call that the Capitol could be the target of violence.\n\n“I’ll never forget it,” Milley said in testimony revealed by the committee.\n\nThe panel suggests former White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato failed to adequately serve as the intermediary between the intelligence community and the White House when it came to security updates ahead of January 6.\n\n“Ornato had access to intelligence that suggested violence at the Capitol on January 6th, and it was his job to inform Meadows and Trump of that. Although Ornato told us that he did not recall doing so, the Select Committee found multiple parts of Ornato’s testimony questionable,” the panel wrote.\n\nThe head of Trump’s security detail, Bobby Engel, testified to the committee that he shared critical information with Ornato as a means to convey messages to the White House.\n\nOrnato confirmed Engel’s understanding of information sharing, but when pressed on whether he talked to Meadows about concerns of the threat landscape going into January 6 said, “I don’t recall; however, in my position I would’ve made sure he was tracking the demos, which he received a daily brief, Presidential briefing. So he most likely was getting all this in his daily brief as well.”\n\nHope Hicks, former senior adviser to President Donald Trump, displayed on a screen during a hearing of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Monday, Dec. 19, 2022.

Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAides urged Trump to call for peaceful protests\n\nStaffers close to Trump told the committee they tried to get the then-president to act preemptively to quell concerns about January 6.\n\nHope Hicks, Trump’s former communications director, texted spokesman Hogan Gidley as the violence was unfolding on January 6 that she had “suggested…several times” on January 4 and 5 that Trump should publicly state that January 6 remain peaceful. Hicks also testified that Herschmann advised Trump to make a preemptive public statement ahead of January 6 calling for there to be no violence that day. No such statement was ever made.\n\nBy the time of Trump’s rally on January 6, the committee says testimony it received indicates that the former president had received a security briefing and that the Secret Service mentioned that there were prohibited items being confiscated from individuals trying to attend.\n\nMotorcade incident proves Trump’s intent to participate in overturning the election\n\nThe committee highlights Trump’s frustration with not being taken to the Capitol on January 6 as evidence that he intended to participate in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“The Committee’s principal concern was that the President actually intended to participate personally in the January 6th efforts at the Capitol, leading the attempt to overturn the election either from inside the House Chamber, from a stage outside the Capitol, or otherwise,” the summary of the report reads. “There is no question from all the evidence assembled that President Trump did have that intent.”\n\nThe report details that the panel was ultimately unable to get Ornato to corroborate a bombshell moment during the public hearings, in which Hutchinson recalled Ornato describing Trump’s altercation with the head of his security detail when he was told he would not be taken to the Capitol. The committee summary said both Hutchinson and a White House employee testified to the committee about the Ornato conversation. But “Ornato professed that he did not recall either communication, and that he had no knowledge at all about the President’s anger.”\n\nUltimately, the committee writes that it “has significant concerns about the credibility of this testimony” and vows to release his transcript publicly. Ornato did not recall conveying the information to Hutchinson or a White House employee with national security responsibilities, according to the report.\n\n“The Committee is skeptical of Ornato’s account.”\n\nThe panel writes that it has obtained evidence from “several sources about a ‘furious interaction’ in the SUV.” The panel cites multiple members of the Secret Service, a member of the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police and national security officials in the White House who described Trump’s behavior as “irate,” “furious,” “insistent,” “profane” and “heated.”\n\nThe driver of Trump’s motorcade on January 6 testified to the committee:\n\nTrump’s former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump continued to push to travel to the Capitol even after he returned to the White House.\n\n“So to the best of my recollection, I recall him being – wanting to saying that he wanted to physically walk and be a part of the march and then saying that he would ride the Beast if he needed to, ride in the Presidential limo,” McEnany said.\n\nAnother intent the committee’s report summary seeks to prove is that Trump’s call to his supporters to go the Capitol during his rally speech was pre-planned.\n\nFor example, the committee notes that January 6 rally organizer Kylie Kremer texted MyPIllow CEO Mike Lindell, “This stays only between us. … It can also not get out about the march because I will be in trouble with the national park service and all the agencies but POTUS is going to just call for it ‘unexpectedly.’”\n\nTrump refused to act as riot unfolded\n\nThe committee lays out Trump’s failure to act as the riot unfolded, noting that as he watched the riot on television, he made no calls for security assistance and resisted efforts from staffers asking him to call off his supporters.\n\n“President Trump did not contact a single top national security official during the day. Not at the Pentagon, nor at the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the F.B.I., the Capitol Police Department, or the D.C. Mayor’s office,” the committee writes. “As Vice President Pence has confirmed, President Trump didn’t even try to reach his own Vice President to make sure that Pence was safe.”\n\nMilley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the committee he had this reaction to Trump, “You know, you’re the Commander in Chief. You’ve got an assault going on on the Capitol of the United States of America. And there’s nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero?”\n\nTrump did, however, take the time to reach out to his attorney.\n\nWhite House staffers, meantime, described being appalled that as the Capitol was under attack, Trump fired off a tweet criticizing Pence.\n\nHicks texted a colleague that night to say, “Attacking the VP? Wtf is wrong with him,” according to the committee’s summary report.\n\n“No photographs exist of the President for the remainder of the afternoon until after 4 p.m. President Trump appears to have instructed that the White House photographer was not to take any photographs,” the committee writes, citing testimony from former White House photographer Shealah Craighead.\n\nIn the aftermath, on the evening of January 6, Trump’s former campaign manager Brad Parscale told Katrina Pierson, one of the rally organizers, that that he felt guilty helping Trump win, the report states..\n\nThe events of the day, Parscale said, resulted from “a sitting president asking for civil war.”\n\nGOP lawmakers called for help\n\nThe committee also highlights real-time reactions from Republican members of Congress who have since downplayed the Capitol attack or defended Trump.\n\nTrump’s son-in-law and former White House senior adviser Jared Kushner described House GOP leader McCarthy as “scared” as McCarthy reached out to members of Trump’s family for help during the riot.\n\nIn a text to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote, “Mark I was just told there is an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol Please tell the President to calm people This isn’t the way to solve anything,” according to the summary.\n\nFILE - Violent rioters, loyal to President Donald Trump, storm the Capitol in Washington, Jan. 6, 2021. John Minchillo/AP\n\nTrump’s reaction upon finding out the Capitol had been attacked: ‘Oh really?’\n\nThe committee reveals a conversation Trump had with a White House employee upon returning to the White House after his speech on January 6. Trump’s actions and conversations from when he returned to the White House to when he called off the rioters, referred to famously as the 187 minutes, continues to have huge gaps of information.\n\nHe asked the White House employee – whose identity the panel kept anonymous “to guard against the risk of retaliation” – if they had watched his rally speech on television. The White House employee responded, “Sir, they cut it off because they’re rioting down at the Capitol.”\n\nWhen Trump asked what they meant, the employee repeated:\n\nThe committee says DOJ has tools to get more information\n\nThe summary acknowledges the roadblocks the House committee ran into in its investigation and says the Justice Department has the tools – such as grand jury subpoena power – to knock down those obstacles.\n\nThe summary also notes the invocations of privilege made by former Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone that prevented the committee from learning details about direct conversations with Trump. But the panels appears optimistic that a recent, under-seal court victory the DOJ secured will allow prosecutors to obtain that testimony from Cipollone.\n\n“Based on the information it has obtained, the Committee believes that Cipollone and others can provide direct testimony establishing that President Trump refused repeatedly, for multiple hours, to make a public statement directing his violent and lawless supporters to leave the Capitol,” the summary says.\n\nMore than 30 witnesses before the select committee exercised their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused, on that basis, to provide testimony.

James Comer of Kentucky, who is likely in line to chair the House Oversight Committee, told CNN he is going to resend a letter to the Treasury Department demanding the agency fork over any suspicious bank activity reports linked to Hunter Biden. A previous request was rebuffed, but Comer said the department may be more inclined to cooperate when it becomes clear Republicans are going to be in charge of the House, meaning the GOP will have newfound subpoena power.\n\nAnd the following week, Comer and Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, are planning to hold a joint press conference laying out what they’ve already uncovered about Hunter Biden, according to sources familiar with the matter. On Friday, Jordan released more than 1,000 pages of his committee’s investigative roadmap alleging political interference by the FBI and Justice Department based in part on whistleblower allegations, while rehashing some previous claims and requests that Republicans have made.\n\nSources say Comer and Jordan next week plan to reveal the contents of at least one suspicious bank report they obtained, though such reports are not conclusive and do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing, as well as a reported text message exchange between Hunter Biden and a financial adviser. Millions of so-called suspicious activity reports are filed every year but very few lead to an law enforcement inquiry.\n\n“We’re going to lay out what we have thus far on Hunter Biden, and the crimes we believe he has committed,” Comer told CNN. “And then we’re going to be very clear and say what we are investigating, and who we’re gonna ask to meet with us for transcribed interviews. And we’re going to show different areas that we’re looking into.”\n\nThe younger Biden, who is facing a federal investigation into potential tax violations and allegedly making a false statement over a gun purchase, has not been charged with any crime. But Republicans are planning to focus in large part on Biden’s overseas business dealings as they try to link him to his father, though it remains to be seen what if any evidence they have uncovered.\n\nHunter Biden has also denied wrongdoing in his business activities.\n\nThe fact that the Hunter Biden probe will be one the GOP’s first order of business following their anticipated takeover of the House next week underscores just how much investigations, hearings and subpoenas will dominate in a Republican majority. Most bills will be primarily messaging endeavors, unlikely to overcome the president’s veto or the Senate’s 60-vote threshold, though they would have to pass legislation to fund the government and raise the national borrowing limit to raise a debt default – an endeavor that is already alarming Democrats. The White House declined to comment on this story.\n\nBiden has also denied wrongdoing in his business activities.\n\nDemocrats see the probes as nothing more than politically-motivated acts of revenge designed to damage Biden ahead of 2024 while throwing red meat to their base.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, told CNN it’s “pretty apocalyptic about what the House will look like” in a GOP majority.\n\n“I think we’re headed for debt default, shutdown, constant impeachments, I think it’s a just absolute nightmare over there if Republicans win,” Murphy said.\n\nOne senior GOP lawmaker told CNN the trick for Republicans will be to prioritize and space out their myriad investigations, warning that too many probes and hearings occurring at the same time could muddle their overall oversight efforts. Plus, Republicans are signaling they want to make sure they slowly build their case against the Biden family, drawing out their investigations well into 2023 to keep their findings in the headlines.\n\nYet GOP leaders will immediately feel pressure from their right flank to go further – even move to impeach Biden or the homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, areas that could divide their conference.\n\n“Let’s not rush to judgment, let’s build your case,” said Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, when asked about pursuing impeachment. “You got to build your case first before you do something of that magnitude – otherwise it’s not credible.”\n\nThe wide range of possible probes – including over the US-Mexico border, the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, and IRS actions – are just a taste of what Republicans have begun to plot before the votes are even tallied on Tuesday.\n\nThey are also eyeing major institutional changes, including ditching the House’s remote voting system and the metal detectors placed outside the chamber after January 6, 2021; potentially imposing term limits on Democratic committee leaders; and kicking some Democrats off their committees while restoring controversial GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar to theirs.\n\nEven as some plans are already being fleshed out, sources say GOP leadership will establish working groups after the midterms to help make key decisions about their new majority in an attempt to give members buy-in – something that has become a hallmark of the leadership style of House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, who is currently running unopposed for the speaker’s job.\n\nRepublicans eye top targets\n\nGOP lawmakers have been laying the groundwork for their investigative priorities for months, and committee leaders plan to sketch out those plans in greater detail in the immediate weeks following the midterms.\n\nRepublicans have already sent over 500 preservation letter requests to the Biden administration, while leadership has been hosting briefings and classes for GOP staffers on how to best use the oversight tools that could be at their disposal.\n\nThe White House, too, has been staffing up and preparing for an onslaught of probes and potential impeachment proceedings into the administration.\n\nComer told CNN Republicans would like to haul Hunter Biden in front of the Oversight committee and conduct interviews and depositions with some of his business associates and banks. That investigation will be primarily housed under the Oversight panel, but the Judiciary Committee will also play a role looking into how the Department of Justice has dealt with Hunter Biden.\n\nAnother top investigative target is Mayorkas, with some on the right already calling to impeach Mayorkas over problems at the southern border.\n\nGOP leaders have tried to publicly tamp down impeachment talk, though they acknowledge it will be an area ripe for investigation, with House GOP Whip Steve Scalise quipping that Mayorkas “might have a reserved parking spot (at the Capitol) he’s gonna be up here so much.”\n\nRepublicans have also signaled they want to investigate the FBI search on Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence, with Jordan sending a letter this week requesting that the FBI and DOJ reserve a wide swath of documents related to the search, among other. Jordan’s 1,000-page report released on Friday – which includes roughly 50 pages of allegations and the rest mostly letters sent mainly to Justice officials – accuses Biden officials of making politically motivated decisions over Hunter Biden, school boards, domestic spying and probing domestic violent extremism. The report is sure to prompt sharp Democratic pushback.\n\nOther items that key House GOP members have said they plan to probe include the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal, which will be conducted through the House Foreign Affairs Committee; Dr. Anthony Fauci and the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, which will come out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee; and how the administration has dealt with parents and school boards, which will go through the House Education and Labor Committee.\n\n“These letters demand more accountability and transparency from agencies that are becoming far too comfortable grabbing power that doesn’t belong to them,” said Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the top Republican on the House Education and Labor Committee, who said she has sent over 100 letters to the administration. “These agencies can expect even more rigorous oversight from me in the 118th Congress.”\n\nMeanwhile, House Energy and Commerce ranking Republican member, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington hired a new chief counsel of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee last month as the committee gears up to start new investigations, including probes into Big Tech.\n\n“We have a full agenda to hold President Biden and his administration officials accountable for how they’ve shut down American energy, broken trust at America’s public health agencies, made the fentanyl crisis worse, and increased our dependence on supply chains controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, and much more,” McMorris Rodgers said of hiring Sean Brebbia, Republicans’ new chief counsel on that subcommittee.\n\nMeanwhile, on Ukraine, a spokesperson for McCaul, who is likely in line to chair the House Foreign Affairs Committee, says the lawmaker wants clarifications from the Biden Administration about the kinds of weapons that are and are not going to Ukraine, emphasizing this oversight would not be an attempt to limit funding to Ukraine.\n\nMost of these congressional investigations will be housed inside the relevant standing committees, but senior GOP sources say Republicans will create at least one select committee to tackle issues related to China – a longtime priority for McCarthy.\n\nRepublicans trying to build legislative agenda\n\nOn the legislative front, McCarthy has vowed that the first bill Republicans will put on the floor is one to prevent the hiring of 87,000 new IRS agents after the Democrats’ climate and health care bill became law earlier this summer.\n\nIn September, McCarthy and House Republicans rolled out a legislative agenda dubbed the “Commitment to America” that will serve as their roadmap for the potential majority. It touches on everything from energy to Big Tech, but many of the policy proposals are vague and don’t highlight specific legislative proposals.\n\nMeanwhile, the GOP’s right flank is preparing to flex its muscles in any future funding fights, from must-pass spending bills to raising the debt ceiling – areas where Republicans will have leverage and will need to work with Biden and the Senate.\n\nBefore they get to legislation, though, Republicans will have to elect their leadership team and committee chairs. GOP leaders are eyeing a quick timeline for that process, scheduling internal leadership elections and a vote on their rules package for one week after the midterms.\n\nMcCarthy has previously vowed to kick Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell off the House Intelligence Committee and boot Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota from the House Foreign Affairs Committee – retribution for Democrats removing Gosar and Greene from their committees for incendiary remarks last year.\n\nAnd McCarthy has vowed to reinstate Gosar and Greene to committees, potentially even “better” ones,” if they’re in charge. Greene told CNN she wants a coveted seat on the House Oversight Committee and said McCarthy is supportive of the idea.\n\nThere’s also been talk of creating a new leadership position, such as chair of the Elected Leadership Committee, sources tell CNN, though nothing has been decided and those sources say they’re waiting to see how things shake out after the midterms. McCarthy could use the spot as a bargaining chip in his bid for speaker or reward it to an ally whom he wants to have a seat at the table, like Reps. Tom Emmer or Jim Banks, who are both vying to become the GOP whip in one of the most competitive leadership races this fall.\n\nAnother decision that Republicans will have to make is whether to keep congressional earmarks, which Democrats brought back during this session of Congress, and whether to institute term limits for all committee leaders, including Democrats. Republicans already have term limits in place for their chairs.\n\nOn the rules package, the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus is pushing to restore the “motion to vacate” the speaker’s chair in a way that would allow any single lawmaker to call for a floor vote on ousting the speaker. The Freedom Caucus previously used the vote to hang over the head of former GOP Speaker John Boehner, who eventually resigned after repeatedly clashing with the group.\n\nMcCarthy’s allies say he doesn’t want to kneecap himself by agreeing to restore the motion to vacate, but some hardliners are signaling they’re prepared to fight hard for the provision.\n\n“There are some red line issues,” freshman Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado told CNN of the rules package, which Republicans will be able to offer amendments to. “The motion to vacate is a red line.”", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona Manu Raju Annie Grayer", "Melanie Zanona", "Manu Raju", "Annie Grayer"], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/23/politics/fbi-investigation-huawei-china-defense-department-communications-nuclear/index.html", "title": "CNN Exclusive: FBI investigation determined Chinese-made ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nOn paper, it looked like a fantastic deal. In 2017, the Chinese government was offering to spend $100 million to build an ornate Chinese garden at the National Arboretum in Washington DC. Complete with temples, pavilions and a 70-foot white pagoda, the project thrilled local officials, who hoped it would attract thousands of tourists every year.\n\nBut when US counterintelligence officials began digging into the details, they found numerous red flags. The pagoda, they noted, would have been strategically placed on one of the highest points in Washington DC, just two miles from the US Capitol, a perfect spot for signals intelligence collection, multiple sources familiar with the episode told CNN.\n\nAlso alarming was that Chinese officials wanted to build the pagoda with materials shipped to the US in diplomatic pouches, which US Customs officials are barred from examining, the sources said.\n\nFederal officials quietly killed the project before construction was underway. The Wall Street Journal first reported about the security concerns in 2018.\n\nThe canceled garden is part of a frenzy of counterintelligence activity by the FBI and other federal agencies focused on what career US security officials say has been a dramatic escalation of Chinese espionage on US soil over the past decade.\n\nSince at least 2017, federal officials have investigated Chinese land purchases near critical infrastructure, shut down a high-profile regional consulate believed by the US government to be a hotbed of Chinese spies and stonewalled what they saw as clear efforts to plant listening devices near sensitive military and government facilities.\n\nAmong the most alarming things the FBI uncovered pertains to Chinese-made Huawei equipment atop cell towers near US military bases in the rural Midwest. According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, the FBI determined the equipment was capable of capturing and disrupting highly restricted Defense Department communications, including those used by US Strategic Command, which oversees the country’s nuclear weapons.\n\nWhile broad concerns about Huawei equipment near US military installations have been well known, the existence of this investigation and its findings have never been reported. Its origins stretch back to at least the Obama administration. It was described to CNN by more than a dozen sources, including current and former national security officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nF.E. Warren Air Force Base, a strategic missile base, is located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, an area near a host of cell towers using Huawei equipment. From F.E. Warren Air Force Base/Facebook\n\nIt’s unclear if the intelligence community determined whether any data was actually intercepted and sent back to Beijing from these towers. Sources familiar with the issue say that from a technical standpoint, it’s incredibly difficult to prove a given package of data was stolen and sent overseas.\n\nThe Chinese government strongly denies any efforts to spy on the US. Huawei in a statement to CNN also denied that its equipment is capable of operating in any communications spectrum allocated to the Defense Department.\n\nBut multiple sources familiar with the investigation tell CNN that there’s no question the Huawei equipment has the ability to intercept not only commercial cell traffic but also the highly restricted airwaves used by the military and disrupt critical US Strategic Command communications, giving the Chinese government a potential window into America’s nuclear arsenal.\n\n“This gets into some of the most sensitive things we do,” said one former FBI official with knowledge of the investigation. “It would impact our ability for essentially command and control with the nuclear triad. “That goes into the ‘BFD’ category.”\n\n“If it is possible for that to be disrupted, then that is a very bad day,” this person added.\n\nTurning doves into hawks\n\nFormer officials described the probe’s findings as a watershed moment. The investigation was so secret that some senior policymakers in the White House and elsewhere in government weren’t briefed on its existence until 2019, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThat fall, the Federal Communications Commission initiated a rule that effectively banned small telecoms from using Huawei and a few other brands of Chinese made-equipment. “The existence of the investigation at the highest levels turned some doves into hawks,” said one former US official.\n\nIn 2020, Congress approved $1.9 billion to remove Chinese-made Huawei and ZTE cellular technology across wide swaths of rural America.\n\nBut two years later, none of that equipment has been removed and rural telecom companies are still waiting for federal reimbursement money. The FCC received applications to remove some 24,000 pieces of Chinese-made communications equipment—but according to a July 15 update from the commission, it is more than $3 billion short of the money it needs to reimburse all eligible companies.\n\nAbsent more money from Congress, the FCC says it plans to begin reimbursing approved companies for about 40 percent of the costs of removing Huawei equipment. The FCC did not specify a timeframe on when the money will be disbursed.\n\nIn late 2020, the Justice Department referred its national security concerns about Huawei equipment to the Commerce Department, and provided information on where the equipment was in place in the US, a former senior US law enforcement official told CNN.\n\nAfter the Biden administration took office in 2021, the Commerce Department then opened its own probe into Huawei to determine if more urgent action was needed to expunge the Chinese technology provider from US telecom networks, the former law enforcement official and a current senior US official said.\n\nThat probe has proceeded slowly and is ongoing, the current US official said. Among the concerns that national security officials noted was that external communication from the Huawei equipment that occurs when software is updated, for example, could be exploited by the Chinese government.\n\nDepending on what the Commerce Department finds, US telecom carriers could be forced to quickly remove Huawei equipment or face fines or other penalties.\n\nReuters first reported the existence of the Commerce Department probe.\n\n“We cannot confirm or deny ongoing investigations, but we are committed to securing our information and communications technology and services supply chain. Protecting US persons safety and security against malign information collection is vital to protecting our economy and national security,” a Commerce Department spokesperson said.\n\n\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Inside Huawei's connection to rural America 02:55 - Source: CNN\n\nUS counterintelligence officials have recently made a priority of publicizing threats from China. This month, the US National Counterintelligence and Security Center issued a warning to American businesses and local and state governments about what it says are disguised efforts by China to manipulate them to influence US policy.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray just traveled to London for a joint meeting with top British law enforcement officials to call attention to the Chinese threats.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN, Wray said the FBI opens a new China counterintelligence investigation every 12 hours. “That’s probably about 2,000 or so investigations,” said Wray. “And that’s not even talking about their cyber theft, where they have a bigger hacking program than that of every other major nation combined, and have stolen more of Americans’ personal and corporate data than every nation combined.”\n\nAsked why after years of national security concerns raised over Huawei, the equipment is still largely in place atop cell towers near US military bases, Wray said that, “We’re concerned about allowing any company that is beholden to a nation state that doesn’t adhere to and share our values, giving that company the ability to burrow into our telecommunications infrastructure.”\n\nHe noted that in 2020, the DOJ indicted Huawei with racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to steal trade secrets.\n\n“And I think that’s probably about all I can say on the topic,” said Wray.\n\nCritics see xenophobic overreach\n\nDespite its tough talk, the US government’s refusal to provide evidence to back up its claims that Huawei tech poses a risk to US national security has led some critics to accuse it of xenophobic overreach. The lack of a smoking gun also raises questions of whether US officials can separate legitimate Chinese investment from espionage.\n\n“All of our products imported to the US have been tested and certified by the FCC before being deployed there,” Huawei said in its statement to CNN. “Our equipment only operates on the spectrum allocated by the FCC for commercial use. This means it cannot access any spectrum allocated to the DOD.”\n\n“For more than 30 years, Huawei has maintained a proven track record in cyber security and we have never been involved in any malicious cyber security incidents,” the statement said.\n\nIn its zeal to sniff out evidence of Chinese spying, critics argue the feds have cast too wide a net — in particular as it relates to academic institutions. In one recent high-profile case, a federal judge acquitted a former University of Tennessee engineering professor whom the Justice Department had prosecuted under its so-called China Initiative that targets Chinese spying, arguing “there was no evidence presented that [the professor] ever collaborated with a Chinese university in conducting NASA-funded research.”\n\nAnd on Jan. 20, the Justice Department dropped a separate case against an MIT professor accused of hiding his ties to China, saying it could no longer prove its case. In February, the Biden administration shut down the China Initiative entirely.\n\nThe federal government’s reticence across multiple administrations to detail what it knows has led some critics to accuse the government of chasing ghosts.\n\n“It really comes down to: do you treat China as a neutral actor — because if you treat China as a neutral actor, then yeah, this seems crazy, that there’s some plot behind every tree,” said Anna Puglisi, a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. “However, China has shown us through its policies and actions it is not a neutral actor.”\n\nChinese tech in the American heartland\n\nAs early as the Obama administration, FBI agents were monitoring a disturbing pattern along stretches of Interstate 25 in Colorado and Montana, and on arteries into Nebraska. The heavily trafficked corridor connects some of the most secretive military installations in the US, including an archipelago of nuclear missile silos.\n\nFor years, small, rural telecom providers had been installing cheaper, Chinese-made routers and other technology atop cell towers up and down I-25 and elsewhere in the region. Across much of these sparsely populated swaths of the west, these smaller carriers are the only option for cell coverage. And many of them turned to Huawei for cheaper, reliable equipment.\n\nBeginning in late 2011, Viaero, the largest regional provider in the area, inked a contract with Huawei to provide the equipment for its upgrade to 3G. A decade later, it has Huawei tech installed across its entire fleet of towers, roughly 1,000 spread over five western states.\n\nAs Huawei equipment began to proliferate near US military bases, federal investigators started taking notice, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Of particular concern was that Huawei was routinely selling cheap equipment to rural providers in cases that appeared to be unprofitable for Huawei — but which placed its equipment near military assets.\n\nFederal investigators initially began “examining [Huawei] less from a technical lens and more from a business/financial view,” explained John Lenkart, a former senior FBI agent focused on counterintelligence issues related to China. Officials studied where Huawei sales efforts were most concentrated and looked for deals that “made no sense from a return-on-investment perspective,” Lenkart said.\n\n“A lot of [counterintelligence] concerns were uncovered based on” those searches, Lenkart said.\n\nBy examining the Huawei equipment themselves, FBI investigators determined it could recognize and disrupt DOD-spectrum communications — even though it had been certified by the FCC, according to a source familiar with the investigation.\n\n“It’s not technically hard to make a device that complies with the FCC that listens to nonpublic bands but then is quietly waiting for some activation trigger to listen to other bands,” said Eduardo Rojas, who leads the radio spectrum lab at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida. “Technically, it’s feasible.”\n\nTo prove a device had clandestine capabilities, Rojas said, would require technical experts to strip down a device “to the semi-conductor level” and “reverse engineer the design.” But, he said, it can be done.\n\nAnd there was another big concern along I-25, sources familiar with the investigation said.\n\nWeather camera worries\n\nAround 2014, Viaero started mounting high-definition surveillance cameras on its towers to live-stream weather and traffic, a public service it shared with local news organizations. With dozens of cameras posted up and down I-25, the cameras provided a 24-7 bird’s eye view of traffic and incoming weather, even providing advance warning of tornadoes.\n\nBut they were also inadvertently capturing the movement of US military equipment and personnel, giving Beijing — or anyone for that matter — the ability to track the pattern of activity between a series of closely guarded military facilities.\n\nThe intelligence community determined the publicly posted live-streams were being viewed and likely captured from China, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Two sources briefed on the investigation at the time said officials believed that it was possible for Beijing’s intelligence service to “task” the cameras — hack into the network and control where they pointed. At least some of the cameras in question were running on Huawei networks.\n\nViaero CEO Frank DiRico said it never occurred to him the cameras could be a national security risk.\n\n“There’s a lot of missile silos in areas we cover. There is some military presence,” DiRico said in an interview from his Colorado office. But, he said, “I was never told to remove the equipment or to make any changes.”\n\nIn fact, DiRico first learned of government concerns about Huawei equipment from newspaper articles — not the FBI — and says he has never been briefed on the matter.\n\nDiRico doesn’t question the government’s insistence that he needs to remove Huawei equipment, but he is skeptical that China’s intelligence services can exploit either the Huawei hardware itself or the camera equipment.\n\n“We monitor our network pretty good,” DiRico said, adding that Viaero took over the support and maintenance for its own networks from Huawei shortly after installation. “We feel we’ve got a pretty good idea if there’s anything going on that’s inappropriate.”\n\nScouring the country for Chinese investments\n\nBy the time the I-25 investigation was briefed to the White House in 2019, counterintelligence officials begin looking for other places Chinese companies might be buying land or offering to develop a piece of municipal property, like a park or an old factory, sometimes as part of a “sister city” arrangement.\n\nIn one instance, officials shut down what they believed was a risky commercial deal near highly sensitive military testing installations in Utah sometime after the beginning of the I-25 investigation, according to one former US official. The military has a test and training range for hypersonic weapons in Utah, among other things. Sources declined to provide more details.\n\nFederal officials were also alarmed by what sources described as a host of espionage and influence activities in Houston and, in 2020, shut down the Chinese consulate there.\n\nUS Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Richard P. Donoghue announcing indictments against China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, several of its subsidiaries and its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on January 28, 2019. Joshua Roberts/Reuters\n\nBill Evanina, who until early last year ran the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, told CNN that it can sometimes be hard to differentiate between a legitimate business opportunity and espionage — in part because both might be happening at the same time.\n\n“What we’ve seen is legitimate companies that are three times removed from Beijing buy [a given] facility for obvious logical reasons, unaware of what the [Chinese] intelligence apparatus wants in that parcel [of land],” Evanina said. “What we’ve seen recently — it’s been what’s underneath the land.”\n\n“The hard part is, that’s legitimate business, and what city or town is not going to want to take that money for that land when it’s just sitting there doing nothing?” he added.\n\nA complicated problem\n\nAfter the results of the I-25 investigation were briefed to the Trump White House in 2019, the FCC ordered that telecom companies who receive federal subsidies to provide cell service to remote areas — companies like Viaero — must “rip and replace” their Huawei and ZTE equipment.\n\nThe FCC has since said that the cost could be more than double the $1.9 billion appropriated in 2020 and absent an additional appropriation from Congress, the agency is only planning to reimburse companies for a fraction of their costs.\n\nGiven the staggering strategic risk, Lenkart said, “rip and replace is a very blunt and inefficient remediation.”\n\nDiRico, the CEO of Viaero, said the cost of “rip and replace” is astronomical and that he doesn’t expect the reimbursement money to be enough to pay for the change. According to the FCC, Viaero is expected to receive less than half of the funding it is actually due. Still, he expects to start removing the equipment within the next year.\n\n“It’s difficult and it’s a lot of money,” DiRico said.\n\nSome former counterintelligence officials expressed frustration that the US government isn’t providing more granular detail about what it knows to companies — or to cities and states considering a Chinese investment proposal. They believe that not only would that kind of detail help private industry and state and local governments understand the seriousness of the threat as they see it, but also help combat the criticism that the US government is targeting Chinese companies and people, rather than Chinese state-run espionage.\n\n“This government has to do a better job of letting everyone know this is a Communist Party issue, it’s not a Chinese people issue,” Evanina said. “And I’ll be the first to say that the government has to do better with respect to understanding the Communist Party’s intentions are not the same intentions of the Chinese people.”\n\nA current FBI official said the bureau is giving more defensive briefings to US businesses, academic institutions and state and local governments that include far more detail than in the past, but officials are still fighting an uphill battle.\n\n“Sometimes I feel like we’re a lifeguard going out to a drowning person, and they don’t want our help,” said the current FBI official. But, this person said, “I think sometimes we [the FBI] say ‘China threat,’ and we take for granted what all that means in our head. And it means something else to the people that we’re delivering it to.”\n\n“I think we just need to be more careful about how we speak about it and educate folks on why we’re doing what we’re doing.”\n\nIn the meantime, the “rip and replace” program has remained fiercely controversial.\n\n“It’s not going to be easy,” DiRico said. “I’m going to be up nights worrying about it, but we’ll do what we’re told to do.”\n\nThis story has been updated to reference Wall Street Journal reporting.", "authors": ["Katie Bo Lillis"], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/politics/takeaways-trump-cannon-mar-a-lago-special-master/index.html", "title": "Takeaways from the ruling granting Trump's request for a special ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA federal judge threw a wrench Monday in the Justice Department investigation into potential mishandling of documents from former President Donald Trump’s White House by granting his request for a special master to review evidence seized from his Florida home last month.\n\nThe win for Trump temporarily prevents the Justice Department’s investigative team from accessing the thousands of documents – some of which are marked as classified – taken from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nUS District Judge Aileen Cannon cleared the way for a third-party attorney to review all the seized materials, not just for documents covered by attorney-client privilege – the circumstance in which special masters are usually used – but also for potential executive privilege concerns, a move the Justice Department has said would be “unprecedented.”\n\nShe did not agree, however, with Trump’s arguments that there had been a “callous disregard” for his constitutional rights with the search.\n\nHere are takeaways from the judge’s ruling and what happens next:\n\nA significant win for Trump\n\nThe primary takeaway is simple: The ruling is a major legal win for Trump.\n\nTrump filed a lawsuit seeking a special master to review the materials the FBI seized last month, and now one will be appointed with the potential to decide that certain materials are out of bounds to the FBI’s investigation.\n\nCannon bought into the skepticism Trump’s lawyers raised about the unprecedented search of the Florida resort, as they questioned whether investigators could be trusted to properly filter through the thousands of documents that were seized. The judge rejected the Justice Department’s assurances that its internal filter team had already sorted out materials that could be subject to attorney-client privileges.\n\nUltimately, the special master appointment may merely lead to a delay in the federal investigation into documents taken to Mar-a-Lago, but it now introduces a new layer of uncertainty and unpredictability into the investigation.\n\nThe former President did not get absolutely everything he asked for – the judge did not rule that any materials seized from his home should be returned to him, for instance.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Attorney explains judge's comments on Trump special master ruling 04:02 - Source: CNN\n\nImmediate next steps focus on rules for special master\n\nCannon left undecided many key questions about how the special master will operate. She sketched out a plan for how things will move forward for at least the rest of this week and focused on settling those logistical matters.\n\nShe ordered Trump’s lawyers and prosecutors to “confer” on several big-ticket items: Who are the proposed candidates to serve as special master? What will their specific “duties and limitations” be? What should be their schedule and pacing? And how much will they be paid for their work?\n\nBoth sides were told to file a “joint filing” by Friday, spelling out their answers to these questions. Based on how the case has progressed so far, it seems unlikely that the two sides will agree on much. They’ll both be able to put in writing their ideas for how they want this to move forward.\n\nCannon said she will “expeditiously” issue a court order setting out “the exact details and mechanics of this (special master) review process” after the joint filing comes in.\n\nShe noted the need to settle disputes between the parties about “whether certain seized documents constitute personal or presidential records” and “whether certain seized personal effects have evidentiary value.”\n\nPlans to review for “executive privilege”\n\nTrump had said that a special master review needed to go beyond documents covered by attorney-client privilege, and that materials covered by executive privilege should be filtered out as well.\n\nExecutive privilege refers to private communications presidents have with their advisers and other types of internal communications within the executive branch that are withheld from public release. While disputes over the privilege have come up in congressional investigations, the reaches of executive privilege – particularly when a former president is arguing it should apply when a current president is declining to assert it – is an unsettled area of law.\n\nCannon’s order requires the special master to examine the documents based on “executive privilege” concerns, making the job more expansive than the attorney-client privilege review that happens typically when a special master is appointed. (Documents potentially covered by attorney-client privilege will be part of this special master’s review as well, according to Cannon’s order.)\n\nShe did not elaborate on the parameters the special master should be considering.\n\nIn her ruling, Cannon said that the Supreme Court had not ruled out “the possibility of a former President overcoming an incumbent President on executive privilege matters.” She quoted from a 1977 Supreme Court case concerning documents from President Richard Nixon’s White House, as well as from a Supreme Court order earlier this year that allowed the release of Trump White House documents to House January 6 investigators.\n\nCannon quoted the Supreme Court saying in the recent case that the questions are “unprecedented and raise serious and substantial concerns” when it comes to scenarios where a former president is claiming to assert executive privilege over materials for which that privilege has been waived by the incumbent.\n\nCNN Illustration/AP/Getty Images\n\nShe also drew from a separate statement from Justice Brett Kavanaugh in that case in which Kavanaugh said it would “eviscerate the executive privilege for Presidential communications” if courts were to conclude that a former president could not “invoke the Presidential communications privilege for communications that occurred during his Presidency, even if the current President does not support the privilege claim.”\n\nCannon conceded that, when all is said and done, Trump’s assertions of executive privilege might fail, but she said that “does not negate a former President’s ability to raise the privilege as an initial matter.”\n\nIntelligence review will continue\n\nThe judge is not stopping the US intelligence community’s from continuing to examine the documents as part of its damage assessment into the potential risk to national security.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Avril Haines told Congress last month that the intelligence community would be conducting an assessment “of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of the relevant documents.” The intelligence community has also been working with the FBI since mid-May to examine some of the documents taken from Mar-a-Lago, CNN previously reported.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback McCabe: Trump's backed himself into a corner on documents 05:59 - Source: CNN\n\nWhile the FBI investigation is related to at least three potential crimes – violations of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice and criminal handling of government records – the intelligence review is primarily concerned with determining whether the disclosure of the material that was housed at Trump’s resort and residence could place sensitive intelligence sources at risk.\n\nTrump got special consideration as ex-president\n\nThe judge repeatedly pointed to the “extraordinary circumstances” present in the special master dispute, given that it involved the “unprecedented” search of a former president’s home. She also said there was a risk of “stigma” that would come with a prosecution that was brought wrongfully and said that the threat was greater in this scenario because Trump is a former president.\n\n“As a function of Plaintiff’s former position as President of the United States, the stigma associated with the subject seizure is in a league of its own,” she wrote. “A future indictment, based to any degree on property that ought to be returned, would result in reputational harm of a decidedly different order of magnitude.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why new Trump lawsuit shows disagreement behind the scenes 03:35 - Source: CNN\n\nThere were other examples in the order of Cannon putting Trump, as a former president, in a special class of defendants. She said that Trump’s reliance on “cooperation between former and incumbent administrations regarding” the exchange of documents also cut in favor of her intervening. (The Justice Department has pointed to several examples in the litigation of Trump’s team slow-walking that negotiation).\n\nIn a footnote rebutting the DOJ’s arguments that special masters are usually appointed to review searches of an attorneys’ offices, Cannon wrote that she did “not see why these concerns would not apply, at least to a considerable degree, to the office and home of a former president.”\n\nWhat can the Justice Department do now?\n\nThe ruling does not shut down the Justice Department’s criminal investigation. Trump still has potential legal jeopardy. But the ruling will limit what investigators can do, and may slow things down a bit, while the special master review is underway.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman said Monday that officials are “examining the opinion” and considering “appropriate next steps.” The one-sentence statement did not explicitly reference an appeal, though that is the obvious next possible option for prosecutors.\n\nIf prosecutors appeal, those proceedings would be handled by the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which is based in Atlanta. The court has four full-time judges appointed by Democratic presidents, and seven by Republican presidents, including six by Trump.\n\nA three-judge panel would be randomly selected to hear the appeal. Whichever side loses that round would get an opportunity to ask the entire 11-member court to rehear the appeal “en banc.” The losing side also could appeal to the Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority.\n\nDOJ officials might choose to only appeal a portion of Cannon’s multi-pronged ruling.\n\nAndrew Weissmann – a venerated ex-DOJ official, former Robert Mueller team prosecutor and prominent Trump critic – tweeted that the Justice Department should “appeal immediately” the part of the ruling that blocks investigators from doing anything with the seized materials, which he called “precedent that is too wrong to not appeal.”\n\nJudge Cannon is a Trump nominee – does that matter?\n\nFederal judges routinely handle matters that involve the president who put them on the bench. The fact that Cannon was appointed by Trump, and that Trump filed this lawsuit, is not grounds for Cannon to recuse herself from the case, though she could if she thinks it creates a perception of unfairness.\n\nFor his part, Trump has a history of politicizing the judicial branch, by attacking “Obama judges” and openly saying that he expects his appointees to do his legal bidding. But this twisted view toward judicial loyalty seems to be pretty one-sided, with Trump expecting political fealty while most judges try to ignore his out-of-court rhetoric and focus on the facts.\n\nHow does DOJ’s so-called “60-day rule” for investigations come into play?\n\nA question lingering over this and other investigations that touch on the former president is how the Justice Department will view the so-called “60-day rule” as applying to investigations connected to Trump.\n\nThe “rule” is an internal DOJ policy that discourages public investigative steps that could influence an election 60 days before Election Day. Trump’s allies have argued the department’s Trump documents investigation stands to run afoul of this principle, even though Trump himself is not a candidate.\n\nIt’s not clear if DOJ was calibrating its approach to the documents probe with that rule in mind, and if prosecutors are doing so, it’s also not clear whether the appointment of a special master affects those plans.\n\nThe investigation appears to be in its very early stages. Prosecutors have described it as such in public court proceedings. And the types of attorneys publicly involved in the probe – mainly coming from the DOJ’s National Security Division – also suggest the probe is at an early phase, former agency officials have said.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed Jeremy Herb Marshall Cohen", "Tierney Sneed", "Jeremy Herb", "Marshall Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/weather/buffalo-winter-storm-new-york-blizzard-wednesday/index.html", "title": "Winter storm in Buffalo: Crews work to clear snow-covered roads ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe winter storm death toll has risen to 37 in Erie County, New York, as crews continue to clear roads and first responders check on people they couldn’t reach days ago when the catastrophic weather system swept the nation, officials there said Wednesday.\n\nAt least 25 others across 11 US states also have been reported dead in the storm, which buried the city of Buffalo in nearly 52 inches of snow, trapping residents in western New York at home – many without heat as the Christmas weekend blizzard took out power lines.\n\n“It’s a horrible storm with too many deaths,” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said at a news conference as he praised first responders, without whom “more people would have died.”\n\nNow, authorities are going door-to-door to conduct wellness checks, Poloncarz said: An EMS task force is checking locations of emergency calls that authorities could not reach during the storm, while the National Guard will spend the next couple days checking every house in neighborhoods that lost power.\n\n“We are fearful that there are individuals who may have perished living alone or people who were not doing well in an establishment, especially those that still don’t have power,” Poloncarz said.\n\nBuffalo police completed sifting through 911 calls going back to the early days of the storm, Commissioner Joseph A.

Two-thirds of the equipment dispatched to help clear winter snow during the height of the storm also got stuck, he said.\n\nPoloncarz was asked Wednesday about the timing of the driving ban, which went into effect Friday at 9:30 a.m. as the storm hit, and whether there had been discussion among officials about issuing such a ban earlier.\n\nOfficials started discussing a potential ban last Thursday, Poloncarz said, but they initially believed the snow band wouldn’t reach the Erie County until 10 a.m. the next morning. They opted to wait, in part, because officials wanted workers to be able to get home before temperatures dropped below freezing, he said.\n\nOn Friday morning, temperatures “dropped dramatically,” going from rain to sleet to snow within five minutes around 8:40 a.m., he said. Whiteout conditions didn’t occur until about 10 a.m., he noted, after the ban was issued.\n\n“But we have to take a lot into consideration,” Poloncarz said. “If anyone is to be blamed, you can blame me. I’m the one who has to make the final call on behalf of the county.”\n\nCity faces criticism over cleanup; mayor says city working hard\n\nPoloncarz, the county executive, on Wednesday criticized how Buffalo’s mayor has handled storm cleanup efforts, saying Brown has not been on daily coordination calls with other municipalities and that the city has been slow to reopen.\n\n“I am a city resident myself, I live in the city of Buffalo, and it pains me to see the other 25 towns and two small cities opened in times when the city isn’t,” Poloncarz said, adding that the county should take over cleanup efforts so the city can fully reopen.\n\nWhen asked about those remarks, the mayor dismissed the criticism, telling CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday evening, “I’m not concerned about those comments, my concern is for the residents of the city of Buffalo.”\n\n“I’ve just completed hours of touring neighborhoods throughout the city, watching the plowing operations,” Brown said, adding there were agencies from the city, county and state working in recovery efforts who have been doing a “great job working together, working around the clock.”\n\n“We believe that by tonight, we’ll have 100% of streets opened up in the city of Buffalo and it’s my hope to be able to lift the … driving ban before the start of business tomorrow,” Brown added.\n\nOther local leaders have urged a review of how the storm was handled.\n\nA person clears snow along a Buffalo road on Wednesday, December 28.

Barnes/AP\n\nDozens of people rescued by National Guard\n\nThere were 580 New York National Guard soldiers and airmen on the ground Wednesday in the Buffalo area, according to the force’s public affairs office.\n\nThey have two separate missions: Teams of four soldiers go door-to-door to see if residents have power, heat and food – and distributing ready-to-eat meals, or MREs, and water as needed; and teams of two soldiers and two medical providers conduct wellness checks, spokesperson Eric Durr told CNN.\n\nAs of Tuesday, they had rescued at least 86 people “from hazardous situations,” according to a news release, including a woman taken to a hospital just before giving birth.\n\nSeparately, a member of the 105th Military Police Company “learned from his mother that a pregnant woman he was close to had gone into labor,” the release said.\n\n“He went to her home,” it said, “helped deliver the baby, then reported for duty.”\n\nPreparations for flooding\n\nMeantime, Buffalo faces a small risk of flooding as rising temperatures begin to melt the massive amount of snow and 2 inches of rain is forecast through the weekend, the National Weather Service said.\n\nBut “it should take around an inch of rain from this system before flooding becomes a concern,” the weather service said.\n\nIn a news release on Wednesday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced she directed state agencies to help support the affected communities with flood response resources.\n\nResources including generators, pumps and more than 700,000 sandbags were available for deployment from state stockpiles in Erie and Monroe counties, the release said.\n\nNationwide death toll rises\n\nIn Erie County, 29 who died were in the city of Buffalo, while seven were located in the suburbs, Poloncarz said Wednesday, adding he did not know where one person was found. Multiple bodies remain unidentified, Poloncarz added.\n\nHe has asked that anyone with a missing family member to call local police to help with the ID process.\n\nAmong the storm’s victims is Anndel Taylor, 22, whose family said she was found dead in Buffalo over the holiday weekend after getting trapped in her car by the blizzard.\n\nAfter losing contact with her, the family posted her location to a private Facebook page related to the storm to ask for help, and a man called to say he had found her without a pulse, her sister said.\n\nThe winter storm’s grim effects have been widespread, with at least 62 storm-related deaths reported across several states:\n\n• New York: In addition to the 37 deaths in Erie County, one fatal carbon monoxide poisoning was reported in Niagara County. The preliminary investigation indicates snow “covered the external furnace causing carbon monoxide to enter the residence,” the Niagara County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release Wednesday, identifying the victim as 27-year-old Timothy M. Murphy of Lockport.\n\n• Colorado: Police in Colorado Springs reported two deaths related to the cold since Thursday, with one man found near a building’s power transformer, possibly seeking warmth, and another in a camp in an alleyway.\n\n• Kansas: Three people died in weather-related traffic accidents, the Highway Patrol said Friday.\n\n• Kentucky: Three people died, officials have said, including one involved in a vehicle crash in Montgomery County.\n\n• Missouri: One person died after a van slid off an icy road and into a frozen creek, Kansas City police said.\n\n• New Hampshire: A hiker was found dead in Franconia on Christmas morning, said Lt. James Kneeland, a spokesperson for the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department.\n\n• Ohio: Nine people died as a result of weather-related auto crashes, including four in a Saturday morning crash on Interstate 75 when a tractor-trailer crossed the median and collided with an SUV and a pickup, authorities said.\n\n• South Carolina: Two men – including a 91-year-old who went outside on Christmas Day to fix a broken water pipe – died due to the storm in Anderson County, the coroner’s office there said. The other victim died on Christmas Eve after his home lost power.\n\n• Tennessee: The Department of Health on Friday confirmed one storm-related fatality.\n\n• Vermont: One woman in Castleton died after a tree fell on her home, according to the police chief.\n\n• Wisconsin: The State Patrol on Thursday reported one fatal crash due to winter weather.", "authors": ["Dakin Andone Nouran Salahieh Christina Maxouris", "Dakin Andone", "Nouran Salahieh", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}]}

The rule also covers Truth Social, the Twitter clone backed by former President Donald Trump.\n\nTwitter’s move signals a shift toward a more closed environment, one that still accepts incoming traffic from other sites but makes it more difficult for users to leave Twitter’s website for other destinations.\n\n“Specifically, we will remove accounts created solely for the purpose of promoting other social platforms and content that contains links or usernames for the following platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Mastodon, Truth Social, Tribel, Nostr and Post,” Twitter’s support account tweeted.\n\nDespite the bans, Twitter said the new policy will still “allow paid advertisement/promotion for any of the prohibited social media platforms.”\n\nHours after the policy’s rollout, Musk appeared to relent under criticism by other users and agreed to loosen the rules. In an exchange involving Box CEO Aaron Levie — who called the new policy “sad” — Musk agreed it was “reasonable” that some might want to link to their Instagram profiles to promote their own businesses.\n\n“Policy will be adjusted to suspending accounts only when that account’s *primary* purpose is promotion of competitors, which essentially falls under the no spam rule,” Musk tweeted.\n\nThen, amid the continuing backlash, Musk opened a Twitter poll asking whether he should “step down as head of Twitter.”\n\n“I will abide by the results of this poll,” Musk wrote.\n\nAs of early Sunday evening, “Yes” was winning by a margin of 58% to 42%.\n\nInconsistent policy\n\nNotably absent from the list of Twitter’s banned social media platforms was TikTok, one of the internet’s fastest-growing social media platforms whose links to China have sparked national security concerns among US policymakers. Musk’s own significant stake in China through his other company, Tesla, have raised doubts among critics as to whether the CEO would stand up to China if the country’s leaders sought to apply pressure on Twitter.\n\nTwitter’s abrupt policy change Sunday afternoon prompted confusion from the platform’s former CEO, Jack Dorsey, who replied: “Why?” Dorsey followed up with: “doesn’t make sense.”\n\nThe policy change came after some Twitter users announced their intention to move to other platforms last week, in the wake of Twitter’s suspension of a number of journalists who cover Musk. Amid the backlash to the journalists suspensions, Twitter quietly began blocking links to Mastodon.\n\nSunday’s initial announcement appeared to formalize that ban to become official Twitter policy, a move that could further raise eyebrows among Twitter’s regulators.\n\nAs part of Twitter’s new policy, the company said users may not “link out” to social media platforms subject to the restrictions. Users were also prohibited from updating their Twitter profiles to include their account names on other platforms, a way to inform followers where they might be found elsewhere on social media.\n\nFor example, posting encouragement to “follow me @username on Instagram” or “username@mastodon.social” is restricted, Twitter said in a blog post.\n\nAttempts to circumvent that policy will also be enforced against, the company said. For example, use of link-shortening services to obscure the true destination of a URL or attempts to spell out a URL in plain text will also run afoul of Twitter’s rules, the company said.\n\n“If violations of this policy are included in your bio and/or account name, we will temporarily suspend your account and require changes to your profile to no longer be in violation,” the blog post said. “Subsequent violations may result in permanent suspension.”\n\nFirst offenses or isolated incidents may result in temporary suspensions or requirements that users delete the violating content, Twitter said.\n\nIt’s unclear how or if the policy will be implemented after Musk’s apparent decision to loosen the restrictions Sunday evening.\n\nUsers may continue to use third-party software to simultaneously publish their social media content to multiple sites, including Twitter, the company said.\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, as well as Truth Social’s parent Trump Media & Technology Group, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/tech/instagram-bereal-imitation/index.html", "title": "Instagram testing a new feature that looks just like rival BeReal ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nOver the years, Facebook has used Instagram to compete with rivals like Snapchat and TikTok by cloning their signature features. Now, a newer, fast-growing service appears to have caught the company’s attention: BeReal.\n\nInstagram is testing a feature called “IG Candid Challenges” that appears strikingly similar to the core concept of BeReal, an app that has been dubbed the anti-Instagram for its focus on more “authentic” posts. On BeReal, users receive prompts at one random time each day to, you guessed it, “BeReal.” Then they have two minutes to snap and post an unfiltered front-and-back photo of what they are up to at that moment.\n\nSimilarly, the Candid Challenges option prompts Instagram users “everyday at a different time” to share a photo to their Stories within a two-minute time frame, according to photos of the new feature shared on social media. It also appears to use dual-camera shots — a selfie and a rear-camera photo at the same time — which is one of BeReal’s hallmark features.\n\nA Meta spokesperson confirmed to CNN Business that the IG Candid Challenge feature is being tested internally, without offering any additional information on it. “This feature is an internal prototype, and not testing externally,” said Christine Pai, a Meta spokesperson.\n\nBeReal launched in late 2019 but gained immense popularity earlier this year. The app has been downloaded 43.3 million times since its launch, with more than 40 million of those installs happening in 2022, according to data from Apptopia. This summer, BeReal earned the top spot on Apple’s App Store in the United States. It was founded by an entrepreneur in France, but Apptopia data indicates the United States is its top market.\n\nBeReal did not immediately respond to CNN Business’ request for comment.\n\nInstagram previously appeared to mimic one of BeReal’s popular features earlier this summer, with the launch of an option dubbed “Dual.” The feature lets users record using the phone’s front and back cameras simultaneously.\n\nIn recent years, Facebook and its parent company Meta have come under criticism from lawmakers and some users for attempting to beat back competition by cloning core features. Just last month, Instagram faced a backlash from users, including members of the Kardashian family, who expressed frustration that the app was becoming too much like TikTok. Instagram eventually walked back some of its changes.\n\nIn going after BeReal, Meta may be battling to hold on to younger users, who seem to have flocked to the newer service. But Meta must also confront the reasons why some find the app enticing.

Instead, the FTC claims, Meta is trying to buy the upstart company, which would “[dampen] future innovation and competitive rivalry.”\n\nThe agency, which is responsible for enforcing US antitrust laws, accused the tech giant of illegally attempting to expand its “virtual reality empire.”\n\nMeta has bet its future on virtual and augmented reality technologies, and the lawsuit comes as the company seeks to build out use cases for its VR headsets. Supernatural is among the most popular apps on Meta’s headset, in some cases turning users on to the idea of exercising in VR for the first time.\n\n“Instead of competing on the merits, Meta is trying to buy its way to the top,” FTC Bureau of Competition Deputy Director John Newman said in a statement Wednesday. “This is an illegal acquisition, and we will pursue all appropriate relief.”\n\nMeta spokesperson Stephen Peters said in a statement that the FTC’s case is “based on ideology and speculation, not evidence.”\n\n“The idea that this acquisition would lead to anticompetitive outcomes in a dynamic space with as much entry and growth as online and connected fitness is simply not credible,” Peters said in the statement. “By attacking this deal in a 3-2 vote, the FTC is sending a chilling message to anyone who wishes to innovate in VR. We are confident that our acquisition of Within will be good for people, developers and the VR space.”\n\nThe FTC alleged in its complaint that the deal would reduce Meta’s incentive to develop its own competitor to Supernatural, or to add new features to Beat Saber, a Meta-owned VR app that the FTC claimed occupies a similar space as a fitness app. Meta, in a blog post responding to the complaint, said Supernatural is not comparable to Beat Saber and thus the deal poses no competitive harm.\n\n“Beat Saber and Supernatural are fundamentally different products with different user bases, different use cases and different competitive dynamics,” Meta said in the blog post. “And this is not just our take – Within’s leadership team strongly believes its competitors are the Pelotons and other established fitness brands of the world, not Beat Saber or other casual VR games.”\n\nMeta is currently battling another FTC antitrust lawsuit that is seeking to break up the tech giant, centering on its years-old acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC’s action also comes as lawmakers consider legislation that could rein in the power of dominant big tech companies, including Meta.\n\nMeta, then known as Facebook, got its start in VR when it acquired headset maker Oculus in 2014. More recently, it has made a slew of VR-related acquisitions, including game development platform Unit 2 Games and Beat Games, the developer behind Beat Saber. Meta announced its planned acquisition of Within for an undisclosed sum in October 2021.\n\nWithin, a six-year-old VR app developer, released Supernatural in April 2020. Unlike a number of other VR apps, it requires a subscription; rather than simply paying a one-time fee for the app, users must pay $19 per month or $180 per year to keep working out in virtual space.\n\nIn its complaint, the FTC claims that Meta already controls “the top-selling device, a leading app store, seven of the most successful developers, and one of the best-selling apps of all time” in the VR space. The agency pointed to a publicly-reported email Zuckerberg sent to Meta executives in which he is said to have told them it is “critical for the company to also be ‘completely ubiquitous in killer apps,’” referring to apps that will prove the underlying value of new technologies.\n\nThe FTC also notes that Meta already competes in some ways with Supernatural with the Beat Saber app, adding that “the two companies currently spur each other to keep adding new features and attract more users, competitive rivalry that would be lost if this acquisition were allowed to proceed.”\n\nThe FTC’s main argument in the complaint — that the deal would reduce competition by eliminating a competitor — reflects decades of established antitrust thinking, said Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy director at the consumer group Public Knowledge and a former FTC antitrust official.\n\n“Under today’s law, that’s usually the strongest legal argument,” Slaiman said. “But I think they are also taking seriously the role of these particular games as a ‘killer app’ for winning the broader metaverse.”\n\nThe complaint plainly recognizes Meta’s potential to dominate the virtual reality space, Slaiman added. “It’s really refreshing to see the FTC is not ‘waiting to see what happens’ in VR.”\n\nSlaiman also said the timing of the FTC’s complaint could renew pressure on Congress to pass a tech-focused antitrust bill that erects new barriers between tech giants’ various lines of business.\n\nThat bill, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, is awaiting a Senate floor vote, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has not put the legislation on the agenda and proponents face a shrinking window of time before Congress breaks for summer recess.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Rachel Metz Brian Fung", "Clare Duffy", "Rachel Metz", "Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/10/tech/teen-charged-abortion-facebook-messages/index.html", "title": "Nebraska teen and mother facing charges in abortion-related case ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nA Nebraska mother and her 18-year-old daughter are facing multiple charges in a case that involved police obtaining Facebook messages between the two that authorities allege show evidence of an illegal self-managed medication abortion, as well as a plan to hide the remains.\n\nNorfolk police began investigating Celeste Burgess and her mother, Jessica Burgess, in late April following concerns Celeste had prematurely delivered a stillborn fetus, according to court documents. After the two were initially charged, law enforcement continued to investigate and obtained Facebook messages between Celeste and Jessica that appear to make reference to abortion pills and burning “the evidence,” according to a copy of the conversation — which is now being used in the case — contained in court filings. Police claim that after the body of the fetus was exhumed, it appeared to have “thermal injuries” indicating that it may have been burned after the pregnancy was terminated, court documents show.\n\nThe case began before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. But it highlights an issue digital privacy experts and some lawmakers have been raising alarms about in recent months: That law enforcement in some states could use people’s personal data to enforce laws prohibiting abortion, a practice which experts worry could increase following the Supreme Court’s ruling. Experts have warned that prosecutors could, for example, serve search warrants to tech companies requesting location data, search history or call logs to help corroborate whether someone had or aided in an abortion. The Burgess case shows how that has, in some cases, already been happening to enforce existing laws.\n\nCeleste, who was 17 at the time of the alleged incident, initially told investigators that she had unexpectedly miscarried a stillborn fetus, and that she and her mother later buried the fetus, according to an affidavit in support of a search warrant. When interviewed by a police detective she “scrolled through her messages on her Facebook Messenger account” in an attempt to surface the date of her miscarriage, which police said led them to believe that there might be more messages with specifics about the case and to seek a search warrant, according to court documents.\n\nThe public defender’s office representing Celeste Burgess, who is being tried as an adult, declined to comment. The attorney representing Jessica Burgess, Bradley Ewalt, also declined to comment.\n\nInvestigators served Meta, Facebook (FB)’s parent company, with a search warrant on June 7 for information pertaining to the accounts of Celeste and her mother. Facebook (FB) turned over the results of the search warrants within two days. The data provided by the company included over 250 MB of data related to Celeste’s Facebook (FB) account and more than 50 MB of data about Jessica’s account, such as account information, images, audio and visual recordings, messages and other data, court documents show. The data included direct message exchanges between Celeste and Jessica two days prior to the “miscarriage/stillbirth” that suggested they’d received pills, and made plans for how to use them and what to do with “the evidence,” according to a signed affidavit in support of an additional search warrant by Detective Ben McBride of the Norfolk Police Investigations Unit.\n\nIn a Tuesday night statement on Twitter responding to a story about the Burgesses’ case, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said “nothing in the valid warrants we received from local law enforcement in early June, prior to the Supreme Court decision, mentioned abortion.” In a post Tuesday on its website titled, “Correcting the Record on Meta’s Involvement in Nebraska Case,” Meta said “court documents indicate that police were at that time investigating the alleged illegal burning and burial of a stillborn infant. The warrants were accompanied by non-disclosure orders, which prevented us from sharing information about them. The orders have now been lifted.”\n\nThe affidavit filed by McBride, the detective investigating the Burgesses, requesting approval of the search warrant to Facebook noted that he would be seeking evidence related to “prohibited acts with skeletal remains,” according to court documents obtained by CNN Business.\n\nAfter the initial request to Facebook, prosecutors filed an additional search warrant on June 16 that requested evidence of internet searches or purchase of medications used for miscarriage, among other things. Thirteen technology devices belonging to the Burgesses were also seized in response to that warrant, according to the court documents\n\nIn June, Celeste and Jessica were each charged with one felony count of prohibited acts with human skeletal remains, one misdemeanor count of concealing the death of another person and one misdemeanor count of false information. Both have pleaded not guilty to all three, and trials have been set for later this year. After the police obtained data from the two search warrants Jessica was later also charged with two additional felonies, inducing an illegal abortion and performing an abortion as someone other than a licensed physician, to which she also pleaded not guilty. A 22-year-old man was issued a citation in relation to the case for allegedly concealing the death of another person, according to a May police press release. He pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor, according to a report from the Lincoln Journal Star.\n\nThe case was earlier reported by the Lincoln Journal Star, Forbes and Vice.\n\nNebraska currently prohibits abortions after 20 weeks, a law that has been in place since before Roe v Wade was overturned. Celeste Burgess was around 28 weeks pregnant when her pregnancy ended, court documents allege.\n\nAlthough the Burgesses were charged before Roe v. Wade was rolled back — and the protection would not have applied to the women’s actions following the end of the pregnancy — the case demonstrates how private information such as direct messages on social media could be used to enforce laws prohibiting abortion. In 2018, a Mississippi woman was also indicted by a grand jury for second degree murder after an at-home pregnancy loss, after law enforcement pointed to her internet search results such as “buy abortion pills,” although the charges were ultimately dropped.\n\nCaptain Michael Bauer of the Norfolk Police Division said in an email to CNN Business that officers and detectives may not comment on cases outside of court.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court’s June ruling, tech giants largely avoided saying how they would respond to law enforcement requests for data that could lead to the prosecution of abortion seekers or providers — even as some of those same companies pledged to help cover travel costs for their own employees who need to travel to obtain legal abortion services. Asked in June, companies including Amazon, Apple, Google, Lyft, Facebook-parent Meta, Microsoft, Uber, Snap, TikTok and Twitter either didn’t respond, declined to comment or didn’t directly answer questions about how they would handle data requests targeting abortion-seekers.\n\nIn many cases, tech platforms may have little choice but to respond to legal requests for information. Tech companies have broadly said they comply with government data requests so long as they are consistent with existing laws. Now, the rollback of federal abortion protections, combined with the passage of new legislation in numerous states restricting abortion, could make it difficult for platforms to fight certain data demands related to abortion investigations.\n\nIn June, Meta responded to questions about law enforcement requests for data by directing CNN Business to its transparency center and said the company requires government requests to be consistent with the law and with the company’s own data policies. “If we determine that a government request is not consistent with applicable law or our policies, we push back and engage the governmental agency to address any apparent deficiencies. If the request is unlawful (for example, overly broad, or legally deficient in any way), we will challenge or reject the request,” the company states.", "authors": ["Sara O'Brien Clare Duffy", "Sara O'Brien", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/961544/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-7-july-2023", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 7 July 2023 | The Week UK", "text": "Minister ordered mural removal\n\nThe Home Office has confirmed that murals of Mickey Mouse and other cartoon characters on the walls of an asylum centre in Kent for unaccompanied children have been painted over.

Now these families want to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChristopher James Dawley, known as CJ to his friends and family, was 14 years old when he signed up for Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Like many teenagers, he documented his life on those platforms.\n\nCJ worked as a busboy at Texas Roadhouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He loved playing golf, watching “Doctor Who” and was highly sought after by top-tier colleges. “His counselor said he could get a free ride anywhere he wanted to go,” his mother Donna Dawley told CNN Business during a recent interview at the family’s home.\n\nBut throughout high school, he developed what his parents felt was an addiction to social media. By his senior year, “he couldn’t stop looking at his phone,” she said. He often stayed up until 3 a.m. on Instagram messaging with others, sometimes swapping nude photos, his mother said. He became sleep deprived and obsessed with his body image.\n\nOn January 4, 2015, while his family was taking down their Christmas tree and decorations, CJ retreated into his room. He sent a text message to his best friend – “God’s speed” – and posted an update on his Facebook page: “Who turned out the light?” CJ held a 22-caliber rifle in one hand, his smartphone in the other and fatally shot himself. He was 17. Police found a suicide note written on the envelope of a college acceptance letter. His parents said he never showed outward signs of depression or suicidal ideation.\n\n“When we found him, his phone was still on, still in his hand, with blood on it,” Donna Dawley said. “He was so addicted to it that even his last moments of his life were about posting on social media.”\n\n\"For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,\" said Donna Dawley, the mother of CJ. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nNow, the Dawleys are joining a growing number of families who have filed recent wrongful death lawsuits against some of the big social media companies, claiming their platforms played a significant role in their teenagers’ decisions to end their lives. The Dawleys’ lawsuit, which was filed last week, targets Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. The suit accuses the two companies of designing their platforms to addict users with algorithms that lead to “never-ending” scrolling as part of an effort to maximize time spent on the platform for advertising purposes and profit.\n\nThe lawsuit also said the platforms effectively exploit minor users’ decision-making and impulse control capabilities due to “incomplete brain development.”\n\nDonna Dawley said she and her husband, Chris, believe CJ’s mental health suffered as a direct result of the addictive nature of the platforms. They said they were motivated to file the lawsuit against Meta and Snap after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked hundreds of internal documents, including some that showed the company was aware of the ways Instagram can damage mental health and body image.\n\nIn public remarks, including her testimony before Congress last fall, Haugen also raised concerns about how Facebook’s algorithms could drive younger users toward harmful content, such as posts about eating disorders or self-harm, and lead to social media addiction. (Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote a 1,300-word post on Facebook at the time claiming Haugen took the company’s research on its impact on children out of context and painted a “false picture of the company.”)\n\n“For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,” said Donna Dawley, adding she felt compelled to “hold the companies accountable” after she heard how Instagram is designed to keep users on the platform for as long as possible. “How dare you put a product out there knowing that it was going to be addictive? Who would ever do that?”\n\nCJ Dawley died by suicide at the age of 17. His parents allege his social media addiction contributed to his death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nHaugen’s disclosures and Congressional testimony renewed scrutiny of tech platforms from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. A bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate in February that proposes new and explicit responsibilities for tech platforms to protect children from digital harm. President Joe Biden also used part of his State of the Union address to urge lawmakers to “hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.”\n\nSome families are now also taking matters into their own hands and turning to the courts to pressure the tech companies to change how their platforms work. Matthew Bergman, the Dawleys’ lawyer, formed the Social Media Victims Law Center last fall after the release of the Facebook documents. He now represents 20 families who have filed wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies.\n\n“Money is not what is driving Donna and Chris Dawley to file this case and re-live their unimaginable loss they sustained,” Bergman said. “The only way to force [social media companies] to change their dangerous but highly profitable algorithms is to change their economic calculus by making them pay the true costs that their dangerous products have inflicted on families such as the Dawleys.”\n\nHe added: “When faced with similar instances of outrageous misconduct by product manufacturers, juries have awarded tens of millions of dollars in compensatory damages and imposed billion-dollar punitive damage awards. I have every reason to anticipate a jury, after fairly evaluating all the evidence, could render a similar judgment in this case.”\n\nCJ's parents, Chris and Donna, are now suing Meta and Snap over CJ's death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nIn a statement to CNN Business, Snap spokesperson Katie Derkits said it can’t comment on active litigation but “our hearts go out to any family who has lost a loved one to suicide.”\n\n“We intentionally built Snapchat differently than traditional social media platforms to be a place for people to connect with their real friends and offer in-app mental health resources, including on suicide prevention for Snapchatters in need,” Derkits said. “Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our community and we are constantly exploring additional ways we can support Snapchatters.”\n\nMeta also declined to comment on the case because it is in litigation but said the company currently offers a series of suicide prevention tools, such as automatically providing resources to a user if a friend or AI detects a post is about suicide.\n\nTech companies under pressure to make changes\n\nAlthough alarms have been raised about social media addiction for years, Haugen’s testimony – coupled with concerns around kids’ increased time spent online during the pandemic – has made the issue a national talking point. But change hasn’t come fast enough for some families.\n\nJennifer Mitchell, who said her 16-year-old son Ian died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat, is also working with the Social Media Victims Law Center to file a lawsuit against Snap. She said she hopes it will make more parents aware of the dangers of social media and encourage lawmakers to regulate the platforms.\n\n“If we can put age restrictions on alcohol, cigarettes and to purchase a gun, something needs to be something done when it comes to social media,” she told CNN Business. Snapchat’s age requirement for signing up is 13. “It’s too addictive for kids.”\n\nIn August 2019, Mitchell had just landed in Alaska on a business trip from Florida when she received a series of voice messages saying her son died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She said police later told her they believed Ian was recording a video at the time of the incident.\n\n“After trying to get into some of his social media accounts, we found video of him [taken] on Snapchat that looked like he was playing Russian roulette with the gun,” Mitchell said. “We don’t know who he was sending it to or if he was playing with someone. The phone was found not too far from his body.”\n\nSnap declined to comment on the incident.\n\nIan's mother said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat. Courtesy Jennifer Mitchell\n\nThe emergence of wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies isn’t limited to teenagers. In January, Tammy Rodriguez filed a lawsuit, alleging her 11-year-old daughter Selena struggled with social media addiction for two years before taking her own life in July 2021. (Instagram and Snapchat, the two sites her daughter is said to have used most, require users to be at least 13 years old to create accounts, but as with many social platforms, some kids younger than that still sign up.)\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Selena Rodriguez had spent more time on those social networks during the pandemic and started communicating with older men on the platforms. She responded to requests to send sexually explicit images, “which were subsequently shared or leaked to her classmates, increasing the ridicule and embarrassment she experienced at school,” the suit alleged.\n\n“Throughout the period of Selena’s use of social media, Tammy Rodriguez was unaware of the clinically addictive and mentally harmful effects of Instagram and Snapchat,” the lawsuit said. It also cited the lack of sufficient parental controls at the time as a contributing factor, an issue that has been a focus of some recent criticism among lawmakers.\n\nBoth Snap and Meta declined to comment on the case but referenced their resources to help its users struggling with their mental health.\n\n“If a person walks into a bad neighborhood and is assaulted, that’s a regrettable incident,” said Bergman, who is also representing the Rodriguez family. “But if a tour guide says, ‘Let me show you around the city or I’ll show you the top sites,’ and one of those [spots] is a very dangerous neighborhood where a person is assaulted, the tour guide appropriately has some responsibility for putting the tourist in harm’s way. That’s exactly what these platforms do.”\n\n“It’s not random that teenage girls are directed toward content that makes them feel bad about their bodies. That is the way the algorithms work; it’s by design,” he added.\n\nA long and uncertain legal road\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, believes these wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies could hold up in court despite inevitable challenges.\n\n“The problem, at least in the traditional notion in the law, has been that it’s difficult to prove addiction that then leads to taking somebody’s life or doing serious damage to somebody that’s self-inflicted,” he said. “But judges and juries in certain situations might be more open to finding liability and awarding damages.”\n\nHe said Haugen’s “damning” testimony before Congress and the “seemingly troubling” data companies collect about young users, as revealed in the documents, could potentially support a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, depending on each case.\n\nIf you suspect someone may be at risk: 1. Do not leave the person alone. 2. Remove any ﬁrearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt. 3.

However, Tobias said because families are now targeting how the platforms are designed, it “might persuade a court to distinguish the new allegations from other actions by defendants that judges found immune.”\n\nIn the months following the leaked internal documents, Instagram has rolled out a handful of safeguards aimed at protecting its young users, including a tool called Take a Break, which aims to encourage people to spend some time away from the platform after they’ve been scrolling for a certain period. It also introduced a tool that allows parents to see how much time their kids spend on Instagram and set time limits, and brought back a version of its news feed that sorts posts in reverse chronological order rather than ranked according to the platform’s algorithms.\n\nLast month, dozens of attorneys general wrote a letter to TikTok and Snap calling on the companies to strengthen the platforms’ existing parental tools and better work alongside third-party monitoring apps, which can alert parents if children use language that suggests a desire for self-harm or suicide.\n\n“Your platforms do not effectively collaborate with parental control applications or otherwise provide an adequate opportunity for parental control within the platform,” the letter said. “We ask that you conform to widespread industry practice by giving parents increased ability to protect their vulnerable children.”\n\nSnap told CNN Business in a response it is currently working on new tools for parents that give more insight into what their teens are doing on Snapchat and who they’re talking to. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company has expanded its safety features over the years. In 2019, TikTok introduced a limited app experience called TikTok for Younger Users which restricts messaging, commenting and sharing videos for users under age 13. In 2020, it rolled out the ability to disable direct messaging for users under the age of 16.\n\nBergman said he anticipates a “long fight” ahead as he plans to “file a lot of cases” against social media companies. “The only thing that’s certain is the level of opposition that we’re going to face from companies that have all the money in the world to hire all the lawyers,” he said. “They want to do everything they can to avoid standing up in a courtroom and explain to a jury why their profits were more important than the life of CJ Dawley.”\n\nDonna Dawley said the last time she saw her son, on the day of his death, he was looking down at his phone, appearing sad. “I just wish I would have grabbed him and hugged him,” she said.\n\n“[This lawsuit] is not about winning or losing. We’re all losing right now.

It also urged Meta to take steps to hide content from its most prominent users that potentially violates rules while it’s under review in order to avoid spreading it further.\n\nThe cross-check program came under fire last November after a report from the Wall Street Journal indicated that the system shielded some VIP users — such as politicians, celebrities, journalists and Meta business partners like advertisers — from the company’s normal content moderation process, in some cases allowing them to post rule-violating content without consequences. As of 2020, the program had ballooned to include 5.8 million users, the Journal reported.\n\nAt the time, Meta said that criticism of the system was fair, but that cross-check was created in order to improve the accuracy of moderation on content that “could require more understanding.”\n\nIn the wake of the report, the Oversight Board said that Facebook had failed to provide crucial details about the system, including as part of the board’s review of the company’s decision to suspend former US President Donald Trump. The company in response requested that the Oversight Board review the cross-check system.\n\nIn essence, the cross-check system means that when a user on the list posts content identified as breaking Meta’s rules, the post is not immediately removed (as it would be for regular users) but instead is left up pending further human review.\n\nMeta says that the program helps address “false negatives” where content is removed despite not breaking any of its rules for key users. But by subjecting cross-check users to a different process, Meta “grants certain users greater protection than others,” by enabling a human reviewer to provide the full range of the company’s rules to their posts, the Oversight Board said in its Tuesday report.\n\nThe board said that while the company “told the Board that cross-check aims to advance Meta’s human rights commitments, we found that the program appears more directly structured to satisfy business concerns … We also found that Meta has failed to track data on whether cross-check results in more accurate decisions.”\n\nThe Oversight Board is an entity made up of experts in areas such as freedom of expression and human rights. It is often described as a kind of Supreme Court for Meta as it allows users to appeal content decisions on the company’s platforms. Although Meta requested the board’s review, it is not under any obligation to incorporate its recommendations.\n\nIn a blog post published Tuesday, Meta President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg reiterated that cross-check aims to “prevent potential over-enforcement … and to double-check cases where there could be a higher risk for a mistake or when the potential impact of a mistake is especially severe.” He said Meta plans to respond to the board’s report within 90 days. Clegg also outlined several changes the company has already made to the program, including formalizing criteria for adding users to cross-check and establishing annual reviews for the list.\n\nAs part of a wide-ranging advisory for restructuring cross-check, the Oversight Board raised concerns that by delaying removal of potentially violative content by cross-check users pending additional review, the company could be allowing the content to cause harm. It said that according to Meta, “on average, it can take more than five days to reach a decision on content from users on its cross-check lists,” and that “the program has operated with a backlog which delays decisions.”\n\n“This means that, because of cross-check, content identified as breaking Meta’s rules is left up on Facebook and Instagram when it is most viral and could cause harm,” the Oversight Board said. It recommended that “high severity” content initially flagged as violating Meta’s rules should be removed or hidden on its platforms while undergoing additional review, adding, “such content should not be allowed to remain on the platform simply because the person who posted it is a business partner or celebrity.”\n\nThe Oversight Board said that Meta should develop and share transparent criteria for inclusion in its cross-check program, adding that users who meet the criteria should be able to apply for inclusion into the program. “A user’s celebrity or follower count should not be the sole criterion for receiving additional protection,” it said.\n\nThe board also said some categories of users protected by cross-check should have their accounts publicly marked, and recommended that users whose content is “important for human rights” be prioritized for additional review over Meta business partners.\n\nFor the sake of transparency, “Meta should measure, audit, and publish key metrics around its cross-check program so it can tell whether the program is working effectively,” the board said.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/29/tech/big-tech-ad-market-decline/index.html", "title": "The online ad market is in decline and it's dragging down tech giants ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nMuch of contemporary Silicon Valley was built on advertising dollars. That dependence made even the most powerful companies look at least somewhat vulnerable this week after reporting their latest earnings results.\n\n“We seem to have entered an economic downturn that will have a broad impact on the digital advertising business,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts at the start of the company’s earnings call on Wednesday. “It’s always hard to predict how deep or how long these cycles will be, but I’d say that the situation seems worse than it did a quarter ago.”\n\nMeta, Twitter (TWTR), Snap (SNAP), Google (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) all reported that shrinking advertising budgets — a result of the recent market downturn and economic uncertainty — took some toll on their previous quarter earnings and would likely continue to be a challenge in the coming quarters. Spotify (SPOT) also said it saw “softening” in its ad business starting in the last two weeks of June.\n\nEven those with dominant market positions weren’t immune. Google’s core advertising business grew just 11.6% year-over-year, compared to the nearly 69% increase it posted during the same period last year. Meta, Facebook and Instagram’s parent company, posted its first year-over-year quarterly revenue decline in its history as a public company. (Advertising accounts for the vast majority of Meta’s revenue.)\n\nThose much less dependent on advertising felt the pinch as well. Microsoft said it took a revenue hit of $100 million during the second quarter from a reduction in advertising spend. Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts Thursday that “digital advertising was clearly impacted by the macroeconomic environment during the June quarter,” weighing on its services revenue.\n\nShares of Meta were down around 7% from the start of this week as of Friday morning. Snap shares fell more than 25% after it reported earnings last week.\n\n“Today’s results are very much reflecting the impact of a challenging economic environment which is hurting almost every mega tech company,” Haris Anwar, a senior analyst at Investing.com, said in a statement.\n\nIt’s a stark reversal for the online advertising industry. After a brief dip at the start of the pandemic, advertisers began funneling money into online ads to reach consumers who were spending more time plugged into screens. This time last year, Meta and Snap both reported that quarterly sales had doubled from the prior year, and Google’s grew by 62%.\n\nBut the world is a very different place now. Russia’s monthslong war in Ukraine caused some uncertainty among advertisers, and many tech companies responded to the attack by cutting off the ability for Russian-based companies to advertise on their platforms.\n\nMore recently, a surge inflation, a market downturn and fears of a recession have prompted companies to pull back on their ad budgets, tech giants said during their earnings reports this week. Many companies, including in the tech industry, have recently slowed hiring and investments amid the economic uncertainty.\n\nThe very nature of how some online ad campaigns are run has made the pain immediate. Snap CFO Derek Anderson noted in the company’s earnings call last week that “advertising spending — in particular auction-driven direct response advertising — is among the very few line items in a company’s cost structure that they can reduce immediately in response to pressure” on other parts of their business.\n\nThose macroeconomic challenges are expected to drag into the rest of this year. Meta said Wednesday it expects revenue for the current quarter to be between $26 billion and $28.5 billion, which would mark a second year-over-year quarterly revenue decline. Although Snap declined to provide financial guidance because of the uncertain environment, it said third quarter revenue was so far flat compared to the previous year.\n\nThe downturn also comes after Apple’s app tracking changes, which went into effect in the second half of last year, had already been taking a toll on some tech giant’s businesses. Apple introduced a feature that lets users opt out of some tracking by apps, taking away some crucial data that social media platforms use to target ads. The change hurt ad businesses at Meta, Twitter and Snap, as well as smaller players such as Pinterest. Meta’s ad revenue alone took a $10 billion hit from the privacy update last year, and Snap’s Anderson said last week that the changes “upended a decade of advertising industry standards.”\n\nAnd while Google has the benefit of its own third-party data, YouTube’s ad business hasn’t been entirely spared.\n\n“Right now is essentially a perfect storm for digital advertising,” D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said. For companies reliant on advertising, “there’s a high risk to your revenue.”\n\n–CNN’s Rishi Iyengar contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/09/12/are-social-media-users-abandoning-facebook-and-instagram/40113681/", "title": "Are Social Media Users Abandoning Facebook and Instagram ...", "text": "Leo Sun\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nFacebook and its subsidiary Instagram are among the most widely used social networking apps in the world, but a recent Bank of America report claims that mobile downloads of both apps are declining.\n\nThe report, which cites data from research firm Sensor Tower, claims that combined downloads of Facebook and Instagram fell 13% year-over-year in the third quarter so far. Facebook's downloads declined 15%, while Instagram's downloads dropped 9%.\n\nBank of America also notes that downloads of Snapchat, Twitter and Pinterest all rose year-over-year during the same period. Let's take a closer look at Facebook and see why the tech giant might be losing its momentum.\n\nThat's a big problem for Facebook, since its users in the U.S. and Canada generated 48% of its revenue last quarter despite only accounting for 10% of its total MAUs. Its users in Europe generated 24% of its revenue but only accounted for 16% of its MAUs. Simply put, Facebook generates most of its revenue from slower-growth developed markets, but most its user growth comes from lower-revenue developing markets.\n\nFacebook doesn't regularly update its number of Instagram users, but it announced that the platform's total MAUs doubled from 500 million to 1 billion between June 2016 and June 2018. The tech giant is increasingly depending on Instagram's growth – especially in developed markets – to offset Facebook's slower growth.\n\nCourt:Amazon owes South Carolina millions in sales taxes\n\nNissan Rogue under investigation:Claims of emergency brakes turning on for no reason\n\nSaturation, alienation and competition\n\nFacebook faces three main problems in developed markets like the U.S. First, the market is heavily saturated. Pew Research claims that 69% of American adults currently use Facebook, and that percentage has remained unchanged since 2016.\n\nSecond, Facebook alienated its users with a seemingly endless streak of privacy, security and PR debacles, which included the Cambridge Analytica data breach, data leaks from linked third-party apps, severe security problems in WhatsApp, and the proliferation of fake news campaigns at home and abroad.\n\nEarlier this year, a poll by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal found that 60% of Americans no longer trusted Facebook with their personal data, compared to the 37% and 28% who didn't trust Alphabet's Google and Amazon, respectively.\n\nLastly, Facebook still faces tough competition from niche rivals like Snapchat, Twitter and Pinterest. Forty-one percent of U.S. teens ranked Snapchat as their favorite social network, according to Piper Jaffray, compared to 35% for Instagram and just 6% for Facebook. Facebook repeatedly tried to stomp out Snapchat by cloning its most popular features in Instagram, yet Snapchat's daily active user growth still accelerated last quarter.\n\nTwitter remains the top platform for following celebrities, brands, real-time news and debates, while Pinterest's platform of interest-based pins remains refreshingly detached from a user's personal life. A recent Cowen & Co. study also found that 48% of Pinterest's users use the platform to find and shop for products – compared to just 10% of Instagram users.\n\nSensor Tower's numbers indicate that more social media users are gravitating toward these platforms as Facebook's growth peaks. Facebook previously offered users an illusion of choice with Instagram – but that illusion is fading as Facebook tethers Instagram more tightly to its core app with cross-platform features.\n\nShould Facebook investors be concerned?\n\nBank of America's report is noteworthy, but it should be taken with a grain of salt. Mobile downloads aren't directly comparable to active users, Facebook's apps are already preinstalled on many new phones (which reduces recorded downloads), and it's unclear if Sensor Tower's numbers cover all of Facebook and Instagram's higher-growth overseas markets.\n\nNonetheless, it supports the bearish claims that Facebook is running out of room to grow and that its recent missteps are alienating users. Therefore, investors should see if that case has merit when Facebook releases its third-quarter report next month.\n\nJohn Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

CNN examined the highest maximum and minimum temperatures collected by weather stations across the country with at least 30 years of data.\n\nAlthough large swaths of Texas and California endured triple-digit temperatures for several days in a row, the state that matched or exceeded the most heat records this summer was Oregon. The Beaver State registered all-time record heat 66 different times this summer, nearly 60 of them in July alone.\n\nAs sweltering as things may have felt during the day, the heat after the sun went down was even more unusual. In the lower 48 states, the nighttime lows this summer were the hottest on record. More than 70% of all the heat records tied or broken were for the hottest low temperature achieved during the day.\n\nIn addition to several high pressure systems across the West and Northeast, the greater number of nighttime records versus the daytime can be partly explained by the wet conditions in some parts of the country, according to Ahira Sanchez-Lugo, a climatologist at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information.\n\n“Clouds help make the daytime temperatures a bit cooler since they help block the sun’s solar rays, while trapping the Earth’s heat during the night,” Sanchez-Lugo said.\n\nA North American monsoon was active in the southwest this summer and rain clouds have kept daytime high temperatures at bay and overnight low temperatures elevated, Sanchez-Lugo said. In New Mexico, for example, all 15 of the heat records tied or broken in July and August were for nighttime lows.\n\nWarming temperatures at night pose a particular threat to communities without air conditioning, such as those in metro areas in California and Oregon. More than half of residents in the San Francisco metro area lack air conditioning, according to the 2019 American Housing Survey. In San Antonio and Boston, which are located in more humid climates, the same is true of fewer than 10% of homes.\n\nHowever, the heat records broken in California and Oregon occurred in the inland mountain and desert regions, which are more sparsely populated. Although temperatures in the 90s and even 100s and 110s can occur in parts of metro Los Angeles, San Francisco and Portland, the biggest reason those cities have fewer air conditioned homes is because of much cooler ocean temperatures than on the Gulf and East Coasts.\n\n“The seabreeze almost always blows the cooler air over the ocean over land to keep coastal areas fairly mild,” said Ryan Littrell, a meteorologist at National Weather Service Los Angeles. “As a result, air conditioning is not needed the vast majority of the year.”\n\nAlthough areas closer to the coast are still getting warmer, the cool Pacific waters have helped dull the heat spikes experienced in places further inland. In downtown Los Angeles, the average high temperature has risen over the past 30 years by 0.7 degrees. Over that same time period, the average high in San Antonio has risen by 2.8 degrees, according to NOAA.\n\n“It is warmer here than the first half of the 20th century, but we still have the cool Pacific Ocean to help,” Littrell said.\n\nExtreme heat is already one of the deadliest weather phenomena, and scientists say heat is becoming more extreme and more frequent because of the planet-warming emissions from burning fossil fuels.\n\nScientists predict 50-year heat waves — those that are so extreme they would normally only be seen once every 50 years — will become much more frequent as the planet warms. The planet is already 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times; at 4 degrees, the chance of a 50-year extreme-heat event will increase to nearly 80% each year.", "authors": ["Christopher Hickey"], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/19/world/heat-emergency-uk-us-climate/index.html", "title": "UK heat wave: Extreme heat is exposing a country woefully ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nHeat waves across multiple continents have dashed records, threatened public health and buckled infrastructure, in what scientists say are signs of the climate crisis’ impact on day-to-day weather.\n\nAmericans are used to switching on their air conditioners any time temperatures near 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius).

On Tuesday, an area of low pressure was moving in off the coast, acting to help funnel the extreme heat northward into the UK.\n\nIn the US, a strong dome of high pressure has set up over the Southern Plains and Mississippi Valley. Instead of heat being funneled in from the south, it is building unabated as the sun bakes down through cloudless skies.\n\nThe connecting tissue between these heat waves is the influence of greenhouse gas emissions and the planet’s ever-warming baseline temperature.\n\nThe UK Met Office’s chief scientist, Stephen Belcher, was in a state of disbelief as he delivered a video statement about the shocking temperatures the country experienced Tuesday, noting they would have been “virtually impossible” the UK in an “undisrupted climate.”\n\n“But climate change driven by greenhouse gases have made these temperatures possible, and we’re actually seeing that possibility now,” he said, adding that if the world keeps emitting greenhouse gases at the level it is now, such heat waves are likely to occur there every three years.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter shares 5 tips to stay cool in extreme temperatures 01:30 - Source: CNN\n\nForty degrees Celsius mat not be that hot to someone sitting in the Central US, Australia, the Middle East or in northern India.

It struggles to manage floods when they occur. In the heat, the nation buckles.\n\nSo many fires ignited in London on Tuesday that the city’s fire brigade declare a “major incident” and were stretched beyond their capacity. Four people have drowned as people flocked to beaches, rivers and lakes just to try to get cool. Even a runway at an airport on London’s outskirts had to be closed off as it melted in the heat.\n\nIn southern Europe, a region more accustomed to extreme heat, at least 1,100 people have died in the latest heat wave, and French firefighters are overwhelmed with blazes tearing through forests. Twenty-one European nations are under heat-related warnings.\n\nAmericans may be more used to the heat, but heat waves are getting longer and more frequent there too, which means more time indoors, or wherever the air conditioning may be. No fewer than 100 million Americans – almost a third of the nation – were under heat alerts on Tuesday.\n\nThe alerts run from the southern Plains into the Mississippi and Tennessee River Valleys, and there are scattered alerts through the Southwest. The Northeast has already issued heat advisories for heat “feeling like” 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 Celsius) for Wednesday.\n\nThe most dangerous heat is forecast around parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas where excessive heat warnings are in place for Dallas, Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Little Rock. Temperatures there are expected to soar to 100 to 110 degrees Farhenheit (as high as 43 degrees Celsius) over the next few days.\n\nScientists who work on just how much of a role the climate crisis is playing in extreme weather now say that just about every heat wave in the world is influenced by humans burning fossil fuels.\n\nFriederike Otto from the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London said that it was up to the world to reach net zero – where humans emit as little greenhouse gas as possible and “offsets” the rest – to stop heat waves from becoming even worse, “deadly and disruptive.”\n\n“We have the agency to make us less vulnerable and redesign our cities, homes, schools and hospitals and educate us on how to keep safe,” Otto told CNN. “40 degrees Celsius in the UK is not an act of god, but to a large degree due to our past and present burning of fossil fuels.”\n\nIn China, the annual “sanfu” – which is usually three lots of 10 days in July and August when temperatures and humidity peak – is now forecast to run for an “extended period” of 40 days, the state weather forecaster said, according to Reuters.\n\nIt warned of scorching heat waves this week, despite seasonal rain, with temperatures likely climb as high as 42 degrees Celsius (107.6 Fahrenheit) in the south from Wednesday.\n\nIn central London on Tuesday, a student named Asser who braved the heat told CNN that world wasn’t doing enough to battle the heat waves.\n\n“In fact, the world is doing nothing. The world is burning and we are doing nothing about it.

Texas grid operator ERCOT projects it could approach that peak again on Tuesday.\n\nBut unlike previous extreme weather events in Texas which led to deadly blackouts, the grid is holding up remarkably well this week. Several experts told CNN that it’s owed in large part to strong performances from wind and solar, which generated 27 gigawatts of electricity during Sunday’s peak demand – close to 40% of the total needed.\n\n“Texas is, by rhetoric, anti-renewables. But frankly, renewables are bailing us out,” said Michael Webber, an energy expert and professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “They’re rocking. That really spares us a lot of heartache and a lot of money.”\n\nDespite the Texas Republican rhetoric that wind and solar are unreliable, Texas has a massive and growing fleet of renewables. Zero-carbon electricity sources (wind, solar, and nuclear) powered about 38% of the state’s power in 2021, rivaling natural gas at 42%.\n\nThis is a relatively recent phenomenon for the state.\n\n“Wind and solar would not have been available in years in the past, so the growing capacity helps to alleviate reliance on natural gas and coal,” said Jonathan DeVilbiss, operations research analyst at the US Energy Information Administration.\n\nNot only have renewables helped keep the power on during a scorching and early heatwave, they have also helped keep costs low. Prices for natural gas and coal are high amid a worldwide energy crunch, but renewables – powered by the wind and sun – have no fuel cost.\n\n“Because the price of wind and sunlight hasn’t doubled in the past year like other resources, they are acting as a hedge against high fuel prices,” said Joshua Rhodes, an energy researcher at UT Austin.\n\nPeak demand during peak heat\n\nTexas and other states have been sweltering in triple-digit temperatures and dangerous heat indices. Texas state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon told CNN that San Antonio has been a particular hot spot; it recently hit 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit, setting a new pre-July record.\n\nTexas is used to heat, but this year they’re “getting August weather in May and June,” Webber told CNN.\n\nExperts said the Texas grid was built to withstand extreme heat moreso than the extreme cold brought by the deadly 2021 winter storm. But with the state now experiencing August-like temperatures in early June many questioned whether the Texas grid could withstand the longer, hotter summers fueled by climate change.\n\n“As opposed to a winter storm, we were built for three months of 90-plus [degrees],” said Caitlin Smith, head of regulatory policy and communications at Texas-based battery storage company Jupiter Power. “Were we built for 4 months of 100-plus [degrees]? There’s some uncertainty there.”\n\nIf the early spikes in temperature persist this year, it could stress out the grid and power plants, Smith and Rhodes warned. As well as the grid is working right now, that could change if this summer continues to bring unrelenting heat.\n\n“It’s like the human body; heat stress is cumulative,” Rhodes said. “The body has no time to recover. Power plants are like that as well, they need some time to recover.”\n\nRhodes added that renewables have been a big help during this early surge by taking strain off the traditional thermal power plants that use coal and natural gas to keep the lights on.\n\nHuman-caused climate change is linked to rising global temperatures and extreme heat. And while it’s too early to tell exactly how much climate change is to blame for the current heat wave, it’s safe to assume it is a factor, said Andy Dessler who directs the Texas Center for Climate Studies at Texas A&M University.\n\n“It’s 100% certain that climate change is contributing to this,” Dessler told CNN. “Everything’s getting hotter. August is getting hotter; June is getting hotter. It is hot and this is the future.”\n\nOvercrowded transmission lines\n\nEven though Texas is an oil and gas giant, renewables – and particularly, wind – have long been thriving there. Texas generates the most wind energy in the country: In 2020, it produced more wind electricity than Iowa, Kansas, and Oklahoma — the next three highest states — combined, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\n\nSolar has been a smaller portion of the state’s energy mix than wind, but it is growing as well. Solar generated about 4% of electricity in Texas last summer, and is expected to grow to 7.2% this summer, EIA projections show.\n\nBuilding out more solar will be important to deal with heat waves in the depths of summer, when wind speeds tend to drop, experts told CNN. That’s because if it’s really hot out, there’s a good chance the sun is beating down.\n\nBut Rhodes and Webber pointed to infrastructure issues limiting the potential of renewables; Texas needs more transmission lines to carry energy generated by renewables to customers. Rhodes pointed to ERCOT projects showing higher solar numbers than what was actually being used; a casualty of over-crowded power lines that can’t let the power through to consumers.\n\n“About half of the solar that could be produced is not being produced right now because there’s no more room on the lines,” Rhodes said. “The numbers for renewables would probably be higher if we had the transmission capacity to move them around.”\n\nWind and solar have natural variability as well; solar can’t generate energy during nighttime, and wind turbines don’t turn when the wind isn’t blowing. That is spurring a big focus on developing more massive batteries that can store and deploy renewable energy when the wind isn’t blowing, and the sun isn’t shining.\n\n“It does keep growth of renewables strong; it allows you to firm up that renewable capacity,” Smith said.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct Joshua Rhodes' name.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/06/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/15/weather/extreme-heat-wednesday-wildfires-power-outages/index.html", "title": "Extreme heat: More than a dozen cities set temperature records for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAt least 16 US cities set or tied records for their highest temperature for the date, with Macon, Georgia, hitting 103 degrees Fahrenheit on Wednesday, the National Weather Service reported.\n\nThat was 3 degrees higher than the previous June 15 mark in Macon, set in 2010.\n\nChicago’s O’Hare airport reported a record temperature of 96, which is 15 degrees above normal and well above the 77 degrees it was last year on that date.

Globally, 150 all-time heat records were broken, compared with just 18 cool records.\n\nGabriel Vecchi, a climate scientist and geosciences professor at Princeton University, told CNN that this is a signal of the climate crisis, and hot extremes outpacing cool extremes has been a notable trend in recent years.\n\n“This is what you would expect from a planetary warming that’s been driven in large part from greenhouse gases; this is now the world we’re living in,” Vecchi told CNN, noting that “it’s fair to think that almost every heatwave that we see right now has some influence from global warming.”\n\nGlobal scientists last year concluded that with every fraction of a degree of warming, the effects of the climate crisis worsen. The kinds of extreme weather the world has experienced last summer — from the wildfires in the US and Greece to the flooding in China and Germany — will only become more severe and more frequent.\n\nWhile extreme heat events would still occur without climate change, the increasing intensity and frequency of these events in recent decades has been linked to the rise of fossil fuel emissions and observed global warming.\n\nImagine a bell-shaped curve of temperatures, Vecchi said, with cold on the left and warm on the right. As climate change shifts this temperature curve to the warmer side, the long tails of the curve increase by a proportionately larger amount than the middle, signifying the increasing likelihood of hotter events to happen and making cold events less likely.\n\nParts of Europe will see this trend play out starting Sunday.\n\nForecasters in the UK are warning that temperatures could exceed 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) starting Sunday, and could approach the country’s all-time high of 38.7 degrees.\n\nMark McCarthy, head of the Met Office National Climate Information Centre, said climate change is exacerbating this weekend’s heat wave.\n\n“The highest temperatures experienced in the UK tend to occur when our weather is influenced by air masses from continental Europe or North Africa, as it will be at the weekend,” McCarthy said in a statement. “There is already a strongly-embedded warming due to climate change across the continent, that is increasing the likelihood of challenging the existing UK temperature record.”\n\nTemperatures in northern and central France could peak around 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday and Tuesday. Similar heat is expected in western Germany, where monthly or all-time records could fall.\n\nPeople eat ice cream outside the houses of Parliament in London on Wednesday. Alberto Pezzali/AP\n\nEuropean cities are largely underprepared for extreme heat, according to Vanesa Castan Broto, professor of climate urbanism at the University of Sheffield in the UK.\n\nDuring heat waves, cities — so-called urban heat islands — can be especially dangerous, since these are areas with a lot of asphalt, buildings and freeways that absorb the sun’s energy and then radiate more heat.\n\nThe phenomenon, called the urban heat island effect, amplifies a heat wave’s already punishing consequences — and it doesn’t fall equally across communities. Marginalized neighborhoods with fewer green spaces suffer disproportionately, while babies and older people become vulnerable.\n\n“We have to remember that when we have an impact of climate change in a city, those can have cascading effects,” Castan Broto told CNN. “It can compound other impacts,” including work productivity, food production, and even health services themselves.\n\n“I really hope that, at the very least, these impacts change the minds of people in cities to kind of try to create cities that are more adapted to more heat waves,” she added. “There are a lot of things we can do and they’re not being done right.”\n\nVecchi said the European heat wave is noteworthy, given its back-to-back nature, which will only continue as the planet warms and is all the more reason to prepare for a hotter future.\n\nWhile this year isn’t yet trending to be the hottest on record, despite the South Asian heat wave back in May and yet another heat dome in Europe, this year remains warmer than historical eras, which Vecchi said “is driven in large part due to the increase in greenhouse gases coming from fossil fuel burning.”\n\n“It’s been a year of warmth,” he said. “And these are the signatures of global warming.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/07/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/weather/us-extreme-heat-thursday/index.html", "title": "US heat wave: Dangerously high temperatures will last through the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMore than 85% of Americans are bracing for temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit through the weekend, with millions in the south-central US expected to experience readings in the triple digits.\n\nMore than 100 million people are under various heat alerts Thursday in more than two dozen states from parts of the American West to New England, a suffocating cocoon that experts believe will become increasingly common due to the effects of climate change.\n\n“Widespread high temperatures in the mid-to-upper 90s and low 100s will encompass a majority of the country on Thursday and Friday,” the National Weather Service warned Wednesday.\n\nThe areas at the highest risk for the dangerously hot temperatures span the Southwest, central and south-central US along with the coastal mid-Atlantic region and the Northeast, the weather service noted.\n\nDallas County, Texas, reported its first heat-related death of the year – a 66-year-old woman – according to a Thursday news release from Dallas County Health and Human Services. The agency is not identifying the woman, but did say she had underlying health conditions.\n\nThe distressing heat wave – which has exacerbated a flash drought in the southern and central Plains – has pushed state and local leaders to issue heat emergencies and offer resources to residents to mitigate the high temperatures.\n\nThe mayor of Washington, DC, on Thursday announced a heat emergency – triggered when the district sees a temperature of 95 degrees or higher – that will last until Monday morning.\n\n“Stay hydrated, limit sun exposure, and check on seniors, neighbors & pets,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said on Twitter.\n\nPhiladelphia declared a heat health emergency for Thursday due to the expected oppressive heat, activating emergency programs likes special field teams that conduct home visits and outreach for people experiencing homelessness, the department of health said in a news release.\n\nSimilarly in New York, residents are encouraged to stay indoors in the upcoming days as the heat continues to sweep across the state to avoid “dangerous conditions that can lead to heat stress and illness,” according to Jackie Bray, the commissioner of the state’s homeland security and emergency services division.\n\nTemperatures over 90 degrees are expected to remain in New York City, Philadelphia and Boston through the weekend – if not longer.\n\nThe excessive heat across the US has been matched by deadly conditions in Europe, where records have been smashed and the European Forest Fire Information System put 19 European countries on “extreme danger” alerts for wildfires.\n\nA construction worker drinks water in temperatures that have reached well above triple digits in Palm Springs, California, on Wednesday. David Swanson/Reuters\n\nHeat index values indicate danger\n\nMeanwhile, triple-digit heat will continue to bake parts of California, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Tennessee on Thursday – meaning 1 in 5 Americans will endure dangerous conditions after what has already been a historic week in terms of topping heat records, said CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford.\n\nThe heat is expected to persist through the weekend in many places, and more than 85% of the population – or 275 million Americans – could see high temperatures above 90 degrees over the next week. More than 60 million people could see high temperatures at or above 100 degrees over the next seven days.\n\nHeat index values – the temperature it feels like when heat is combined with humidity – could top 100 degrees in a number of states through this weekend, particularly in the Midwest, the Southeast and on the East Coast.\n\nLarge swaths of the South – including parts of eastern Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi and Alabama – and the central East Coast from South Carolina to New Jersey will see some of the most pronounced danger (seen in these maps in dark orange) from the heat on Thursday.\n\nCNN CNN CNN CNN CNN Heat index forecasts indicate danger for large parts of US Prev Next\n\nThat danger becomes more apparent in parts of the Midwest this weekend, in parts of southern Illinois, Missouri and Iowa, before shifting back to the East Coast on Sunday.\n\nForecast heat index values indicate much of the rest of the US should exercise extreme caution.\n\nTriple-digit heat records across multiple states\n\nWhile much of the western US has been gripped by an extended, unrelenting drought, the recent heat and lack of adequate rain has catalyzed a “flash drought” in other parts of the country.\n\nThe US Drought Monitor last week announced states including Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri and Massachusetts were experiencing a flash drought, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration defines as the “rapid onset or intensification of drought.”\n\nIt grew even worse this week in the central and southern Plains, the Drought Monitor said in its weekly update Thursday: More than 84% of Texas is in severe or worse drought conditions, the highest percentage in over a decade, while the area of Oklahoma experiencing drought doubled in size.\n\nArkansas went from less than 1% of the state seeing severe drought to more than a quarter of the state. Missouri similarly went from 2% to a third of the state experiencing severe drought.\n\nMeanwhile, triple-digit records were set Tuesday and Wednesday in multiple locations across Texas, Arkansas and Oklahoma, where Tulsa EMS reported responding to nearly 250 heat-related emergency calls so far this year.\n\n“Those numbers are what we would expect to see in mid- to late-August,” Adam Paluka, spokesperson for the Emergency Medical Services Authority, said Wednesday. “So we’re four to six weeks ahead of where we would normally see those mid-200 call numbers.”\n\n“It’s very concerning,” he added, “especially because the amount of patients that are being transported indicates that some of those calls are heatstroke, which can be deadly.”\n\nIn Abilene, Texas, temperatures on Wednesday reached 110 degrees, breaking a 1936 record on that date. Another record of 104 degrees was set in San Antonio, Texas, surpassing the 101 degrees last experienced in 1996.\n\nAnd as of Tuesday, the Austin area reached at least 100 degrees on 38 out of the last 44 days, according to the weather service.\n\n“We’re asking people to conserve power so that the systems continue to operate,” Austin Mayor Steve Adler said Wednesday. “We’re asking everybody to do that so that we can get through this together.”\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates about 90% of Texas’ power grid, said it set another record Wednesday for power demand – surpassing a record set a day prior.\n\nAlso, Wednesday, a record high of 103 degrees in Fayetteville, Arkansas, topped the 102 degrees seen on that date in 2012.\n\nAnother Arkansas city, Mountain Home, saw 107 degrees Wednesday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n“This would shatter the old record high of 102 degrees for this date set back in 2012. Official record reports are not sent out until midnight but it sure looks like a new record high,” the weather service wrote Wednesday evening.\n\nSeveral US communities set or tied new daily records for high low temperatures this week, according to the National Weather Service. In Needles, California, the low temperature never got below 95 degrees Wednesday, tying a record set in 1901.\n\nIn Texas, the low temperature was 86 degrees Tuesday in Galveston, and Wichita Falls never got below 84 degrees on the same day. Elsewhere in the state, Houston and Laredo both had low temperatures of 81 degrees Wednesday. All of these were new daily records.\n\nIn Arkansas, the cities of Little Rock and Pine Bluff set low temperature records at 82 degrees Wednesday.\n\nExtreme heat causes businesses to alter operations\n\nThe extreme heat is causing Texas farmers to sell off their cattle at a rate not seen in more than a decade, according to a livestock economist.\n\n“A lot of ranchers rely on ponds and tanks that capture rainfall,” said David Anderson with Texas A&M University. “I’ve heard a lot of stories about ranchers running out of water.”\n\nThe weather conditions also are causing grass to die off, severely thinning the pastures where cattle graze. That leaves many ranchers no choice but to send cattle they can’t feed to slaughter, which has a ripple effect on the beef supply in future years.\n\nIt’s so hot in Oklahoma that the Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden postponed a Thursday event “due to extreme temperatures,” the zoo posted on its Facebook page.\n\nThe zoo’s after hours Sip and Stroll event would not have a significant impact on the animals, but the zoo postponed the event to protect guests and team members from the extreme temperatures, zoo spokesperson Candice Rennels told CNN.\n\nConfronting the heat\n\nTo help residents brace through the heat, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu announced that at least 12 community centers will open to anyone who wants to cool off. Additionally, more than 50 splash pads will be available at city parks and playgrounds, she said, as she declared a heat emergency through Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, some local officials have taken the step to hire chief heat officers to help navigate the response to the extreme heat.\n\nJane Gilbert, chief heat officer for Miami-Dade County, told CNN’s Don Lemon on Tuesday that Miami now has nearly double the days with a heat index – what the air feels like – over 90 degrees than it did in the 1970s.\n\n“That is not only concerning to people’s health but their pocketbooks. Our outdoor workers can’t work as long, they lose work time. People can’t afford this AC, the higher electricity cost. It’s both a health and an economic crisis.”\n\nDavid Hondula, director of the Office of Heat Response and Mitigation for Phoenix, echoed that sentiment, saying, “The heat can affect everyone, we’re all at risk.”\n\nHigh temperatures are one of the top weather-related causes of death in the US, according to Kimberly McMahon, public weather services program manager with the National Weather Service.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi Dakin Andone Amir Vera", "Aya Elamroussi", "Dakin Andone", "Amir Vera"], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/08/18/hottest-temperature-ever-recorded/10339971002/", "title": "What is the hottest temperature ever recorded?

Despite the planet’s consistent warming due to climate change, and the steady increase in the year’s highest temperatures, Earth has been this hot before.\n\nHere’s a guide to the hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth, which country it’s in, and at what point heat becomes unlivable for humans.\n\nWhat is a heat wave?:Here's what it is, how it affects your body and how to stay safe.\n\nScientists predict more heat waves:Florida, Texas, Central US could see biggest increase in hot days, new modeling shows\n\nWhat is the hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth?\n\nThe highest temperature on record belongs to California’s Death Valley which, in 1913, reached a temperature of 134 degrees Fahrenheit, or 56.7 degrees Celsius, Al Jazeera reports.\n\nBy region, the hottest temperatures ever recorded are:\n\nAfrica: 131 F (Tunisia, 1931)\n\nAsia: 129 F (Iran 2017)\n\nEurope: 119.8 F (Italy 2021)\n\nAntarctica 69.3 F (Seymour Island 2020)\n\nExtreme heat waves may be our new normal:Is the globe prepared?\n\nDo humans live in Death Valley?\n\nYes, people live in Death Valley. According to the 2020 Census, that population number is around 856.\n\nWhat is the hottest temperature a human can survive?\n\nIt really depends on the conditions. It is easier for humans to survive dry heat than extreme humidity, as excessive moisture in the air slows the natural cooling process of the body by slowing the evaporation process of sweat.\n\nUCLA climate researcher Chad Thackeray told USA Today in an email that it is generally thought that exposure to wet bulb temperatures of 95F or greater for at least 6 hours is the threshold for human survival. Wet bulb temperature refers to the metric used to express the combined impacts of extreme temperature and humidity.\n\nFind the hottest temperature by state:Hottest temperatures ever in all 50 states (plus D.C.)\n\nWhat is the coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth?\n\nThe coldest temperature ever recorded is -128.6°F, in Vostok Station, Antarctica in 1983.\n\nOne colder temperature exists, however. In 2010 a temperature of -135.8F was recorded in East Antarctica via NASA satellite. This recording does not get to wear the \"coldest ever\" crown though, as it was not measured with a thermometer.\n\nHas the Earth ever been hotter than it is now?\n\nYes, technically. Our planet is many billions of years old, and during its earliest days Earth was molten, meaning its surface temperatures could have exceeded 3,600° F.\n\nIn the period since humans have inhabited the planet and begun recording temperatures, recent years are certainly proving to be hotter, scientists believe from the warming of our climate due to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn fact, in 2021, a report released by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change reported that the planet’s global surface temperature has increased by approximately 1.9F compared to the average from 1850 –1900. This phenomenon has not been seen since prior to the last ice age, 125,000 years ago.\n\nIs your climate change news accurate?:Fact check: Study misrepresented to wrongly claim global warming has slowed\n\nWhat are the top 5 hottest years on record?\n\nGiven the climate’s unequivocal warming trend, the top five hottest years on record have all occurred since 2015.

The Jack-o-lantern image for Halloween and a snow globe for Christmas shows how much fun the LED orb will bring to the city.\n\nHere’s what to know about the sphere before it becomes a city staple like Bellagio’s water fountains and Paris Paris’ half-scale replica of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nWhat will the MSG Sphere be used for?\n\nThe eye-catching venue will host live music, film and sporting events including boxing and mixed martial arts.\n\nConcert goers will be able to see their artists perform live alongside the appeal of being surrounded by a 16K LED screen displaying augmented animations and also serve as a 360 JumboTron showing close-ups of performers.\n\nRich Claffey, the Sphere operations officer, compared the experience to watching a movie on IMAX, according to CNN.\n\n“The screen goes from ground to 250 feet high, all the way around,” Claffey said. “It keeps you fully immersed when you’re sitting in that bowl. I used to love IMAX in New York City, but this will blow that away.”\n\nAside from being a visual wonder, producers promise next-level audio for guests as the Sphere has over 160,000 speakers spread around the bowl.

Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi, UAE CNN —\n\nElectronic music, strobe lights, glittered faces and hundreds of thousands of people in mixed-gender gyrations are all part of a new kind of ritual in Saudi Arabia that didn’t exist just three years ago.\n\nThe kingdom’s Soundstorm music festival, which began in 2019, is back again for its fourth year and will start on Thursday.\n\nIn just five years since Saudi Arabia lifted its ban on musical events, the kingdom’s concert scene has arguably outshined even that of Dubai, long seen as the Gulf region’s premier entertainment hub.\n\nThe country that has been better known as the birthplace of Islam than a rave capital has gone through a tremendous makeover since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (known as MBS) took control of the everyday running of the kingdom in 2017. Soundstorm is an eye-catching symbol of that change.\n\nFor three days every winter, hundreds of thousands of people from across Saudi Arabia and the region descend on a desert site outside the capital Riyadh to listen to some of the top Western and Arab acts .\n\nThe rave is a manifestation of the ethos behind Saudi Arabia’s socioeconomic transformation, according to Anna Jacobs, a senior analyst at the Crisis Group think tank. “(It) is a particularly powerful example because it seeks to bring together young people and women from across Saudi Arabia and the world,” she said.\n\nDavid Guetta, Post Malone and Bruno Mars are just a few of the stars performing at this year’s event, which prides itself as being “the loudest festival in the region,” aiming to “amplify the unseen” as it supports local and international music in the Middle East. Tickets cost between 149 riyals (around $40) for a single day and 6,699 riyals (around $1,800 ) for a three-day VIP treatment.\n\nThe festival reportedly welcomed 730,000 partygoers last year. By contrast, Las Vegas’ Electric Daisy Carnival, considered North America’s biggest dance music festival, had an attendance of over 400,000 this year.\n\nAn event like Soundstorm was inconceivable in the country just six years ago, when the notorious religious police would roam the streets and censure Saudis for mixing with the opposite sex or flouting social norms. But it is now part of a liberalization initiative spearheaded by MBS, the kingdom’s de facto ruler. It accompanies a series of steps to relax social rules, including lifting the ban on women’s driving and reining in the religious police.\n\nIn 2016, Saudi Arabia established the General Entertainment Authority in tandem with Vision 2030 – the crown prince’s plan to diversify its economy beyond oil, which accounts for more than half of the government’s revenue. Among its goals was to almost double household spending on cultural and entertainment activities within the kingdom. Riyadh is now seeing more than $64 billion in entertainment investment, reported Arab News, with a significant proportion of that going to the live music industry.\n\nVision 2030 prides itself on offering “world-class entertainment” and says that it has organized up to 3,800 entertainment events in the country, attended by more than 80 million people.\n\n“The whole principle about allowing festivals is to provide youth with domestic entertainment and local tourism opportunities so they don’t need to travel abroad in search of fun,” said Ali Shihabi, a Saudi author and analyst.\n\nSome conservatives may find the festival unacceptable, Shihabi said, but given that youth make up the majority of the country’s population, they remain the primary beneficiaries.\n\nAround two-thirds of Saudi Arabia’s population is 34 years old or younger, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics. Analysts say it’s the youth that MBS needs to placate, not the conservatives.\n\nAlcohol continues to be banned in the kingdom, as are sexual relations between men, and unmarried couples.\n\nThe festival is not, however, without international criticism and accusations of whitewashing the kingdom’s human rights record. Last year, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said that performers should either “speak up” about Saudi Arabia’s human rights violations or not attend the festival at all.\n\n“Saudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars hosting massive entertainment and cultural events in a deliberate (attempt) to whitewash the country’s abysmal human rights record and the Soundstorm music festival is no different,” Joey Shea, a researcher at HRW told CNN. “The creation of the country’s local entertainment industry was accompanied by waves of arbitrary arrests of dissidents, activists, human rights defenders and ordinary Saudi citizens.”\n\nShihabi rejects the argument that the festival whitewashes the country’s rights record, saying that it “has little to do with any global image and is purely focused on servicing local needs.”\n\nMdlbeast, the organizers of Soundstorm, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nSome however argue that opening up countries to international norms and values can allow for better discussion on human rights shortcomings.\n\n“I think there is a way for these major international events – whether that be the World Cup in Qatar or music festivals in Saudi Arabia – to help open public discourse to critical debate,” said Jacobs.\n\n“They can help cultivate healthy criticism and discussion around human rights issues in the region,” she added, “and as the Gulf continues to solidify its position as the region’s center of gravity, I think this is what we will see.”\n\nIran protests\n\nThe families of Iran’s World Cup football team had been threatened with imprisonment and torture if the players failed to “behave” ahead of the match against the United States on Tuesday, a source involved in the security of the games said.\n\nFollowing the refusal of Iranian players to sing the nation’s national anthem in their opening match against England on November 21, the source said that the players were called to a meeting with members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nThe source said that they were told that their families would face “violence and torture” if they did not sing the national anthem or if they joined any political protest against the Tehran regime.\n\nHere’s the latest:\n\nThe Norway-based Iran Human Rights organization said on Tuesday that at least 448 people have been killed in the unrest surrounding the protests. CNN cannot independently verify the death toll.\n\nMembers of the activist art group Pussy Riot wore shirts in support of Iranian protesters at Tuesday’s World Cup game between Iran and the United States in Doha.\n\nTwo Iranian footballers were freed from detention on Tuesday, according to reports. Voria Ghafouri, who was facing charges of incitement against the regime, was released on bail, reported Iranian judiciary news site Mizan News. And a former member of Iran’s national team, Parviz Boroumand, who was arrested during protests in Tehran, was also released, according to state news agency IRNA.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna announced Monday that a third tranche of European Union sanctions against Iran is “being prepared” over the ongoing repression of protests.\n\nThe digest\n\nQatar to send 2 million tons of LNG to Germany in new energy deal\n\nQatarEnergy signed a deal on Tuesday that will allow Germany to receive flows of Qatari liquefied natural gas (LNG) over a period of at least 15 years, Qatar’s state news agency QNA said. The deal is the first of its kind to Europe from the expansion project of Qatar’s North Field, the world’s biggest gas field, and is meant to make up for some of the shortage triggered by Russian supply cuts.\n\nBackground: Until the Ukraine war, Germany was heavily reliant on Russian gas. Talks with Qatar have been in the works for months, as Germany and other European countries try to find alternative energy sources as the market tightens following sanctions on Russian supplies. The contract provides Germany with two million tons of LNG annually and the first shipment is due in 2026.\n\nWhy it matters: Tensions were high this month as Germany ramped up its criticism of Qatar ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, questioning its human rights record and later opposing the Gulf country’s ban on the rainbow-colored armband. Europe’s biggest economy has been running short on natural gas, with German economy minister Robert Habeck previously saying that rationing could not be ruled out ahead of the coming winter.\n\nUS State Department approves potential anti-drone system sale to Qatar for $1 billion\n\nThe US State Department has approved the potential sale of an anti-drone system to Qatar in a deal valued at $1 billion, Reuters cited the Pentagon as saying on Tuesday. The principal contractors will be Raytheon Technologies and Northrop Grumman Corp, the Pentagon said.\n\nBackground: The potential sale approval comes after US President Joe Biden earlier this year designated Qatar as a major non-NATO ally of the US, granting special status to a key friend in a turbulent region. Separately, Qatar has also played a role in the Iran nuclear talks and in relations with Afghanistan, where Washington’s interests were represented by the small Gulf country.\n\nWhy it matters: The approval comes as the use of drones rises in Middle East warfare. In 2019, a drone attack blamed on Iran knocked off half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production. Iran, which has friendly relations with Doha, has also been accused by the US of supplying Russia with drones in its war with Ukraine. The Pentagon said the proposed sale will improve Qatar’s capability to meet threats by providing electronic and kinetic defeat capabilities against drones.\n\nUS-backed Syrian Democratic Forces fear Turkish ground invasion could start in a week\n\nThe head of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) on Tuesday said a Turkish ground invasion could take place in a matter of days if Turkey does not see forceful opposition to a military incursion from countries such as the US and Russia.\n\nBackground: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has launched a recent series of airstrikes against Kurdish militants in northern Syria, and has warned that a ground operation will soon follow. The operation is meant to target Kurdish groups that Turkey believes were behind a deadly bomb attack in Istanbul earlier this month.\n\nWhy it matters: The SDF’s backbone is the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) militia, which Turkey considers a wing of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and seeks to eliminate. But the group has been instrumental in the fight against ISIS since 2014 and has warned that a Turkish assault will complicate the fight against the militants. It is unclear if the US will heed its calls to restrain Turkey. The US has reduced the number of patrols with SDF ahead of a possible incursion.\n\nWorld Cup\n\nQatar’s World Cup chief Hassan Al-Thawadi said that between 400 and 500 migrant workers have died as a result of work done on projects connected to the tournament – a greater figure than Qatari officials have cited previously.\n\nIn an interview with Piers Morgan which aired on TalkTV on Monday, Al-Thawadi was asked about the number of migrant workers fatalities due to construction for the World Cup and said: “The estimate is around 400, between 400 and 500.\n\n“I don’t have the exact number, that’s something that’s been discussed. One death is too many, it’s as simple as that.”\n\nIn November 2022, a government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on World Cup stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths.\n\nRead more:\n\nAround the region\n\nA rendition of the Rashid Rover provided by the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre. Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre\n\nOn Thursday, the UAE is set to become the first Arab country to launch a mission to the moon. The Rashid Rover will begin its trip from Cape Canaveral Space Station in Florida where it aims to land on the lunar surface in the coming months.\n\nBeginning construction in 2017, the solar-powered rover has been developed by Dubai’s Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC) and is named after the emirate’s late ruler Sheikh Rashid Al Saeed.\n\nThe rover will take a low-energy route and is expected to land on the lunar surface in March 2023. The vehicle will be delivered by the Japanese HAKUTO-R lander and will touch down on the Atlas crater.\n\nIt will spend one lunar day (equivalent to 14.75 days Earth time) where it will analyze the plasma of the moon’s surface and conduct experiments on lunar dust. It will then spend another lunar day in which it will attempt to survive the moon’s harsh environment, before decommissioning.\n\nThe launch aims to be the first step in the UAE’s greater space prospects. By 2117, the country aims to have a colony built on Mars’s surface. “We are starting small,” Hamad Al Marzooqi, project manager of the Emirates Lunar Mission at the MBRSC, told CNN. “But we hope that this small step will be eventually the starting point to reach our targets.”\n\nThe UAE launched a mission to Mars in February last year.\n\nBy Ollie Macnaughton\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Nadeen Ebrahim"], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/28/middleeast/world-cup-catalyst-for-change-qatar-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Will the changes brought by the World Cup to Qatar last? | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nDoha CNN —\n\nQatar is unrecognizable from the country it was 12 years ago when it won its bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Around $220 billion has been pumped into building an entirely new city, a state-of-the-art metro system and hundreds of new hotel and apartment buildings.\n\nLike previous countries to host major events, Qatar has been under the watchful eye of the international community. At the same time, its own people have been exposed to international ideals as well as shifting cultural and societal norms as they anticipated the influx of over a million football fans to their tiny country.\n\n“Qatar changed a lot in the past 12 years and, culturally speaking, this has made a huge impact,” 30-year-old Qatari football fan Ali Adnan Abel told CNN. “We have seen more diversity that has made Qataris realize it’s time to let the shields down.”\n\nIn hosting the World Cup, Qatar has been under intense pressure to enact legal changes. It dismantled the controversial Kafala system, a long-established regional labor practice that gives companies and the minority citizen population control over migrant workers’ employment, movement, and immigration status.\n\n“What we’ve seen in this case is, certainly there was no attention whatsoever internationally or even on a national level to the treatment of migrant workers in Qatar and that certainly did change after Qatar won the ability to host the World Cup,” James Lynch, director of the human rights group FairSquare and a former British diplomat in Doha, told CNN on Saturday.\n\nBut questions remain as to whether the reforms will stick once the tournament is over and the world’s gaze shifts away from the Gulf nation.\n\nThe Qatari organizers of the event insist those changes are here to stay.\n\n“All of this is actually part of the vision that we have for 2030 and it is one of the pillars of that vision,” Fatma Al Nuaimi, a spokesperson for the organizers, Qatar’s Supreme Committee, told CNN’s Becky Anderson, referring to the government’s blueprint for its future.\n\nQatar, a deeply conservative Muslim country, relaxed alcohol laws in the lead-up, allowing fans to drink in specific zones even though being drunk in public is illegal – although just two days before kick-off, FIFA announced that no alcohol would be sold at stadiums.\n\nThe tournament has also given the opportunity for men and women to mingle in an otherwise segregated country. Women and children have had a strong presence in fan zones and stadiums , watching the games in what has traditionally been a male-dominated sphere.\n\nHowever, history shows that it is uncommon for large sporting events like the World Cup or the Olympics to be long-term catalysts for societal change. Russia infamously hosted the World Cup in 2018 and sought to project an image of tolerance by allowing fans to carry rainbow flags despite a yearslong crackdown on the LGBTQ community.\n\nBut Russian President Vladimir Putin has since shunned liberalism, as tensions with the West spiraled, and after invading Ukraine earlier this year, Moscow came down hardon any subsequent anti-war protests. And just last week, the lower house of the country’s parliament passed an amendment to its “LGBT propaganda” law, banning all Russians from promoting or “praising” homosexual relationships or publicly suggesting that they are normal.\n\nOn the other hand, studies have shown that the international perception of Germany was enhanced after it hosted the 2006 World Cup, and much of the sporting infrastructure put in place is still in use.\n\n“For there to be a positive legacy, this change has to keep on going,” said Thomas Ross Griffin, an assistant professor of American and postcolonial literature at Qatar University. “And what the history of tournaments in London, Brazil, Russia told us, is that change often ends once the final whistle is blown. It’s on Qatar to demonstrate to the world that their change is something that would be kept going beyond the final game of the tournament.”\n\nWhile changes have been made to Qatar’s labor laws, human rights groups say more needs to be done. Just one month before the World Cup began, Amnesty International said the 2020 labor reforms had not been implemented or enforced properly. Qatar, it said, continues to lack freedom of expression and association and discriminates against women and LGBTQ people in law.\n\n“Now, the question is if [this reform] wasn’t implemented properly before the World Cup with the eyes of the world on Qatar, what are the prospects after the World Cup that’s the big concern,” Lynch said.\n\nWhile some have called for a boycott of Qatar for its treatment of LGBTQ people, others have argued that going to Doha and showing solidarity with the LGBTQ community there can affect lasting change. Spain’s openly gay sports minister, Miquel Iceta, said Thursday that hosting the World Cup will mean long-lasting improvement in Qatar’s human rights record by bolstering freedom and tolerance in the country.\n\nJakob Jensen, the Danish football association chief commended the changes that have taken place in Qatar since 2010 in an interview with CNN’s Becky Anderson Thursday. “We do not believe in boycotting. We do believe you make a difference participating, discussing, engaging and dialogue,” he said.\n\nOthers however see Qatar hosting the event as a slap in the face for human rights activists. At FIFA’s 72nd annual Congress in April, the Norwegian football association President Lise Klaveness delivered a stinging speech that labeled the decision to award Qatar the tournament as “unacceptable” and demanded that FIFA do more to defend its principles.\n\nIt will likely take months and even years before the true extent of the World Cup’s influence on the tiny Gulf state is known, says Lynch.\n\n“I think there will be an expectation that there will be comparable scrutiny for future major projects, and I think that’s a good thing,” he said. “Whether it leads to whole-scale reform, I think that’s a bigger question and I think we’ll have to wait to see.”\n\nIran protests\n\nFarideh Moradkhani, a niece of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, called on foreign governments to cut all ties with the Iranian government in a video statement shared on YouTube by her brother, Mahmoud Moradkhani, two days after she was arrested.\n\nFarideh, who is a well-known rights activist opposed to the Iranian regime, was arrested on Wednesday when she went to the prosecutor’s office to serve a court order, according to a tweet from her brother that day.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify when Farideh recorded the video statement shared by her brother on YouTube on Friday, and have reached out to Mahmoud for clarification.\n\nHere’s the latest:\n\nUNICEF on Sunday called for an end “to all forms of violence and abuse that have reportedly claimed the lives of over 50 children and injured many more” in Iran.\n\nIranian footballer Voria Ghafouri has been bailed out after being arrested on charges of “incitement against the regime,” Fars reported on Saturday.\n\nState-aligned Fars News was hacked on Friday, according to a message displayed on its website. The group, which identifies itself as “Black Reward,” posted a message in Farsi condemning the news organization and the government.\n\nUN Human Rights Council President Federico Villegas told CNN’s Becky Anderson on Friday that he is confident Iran will cooperate with a UN fact-finding mission into human rights abuses committed during the protests\n\nThe digest\n\nTurkish, Egyptian ministers to meet in process of building ties\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday that a process of building relations with Egypt will start with ministers of the two countries meeting, Reuters reported.\n\nBackground: Ankara’s ties with Cairo have been strained since Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, then the Egyptian army chief, led the 2013 ouster of Mohammed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood, who was strongly supported by Erdogan.\n\nWhy it matters: Turkey has been on a push to ease tensions with Egypt and several other countries in the region since last year. Erdogan shook hands with Sisi in Qatar last week in what was described by an Egyptian presidency statement as a new start in bilateral relations. In a televised discussion program on Saturday, Erdogan said that he and Sisi had spoken for around half an hour to 45 minutes on the sidelines of the World Cup in Qatar.\n\nArab Monetary Fund signs $1 billion pact to support Yemeni government reforms\n\nThe Arab Monetary Fund has signed a $1 billion agreement to support Yemen’s economic reform program to its Saudi-backed government, Saudi state media said on Sunday. The new package by the Abu Dhabi-based fund, which includes countries from the Middle East and North Africa, will provide support for the Yemeni government’s efforts to stabilize the economy from 2022 to 2025, Reuters reported, citing Saudi Ekhbaria TV.\n\nBackground: After the Houthi rebels stormed the capital Sanaa in 2014 and ousted the government, sending it into exile, Yemen’s central bank split into two branches – one in Sanaa, under Houthi control, and one internationally recognized branch in Aden, which has access to money printers. Aden’s branch is under the control of the Saudi-backed administration.\n\nWhy it matters: The war between the Houthi group and a Saudi-led coalition has brought Yemen’s economy to its knees and caused the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. Inflation and foreign currency shortages have made food, water and fuel unaffordable for many in Yemen, which imports most of its needs. The Yemeni riyal has reached all-time lows in provinces controlled by the Saudi-backed government.\n\nThis year has been the deadliest for Palestinians and Israelis since early 2000s\n\nThis year is already the deadliest in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in Israel and the West Bank since the early 2000s, a CNN analysis of official numbers from both Israel and the Palestinian Authority shows. The Israel number includes security forces and civilians killed in Palestinian attacks in Israel and the West Bank. Most were Israeli citizens, but the number includes foreigners living in Israel, according to the Israeli Security Agency, more commonly known as the Shin Bet. The Palestinian Ministry of Health told CNN that 150 Palestinians in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Israel have been killed this year, mostly by Israeli security forces – a number that includes militants and civilians.\n\nBackground: The death over the weekend of Tadasa Tashume Ben Ma’ada from wounds in last Wednesday’s double bombing in Jerusalem brings the number of people killed on the Israeli side to 31 this year, according to Israeli Security Agency (ISA) data and a CNN count.\n\nWhy it matters: The Israeli military is increasingly targeting new militant groups in Jenin and Nablus and claims most of the Palestinians killed were militants or engaging violently with their forces. Human rights groups say dozens of unarmed civilians have been killed as well.\n\nWorld Cup\n\nIranian state media has called for the US to be kicked out of the World Cup after the United States Soccer Federation changed Iran’s flag on its social media platforms to show support for protesters in Iran.\n\nThe federation had temporarily displayed Iran’s national flag on its official Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts without the emblem of the Islamic Republic. A now-deleted graphic of the Group B standings posted on Saturday displayed the Iranian flag only bearing its green, white and red colors.\n\nUS Soccer told CNN on Sunday that it wanted to change the official flag for 24 hours to show “support for the women in Iran fighting for basic human rights” but always planned to go back to the original flag.\n\nRead more:\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Eoin Mcsweeney Mohammed Abdelbary", "Eoin Mcsweeney", "Mohammed Abdelbary"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/08/world/repeating-fast-radio-burst-detection-scn/index.html", "title": "New unusual repeating fast radio burst detected 3 billion light-years ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nAstronomers have detected a mysterious, repeating fast radio burst emanating from a dwarf galaxy located 3 billion light-years away.\n\nThe cosmic object is distinctive when compared with other detections of radio bursts in recent years, according to new research.\n\nFast radio bursts, or FRBs, are millisecond-long bursts of radio waves in space. Individual radio bursts emit once and don’t repeat. But repeating fast radio bursts are known to send out short, energetic radio waves multiple times.\n\nAstronomers have been able to trace some radio bursts back to their home galaxies, but they have yet to determine the actual cause of the pulses. Learning more about the origin of these bright, intense radio emissions could help scientists understand what causes them.\n\nThis image, captured by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, shows the object FRB 190520 when it's active (in red). Niu, et al/Bill Saxton/NRAO/AUI/NSF/CFHT\n\nAstronomers detected the object, named FRB 190520, when it released a burst of radio waves on May 20, 2019. The researchers used the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, or FAST, in China, and discovered the burst in the telescope data in November 2019. When they conducted follow-up observations, the astronomers noticed something unusual – the object was releasing frequent, repeating bursts of radio waves.\n\nIn 2020, the team used the National Science Foundation’s Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, or VLA, of telescopes to pinpoint the origin of the burst before zeroing in on it using the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii. Subaru’s observations in visible light showed that the burst came from the outskirts of a distant dwarf galaxy.\n\nA study detailing the findings published in the journal Nature on Wednesday.\n\nTwo of a kind\n\nThe VLA observations also revealed that the celestial object constantly released weaker radio waves between the repeating bursts. That’s very similar to only one other known repeating fast radio burst: FRB 121102, discovered in 2016.\n\nThe initial detection and subsequent tracing of FRB 121102 back to its origin point in a small dwarf galaxy more than 3 billion light-years away was a breakthrough in astronomy. It was the first time astronomers were able to learn about the distance and environment of these mysterious objects.\n\n“Now we actually need to explain this double mystery and why FRBs and persistent radio sources are found together sometimes,” said study coauthor Casey Law, staff scientist in radio astronomy at the California Institute of Technology. “Is it common when FRBs are young? Or perhaps the object that makes the bursts is a massive black hole that is messily eating up a neighboring star? Theorists have a lot more detail to work with now and the scope for explanation is shrinking.”\n\nCurrently, less than 5% of the hundreds of identified fast radio bursts have been known to repeat and only a few of them are regularly active.\n\nBut FRB 190520 is the only persistently active one, meaning that it has never “turned off” since being discovered, said study author Di Li, chief scientist for the radio division of the National Astronomical Observatories of China and the FAST Operation Center. Meanwhile, FRB 121102, “the first known famous repeater, can turn off for months,” Li said.\n\nNew questions\n\nThe latest findings raise more questions because now astronomers wonder if there might be two kinds of fast radio bursts.\n\n“Are those that repeat different from those that don’t? What about the persistent radio emission – is that common?” said study coauthor Kshitij Aggarwal, who was involved in the study as a doctoral student at West Virginia University, in a statement.\n\nIt’s possible that there are different mechanisms that cause the radio bursts, or that whatever produces them is behaving differently during various stages of evolution.\n\nPreviously, scientists have hypothesized that fast radio bursts are caused by the dense remnants leftover after a supernova, called a neutron star, or neutron stars with incredibly strong magnetic fields called magnetars.\n\nThis is an artist's concept of a neutron star with an ultrastrong magnetic field, called a magnetar, emitting radio waves (in red). Bill Saxton, NRAO/AUI/NSF\n\nFRB 190520 is being considered as a possible “newborn” object because it was located in a dense environment, Law said. That environment may be caused by material released by a supernova, which resulted in the creation of a neutron star. As this material scatters over time, the bursts from FRB 190520 may decrease as it ages.\n\nGoing forward, Li wants to discover more fast radio bursts.\n\n“A coherent picture of the origin and evolution of FRBs is likely to emerge in just a few years,” Li said.\n\nLaw is excited about the implications of having a new class of radio wave sources.\n\n“For decades, astronomers thought there were basically two kinds of radio source that we could see in other galaxies: accreting supermassive black holes and star formation activity,” Law said. “Now we’re saying that it can’t be an either/or categorization any more! There is a new kid in town and we should consider that when studying populations of radio sources in the universe.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/02/03/st-vals-future-city-team-heads-national-contest/97450946/", "title": "St. Val's Future City team heads to national contest", "text": "Matt Jachman\n\nhometownlife.com\n\nThe year is 2224, and a population center on the Gulf of Riga has been revived thanks to the latest technology and engineering principles and a renewed emphasis on public spaces.\n\nThat's the scenario in Briviba, Latvia, a fictional city researched and designed by eighth-graders at St. Valentine School in Redford Township. Their project, including a scale model that represents a portion of the 25-square-mile Briviba, took first place in the Engineering Society of Detroit's Future City competition last month.\n\nThe win marks the first time since 2004 that St. Valentine has taken the top regional prize, and sends the team to the national competition in Washington, D.C., later this month. The class of just 11 eighth-graders will be competing against teams from 30 other states as well as from Egypt and China, said their teacher, Meghan Ciechanowski. (A GoFundMe page quickly raised more than enough money for the trip.)\n\nThe regional competition, featuring 30 teams, was Jan. 23 at the Suburban Collection Showplace in Novi. The theme for this year was the power of public spaces.\n\nEighth-grade presenters Frankie Nelson-Pawlik, Anna Damuth and Faith Emmerling said adrenaline kept them going through the competition day, during which they spent hours answering questions about Briviba for judges and showed off the city through a skit about an urban planning class at Briviba's Kopa University. There were 30 teams from schools around the region competing.\n\nAfter Briviba was named as one of five finalists, and presenters had to perform the skit again for judges, competing teams and visitors, the anticipation grew, the presenters said.\n\n\"All of us were nervous,\" said Rosanna.\n\n\"All of us were crying\" about the win, said Faith.\n\nWith the school's history of strong Future City teams, and veteran mentors John Danic, a retired Redford electrical inspector, and Dan Brooks, a civil engineer, helping out, the St. Valentine Class of 2017 was well prepared.\n\nJoe McComb, a St. Valentine student since kindergarten, said seeing what older students did with Future City projects had become commonplace for him.\n\nThen, it was their turn.\n\n\"It's really weird that I'm the one — we're the ones — building it,\" he said.\n\nBriviba, population 620,434, grew up next to Riga, Latvia, and marked a rebirth of the area, which had been nicknamed \"The Desert\" a couple of generations earlier.\n\nThe city harnesses the advantages of its location on the Baltic Sea: fishing is an industry there, and Aquatic Commerce, with parks, theaters, restaurants, shops and hotels, is the first large-scale underwater public space. Visitors to the high-strength spherical structure can look outside to see marine life in its natural habitat.\n\nLumino-City, with stores, restaurants, parks and places to sit and relax, is another major public space, and features a light show every night. And the Virtual Reality Museum provides a way for people to visit different periods in history.\n\nFruits and vegetables are grown in vertical terrace farms, which can simulate the environments needed to grow many kinds of crops, regardless of season. Aside from seafood, many proteins are imported.\n\nMost Briviba residents live in Solar Energy Apartments, which have recycling centers and waste chutes that send compostable materials to the terrace farms. Briviba has single-family homes as well.\n\nPublic transportation is provided by MAT, or Metro Aeronautical Transit, a trackless elevated system that uses electromagnetics to keep its cars aloft. There are also Spheros, private vehicles that run on hydrogen fuel cells but can also be pedaled, and Connects, travel pods that pick up passengers individually and connect to other pods on main roads.\n\nBriviba residents can work in the factories that make the Multi-pi, which is both a communications and personal health-monitoring device, or the EHI, or Electronic Health Information, a device to help medical professionals make diagnoses. They can also work in the public spaces, the terrace farms or at Kopa University.\n\nBriviba took the eighth-graders about four months of work, including on some Saturdays and during the Christmas break, staring with researching ideas for better cities and designing a virtual city using SimCity software.\n\nClass members divided into teams to work on different aspects of the city, including transportation, commerce, public spaces, public services and residential areas. Ideas from the teams were put together in a research paper that won this year's Best City Description prize.\n\nThe Briviba city model was built largely with cast-offs that might otherwise be thrown away, such as pieces of trophy pedestals, bottle caps, old computer parts and an old pipe. Lights at the top of each Solar Energy Apartment building came from a dollar store.\n\nThe eighth-graders also won a prize for quality improvement and another for best design, engineering and construction.\n\nNyla Flack said she and classmates had set a goal last year when, as seventh-graders, they studied what the class ahead of them did with its Future City project.\n\n\"We, last year, said that we'd win fist place this year. And we did,\" Nyla said.\n\n@mjachman@hometownlife.com\n\n734-678-8432\n\nTwitter: @mattjachman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/asia/china-taiwan-invasion-scenarios-analysis-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "title": "China has the power to take Taiwan, but it would cost an extremely ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nOn his first trip to Asia as United States President last week, Joe Biden gave his strongest warning yet to Beijing that Washington was committed to defending Taiwan militarily in the event of an attack from China.\n\nBiden’s comments, which compared a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, appeared to deviate from Washington’s decades-old policy of “strategic ambiguity” on the issue and seemingly raised the possibility of a military clash between US and Chinese forces.\n\nIt’s the third time Biden has made similar remarks since taking office and, just as on the other two occasions, they were quickly walked back by the White House – which insists its policy has not changed. However, it inevitably raises the question: if China tries to take Taiwan, are the United States and its allies able to stop it?\n\nAnd the alarming answer is: Quite possibly not. Analysts say China has more troops, more missiles and more ships than Taiwan or its possible supporters, like the US or Japan, could bring to a fight. That means that if China is absolutely determined to take the island it probably can.\n\nBut there’s a caveat; while China could likely prevail, any victory would come at an extremely bloody price for both Beijing and its adversaries.\n\nMany analysts say an invasion of Taiwan would be more dangerous and complex than the Allied D-Day landings in France in World War II. US government documents put the number of killed, injured and missing from both sides during the almost three-month-long Normandy campaign at almost half a million troops.\n\nAnd the civilian carnage could be far, far worse.\n\nTaiwan’s population of 24 million people is packed into dense urban areas like the capital Taipei, with an average of 9,575 people per square kilometer. Compare that to Mariupol, Ukraine – devastated in the war with Russia – and with an average of 2,690 people per square kilometer.\n\nDespite its numerical advantages in sea-, air- and land-based forces in the region, China has Achilles heels in each arena of war that would force Beijing to think long and hard about whether an invasion is worth the overwhelming human cost.\n\nHere are some scenarios of how a Chinese invasion might play out:\n\nThe naval war\n\nChina has the world’s largest navy, with around 360 combat vessels – bigger than the US’ fleet of just under 300 ships.\n\nBeijing also has the world’s most-advanced merchant fleet, a large coast guard and, experts say, a maritime militia – fishing boats unofficially aligned with the military – giving it access to hundreds of additional vessels that could be used to transport the hundreds of thousands of troops that analysts say China would need for an amphibious invasion.\n\nAnd those troops would need massive amounts of supplies.\n\n“For Beijing to have reasonable prospects of victory, the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) would have to move thousands of tanks, artillery guns, armored personnel vehicles, and rocket launchers across with the troops. Mountains of equipment and lakes of fuel would have to cross with them,” Ian Easton, a senior director at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote in The Diplomat last year.\n\nGetting a force of that size across the 110 miles (177 kilometers) of the Taiwan Strait would be a long, dangerous mission during which those vessels carrying the troops and equipment would be sitting ducks.\n\n“The thought about China invading Taiwan, that’s a massacre for the Chinese navy,” said Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\n\nThat’s because Taiwan has been stocking up on cheap and effective land-based anti-ship missiles, similar to the Neptunes Ukraine used to sink the Russian cruiser Moskva in the Black Sea in April.\n\n“Taiwan is mass-producing these things. And they’re small, it’s not like (China) can take them all out,” O’Brien said.\n\n“What’s cheap is a surface-to-ship missile, what’s expensive is a ship.”\n\nThe Chinese guided-missile destroyer Changsha returns to a port in Sanya City, China, in March 2017. Zeng Tao/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nStill, China could – given its numerical advantage – simply decide the losses were worth it, pointed out Thomas Shugart, a former US Navy submarine captain and now an analyst at the Center for a New American Security.\n\n“There’s gonna be hundreds if not thousands of (Chinese) vessels there to soak up those (Taiwanese) missiles,” Shugart said.\n\nMissiles aside, China would face massive logistical hurdles in landing enough soldiers. Conventional military wisdom holds that an attacking force should outnumber defenders 3 to 1.\n\n“With a potential defending force of 450,000 Taiwanese today … China would need over 1.2 million soldiers (out of a total active force of more than 2 million) that would have to be transported in many thousands of ships,” Howard Ullman, a former US Navy officer and professor at the US Naval War College, wrote in a February essay for the Atlantic Council.\n\nHe estimated such an operation would take weeks and that despite China’s maritime strength, it “simply lacks the military capability and capacity to launch a full-scale amphibious invasion of Taiwan for the foreseeable future.”\n\nAircraft carrier killers\n\nSome of the problems that would face China’s navy in Taiwan would also face any US naval force sent to defend the island.\n\nThe US Navy sees its aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships, bristling with F-35 and F/A-18 jets, as its spear in the Pacific and would have a numerical advantage in this area. The US has 11 carriers in total, compared to China’s two. However, only about half are combat ready at any one time and even these might be vulnerable.\n\nO’Brien and others point out that the People’s Liberation Army has more than 2,000 conventionally armed missiles, many of which it has developed with the US Navy’s prized aircraft carriers in mind.\n\nOf particular concern would be China’s DF-26 and DF-21D – touted by Beijing’s state-run Global Times tabloid in 2020 as “aircraft carrier killers” and the “world’s first ballistic missiles capable of targeting large and medium-sized vessels.”\n\nAs O’Brien puts it, “The US better be careful thinking about, in any kind of war environment, sending carrier battle groups close to China … If you’re fighting a state-to-state war, you’re going to stay far away from shore.”\n\nOthers are more confident in the US carriers.\n\nRear Adm. Jeffery Anderson, the commander of the US Navy’s Carrier Strike Group Three centered on the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, recently told CNN his ships are more than ready to deal with the kind of missiles that sank the Moskva.\n\n“One thing I do know about our US ships is they’re extremely survivable. Not only are they lethal, but they are extremely survivable,” he said.\n\nA Chinese air force fighter jet takes off during training exercises in 2017. Liu Chang/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nThe air war\n\nChina is likely to seek air superiority early into any conflict, analysts say, and may feel it has an advantage in the skies.\n\nFlight Global’s 2022 directory of the world’s air forces shows the PLA with almost 1,600 combat aircraft, compared to Taiwan’s fewer than 300. The directory shows the US with more than 2,700 combat aircraft, but those cover the world while China’s are all in the region.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Taiwan holds ceremony for advanced F-16V fighter jets 02:11 - Source: CNN\n\nIn the air war, China also will have learned from Russia’s failures in Ukraine – where Moscow took months assembling its ground forces yet failed to soften up the terrain for them with a bombing campaign – and is more likely to emulate the “shock and awe” bombardments that preceded the US’ invasions of Iraq.\n\n“I’m sure the PLA is learning from what they’re seeing,” Shugart said. “You can read open-source translations of their strategic documents. They learned very carefully from what we did in Desert Storm and Kosovo.”\n\nBut even in the air China would face significant difficulties.\n\nA guided-missile-armed J-20 stealth fighter jet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force performs at Airshow China 2018. Shu ying/Imagine China/Reuters\n\nRussia’s failure to quickly seize control of the skies in Ukraine initially dumbfounded many analysts. Some put the failure down to the cheap antiaircraft missiles Western militaries have supplied to Kyiv.\n\nTaiwan has deals with the United States to supply it with Stinger antiaircraft missiles and Patriot missile defense batteries. And it also has been investing heavily in its own missile production facilities over the past three years in a project, when completed this summer, will see its missile production capabilities triple, according to a Janes report in March.\n\nOn the other hand, China would have an advantage over the US due to its closeness to Taiwan.\n\nA recent war game run by the Center for a New American Security concluded that an aerial conflict between the US and China would likely end in stalemate.\n\nCommenting on the result to Air Force Magazine, Lt. Gen. S. Clinton Hinote, US Air Force deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration and requirements, said that while the US was used to dominating the skies some factors weren’t in its favor.\n\nChina had “invested in modern aircraft and weapons to fight us,” he noted, and US forces would also face the “tyranny of distance” – most of the US air power used in the war game operated out of the Philippines, about 500 miles (800 kilometers) away.\n\nThe war game simulated Chinese forces beginning their campaign by trying to take out the nearest US bases in places like Guam and Japan.\n\nHinote likened that move to Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, saying China would be motivated by “many of the same reasons.”\n\n“The attack is designed to give Chinese forces the time they need to invade and present the world with a fait accompli,” he told the magazine.\n\nChina has a growing arsenal of short-, medium- and intermediate range ballistic missiles that can reach these far-flung targets.\n\nAs of 2020, the PLA had at least 425 missile launchers capable of hitting those US bases, according to the China Power project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nA Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldier fires an anti-tank rocket during a live-fire military exercise in Wuzhong, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China in 2019. Reuters\n\nThe ground war\n\nEven in a scenario where China was willing to take these risks and managed to get a significant amount of troops ashore, its forces would then face another uphill battle.\n\nTaiwan has about 150,000 troops and 2.5 million reservists – and its entire national defense strategy is based on countering a Chinese invasion.\n\nLike their counterparts in Ukraine the Taiwanese would have the advantage of home turf, knowing the ground and being highly motivated to defend it.\n\nFirst, the PLA would need to find a decent landing spot – ideally close to both the mainland and a strategic city such as Taipei with nearby port and airport facilities. Experts have identified just 14 beaches that would fit the bill and Taiwan is well aware of which ones those are. Its engineers have spent decades digging tunnels and bunkers to protect them.\n\nTaiwan’s troops would also be relatively fresh compared to their Chinese counterparts, who would be drained from the journey over and would still need to push through the island’s western mud flats and mountains, with only narrow roads to assist them, toward Taipei.\n\nChinese troops could be dropped in from the air, but a lack of paratroopers in the PLA makes it unlikely.\n\nAnother problem for Chinese troops would be their lack of battlefield experience. The last time the PLA was in active combat was in 1979, when China fought a brief border war with Vietnam.\n\nSoldiers of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) fire a mortar during a live-fire military exercise in Anhui province, China May 22, 2021. cnsphoto/Reuters\n\nIn that effort, China “really got a bloody nose, it was not very successful operation,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\n“So China’s military today is not battle tested, and it could suffer great losses, if it indeed attacked Taiwan,” Glaser said.\n\nOthers pointed out that even battle-tested troops could struggle against a well-motivated defensive force – noting that the Russian military was bogged down in Ukraine despite its recent fighting experience in Syria and Georgia.\n\nStill, as with the other scenarios, it is not only Chinese forces that might be handicapped by a lack of experience. Taiwan’s troops have also not been tested, and depending on the scenario, there are holes in even the US’ experience. As Shugart put it: “There is not a single US naval officer who has sunk another ship in combat.”\n\nWhat are the chances China attacks?\n\nGlaser, the German Marshall Fund analyst, thinks a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is unlikely.\n\n“I think that the PLA lacks full confidence that it can seize and control Taiwan. The PLA itself talks about some of the deficiencies in its capability,” she said.\n\n“And obviously, the war in Ukraine highlights some of the challenges that China could face; it is certainly much harder to launch a war 100 miles across a body of water than it is across land borders, (such as those) between Russia and Ukraine,” she said.\n\nShe noted that the strong Ukrainian resistance may be giving Taiwan’s people reason to fight for their land.\n\n“Given how Ukraine has really demonstrated a very high morale and willingness to defend its freedoms … I think that this is likely to change the calculus of not only military leaders in China, but hopefully also of (Chinese leader) Xi Jinping personally,” she said.\n\nO’Brien, the University of St. Andrews professor, wrote in The Spectator this year that any war over Taiwan would lead to devastating losses on all sides, something that should make their leaders tread carefully before committing troops.\n\n“If the Ukrainian war teaches us anything, it is that war is almost always a rash choice. Don’t underestimate your opponent, and don’t assume your systems will all work that well.”\n\nA Chinese amy tank takes part in military drills in 2018. Mladen Antonov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAny other option?\n\nOf course, the PLA has options other than a full-blown invasion.\n\nThese include taking outlying Taiwanese islands or imposing a quarantine on the main island, Robert Blackwill and Philip Zelikow wrote last year in a report for the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Residents of Taipei on edge about China after Russia invades Ukraine 02:52 - Source: CNN\n\nPossible PLA targets could be Taiping Island, Taiwan’s most far-flung outpost in the South China Sea; the tiny Pratas Island, a small outpost 170 nautical miles (320 kilometers) southeast of Hong Kong; Kinmen and Matsu islands, tiny territories just a few miles off mainland China’s coast; or Penghu in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nWhile a PLA victory of any of the four is almost assured, it could come at the cost of galvanizing support for Taiwan in the rest of the world – much as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has united the West against it.\n\nBlackwill and Zelikow said the quarantine option might be more effective.\n\n“In a quarantine scenario, the Chinese government would effectively take control of the air and sea borders of Taiwan,” they wrote. “The Chinese government would run effectively a clearance operation offshore or in the air to screen incoming ships and aircraft. The screeners could then wave along what they regarded as innocent traffic.”\n\nAnything regarded as belligerent, such as US military aid for Taiwan, could be blocked or confiscated as a violation of Chinese sovereignty, they say. Meanwhile, China could allow the Taiwan government to function as normal except for foreign affairs.\n\nThis option would have an advantage in China’s eyes: the ball would be in the US’ court as to whether to use force to end the quarantine. Then it would be the US that would have to consider whether to risk a war that could cost countless lives.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon Ivan Watson", "Brad Lendon", "Ivan Watson"], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/12/22/vermont-mysterious-structures-monolith-earth-clock-tallest-filing-cabinet/4005197001/", "title": "Here's a list of Vermont's mysterious structures and sights", "text": "Have aliens touched down in Vermont?

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nNASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has captured the first clear evidence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of an exoplanet, a planet outside our solar system.\n\nThe exoplanet, WASP-39b, is a hot gas giant orbiting a sunlike star that is 700 light-years from Earth and part of a larger Webb investigation that includes two other transiting planets, according to NASA. Understanding the atmospheric makeup of planets like WASP-39b is critical for knowing their origins and how they evolved, the agency noted in a news release.\n\nThis illustration shows what exoplanet WASP-39 b could look like, based on current understanding of the planet. NASA, ESA, CSA, and J. Olmsted (STScI)\n\n“Carbon dioxide molecules are sensitive tracers of the story of planet formation,” said Mike Line, an associate professor in Arizona State University’s School of Earth and Space Exploration, in the news release. Line is a member of the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science team, which conducted the investigation.\n\nThe team made the carbon dioxide observation using the telescope’s Near-Infrared Spectrograph – one of Webb’s four scientific instruments – to observe WASP-39b’s atmosphere. Their research is part of the Early Release Science Program, an initiative designed to provide data from the telescope to the exoplanet research community as soon as possible, guiding further scientific study and discovery.\n\nThis latest finding has been accepted for publication in the journal Nature.\n\n“By measuring this carbon dioxide feature, we can determine how much solid versus how much gaseous material was used to form this gas giant planet,” Line added. “In the coming decade, JWST will make this measurement for a variety of planets, providing insight into the details of how planets form and the uniqueness of our own solar system.”\n\nA new era in exoplanet research\n\nThe highly sensitive Webb telescope launched on Christmas Day 2021 toward its current orbit 1.5 million kilometers (nearly 932,000 miles) from Earth. By observing the universe with longer wavelengths of light than other space telescopes use, Webb can study the beginning of time more closely, hunt for unobserved formations among the first galaxies, and peer inside dust clouds where stars and planetary systems are currently forming.\n\nIn the captured spectrum of the planet’s atmosphere, the researchers saw a small hill between 4.1 and 4.6 microns – a “clear signal of carbon dioxide,” said team leader Natalie Batalha, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California at Santa Cruz, in the release. (A micron is a unit of length equal to one millionth of a meter.)\n\n“Depending on the atmosphere’s composition, thickness, and cloudiness, it absorbs some colors of light more than others – making the planet appear larger,” said team member Munazza Alam, a postdoctoral fellow in the Earth & Planets Laboratory at the Carnegie Institution for Science. “We can analyze these miniscule differences in the size of the planet to reveal the atmosphere’s chemical makeup.”\n\nAccess to this part of the light spectrum – which the Webb telescope makes possible – is crucial for measuring abundances of gases such as methane and water, as well as carbon dioxide, which are thought to exist in many exoplanets, according to NASA. Because individual gases absorb different combinations of colors, researchers can examine “small differences in brightness of the transmitted light across a spectrum of wavelengths to determine exactly what an atmosphere is made of,” according to NASA.\n\nPreviously, NASA’s Hubble and Spitzer telescopes discovered water vapor, sodium and potassium in the planet’s atmosphere. “Previous observations of this planet with Hubble and Spitzer had given us tantalizing hints that carbon dioxide could be present,” Batalha said. “The data from JWST showed an unequivocal carbon dioxide feature that was so prominent it was practically shouting at us.”\n\n“As soon as the data appeared on my screen, the whopping carbon dioxide feature grabbed me,” said team member Zafar Rustamkulov, a graduate student of in the Morton K. Blaustein Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences at Johns Hopkins University, in a news release. “It was a special moment, crossing an important threshold in exoplanet sciences,” he added.\n\nDiscovered in 2011, WASP-39b’s mass is about the same as Saturn’s and roughly a fourth of Jupiter’s, while its diameter is 1.3 times greater than Jupiter’s. Since the exoplanet orbits very close to its star, it completes one circuit in slightly over four Earth days.", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/02/08/how-madison-square-garden-co-aiming-make-every-seat-best-house/318516002/", "title": "MSG Sphere wants to change the concert experience", "text": "NEW YORK – Sitting in the last row of New York's iconic Radio City Music Hall, a robotic voice speaks a sentence into the amphitheater.\n\n\"You are hearing my voice from a speaker that is located on the rear stage wall more than a football field away from your current location.\"\n\nThe voice is not blasted at a high volume even though it is coming from 100 meters (about 328 feet) away on a speaker array in the back left corner of the Radio City stage. Yet it sounds nearly as loud and clear as if this reporter was standing directly in front of it.\n\n\"Welcome to the future of audio technology,\" the voice whispers.\n\nThe technology is known as beamforming audio, which sends sound directly to a specific location instead of blasting it over speakers spread through a venue. Developed by a German company called Holoplot, the system is one of the centerpieces for the Madison Square Garden Co.'s new 18,000 seat MSG Sphere arena, which the company announced Thursday would open in Las Vegas in 2020.\n\nWith Sphere, which breaks ground later this year near the Sands' Venetian and Palazzo complex, the company is aiming to transform the way audiences experience concerts and events with features that include Internet at each seat, bass pumped through the floorboards and screens that stretch across the ceiling. Sphere is, in part, a result of the formation of MSG Ventures, a division of MSG created following the $17.7 billion sale of cable operator Cablevision.\n\nWatching people flock to Madison Square Garden for concerts by popular electronic dance music (EDM) artists Swedish House Mafia and Deadmau5, made CEO and executive chairman James Dolan want to figure out why people were there.\n\nUnlike rock or hip-hop concerts, where artists sing and perform live, at EDM events \"all of the artistry actually occurs prior to the show... And then the show is essentially run,\" Dolan says.\n\n\"What I got from that was it wasn't just about the performance and the lights and the music, it was about being together,\" Dolan told USA TODAY after a preview of the technology being incorporated into Sphere.\n\nHigh-speed Internet at each seat\n\nThis new arena will be built for these type of experiences, with high-speed Internet at every seat and throughout the venue, allowing event-goers to share what is happening on stage with friends on social media and to create interactive experiences with performers and presenter on stage.\n\n\"It's no longer just about what is happening on stage, it's about what is happening inside the entire audience.\"\n\nIn an increasingly crowded Las Vegas arena market — the 650,000-square-foot T-Mobile Arena opened off the famous Las Vegas Strip in 2016 while the NFL's Oakland Raiders are building a $1.9 billion, 65,000 seat stadium also due to open in 2020 — Sphere needs a compelling angle to draw not just customers, but artists and events.\n\nNo hockey or basketball here\n\n\"You will not see a hockey game, a basketball game in the Sphere,\" says Dolan, who also owns the New York Knicks, Rangers, and Liberty sports teams. \"The most sports thing you'll ever see is a fight.\"\n\nMSG is betting big on technology to add features to the Sphere to make it stand out for entertainment and conferences. Sphere's exterior is a dome that features 190,000 linear feet of LED lighting, or roughly 36 miles end-to-end, to enable it to be lit up or display images and video customized for each event that is taking place.\n\nA camera system located inside the dome will even be able to broadcast out to the outer shell, allowing the event inside to be viewed by anyone outside. A different camera system set up around the city will be able to virtually cloak the dome with real-time images and video of its surroundings, making it seemingly disappear.\n\nInside, 180,000 square feet, or about 4 acres, of a high-resolution screen stretches across nearly the entire arena's roof providing an immersive visual experience akin to a souped-up, 360-degree IMAX display. Radio City Music Hall, by comparison, has roughly 35,000 square feet of ceiling space.\n\nAnd for those EDM fans, there is an area at the front of the stage that will pump bass through the floorboards for concerts, working in tandem with the Holoplot system to give fans a new way to feel the music.\n\nWhile the large dome exterior and the massive interior display will catch people's eyes, it is the Holoplot system that has the potential to truly change the experience once inside.\n\nIn a different demonstration, the same speaker system played a German and English voice simultaneously.\n\nWhile this would normally give headaches, thanks to the beamforming technology the system was able to direct the German to this reporter's spot and the English to a colleague only a few feet away. When we switched locations, I heard English clearly while he heard German.\n\nAnd all this was without any fancy headphones or U.N.-style translation devices that have to be held up to your ear.\n\nBeyond the dome\n\nMSG has ambitious plans for the technology. While its debut in MSG Sphere may have to wait until 2020, David Dibble, CEO of the Ventures subsidiary that took a 25% stake in Holoplot, says the company hopes to bring the technology to Radio City later this year for the annual Rockettes Christmas show.\n\nThe company also has big plans for Sphere. Beyond Vegas, it has plans to open a venue in London while also exploring ways to bring some of it into people's homes, a move that would harken to Dolan's days in the cable business.\n\n\"We're building very large Spheres now, but we can build ones that are half the size, a quarter,\" Dolan says. \"Ultimately we may be able to put one right in your home.\"\n\nA \"home dome,\" adds Dibble with a laugh.\n\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/08"}]}

John Nagy/The Pilot/AP\n\n“Equipment will have to be replaced,” Brooks said. “We’re pursuing multiple paths of restoration so that we can restore as many customers as quickly as possible. Recognizing that, we are looking at pretty sophisticated repair with some fairly large equipment.”\n\nIn addition to the gunfire damage at the substations, a gate at one of the locations appears to have been taken off its hinges, Asst. Chief Mike Cameron of the Southern Pines Fire and Rescue Department told CNN.\n\nWhile it’s unclear what motivated the alleged vandalism, the sheriff on Sunday addressed rumors circulating on social media that the attack was an attempt to thwart a local drag show.\n\nFields said investigators “have not been able to tie anything back to the drag show,” which was scheduled in the town of Southern Pines at 7 p.m. Saturday, around the time the power went out.\n\nDuke Energy workers gather Sunday as they plan how to repair an electrical substation in Carthage, North Carolina. Jonathan Drake/Reuters\n\nThe head of the LGBTQ+ group that helped organize the drag show said Monday she was unaware of any threats to the event before the attacks. Lauren Mathers, the executive director of Sandhills PRIDE, told CNN they received a lot of “hateful comments” on social media, but nothing that could be considered a threat.\n\nThe house lights were down between numbers when the power went out, so they didn’t realize anything was wrong when the lights didn’t come back on, she said.\n\nCNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem said the fact that the shooting was “targeted enough to bring down two different facilities” probably has investigators looking at an “insider threat.”\n\n“They will be looking at the potential that there was either casing or someone who knew the area, knew the facilities and knew exactly where to shoot,” she said on CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper.” “These aren’t drive-by incidents. These are ones in which you’re targeting directly.”\n\nAccording to CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller, these incidents are similar to one more than nine years ago in California.\n\nSniper fire hit a Silicon Valley substation in April 2013, when 150 bullets from a rifle took out 17 transformers.

A few thousand at a time.”\n\nNew equipment has been installed, but it needs to be calibrated and tested so that it works in sync with the grid, Brooks said.\n\nAbout 35,000 customers in Moore County remained without power Tuesday afternoon, according to Brooks.\n\nThe mayor of Southern Pines, a town of about 15,900 residents situated in the county, called the attack a cruel and selfish act.\n\n“There are so many people that are hurting,” Mayor Carol Haney said on CNN on Monday. The revenue stream has been stopped. If you have health issues, it is critical. It is just a horrible, horrible, terrorist, in my opinion, act.”\n\nNo suspects or motives have been announced.\n\nAt Tuesday’s news conference, Moore County Chief Deputy Richard Maness had no major updates about the investigation but said a tip line has been “very, very active” in the past 24 hours.\n\nTom McInnis, the North Carolina Senate Majority Whip whose district includes Moore County, told reporters he is looking at potential legislation to modernize penalties for this kind of incident, which he said is something that has never happened in North Carolina.\n\nPharmacist storing prescription medicines at home\n\nThe outages have made life difficult for residents. Schools will be closed through Thursday, four days with no classes. Businesses without generators are shuttered. Residents without power must leave their homes for hot food and to charge their electronic devices.\n\nThe owner of a Moore County pharmacy is storing medicines in his home, which is powered by a generator, so that people can continue to get their prescriptions, he said.\n\nRob Barrett, the owner of Whispering Pines Prescription Shoppe, believes he has enough gas to keep the generator running, but the pharmacy faces other issues: Some employees have no gas to get to work, and there are communication issues.\n\nIn rural areas of the county, the loss of electricity has also impacted the water supply to families.\n\n“Rural communities rely on electricity a lot more than people realize,” Andrew Wilkins, whose parents own a farm in Whispering Pines, told CNN. “Many big cities don’t lose their water when the power goes out, but a lot of rural areas rely on a well for water.\n\n“My family draws their water from a well, so when the power goes out, the well stops and the water pressure drops and we slowly lose water.”\n\nResidents of Southern Pines have lunch Monday while the power is out in the area at Reds Food Truck Corner. Karl B DeBlaker/AP\n\nSouthern Pines, roughly a 40-mile drive northwest of Fayetteville and a 70-mile drive southwest of Raleigh, lost all power, according to Haney, the mayor. She said she had to get her 98-year-old mother out of the town and to Charlotte so she could be in a warm home.\n\nWith the power out, the town’s water and sewer system is operating on generator power, according to Southern Pines Fire and Rescue.\n\nThe town’s fire department has seen an increase in car crashes related to the lack of traffic lights, and more fires as people try to find alternate ways to heat their homes, Southern Pines Fire Chief Mike Cameron told CNN.\n\nThe fire department also is getting more medical calls from people using supplemental oxygen or other medical devices that require power, Cameron said.\n\nFirstHealth Moore Regional Hospital in Pinehurst is running on a backup generator.

Roy Cooper told “CNN This Morning” on Tuesday. FBI and state investigators have joined the investigation.\n\n“This was a malicious, criminal attack on the entire community that plunged tens of thousands of people into darkness,” Cooper said.\n\n“Our priorities now are health and safety, getting the power back on as quickly as possible, and making sure that federal, state and local law enforcement find out who did this, and why, and bring them to justice.”\n\nSeveral communities across the county began experiencing power outages just after 7 p.m. Saturday, the Moore County Sheriff’s Office said.\n\nWhoever fired bullets at the substations “knew exactly what they were doing,” Fields, the county sheriff, said Sunday.\n\nFields on Sunday noted “no group has stepped up to acknowledge or accept they’re the ones who (did) it.”\n\nInvestigators were trying to determine whether both substations were fired at simultaneously, or one after the other, the sheriff said Monday.\n\nA countywide mandatory curfew from 9 p.m. until 5 a.m. has been in effect since Sunday night, with Fields saying the decision was made to protect residents and businesses.\n\nResidents fill gas containers Monday just outside the area impacted by the power outage. Karl B DeBlaker/AP\n\nCountry needs to have a serious conversation about infrastructure protection, governor says\n\nThe governor stressed Tuesday that the state needs to learn from the incident, saying “this is unacceptable to have this many people without power for this long.”\n\n“This is a retirement community, so there are a lot of adult care homes that do not have power,” Cooper told CNN on Tuesday. “We’re providing generators and help to make sure people are safe here.”\n\nThe country needs to have “a serious … conversation about protecting our critical infrastructure,” Cooper said.\n\n“It was clear that (whoever is behind the gunfire) knew how to cause significant damage, and that they could do it at this substation, so we have to reassess the situation,” Cooper said.\n\nOfficials are not disclosing whether there were cameras at the two affected substations, because that is “part of the investigation that they do not want to reveal at this time,” Cooper said.\n\nLess than two weeks before Saturday’s substation damage, the FBI said there had been an increase in reported threats to electric infrastructure from people who espouse “racially or ethnically motivated violent extremist ideology.”\n\nThe FBI has received reports of threats to electric infrastructure by people espousing racially or ethnically motivated extremist ideology “to create civil disorder and inspire further violence,” the FBI said in a November 22 bulletin sent to private industry, which CNN obtained.\n\nThough the motives for Saturday’s damage still are unclear, US officials have consistently been concerned by the interest violent extremists have shown in the country’s electric grid.\n\nCooper said Tuesday he was aware of the FBI warning.\n\n“Matter of fact, we have worked to organize and step up our protection of our infrastructure, particularly in the area of cyber security. We know that those attacks can be massive and put down power or water or other infrastructure for a lot of people across the country, so we’ve been working on that,” Cooper said.", "authors": ["Steve Almasy Jason Hanna Amanda Musa", "Steve Almasy", "Jason Hanna", "Amanda Musa"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/11/economy/hurricane-ian-labor-impact/index.html", "title": "Tens of thousands likely jobless after Hurricane Ian, economists say ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nHurricane Ian’s devastating impact will be felt for weeks and months to come, especially in the state of Florida where much of the storm’s damage was sustained. Economists say tens of thousands of people are likely to file for unemployment benefits in the storm’s wake, but if those workers — many in low-paying service sector industries like tourism — don’t come back, the local economies of some hard-hit areas could struggle to rebound.\n\nAlthough the damage is still being tallied, early estimates indicate that Ian could be the most costly hurricane to make landfall in Florida. The storm’s economic toll of insured losses could be between $53 billion and $74 billion, according to RMS, a Moody’s Analytics disaster-modeling firm.\n\nIn the short term, a spike in jobless claims is almost inevitable, economists say: “Hurricane Harvey in Texas prompted a rise of about 50,000 in August of 2017,” noted Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics.\n\n“Certainly, there’s going to be some short-term displacement… but it’s hard to predict exactly what that will look like in the Florida context or in the Southeast more generally,” said Lynn Karoly, a senior economist at the RAND Corporation.\n\nThe biggest threat is to tourism. “Particularly in coastal communities, and within tourism… how long those effects persist depends on the sector’s ability to rebuild,” Karoly said.\n\nLow-income workers face a potential cash crunch\n\nWhile big companies can at least fall back on insurance, free cash flow or issuing debt to repair or replace damaged buildings and equipment, workers are likely to have a steeper climb back to financial stability.\n\n“The resilience factor could be lower among the lower-wage workforce, and even their employers may also be rethinking about how they staff the positions that they need to fill,” Karoly said. In a labor market that was historically tight pre-storm, there might be more of an impetus to replace displaced workers with machines, self-serve customer features or other technologies.\n\nA view of the destroyed road between Florida's Matlacha and Pine Island after Hurricane Ian. Marco Bello/Reuters\n\nDave Gilbertson, vice president at HR technology firm UKG, which tracks real-time labor market metrics like time-card punches, said that in devastated Florida counties like Lee and Hillsborough, workforce activity has already plunged by nearly half — suggesting a tremendous loss of economic activity as well as earnings.\n\n“It’s pretty uncommon to see a nearly 50% decline,” Gilbertson said. “This is a deeper disaster than we’ve seen over the past couple of years.”\n\nFor the growing number of households whose pay isn’t keeping pace with rising prices, losing a source of income can quickly become a crisis.\n\n“They’re losing so much personally, but they’re also losing the ability to work and support their family,” Gilbertson said. “A lot of hourly workers are living paycheck-to-paycheck [and] dealing with rising inflation by pulling down their savings and utilizing more credit cards… The ability to withstand any kind of disruption is minimal.”\n\nHurricane Katrina showed what worked — and what didn’t\n\nAlthough parallels are frequently drawn, economists said comparisons to 2005’s Hurricane Katrina can only go so far to help predict what the aftereffects of Ian will mean for Florida’s labor market in the long term.\n\n“There will be a significant slowdown in the job openings in the state, [but] it’s a very strong economy and hurricanes are not new to them,” said Sinem Buber, lead economist at ZipRecruiter.\n\nFlorida absorbed nearly 221,000 new residents between July 2020 and July 2021 alone, according to Census Bureau data. The hard-hit city of Fort Myers had the sixth-fastest growth of all US cities in that time frame. That state’s unemployment rate was 2.7%, a full percentage point below the national average.\n\n“Katrina was a much more damaging storm, and impacted Louisiana, which is much less affluent than Florida,” Zandi said.\n\nRelatively wealthy places like Florida generally have more resources at their disposal for rebuilding, but even there, people who live in poorer areas — who are less likely to have either adequate insurance or savings to rebuild — often just move away. Many displaced people who migrated across the Gulf of Mexico to the Houston area in the wake of Katrina, for instance, never returned. This exodus can permanently reshape the fabric of the local economies they leave behind.\n\n“Hurricanes have differing economic effects, depending on whether the area is one that people are moving into or out of,” Englund said. “Hurricane recoveries tend to accelerate whatever economic transitions might have been underway when the storm hit, leaving a building surge in growing areas but economic blight in contracting areas.”\n\nStay or go? Workers are vulnerable either way\n\nAs climate change magnifies the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, relocation itself can create a vicious cycle for the financial stability of lower-income households, said Adam Rose, senior research fellow at the Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Threats and Emergencies.\n\nMany of the displaced residents of New Orleans who moved to Houston following Hurricane Katrina settled in the only place they could afford — on less-desirable, low-lying land that was inundated more than a decade later by 2017’s Hurricane Harvey.\n\nA powerboat lies atop a pile of debris two days after the passage of Hurricane Ian, in Fort Myers, Florida. Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n\nEven if low-earning residents are able to rebuild their finances, they remain on figurative — if not literal — unstable ground, which suggests that an economy growing at their expense isn’t rock-solid, either.\n\n“These low-wage jobs in tourism are not a solid economic base,” Rose said, adding that part of the blame for New Orleans’ slow post-Katrina recovery was its dependence on a sector that left residents with little resources for rebuilding. “The fact that so much of the employment base in New Orleans is tourism has kind of reached its maximum in that vein, and that’s one reason the population growth has leveled off.”\n\nAnd those who manage to stick it out might be no better off in terms of being protected from the next big storm. “Without careful attention to climate preservation, hurricanes are poised to present significant challenges for labor markets in coastal regions of the United States,” Rushaine Goulbourne, a former research associate at the Brookings Institution, wrote in a study last year.\n\nIn this context, Florida’s population boom — a frequent boast of state lawmakers — could be contributing to the scope of the crisis, as demand grows for housing that people in low-wage service-sector jobs can afford, said Jim Blackburn, professor of environmental law and co-director of the Severe Storm Prediction, Education and Evacuation From Disasters Center at Rice University.\n\n“There’s no replacement housing. If you don’t have alternative… safe housing for lower-income people, we’re going to continue to have this same problem over and over and over,” he said. “It’s unreasonable to develop barrier islands and not expect them to get destroyed.”", "authors": ["Martha C.

The operator warned rolling blackouts could happen if the strain becomes too much.\n\nIn New York, utility companies Con Edison and Natural Grid US also urged customers to conserve energy, citing extreme weather conditions and increased energy demand on interstate pipelines carrying natural gas into the city.\n\nMeanwhile, a shortage of electricity in Texas prompted the US Department of Energy to declare an emergency Friday, allowing the state’s energy provider to exceed environmental emissions standards until energy usage drops.\n\nIn Jackson, Mississippi, frigid temperatures are hampering efforts to repair a large water main break late Saturday, which has caused a loss in water pressure for residents, city officials said.\n\n“We are grateful to the crews who are braving these frigid temperatures on this Christmas Eve night, while working to restore pressure to residents. Their sacrifice does not go unnoticed and is appreciated not only by this administration, but also by every resident who is affected,” the release stated.\n\nThe brutal weather conditions have also snarled travel during the busy holiday weekend, with more than 5,000 flights canceled Friday, more than 3,400 flights canceled Saturday, and more than 2,800 canceled for Christmas Day.\n\nDangerous weather conditions claim lives\n\nSnow covers a vehicle on December 24, 2022, in Hamburg, New York.

Details about a third death, confirmed by a county spokesperson Saturday afternoon, weren’t immediately available.\n\n“The loss of two lives in Buffalo – storm related – because people were not able to get to medical attention, is again a crisis situation that unfolds before your eyes and you realize that lifesaving ambulances and emergency medical personnel cannot get to people during a blizzard situation,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Saturday.\n\nHochul said she will ask the federal government “for a declaration of emergency that’ll allow us to seek reimbursements for the extraordinary expenses of all the overtime and the fact that we brought in mutual aid from other parts of the state.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Powerful winter storm leaves first responders in need of rescue, official says 01:49 - Source: CNN\n\nOther storm-related deaths have been reported in the country.

Tate Reeves. The National Guard was called up to help distribute bottled water as crews work to get the water treatment plant back online, state officials said.\n\nBut the distribution itself proved unsustainable. Residents of all ages were seen waiting in lines more than a mile long at Hawkins Field Airport for at least two hours Tuesday for just one case of bottled water. The event was supposed to span three hours, but barely ran two as people were eventually turned away when the 700 cases of water ran out.\n\n“I keep saying we’re going to be the next Michigan,” said Jeraldine Watts, 86, who was able to get water at a grocery store Monday night. “And it looks like that’s exactly what we’re headed for.”\n\nWatts was referring to the water crisis in the city of Flint, which has battled water issues since a 2014 water crisis in which lead-contaminated water fed to residents’ faucets.\n\nPeople line up for water in Jackson, Mississippi, on August 30, 2022. CNN\n\nJackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba told CNN’s Pamela Brown the city is working on more water distribution events. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency will provide nearly 30 water trucks to help supplement the city events, the mayor said.\n\n“I have been assured by MEMA that they will supplement those locations with about 28 tanker trucks distributed at various points across the city,” Lumumba told CNN.\n\nExplanations for Jackson’s failing system are complicated: Damage this summer to pumps at the main water treatment facility made failure increasingly likely as the summer progressed, the governor said; and flooding of the Pearl River after heavy rains last week affected treatment processes and therefore the amount of running water the system can provide, Lumumba said.\n\nThis week’s troubles come as the water system has been plagued with problems for years and with the city already under a boil water notice since late July for what the state called a water-quality issue.\n\nThe state is “surging our resources to the city’s water treatment facility and beginning emergency maintenance, repairs and improvements,” Gov. Reeves said. “We will do everything in our power to restore water pressure and get water flowing back to the people of Jackson.”\n\nWater for those in the state’s most populous city would have to be provided “for an unknown period of time,” Reeves said.\n\nThe water shortage is expected to last “the next couple of days,” according to the mayor’s office.\n\nLumumba also announced Monday the city’s public works director – a role that oversees the water treatment facilities – has been reassigned. Marlin King will instead serve as deputy director and Jordan Hillman, the city’s planning and development director, will be the interim public works director, according to Melissa Payne, the mayor’s spokesperson.\n\nKing did not respond to CNN requests for comment. Payne said King’s reassignment “is part of restructuring” and is not a result of the current water crisis.\n\nResidents say faucet water is discolored\n\nState Rep. Ronnie Crudup Jr. said he didn’t have running water Monday, but on Tuesday, discolored water came out of his faucet that he used to flush the toilet. He and his family used bottled water Tuesday morning to brush their teeth, Crudup told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota.\n\nCrudup said that although the city has experienced water issues in the past, rain played a part in the current water emergency.\n\n“It’s been building up for years, but we have had an unprecedented amount of rain in the last two to three weeks, and it just kind of created this havoc, what we are dealing with right now,” he said.\n\nJackson resident Daryl Page told CNN he’s been searching for clean, bottled water since the city’s been under a boil water notice “for a whole month.” He was driving to a distribution site, but as he arrived, he noticed there was nothing there.\n\nFirefighters and recruits for the Jackson Fire Department carry cases of bottled water to residents vehicles, August 18, 2022, as part of the city's response to longstanding water system problems. Rogelio V. Solis/AP\n\n“Everyone is turning around because there is nothing here,” Page said, adding that his next plan of action was to drive to another site in hopes that he could find cases of water there.\n\nBecause of Monday’s failure, officials announced all Jackson public schools will shift to virtual learning Tuesday.\n\nHospitals are also feeling the strain. Jackson’s University of Mississippi Medical Center released a statement Tuesday saying the Jackson Medical Mall air conditioning is not functioning properly “because the water pressure feeding its chillers is too low.” Portable restrooms are being used in locations experiencing low water pressure, the statement said.\n\nThe university medical center statement also said a fire watch was declared for its Jackson-based facilities, “because fire suppression systems are fed by the city water system. Low pressure in the systems may cause them to be less effective.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed on the water crisis in Jackson and the White House has been “in regular contact with state and local officials, including Mayor Lumumba, and made clear that the Federal Government stands ready to offer assistance,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“(The Federal Emergency Management Agency) is working closely with the state officials to identify needs, and the EPA is coordinating with industry partners to expedite delivery of critical treatment equipment for emergency repairs at the City of Jackson water treatment facilities,” she said.\n\nIn an emailed statement Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency said “ensuring all people have access to healthy and safe water is a top priority.”\n\n“We are in communication with officials in Mississippi and stand ready to provide support should the State request federal assistance,” the EPA statement read. “In the interim, we are available to provide technical support and information to Mississippi officials as they navigate their plan to address the immediate concerns at the O.B. Curtis Water Plant.”\n\nLater Tuesday, the governor said FEMA has received the state’s declaration asking the federal government to declare the water shortage a federal emergency.\n\nWater system issues go back decades, mayor says\n\nThe problem this week stems from one of two water treatment facilities in the city: the O.B. Curtis plant, which is run by the city of Jackson, according to the governor.\n\nThe main pumps at O.B. Curtis were severely damaged recently, and the facility began operating on smaller backup pumps about a month ago, around the time the latest boil water notice began in July, the governor said, without elaborating about the damage.\n\nThe governor said he was told Friday that “it was a near-certainty that Jackson would fail to produce running water sometime in the next several weeks or months if something did not materially improve,” the governor said.\n\nThe O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant in Jackson, Mississippi, seen on March 24, 2022. Mark Felix/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut Lumumba said during a Monday news conference that it was only a matter time before the water system failed because Jackson’s water system has been faced serious issues for years.\n\n“I have said on multiple occasions that it’s not a matter of ‘if’ our system would fail, but a matter of ‘when’ our system would fail,” the mayor said, adding that the city has been “going at it alone for the better part of two years” when it comes to the water crisis.\n\nIn early 2020, the water system failed an Environmental Protection Agency inspection. The agency wrote the drinking water had the potential to be host to harmful bacteria or parasites, based on observations of the water’s turbidity, or cloudiness, as well as “disinfection treatment concerns, and/or the condition of the distribution system.”\n\nIn March 2020, the EPA issued an order requiring the city to develop a plan to replace and repair monitoring and treatment equipment, to “address dosing processes for disinfection and pH control” and to take more coliform bacteria samples, among other things.\n\nThe city also has endured weather-related shutdowns.\n\nIn February 2021, a winter storm shut down Jackson’s entire water system, leaving tens of thousands of residents without water for a month amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Residents have been under some sort of boil water notice or advisory several times since that storm, including the state-ordered notice posted in July.\n\n“We were here two Februarys ago when we had system failures, and the world was watching us and the world is watching us again,” Lumumba said during Monday’s news conference.\n\nThe mayor also pointed to recent flooding from the Pearl River as an event that triggered the latest water pressure issues.\n\nBecause O.B. Curtis received additional water from the reservoir during the flooding from last week to this week, the facility had to change the way it treats the water, which has led to the reduction of water being put out into the system and reduced tank levels. This is affecting the water pressure at residents’ homes, he said.\n\n“As one crisis may be diverted, another one rears its head,” Lumumba said Monday during a news conference after addressing the flooding in the city.\n\nO.B. Curtis is meant to provide about 50 million gallons for the city daily. The other plant, which usually provides about 20 million gallons daily, has been approved to ramp up its output amid the shortage, authorities said.\n\nIn July 2021, the EPA and the city entered into an agreement to address “long-term challenges and make needed improvements to the drinking water system.” The EPA recently announced $74.9 million in federal water and sewer infrastructure funds for Mississippi, mentioning Jackson without naming specific projects.\n\nHowever, Lumumba has said it would take $2 billion to fully repair and replace the dated system, which city, state and federal officials say also has too much lead in its water in some places.\n\nLumumba declared a water system emergency Monday. The proclamation noted not only the flooding but also numerous previous “unsuccessful attempts to rectify water system issues.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\nAs for restoring water pressure and flow and performing emergency maintenance and repairs, the state would split the cost with the city, Reeves said Tuesday.\n\n“We will cash flow the operation, and the city will be responsible for half the cost of the emergency improvements that we make,” the governor said in a statement released on Twitter.\n\nAt a Tuesday news conference at the plant, Reeves said he is “encouraged” and at the same time “discouraged” by some of the news coming out of the facility.\n\n“We do have a plan in place to potentially bring in an additional rented pump that will allow us to put at least 4 million gallons of water additionally, hopefully, which will be installed by tomorrow morning. That is progress and will help,” he said.\n\nReeves added there is no time frame as of now for safe drinking water, but that over the next 24 to 36 hours residents will see significant truckloads of clean water start to be delivered to Jackson.\n\nOver the next few days, more than 108 semi-trucks of water are coming into Jackson and seven mega distribution sites will have 36 truckloads of water a day for the public to be able to retrieve, according to Lt. Col. Stephen McCraney, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency director.\n\nSystemic issues also contributed to water crisis\n\nLumumba previously told CNN a lack of political will and years of neglect on a national level has prevented Jackson from getting the help it needs to fix its water and sewer crisis. Besides the infrastructure issues, the plant has also been faced with staffing issues, according to the mayor and governor.\n\n“A far too small number of heroic frontline workers were trying their hardest to hold the system together, but that it was a near impossibility,” the governor said Monday.\n\nJackson’s ongoing water system problems already had some residents reporting low to no water pressure and raw sewage flowing in city streets and neighborhoods before this month.\n\nNow, some residents are taking to Twitter – where #jxnwatercrisis and #jacksonwatercrisis were trending – to post pictures of buckets and even tubs full of brown water coming out of their drains.\n\nSome on social media also pointed to systemic and environmental racism as among the causes of the city’s ongoing water issues and lack of resources, given that 82.5% of Jackson’s population identifies as Black or African American, according to census data, while the state’s legislature is majority White.\n\nNAACP president Derrick Johnson called out the Mississippi governor on Twitter Tuesday.\n\n”.@tatereeves, what are you waiting for!? We demand on behalf of the Jackson communities that you request federal aid from @FEMA and other agencies to ensure people have access to a basic human right: WATER,” Johnson’s tweet read. “Make the damn call. This is personal.”\n\nJackson has undergone drastic changes in the past half century. Its economic decline has occurred rapidly over the past two decades, fueled by population decline and demographic shifts.\n\nThe city’s population shrank from almost 200,000 in 1990 to about 160,000 in 2020. Its decline in population in these three decades was driven almost entirely by White flight. The city was 56% Black in 1990. By 2020, 82% of the city’s residents were Black.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Jason Hanna Nouran Salahieh", "Amir Vera", "Jason Hanna", "Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/us/power-outage-moore-county-investigation-wednesday/index.html", "title": "Moore County power: Investigators are zeroing in on 2 possible ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nInvestigators – who have found nearly two dozen shell casings from a high-powered rifle – are zeroing in on two threads of possible motives centered around extremist behavior for the weekend assault on two North Carolina electric substations, according to law-enforcement sources briefed on the investigation.\n\nThe news comes as the primary utility company in Moore County restored electricity to the final customers of the 45,000 homes and businesses that initially lost power.\n\nOfficials on Wednesday also announced a total of $75,000 in reward money for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or people responsible for Saturday’s attacks.\n\nOne thread involves the writings by extremists on online forums encouraging attacks on critical infrastructure. The second thread looks at a series of recent disruptions of LGBTQ+ events across the nation by domestic extremists.\n\nThe FBI and the NC State Bureau are assisting in the investigation.\n\ninvestigators have no evidence connecting the North Carolina attacks to a drag event at the theater in the same county, but the timing of two events are being considered in context with the growing tensions and armed confrontations around similar LBGTQ+ events across the country, the sources told CNN.\n\nIn the past two years, anti-government groups began using online forums to urge followers to attack critical infrastructure, including the power grid. They have posted documents and even instructions outlining vulnerabilities and suggesting the use of high-powered rifles.\n\nOne 14-page guide obtained by CNN cited as an example the 2013 sniper attack on a high voltage substation at the edge of Silicon Valley that destroyed 17 transformers and cost Pacific Gas and Electric $15 million in repairs.\n\nIn that case, the shooter fired more than 100 bullets in about 20 minutes, disappearing a minute before police arrived. The case remains unsolved.\n\nWhile investigators haven’t found a rifle in the North Carolina shootings, the casings still could offer critical evidence. A law enforcement source told CNN that the caliber of the bullets in the California incident is different from those used in North Carolina.\n\nInvestigators are taking into consideration that the timing of Moore County shootings – 7 p.m. on a Saturday night – coincided with the time a drag performance sponsored by the local LBGTQ+ community began, according to the sources. Audience members used their phone flashlights to light the stage for one last song, but after that the performance couldn’t continue due to the power outage, according to Sandhills PRIDE.\n\nOfficials have said the gunfire, which left much of the county without electricity for days, were a “malicious” and “intentional” attack. The two substations are about 10 miles apart.\n\nNo suspects in the outages have been announced.\n\nSheriff Ronnie Fields has said whoever fired at the substations “knew exactly what they were doing.” No group “has stepped up to acknowledge or accept they’re the ones who (did) it,” the sheriff said Sunday.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning there were 35,000 customers without power, but that number had decreased to 1,200 by the time a 4 p.m. news conference began, according to Duke Energy spokesperson Jeff Brooks. A few hours later the company’s website showed zero outages in the area.\n\nGiven the information, county officials said a nightly curfew will end for good at 5 a.m. Thursday.\n\nShell casings and bullets offer clues\n\nBullets recovered from the sites, and the brass shell casings found a short distance away, are the few pieces of physical evidence that investigators have.\n\nBecause of the heat generated in a high-powered rifle’s chamber during rapid fire, fingerprints are burned away – and nearly impossible to recover from spent casings. Still, the brass may offer valuable clues.\n\nInvestigators can enter the casings into the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network, a database from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The database records three-dimensional images of shell casings and can match them to any other shell casings that may have been fired by the same gun at another crime scene or to the gun if the weapon is recovered.\n\nThe spot where the casings were found can give investigators a way to pinpoint the firing positions. Knowing where the shooter fired from could lead to discoveries such as shoe prints and tire tracks.\n\nResidents head to shelter for hot food and showers\n\nFor now, schools are closed through Thursday, many stores and restaurants are shut, homes are without heating or running refrigerators, drivers are traversing intersections with no traffic lights.\n\nNakasha Jackson, who came to the shelter to pick up some hot food, said the outage has been difficult with her 1-year-old child. CNN\n\nA Red Cross-run emergency shelter was set up at the Moore County Sports Complex to help provide shelter, food, showers and other services to people impacted. It will remain as a shelter through noon on Thursday, officials said.\n\nNakasha Jackson, who came to the shelter to pick up some hot food, said the outage has been difficult for her 1-year-old child.\n\n“No lights, no power, can’t really do nothing. The kid is scared of the dark,” she told CNN.\n\nJackson said sometimes she has to travel up to an hour one way to buy food. “It’s ridiculous. It should never have been done,” Jackson said.\n\nResidents who rely on electricity-powered medical equipment have also seen their lives upended. One woman told CNN she came to the shelter because she had no power for her CPAP machine at night.\n\nAfter two days of sleeping without it, she said she began to feel ill and came into the shelter for help.\n\nOthers have sought shelter fearing for their safety as they struggled to keep their homes warm.\n\n“It’s different. It’s kind of hard to sleep, you know. But at the end of the day, I’d rather be somewhere where it’s warm, where we have food, where we’re taken care of than to be somewhere it’s freezing cold,” said Amber Sampson.\n\nOn top of having to stay at the shelter, Sampson hasn’t been able to work since Sunday after her employer also lost power – an issue that could end up costing her hundreds of dollars.\n\nAuthorities have expressed anger over the attack, with Carol Haney, mayor of Southern Pines – a town of about 15,900 residents that completely lost power – calling it a cruel and selfish act.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper voiced concern over businesses and residents in nursing homes.\n\n“When we look at all the money that’s being lost by businesses here at Christmastime, when we look at threats to people in nursing homes having lost power, hospitals having to run off generators and not being able to do certain kinds of operations at this point – all of those are deep concerns here, and we can’t let this happen,” the Democrat told CNN on Tuesday.\n\n“This was a malicious, criminal attack on the entire community.”", "authors": ["John Miller Steve Almasy Whitney Wild", "John Miller", "Steve Almasy", "Whitney Wild"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/weather/kentucky-appalachia-flooding-monday/index.html", "title": "Kentucky flooding: Death toll rises to 37 as governor says hundreds ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe death toll in flood-stricken Kentucky has risen to 37, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday afternoon, as rescue workers continue to comb the region for hundreds of missing people, unable to access areas left isolated after floodwater washed away bridges and inundated communities.\n\n“We are ending the day with more heartbreaking news out of Eastern Kentucky. We can confirm the death toll has now risen to 37, with so many more still missing,” Beshear tweeted late Monday afternoon. “Let us pray for these families and come together to wrap our arms around our fellow Kentuckians.”\n\nThe death toll could still rise further, according to officials, with “hundreds of unaccounted for people” at a minimum, the governor said at a news conference earlier in the day in Frankfort.\n\n“We just don’t have a firm grasp on that. I wish we did – there are a lot of reasons why it’s nearly impossible,” he said. “But I want to make sure we’re not giving either false hope or faulty information.”\n\nThe flooding last week swelled over roads, destroyed bridges and swept away entire homes, displacing thousands of Kentuckians, Beshear previously said. Vital electricity, water and roadway infrastructure was also knocked out. Some of it has yet to be restored, though cell service is returning in some of the state’s hardest-hit areas, the governor said, which may help people connect with loved ones they’ve yet to contact.\n\n“I’ve lived here in this town for 56 years, and I have never seen water of this nature,” Tracy Neice, the mayor of Hindman, Kentucky, told CNN, saying his town’s main street looked like a stretch of river where one might go whitewater rafting. “It was just devastating to all of our businesses, all of our offices.”\n\nThis photo shows four siblings from Knott County, Kentucky, who died in last week's flooding. Running clockwise, beginning in the top left, it shows Madison, 8; Riley Jr., 6; Chance, 2; and Nevaeh, 4. courtesy Smith & Noble family\n\nWhile reading a breakdown of those killed in each county during a news conference Sunday, Beshear became visibly emotional when he reached four children dead in Knott County. They were identified to CNN by their aunt as siblings Chance, 2; Nevaeh, 4; Riley Jr., 6; and Madison, 8.\n\n“It says ‘minors,’” the governor said looking at the list. “They are children. The oldest one is in second grade,” Beshear said.\n\nThe children – described as sweet, funny and lovable – died after the family’s mobile home flooded last week, forcing them to seek shelter on the roof, their aunt, Brandi Smith, told CNN on Friday.\n\n“They were holding on to them,” Smith said of her sister and her partner. “The water got so strong it just washed them away.”\n\nSixteen of the deaths occurred in Knott County, about 130 miles southeast of Lexington, per the governor’s office. Seven people were killed in Breathitt County, two in Clay County, two in Letcher County and three in Perry County.\n\nThe governor believes recovery crews are “going to be finding bodies for weeks,” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, “many of them swept hundreds of yards, maybe a quarter-mile plus from where they were last.”\n\nMore rain in the forecast\n\nOfficials are “still in search and rescue mode,” Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman told CNN on Monday, “because there is so much water.”\n\n“All of our state roads are passable,” she said, but “we still have back roads and country roads that are broken off, and our bridges are out. So it’s really difficult to get to some of the most remote places.”\n\nIn Perry County, as many as 50 bridges are damaged and inaccessible, according to county Judge Executive Scott Alexander.\n\n“What that means is there’s somebody living on the other side or multiple families living up our holler on the other side that we’re still not able to have road access to,” Alexander said.\n\nThings could get more difficult due to a slight risk of excessive rainfall throughout the region Monday, the National Weather Service said, and with the ground already saturated, more rain could bring yet more flooding.\n\n“If things weren’t hard enough on the people in this region, they’re getting rain right now,” Beshear said Monday.\n\nA flood watch will be in effect overnight, lasting from 9 p.m. Monday to 9 a.m. Tuesday. Forecasts predict thunderstorms and potential rainfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour. Heavy downpours could cause excessive runoff and “result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations,” said the weather service.\n\nDebris surrounds a badly damaged home near Jackson, Kentucky, on July 31, 2022. Seth Herald/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTemperatures are expected to rise later this week, hitting the mid-80s and near 90 on Wednesday and Thursday, per the weather service, but it will feel much hotter because of the humidity. The heat indices – the temperature it feels like when heat is combined with humidity – are expected to peak around 100 degrees in some places, leaving rescue crews and displaced people facing oppressive heat as more than 14,000 customers remain without power.\n\nAs the climate crisis fuels more frequent extreme weather events, several areas of the US are currently experiencing flash flood risk, including swathes of the desert Southwest, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Tucson, Arizona.\n\nRegion in desperate need of resources\n\nMeantime, state officials are immediately focused on getting food, water and shelter to the people who were forced to flee their homes.\n\nPower outages and storm damage left 22 water systems operating in a limited capacity, a Sunday news release from the governor’s office said. More than 60,000 water service connections are either without water or under a boil advisory, it said.\n\nOfficials overseeing the recovery efforts say bottled water, cleaning supplies and relief fund donations are among the most needed resources as the region works toward short- and long-term recovery. FEMA is providing tractor trailers full of water to several counties.\n\nVolunteers work at a distribution center of donated goods in Buckhorn, Kentucky. Seth Herald/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“A lot of these places have never flooded. So if they’ve never flooded, these people will not have flood insurance,” the mayor of Hazard, Kentucky, Donald Mobelini told CNN on Saturday. “If they lose their home, it’s total loss. There’s not going to be an insurance check coming to help that. We need cash donations,” he said, referring to a relief fund set up by the state.\n\nAmong those without flood insurance is Jessica Willett, a mother who tied herself to her two children using a cord she cut off her vacuum.\n\n“I thought I could try to save us,” she told CNN Monday. “Or, you know, if we didn’t make it, then we could be found all together.”\n\nWillett had no warning when the flooding began, she said.

There are other river dolphins in the world but this one was very different, so unrelated to anything else,” Turvey said. “Its demise was more than just another species tragedy – it was a huge loss of river diversity in terms of how unique it was and left huge holes in the ecosystem.”\n\nExperts have expressed grave concern that other rare native Yangtze animal and plant species are likely to suffer a similar fate to the baiji river dolphin as worsening climate change and extreme weather conditions take their toll on Asia’s longest river.\n\nChina has been grappling with its worst heat wave on record and the Yangtze, the third longest river in the world, is drying up.\n\nWith rainfall below average since July, its water levels have plunged to record lows of 50% of their normal levels for this time of year, exposing cracked river beds and even revealing submerged islands.\n\nParts of the Yangtze River have dried up from the extreme heat. Stringer/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe drought has already had a devastating effect on China’s most important river, which stretches an estimated 6,300 kilometers (3,900 miles) from the Tibetan plateau to the East China Sea near Shanghai and provides water, food, transport and hydroelectric power to more than 400 million people.\n\nThe human impact has been enormous. Factories were shut to preserve electricity and water supplies for tens of thousands of people have been affected.\n\nLess talked about, experts say, is the environmental impact that climate change and associated extreme weather events have had on the hundreds of protected and threatened wildlife and plant species living in and around the river.\n\n“The Yangtze is one of the world’s most ecologically critical rivers for biodiversity and freshwater ecosystems – and we are still discovering new species yearly,” said conservation ecologist Hua Fangyuan, an assistant professor from Peking University.\n\n“Many of the little (known) and unknown fish and other aquatic species are most likely facing extinction risks silently and we simply do not know enough.”\n\nA Chinese alligator at a zoo in Shanghai.

Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHundreds of species at risk\n\nOver the years conservationists and scientists have identified and documented hundreds of wild animal and plant species native to the Yangtze.\n\nAmong them are the Yangtze finless porpoise which, similar to the baiji, faces extinction due to human activity and habitat loss, and critically endangered reptiles like the Chinese alligator and Yangtze giant softshell turtle – believed to be the largest living species of freshwater turtle in the world.\n\nExperts have also noticed a drastic decline of many native freshwater species of fish, like the now extinct Chinese paddlefish and sturgeon.\n\nAt high risk is the Chinese giant salamander, one of the largest amphibians in the world. Wild populations have crashed, Turvey the zoologist said, and the species is “now on the verge of extinction.”\n\n“Although they are a protected species, Chinese giant salamanders are under greater threat from climate change – increasing global temperatures and droughts will definitely do it no good when it is already extremely vulnerable,” Turvey said.\n\nA Chinese giant salamander pictured at a local breeding facility. Imaginechina/AP\n\n“They have for a long time faced threats like poaching, habitat loss and pollution but when you add climate change into the mix, their chances of survival become drastically thin,” he added.\n\n“They can only live within freshwater environments and lower water levels would inevitably place greater pressure on their numbers across China.”\n\nA problem for the world\n\nNature conservation groups like the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) say the Yangtze’s plight is a major concern not only for the Chinese people and government, but also for the wider international community.\n\n“Rivers around the world, from Europe to the United States, have declined to historically low flow levels that are negatively impacting ecosystems,” said its lead scientist Jeff Opperman.\n\nEU, Copernicus Sentinel-2 imagery EU, Copernicus Sentinel-2 imagery Slide right to see the Yangtze in August, 2021, and slide left to see it in August, 2022.\n\n“Reduced river flow and warmer waters in the Yangtze are a threat to freshwater species and increase pressure on already critically endangered animals like the remaining Yangtze finless porpoises and Chinese alligators left in the wild. Lower river levels also impact the health of (nearby) lakes and wetlands, which are vital to millions of migratory birds along the East Asian Flyway.”\n\nA Yangtze giant softshell turtle at a zoo in Jiangsu province.

This is a lesson for any civilization,” she said.\n\n“The Yangtze is the longest river in China and (all of) Asia and has long been a cradle of civilization.

But experts say unless action is taken – and soon – more species will follow the fate of the baiji and Chinese paddlefish.\n\nTurvey, the British zoologist, warned against the sort of complacency that allowed the baiji to disappear.\n\n“The Yangtze was a jewel in Asia’s crown. There is still so much biodiversity to fight for and we must not give up hope for saving species like giant salamanders, river reptiles and others,” Turvey said.\n\n“If there’s anything we can learn from the death of the Yangtze River dolphin, it’s that extinction is forever and we can’t afford to take it lightly.”", "authors": ["Heather Chen"], "publish_date": "2022/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/10/weather/hurricane-nicole-florida-thursday/index.html", "title": "At least 2 dead as Hurricane Nicole weakens after striking Florida ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: CNN’s continuing coverage of the storm can be found here.\n\nCNN —\n\nAt least two people have died during the damage wrought by Nicole’s overnight landfall Thursday along Florida’s eastern shore, which knocked out power to thousands, pushed buildings near collapse and flooded the coast as the first hurricane to hit the United States in November in nearly 40 years.\n\nTwo people were “electrocuted by a downed power line” in Orange County, the Orange County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release.\n\nA tornado threat, plus powerful wind and heavy rain, are expected to continue Thursday in parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina after Nicole, which hit at Category 1 strength, weakened to a tropical depression.

But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday, it was pretty easy to read between the lines of the Wyoming Republican’s answers.\n\n“I am working hard here in Wyoming to earn every vote,” Cheney said at one point. “But I will also say this. I’m not going to lie. I’m not going to say things that aren’t true about the election. My opponents are doing that, certainly simply for the purpose of getting elected.\n\n“If I have to choose between maintaining a seat in the House of Representatives or protecting the constitutional republic and ensuring the American people know the truth about Donald Trump, I’m going to choose the Constitution and the truth every single day,” she said at another.\n\nAsked by Tapper whether her service as vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6 will have been worth it even if she loses next month, Cheney responded that it was “the single most important thing I have ever done professionally.”\n\nIf it sounds to you like Cheney is framing her August 16 primary for Wyoming’s at-large House seat as a sort of fait accompli, and as not the end of the story but as a part of a broader narrative, well, then, you are right.\n\nThe simple fact is that Cheney is very unlikely to beat Harriet Hageman in next month’s primary. Hageman has the support of former President Donald Trump, as well as a number of top Republicans including, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nWhile Cheney has tried to recruit Democrats to cross party lines and support her – and some undoubtedly will – it’s hard to see that making a real difference in the outcome of the race in such an overwhelmingly Republican state.\n\nSimply put: Cheney looks likely to lose – and she knows it.\n\nWhat she also knows is that, at least in her mind, this isn’t the end of her political career.\n\nHere’s how Cheney answered a question from Tapper on whether she is interested in running for president in 2024:\n\n“I haven’t really – at this point, I have not made a decision about 2024. …\n\n“… But I do think, as we look towards the next presidential election, as I said, I believe that our nation stands on the edge of an abyss. And I do believe that we all have to really think very seriously about the dangers we face and the threats we face. And we have to elect serious candidates.”\n\nWhich tells you everything you need to know about Cheney and 2024. She isn’t an announced candidate. But when you hear a politician talking about the country “standing on the edge of an abyss” and the need to elect “serious candidates,” well, it doesn’t take an astrophysicist to figure out what’s going on there.\n\nThe real question seems to be then not whether Cheney runs – she sounded to all the world like that decision is mostly made – but rather whether she would have any sort of impact on the 2024 race.\n\nIf Cheney runs as a Republican, it will, undoubtedly, be a very tough road for her.\n\nTrump is the clear frontrunner in all polling conducted on the Republican presidential primary and seems very likely to run. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is widely seen as the only serious alternative to Trump at the moment – and he has positioned himself as a representative of Trumpism without Trump.\n\nThere is no potential candidate garnering any serious support in hypothetical 2024 primary polls who is running expressly against Trump and his four years in office. The Republicans, aside from Cheney, who are signaling an interest in running that sort of campaign – Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan being perhaps the most prominent – barely register in polls.\n\nCould Cheney somehow coalesce the anti-Trump vote within the Republican Party? Sure. But even if she was to do so, there’s scant evidence that bloc of voters comprise anything close to a majority of likely Republican primary voters.\n\nThe other – and perhaps more plausible – path for Cheney is to run as an independent in 2024. Assuming Trump is the Republican nominee, such a candidacy could skim off enough votes to potentially hamstring the former President’s chances of winning. (Presumably Cheney, who is conservative on most issues, would appeal more to Republicans than Democrats.)\n\nEven under that scenario, however, Cheney would function as a spoiler – trying to keep Trump from the White House – rather than as a viable candidate to be president. Which, given what she told Tapper Sunday, might be enough for her.\n\n“I’m fighting hard, no matter what happens on August 16, I’m going to wake up on August 17 and continue to fight hard to ensure Donald Trump is never anywhere close to the Oval Office ever again,” said Cheney.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/politics/ron-desantis-migrants-marthas-vineyard-stunt/index.html", "title": "Ron DeSantis is getting *exactly* what he wanted | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn the 24 hours or so since Ron DeSantis sent two planes carrying migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, the move has dominated the political world. Every newspaper and cable channel is filled with thoughts about the move, with much of that opinion tilting toward outrage over the Florida Republican governor treating people like political pawns.\n\n“It’s outrageous,” New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez said of the move. “They lure people, like human traffickers lure people, onto buses and unknowing where they’re going to. They have no concern for – they supposedly are the advocates for human life. They have no concern for the lives of these people.”\n\nDeSantis couldn’t have scripted it any better politically.\n\nThe simple fact is that DeSantis made this Martha’s Vineyard gambit solely to draw attention to himself and his opposition to the border policies of the Biden administration. It was, to be frank, a stunt. And it’s not the first time he’s done something like this.\n\nConsider:\n\n* In the spring of 2022, DeSantis’ administration rejected 41% of proposed math textbooks because they were allegedly “indoctrinating” kids. “Some publishers attempted to slap a coat of paint on an old house built on the foundation of Common Core, and indoctrinating concepts like race essentialism, especially, bizarrely, for elementary school students,” DeSantis said in a statement explaining the move.\n\n* At a press conference at the University of South Florida earlier this year, DeSantis scolded students for wearing masks while indoors. “You do not have to wear those masks,” he said. “I mean, please take them off. Honestly, it’s not doing anything. We’ve got to stop with this Covid theater. So if you want to wear it, fine, but this is ridiculous.”\n\n* DeSantis revoked Disney’s special self-governance status in Florida following the company’s criticism of the state’s passage of legislation that bans the discussion of gender and sexuality among young people in public schools. “You’re a corporation based in Burbank, California, and you’re going to marshal your economic might to attack the parents of my state,” said DeSantis. “We view that as a provocation, and we’re going to fight back against that.”\n\nEach of these incidents drew national headlines. Each of them drew intense criticism from the left. And each of them drew equal amounts of praise from the conservative right.\n\nWhich is exactly how the Martha Vineyard’s stunt has played out. While DeSantis was blasted by Democrats, the right ran to defend him. “DeSantis was right to send migrants to Martha’s Vineyard. We need to bring border crisis to Democrats,” read an op-ed on Fox News’ website.\n\nFor DeSantis, the outrage – on both sides – is the point. He has built a political brand on the idea of standing up to what he views as political correctness and wokeness. (DeSantis signed a bill into law earlier this year designed to “protect Floridians from discrimination and woke indoctrination.”) In order to maintain and burnish that image, he has to do even more outrageous things – like the Martha’s Vineyard move.\n\nThe fact of the matter – whether you like DeSantis or not – is that his outrage machine is humming along. Largely riding his knack for stirring controversy, he has emerged by many measures as the second-most popular Republican in the country – behind only Donald Trump. He is regarded as a heavy favorite to win a second term over his Democratic opponent, former Gov. Charlie Crist, in November. And he is widely regarded as the only candidate who could credibly challenge Trump in a 2024 Republican primary.\n\nWhich is somewhat ironic. Because, as Trump likes to remind anyone who asks, he helped make DeSantis by endorsing him in a primary fight in 2018. And DeSantis has quite clearly modeled his approach to politics off of the ripped-from-the-headlines strategy employed by Trump.\n\nIn fact, what DeSantis is offering Republican voters amounts to Trumpism without Trump. In DeSantis, you get all the anti-wokeness that Trump built a presidential campaign and presidency on, but just without some of the more embarrassing personal foibles and tics that the former President brings with him.\n\nAnd, just like Trump, covering DeSantis provides a significant challenge for the media as well. DeSantis wants – and even courts – the scorn of the mainstream media for gambits like the one in Martha’s Vineyard. He knows that the more negative attention he gets, the better liked he is among the Republican base and the more money he can raise for his future political endeavors.\n\nNot covering someone like DeSantis – the governor of a major state and someone with national ambitions – is out of the question.

Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nUS President Joe Biden has called for a network of 500,000 chargers to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles and fight the climate crisis. Electric vehicles have much smaller carbon footprints than gas-powered vehicles over the typical lifetime of a vehicle.\n\nGovernments are increasingly embracing electric vehicles. Biden has called for the federal government to shift its fleet to electric vehicles, and for half of all new vehicles to be electric by 2030. California has passed regulations that essentially require vehicles sold in the state by 2035 to be electric, hydrogen-fueled or plug-in hybrids. The federal government passed new tax credits for electric vehicles last month.\n\nBut many consumers have concerns about if they’ll be able to charge an electric vehicle. The nation’s charging network is nascent compared to the long-established network of gas pumps. Last week the Biden administration announced that it had approved EV charging plans from 35 states. Many stations will be built along highway corridors to facilitate long trips.\n\nThe Joint Office of Energy and Transportation has already advised states on their EV charging plans and worked with the Federal Highway Administration on minimal standards for chargers.\n\nThe Biden administration has called for 40% of its climate change and clean energy investments to flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved and overburdened by pollution.\n\nKlein, who has previously called for the country to reckon with its racial history when it comes to urban planning, owns an electric car and an electric bike, both of which he charges with solar, according to the departments.\n\n“We couldn’t be more excited to have him working for more electric cars and trucks on our roadways,” Secretary of Energy Jennifer M.

But is it a firm decision that I run again? That remains to be seen.”\n\nLet’s say, for the sake of argument, that Biden does decide to run for another term in two years time. The challenge before him will be simple but profound: Prove to the American people that he can campaign all over the country for the entirety of the campaign.\n\nThat’s according to the latest column from The Washington Post’s Megan McArdle, who writes:\n\n“You need only watch video from 10 years ago to see that the president now appears slower than he used to be. That doesn’t mean he’s unfit to be president; he will not be asked to resolve a foreign policy crisis by solving crossword puzzles at high speed. But whether it’s a policy problem, it is a political problem.”\n\nMcArdle’s argument – if I extrapolate it somewhat – goes like this:\n\n1. In the early primary and caucus states where a premium was put on hand-to-hand campaigning, Biden was crushed.\n\n2. He was saved by the endorsement of South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn and the strong support of Black voters in the Palmetto State.\n\n3. After that win in South Carolina, the primary campaign effectively ended because the country went into lockdown over Covid-19.\n\n4. The general election campaign, similarly, wasn’t much of a campaign. Biden held very few in-person events and the ones he did hold were with small numbers of people.\n\n5. By the time the 2024 campaign rolls around, the pandemic will be in the rearview mirror (Biden says it already is) and politics will return to normal again. Which means Biden will have to do something he hasn’t done in years – actively campaign.\n\nAgain, McArdle:\n\n“Whether Republicans nominate Trump or someone else, his opponent is going to be out there on the stump, whipping up voter enthusiasm and proving they have the stamina for the job. If Biden doesn’t follow suit, he will be conceding them an edge — especially since they will not be shy about using that fact to raise questions about his fitness.”\n\nWe know from oodles of polling that there are real and persistent questions among the electorate – including a decent-sized chunk of Democrats – about whether Biden should run again, with his age being a prime driver of those doubts.\n\nWhether you agree with McArdle or not, she raises a provocative and important point: Given Biden’s age and snafus like the one last week involving the late Rep. Jackie Walorski, people are going to be keeping a close eye on how he carries himself as a candidate in 2024.\n\nThe Point: Biden, assuming he runs in 2024, will be 81 years old on the campaign trail – the oldest person to ever seek a second term as president.

And they might be right. But Liz Cheney made it clear in her barn burner of a concession speech that she is not planning to ride off quietly into the sunset; rather, she plans to “do whatever it takes to ensure that Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office, and I mean it.”\n\nArick Wierson Tunheim\n\nNo longer chained to a party whose leaders have abandoned its core values and principles, Cheney is now poised to become the Obi-Wan Kenobi of American politics. Like Kenobi’s famous line in “Star Wars,” “If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine,” uttered moments before he’s killed by Darth Vader, the same can now also be said about Cheney.\n\nBradley Honan c/o Bradley Honan\n\nBut with her rejection from Republican voters in Wyoming comes an unparalleled opportunity for President Joe Biden and the Democrats, and one they should not squander.\n\nAs a conservative with a dynastic last name who, in this hyper-partisan climate, wields uncommon and genuine respect on both sides of the aisle, Cheney would be a valuable addition to the Biden administration. The President should appoint her as a cabinet-level czar on election integrity and the preservation of democracy once her term is up in January. Creating this post would allow her to continue the work she so adroitly began as the co-chair of the January 6th Committee and empower her to fight against the violent and pseudo-autocratic undercurrents that have seeped into conservative politics and pose a real existential threat to our democracy.\n\nWe don’t agree with much, if any, of Cheney’s politics, but at this point, when our democracy is hanging on by a bare thread, principles trump policy, and we commend Cheney for sticking to her guns amid a hail of incoming fire.\n\nSadly, Cheney was one of the last Republicans standing among those who voted to impeach Trump. Regardless what anyone thinks of her political stances, Cheney has displayed courageous leadership in the face of staunch opposition and even threats to her physical safety. She has proven her mettle as an unapologetic defender of democracy and the rule of law.\n\nIn her concession speech on Tuesday, Cheney made no formal commitments about what the future may hold for her beyond her work as co-chair of the January 6th Committee, but her speech left the door wide open for any number of moves down the road.\n\nShe invoked the name of President Abraham Lincoln, a Republican who lost a US Senate bid only a few years before winning the presidency – a move that surely added to already rampant speculation that she too might seek the nation’s highest office.\n\nBut should Trump declare himself a presidential candidate for 2024, a Cheney run in a Republican primary would likely be nothing more than a constant irritant. She would likely use the megaphone that comes with a national profile to blanket the media with strong anti-Trump messaging and truth telling in the hopes of chipping away at the former President’s support among those who might be on the fence about backing him a third time.\n\nBut primarying Trump is not Cheney’s best play. Nor is running as an independent, a move that might actually serve Trump’s interests by splitting the conservative anti-Trump vote. And certainly, what the country does not need is another ex-pol turned TV pundit.\n\nCheney’s smartest move would be to join the Biden administration in a bespoke senior-level role where her mandate is clear: coordinate the fight for free and fair elections and wage all-out war against the anti-American and undemocratic forces that Trumpism has unleashed. Cheney is the ideal crusader in this fight.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nSuch a move by Biden certainly has ample precedent. Both Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama appointed notable Republicans to serve in their Cabinets. The symbolism of bringing members from an opposing party into an administration is a strong signal of bipartisanship, putting the country ahead of party. Placing a high-profile conservative like Cheney in a senior-level position would be a powerful signal to our nation’s shared, bipartisan commitment to the rule of law and the right to free and fair elections.\n\nThis is a perilous time for our democracy, and Biden should recognize that Cheney can be a national force for good by taking the helm of our nation’s fight to push back the dark, homegrown forces and ideologies that threaten our future. It’s clear that, despite her Tuesday night primary defeat, her star continues to shine brightly.\n\nBiden would be well-served to act decisively and harness her star power.", "authors": ["Arick Wierson Bradley Honan", "Arick Wierson", "Bradley Honan"], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/04/nancy-pelosi-china-taiwan-visit/10244249002/", "title": "China halts climate, military talks with US as tensions rise over ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – China said Friday it would suspend talks with the United States on a range of issues and would impose sanctions on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her family as tensions between the two nations escalated over Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan earlier this week.\n\nChina’s Foreign Ministry said it would suspend or cancel dialogue with the U.S. on issues ranging from climate change to military relations and anti-drug efforts. China did not say specifically what sanctions it would levy against Pelosi and her immediate family over what it called her “egregious provocations” in visiting Taiwan, an island that China claims as its own territory.\n\nChina acted because Pelosi visited Taiwan “in disregard of China’s strong opposition and serious representations,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nIn another sign of deteriorating relations between Washington and Beijing, the White House summoned China's ambassador to the White House on Thursday to launch a formal protest over Beijing's recent aggressive actions against Taiwan.\n\nChina on Thursday launched threatening military exercises in six zones just off Taiwan’s coasts that it says will run through Sunday. Missiles also have been fired over Taiwan, defense officials told state media.\n\n\"We condemned (China's) military actions, which are irresponsible, at odds with our long-standing goal of maintaining peace and stability and across the Taiwan Strait,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. \"We made clear to the ambassador that Beijing’s actions are of concern to Taiwan, to us and to our partners around the world.\"\n\nChina has claimed that Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan amounts to an attack by the Biden administration on Chinese sovereignty. The White House has stressed that Pelosi is the head of the legislative branch of government and that it could not stop her visit.\n\nThe White House also has said Pelosi’s visit does not signal a shift in its one-China policy, which acknowledges that Taiwan is part of China.\n\n“China has chosen to overreact and use the speaker’s visit as a pretext to increase provocative military activity in and around the Taiwan Strait,” Kirby told reporters at the White House on Thursday.\n\nIn an effort to ease the tensions, Kirby said the U.S. would postpone intercontinental ballistic missile test scheduled for this week. Kirby said the decision to reschedule the test was intended to demonstrate “the behavior of a responsible nuclear power by reducing the risks of miscalculation and misperception.”\n\nPelosi, the first U.S. speaker to visit Taiwan in 25 years, said in Japan on Friday that China will not be able to isolate Taiwan by preventing U.S. officials from traveling there. The Chinese have tried to isolate Taiwan, Pelosi said, including most recently by preventing it from joining the World Health Organization.\n\n“They may try to keep Taiwan from visiting or participating in other places, but they will not isolate Taiwan by preventing us to travel there,” Pelosi said as she wrapped up a swing across Asia. Pelosi and five other members of Congress arrived in Tokyo late Thursday after visiting Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and South Korea.\n\nChina’s announcement on Friday threatened to accelerate the friction with Washington.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry said dialogue between U.S. and Chinese regional commanders and defense department heads would be canceled, along with talks on military maritime safety.\n\nCooperation on returning illegal immigrants, criminal investigations, transnational crime, illegal drugs and climate change will be suspended, the ministry said.\n\nThe Chinese military exercises launched Thursday involve its navy, air force and other departments and are to last until Sunday. They include missile strikes on targets in the seas north and south of the island in an echo of the last major Chinese military drills in 1995 and 1996 aimed at intimidating Taiwan’s leaders and voters.\n\nTaiwan has put its military on alert and staged civil defense drills, while the U.S. has numerous naval assets in the area. China also flew war planes toward Taiwan and blocked imports of its citrus and fish.\n\n'WE CAME TO TAIWAN TO LISTEN':Pelosi gives strong backing to Taiwan's democracy; US braces for Chinese military drills\n\nEarlier Friday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said that China’s military exercises aimed at Taiwan represent a “grave problem” that threatens regional peace and security after five ballistic missiles launched as part of the drills landed in Japan’s exclusive economic zone.\n\nKishida, speaking after breakfast with Pelosi and her congressional delegation, said the missile launches need to be “stopped immediately.”\n\nJapanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said five missiles landed on Thursday in Japan’s exclusive economic zone off Hateruma, an island far south of Japan’s main islands. He said Japan protested to China, saying the missiles “threatened Japan’s national security and the lives of the Japanese people, which we strongly condemn.”\n\nJapanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, attending a regional meeting in Cambodia, said China’s actions are “severely impacting peace and stability in the region and the international community, and we demand the immediate suspension of the military exercises.”\n\nJapan has in recent years bolstered its defense capability and troop presence in southwestern Japan and remote islands, including Okinawa, which is about 700 kilometers (420 miles) northeast of Taiwan. Many residents say they worry their island will be quickly embroiled in any Taiwan conflict. Okinawa is home to the majority of about 50,000 American troops based in Japan under a bilateral security pact.\n\nSEE THE HISTORIC TRIP:Speaker Nancy Pelosi visits Taiwan amid escalating tensions with China\n\nAt the breakfast earlier Friday, Pelosi and her congressional delegation also discussed their shared security concern over China, North Korea and Russia, and pledged their commitment to working toward peace and stability in Taiwan, Kishida said. Pelosi was also to hold talks with her Japanese counterpart, lower house Speaker Hiroyuki Hosoda.\n\nJapan and its key ally, the U.S., have been pushing for new security and economic frameworks with other democracies in the Indo-Pacific region and Europe as a counter to China’s growing influence amid rising tensions between Beijing and Taipei.\n\nDays before Pelosi’s Taiwan visit, a group of senior Japanese lawmakers, including former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba, visited the island and discussed regional security with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. Ishiba said Japan, while working with the United States to prevent conflict in the Indo-Pacific, wants a defense agreement with Taiwan.\n\nOn Thursday, the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized nations issued a statement saying “there is no justification to use a visit as pretext for aggressive military activity in the Taiwan Strait.” It said China’s “escalatory response risks increasing tensions and destabilizing the region.”\n\nChina cited its displeasure over the statement for the last-minute cancellation of talks between the Chinese and Japanese foreign ministers on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in Cambodia on Thursday.\n\nPelosi held talks on Thursday in South Korea, also a key U.S. ally, which stayed away from the Taiwan issue, apparently to avoid upsetting China, focusing instead on North Korea’s increasing nuclear threat.\n\nIn recent years, South Korea has been struggling to strike a balance between the United States and China as their rivalry has deepened.\n\nThe Biden administration and Pelosi have said the United States remains committed to the so-called one-China policy, which recognizes Beijing as the government of China but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taipei. The administration discouraged but did not prevent Pelosi from visiting.\n\nPelosi has been a long-time advocate of human rights in China. She, along with other lawmakers, visited Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1991 to support democracy two years after a bloody military crackdown on protesters at the square.\n\nAs leader of the House of Representatives, Pelosi’s trip has heightened U.S.-China tensions more than visits by other members of Congress. The last House speaker to visit Taiwan was Newt Gingrich in 1997.\n\nChina and Taiwan, which split in 1949 after a civil war, have no official relations but multibillion-dollar business ties.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/us/five-things-august-31-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for August 31: Mar-a-Lago, Flooding, Heat waves ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Liz Cheney was decided Tuesday after Wyoming voters ousted her from her House seat. “This primary election is over, but now the real work begins,” Cheney said, delivering scathing remarks about former President Donald Trump, after losing to Trump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman. In her concession speech, Cheney vowed to continue to fight the former President’s election lies and steer the GOP away from his influence. Since the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol, Cheney has become the Republican Party’s most forceful critic of Trump and has helped lead the House select committee investigating the Capitol riot. She is the eighth of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump to now exit the House. Separately, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska is squaring off in the first of what’s likely to be two rounds against the Trump-endorsed Kelly Tshibaka. Former Gov. Sarah Palin, meanwhile, is attempting a political comeback in a special election for the state’s lone House seat.\n\n2. January 6\n\nThe committee investigating the Capitol Hill insurrection on January 6, 2021, has added an unexpected public hearing today. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and a witness to many critical events and conversations, is expected to testify publicly later today, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Hutchinson’s live testimony would mark a significant moment in the committee’s series of hearings as she has long been considered one of its most consequential witnesses who can speak to former President Donald Trump’s reaction to the Capitol riot. The announcement of the hearing – which will start at 1 p.m. ET – came as a surprise as the committee had said it was not going to resume its hearings until mid-July.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\n3.

Aerial footage of the crash showed the train toppled to the side as authorities responded to the scene. Preliminary reports indicate the incident happened at an uncontrolled intersection – without warning lights or motion gates – where a gravel road crossed the railroad tracks southwest of town.

Ukraine\n\nWhite House officials are losing confidence that Ukraine will ever be able to take back all of the land it has lost to Russia over the past four months of war, US officials told CNN, even with the more sophisticated weaponry the US and its allies plan to send. The officials emphasized that this more pessimistic assessment does not mean the US plans to pressure Ukraine into making any formal territorial concessions to Russia in order to end the war. There is also hope that Ukrainian forces will be able to take back significant chunks of territory in a likely counteroffensive later this year. Separately, Ukraine has requested a meeting of the UN Security Council today to discuss the Russian strike on a shopping mall as the death toll rose to at least 18. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the attack “one of the most defiant terrorist acts in European history.”\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nMeet Mr. Happy Face, the ‘World’s Ugliest Dog’\n\nA woman used her smartwatch to call 911 after getting stuck in an interesting position at the gym.

Ukrainian officials said last week that they have shot down more than 300 Iranian drones.\n\nThis new expected shipment would mark a significant increase in Iranian support to Russia’s war effort. While the precise timing of when the shipment will arrive in Russia is unclear, officials believe the weapons will definitely be delivered before the end of the year.\n\nDrones have played a significant role in the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, but their use has increased since the summer, when the United States and Kyiv say Moscow acquired drones from Iran. In recent weeks these Iranian drones have been used to target critical energy infrastructure in Ukraine.\n\nThe Iranian drones are known as a “loitering munition” because they are capable of circling for some time in an area identified as a potential target and only striking once an enemy asset is identified.\n\nThey are small, portable and can be easily launched, but their main advantage is that they are hard to detect and can be fired from a distance.\n\nThe US has also alleged that Iran has sent military personnel to Crimea to assist Russian drone attacks on Ukrainian targets.\n\nSending further Iranian weaponry to Russia is a move that will likely cause relations with the US to further deteriorate. On Monday, the US envoy to Iran Rob Malley said the Biden administration is not going to “waste our time” on talks to revive the nuclear deal “if nothing’s going to happen.” Tehran’s support for Russia in the Ukraine war and its crackdown on nationwide protests prompted by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September have prompted the US to impose further sanctions on Iran.\n\nEarlier this month John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the National Security Council, said the presence of Iranian personnel was evidence of Tehran’s direct engagement in the conflict.\n\n“We can confirm that Russian military personnel that are based in Crimea have been piloting Iranian UAVs, using them to conduct strikes across Ukraine, including strikes against Kyiv,” Kirby said, referring to unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nMalley spoke out strongly against Iran supplying the drones on Monday.\n\n“We know that those drones have been used to target civilians and civilian infrastructure. And we know that Iran, in the face of all of this evidence, keeps lying and denying that it’s happening,” Malley said.\n\nOn Monday a senior US defense official said they didn’t have any information to provide on the suggestion Iran is preparing to send missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine.\n\nOn Tuesday a Pentagon spokesman said the US has “concerns” that Russia may “seek to acquire additional advanced munition capabilities from Iran,” Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters during a briefing on Tuesday.\n\n“We do have concerns that Russia may also seek to acquire additional advanced munition capabilities from Iran, for example surface-to-surface missiles, to use in Ukraine,” Ryder said.\n\nYuriy Ihnat, spokesperson for Ukraine’s Air Force Command, said on Tuesday that Ukraine currently has “no effective defense against these (surface-to-surface) missiles. It is theoretically possible to shoot them down, but it is very difficult to do it with the means we currently have.”\n\nThe Iranian mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment about the new expected shipment. Iran has previously denied supplying Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine, saying it “has not and will not” do so.\n\nThe Washington Post was first to report Iran’s plans to send missiles and additional drones to Russia.\n\nThe US is “looking at everything that we can do, not just with sanctions” in order to disrupt the Iranian weaponry from going to Russia, Secretary of State Tony Blinken said last week. He said that the US is “trying to break up these networks.”\n\nBut it is unclear if the US will be able to prohibit further shipments from going ahead, even as concerns mount about Iranians sending even more advanced weaponry to Russia.\n\nUS officials have also said that they are aware of discussions about additional Iranian weaponry to Russia that has not yet been delivered.\n\nLast month the US sanctioned an air transportation provider for its involvement in the shipment of the Iranian drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to Russia. The US is also ready to “target producers and procurers” contributing to the UAV program, the Treasury Department’s Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence said.\n\nThe question of longevity and sustainability remains because it is unclear how long Iran can or would continue providing weaponry – including more advanced missiles – to Russia.", "authors": ["Kylie Atwood"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/17/economy/retail-sales-july-inflation/index.html", "title": "US consumers continue to spend, but rising inflation has shifted their ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWith lower gas prices effectively putting more money back in their pockets, Americans continued to spend last month. But persistent inflation has reshaped their shopping habits.\n\nIn July, US retail sales were flat compared to the previous month, the Census Bureau reported Wednesday. That marks a slowdown from June, when retail sales rose by a revised 0.8% over the month.\n\nSpending at gas stations fell by 1.8% month over month, reflecting the recent drop in gas prices, while spending at grocery stores rose 0.2% for the month.\n\n“[American shoppers] are clearly spending money on consumables and basics at the expense of some discretionary merchandise,” said Sarah Henry, portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management.\n\nConsumers have no choice but to buy essentials like groceries and gas, although they may switch to cheaper brands or change how frequently they buy, said Kayla Bruun, economic analyst at decision intelligence company Morning Consult. “It’s really those discretionary goods we’re seeing a lot of cutback on, particularly among those lower- and middle-income groups,” she said. Retail sales at department stores, for example, dropped in the month of July and were also lower on a year-over-year basis.\n\nEven wealthier Americans are being impacted by the highest inflation in 40 years: Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Tuesday on the company’s investor call that higher prices were contributing to an influx of higher-income shoppers at the discount store.\n\n“We expect inflation to continue to influence the choices that families make,” McMillon said.\n\nHigher prices on food and gas impact lower-income households to a greater degree, because they must spend a larger share of their earnings for these necessary purchases, said Mike Rittler, head of retail card services at TD Bank.\n\n“It’s kind of a double whammy – you have less coming in, more going out. It really makes for challenging times,” he said, noting that the amount of debt people are carrying on their credit cards has been creeping up. The Federal Reserve said earlier this month that consumers added $40.1 billion worth of debt to their balance sheets in June.\n\nThe July data also showed that sales at home improvement stores rose by 1.5% over the month and by 10.1% from a year ago – as corroborated by recent earnings in this sector. Home Depot said Tuesday it had record sales in the most recent quarter, and that although the number of transactions ticked down by 3%, people spent about 9% more when they did make purchases. Lowe’s missed on expectations for same-store sales, but beat analyst estimates for earnings.\n\n“It speaks to the wealth effect of consumers who own homes,” Henry said.\n\nIncreasingly, experts worry that the divide between homeowners and renters is further driving economic inequality, as concerns grow that lower income households are losing more ground the longer inflation remains entrenched and prices for everything from groceries to rent keep rising.\n\nFor example, homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages are insulated from rising rents and are “not necessarily having to bear that burden of higher housing prices,” Bruun said, noting that lower-income adults are more likely to be renters, not homeowners.\n\n“There’s reasons to be optimistic, but also reasons to be concerned. Inflation still is really high, even if it’s slowing down,” Bruun said. “That’s a really long time for consumers to be living with these elevated prices.”", "authors": ["Martha C.

Theron Stokes, associate executive director of AEA, said doctors should be aware of the guidelines and follow them. “When students return to school having not completed the entire 14-day quarantine period, they are placing their fellow students and their schools’ employees at risk.

In some cases, such as for individuals with disabilities who cannot tolerate a mask, face shields will be allowed unless wearing one would be impossible, the order says. Masks are to be worn by school-age children older than 5, those who exercise or work at gyms, and athletes, players, coaches and officials who participate in organized sports, according to the municipality directives.

State Department of Health Services officials said the latest figures increase Arizona’s totals to 259,264 cases and 6,164 known deaths since the coronavirus pandemic began.

The state’s previous one-day high came Thursday, when it reported 1,548 new cases. On Saturday the department reported 1,598 new cases and 12 additional deaths for totals of 120,828 cases and 2,068 deaths since the pandemic began. The department reported 722 hospitalizations, 16 more than Friday’s then-record high. “Today’s numbers show we are not in a good position as we head into the colder months,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Friday. “I ask all Arkansans to take this virus seriously and to take necessary precautions. Our number of new cases is growing at a rate that worries me in terms of our hospital capacity.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: Republican former U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa was victorious Saturday in his race to return to Congress, where he once headed the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and became a GOP favorite for launching a string of investigations of the Obama administration. The former nine-term congressman and ardent supporter of President Donald Trump trailed early in the San Diego-area 50th District. But as more votes were counted after Election Day, he overtook Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar. The latest vote count update gave him about 54% of the votes and a 23,000-vote lead. Issa already had declared victory in a statement posted to social media Friday night. Campa-Najjar, a 31-year-old former Obama administration official, was making his second bid for the seat. He received more votes than he did in 2018 and thanked his supporters for “giving a Latino-Arab American a chance to do something special.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: City officials are urging residents to stay home between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. in an effort to stem the tide of coronavirus cases, which could overwhelm area hospitals by the end of the year. Mayor Michael Hancock said during a virtual news conference Friday that the “Home by 10 Order,” which will last for at least 30 days, is necessary to avoid another citywide stay-at-home order. He also urged residents not to gather or mix with other households. “I’m not going to mince any words here when it comes to the spread of the coronavirus,” Hancock said. “We’re on a very dangerous path. We’re seeing rapid, significant increases in the numbers of people getting sick, and many of those people ended up in the hospital.” The mayor shied away from calling the order a curfew because he said enforcement would only target the most egregious violations – not, for instance, someone walking their dog or going for a run after 10 p.m.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: Several colleges and universities have added new restrictions for students as coronavirus cases continue to rise in the state. Quinnipiac University announced it is instituting a two-week quarantine after recording 155 positive tests on campus since Wednesday. The quarantine means residential students must stay in their rooms, except to pick up takeout meals from the dining hall, and students living off campus can only return for testing. Students in isolation who have tested positive for the coronavirus will have meals delivered to their rooms each night. At Yale University, students residing in Davenport, Hopper, and Saybrook Colleges were ordered to quarantine because of positive coronavirus tests. In Fairfield, Sacred Heart and Fairfield universities have instituted curfews. The state reported Friday that 22 more people were hospitalized with COVID-19, bringing the total to 402, the highest total in five months.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: For the Rehoboth Beach Film Society, the show (or shows) must go on. The 23rd annual Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival is taking place as scheduled this month with a few modifications for health concerns. Only five films will be shown inside the society’s Cinema Art Theater, with 10 more available to stream at home. “We had the opportunity to carry out this event with the safety of our viewers as a priority,” said Rehoboth Beach Film Society Executive Director Sue Early. “They can watch films at home this year. It’s not the same experience, but there’s some great films to see. And in our theater, we could be showing at 60%, and we’re only going to use 30 out of 104 seats, which is just under 29%. They are well-spaced and cleaned after every screening. So it’s really safe.” Tickets are on sale now for the festival, which runs Nov. 5-15.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Hundreds of people gathered on the campus of Howard University on Saturday to celebrate their sister Kamala Harris after her announcement as vice president-elect, WUSA-TV reports. “When you come to Howard University, that is a very distinct choice,” said Niambi Carter, associate professor of political science at Howard University. “You are choosing a legacy and a lineage that is great in so many aspects.” A large group of Alpha chapter members of Alpha Kappa Alpha gathered in front of the sorority’s plot on the yard to cheer for Harris’ election. “I’m so proud of Kamala, and I’m so proud to stand on the grounds where she walked,” alumna Kenya Sumner said. Harris graduated from Howard with a degree in political science and economics in 1986, the same year she became a member of the Alpha chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first historically black sorority, founded on Howard’s campus.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrange Park: Eight weeks after being admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, Henry Bell and his longtime fiancee decided the time was right for a wedding. So the day before his anticipated release from the inpatient rehab center at Orange Park Medical Center, Bell, 63, and Antionette Brown, 48, said their vows in the parking lot Thursday. Brown’s uncle performed the ceremony. “His condition was deadly,” Brown said. “We decided to do it now because we feel they (the hospital staff) are like family and wanted to share the life they gave us back.” Bell was admitted to the hospital Sept. 13 and immediately put on a ventilator. Brown and the couple’s seven grown children could only wait and hope for his condition to improve. He spent weeks in intensive care. He entered the hospital’s rehab center Sunday, and his recovery has included learning how to walk again.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Athens-Clarke County plans to rent space for jury trials and grand jury proceedings. Grand juries and trials have been on hold in the state since March 14, when state Supreme Court Chief Justice Harold Melton declared a statewide judicial emergency because of the coronavirus threat. In subsequent renewal orders, Melton amended them to allow for court proceedings if they could be conducted safely. The best option for holding court proceedings in Athens-Clarke County is by using the Classic Center, said a committee tasked with deciding the issue. The county will pay the Classic Center up to $350,815 to rent space for the proceedings. The price Athens-Clarke will pay includes daily cleaning of the rooms used for trial proceedings, including space to conduct actual trials and a jury deliberation room. The $350,815 amount is based on the cost of 30 jury trials that last an average of five days each.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Land and Natural Resources reopened a popular scenic spot on Oahu that has been closed to visitors since the outbreak of the coronavirus. The Nuuanu Pali State Wayside, popularly known as Pali Lookout, was closed to the public at the outset of the pandemic because of budgetary constraints and crowding concerns. There were challenges in maintaining physical distancing at the lookout, State Parks Administrator Curt Cottrell said. Officials announced the park, which is among the most visited spots on Oahu, reopened Wednesday with daily hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The gates to the park’s access roads will be unlocked and secured daily by the Honolulu Police Department. The state set new parking fees of $7 per vehicle for nonresidents. Hawaii residents are not subject to parking and entry fees at any state parks. Tour buses are largely absent from the lookout, making the volume of visitors much lower.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A state panel of medical experts is asking the governor for a statewide mask mandate, and hospitals are running out of space for COVID-19 patients, after a week marked with record numbers of new cases and deaths. At least 671 Idaho residents have died from the coronavirus, and a record high of 1,290 new COVID-19 cases were reported on Wednesday alone, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, followed by 1,265 new cases Thursday. More than 69,500 residents have been confirmed to have the illness since the pandemic began. Idaho hospitals have reported more than 200 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 every day since Oct. 12. On Nov. 2, the most recent data available, there were nearly 300 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Jeanie Gentry, CEO of Steele Memorial Medical Center in Salmon, told the Idaho Statesman the facility is short about 40% of its staffers because they’ve been exposed or sickened.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has tested negative for the coronavirus after learning he may have been exposed during a meeting to someone who tested positive. Members of Pritzker’s staff who attended the meeting last Monday also tested negative for the virus, his office said Saturday in a news release. Pritzker had self-isolated Friday while awaiting test results. They were the second negative test results for Pritzker and staff members who also underwent weekly tests Wednesday, according to his office. Meanwhile, 12,438 newly confirmed and probable cases of the virus and another 76 deaths were reported Saturday by the Illinois Department of Public Health. More than 10,370 new cases and 49 deaths were reported Friday. Illinois has had nearly 478,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 10,150 deaths since the start of the pandemic.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: The University of Notre Dame’s Faculty Senate formally expressed disappointment in the school president’s failure to wear a face mask at a White House event days before he tested positive for the coronavirus. The Faculty Senate voted 29-13 on Thursday for a resolution expressing disappointment in the Rev. John Jenkins’ failure to wear a mask and practice social distancing at a Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett, a Notre Dame law professor confirmed last month as a U.S. Supreme Court justice. The Faculty Senate was originally expected to vote on a no confidence resolution, but that was amended. Jenkins tested positive for the coronavirus days after the Rose Garden ceremony, where President Donald Trump introduced Barrett as his nominee to the high court. Jenkins was seen without a mask, and he shook hands and sat shoulder-to-shoulder with others.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State prison officials reported Friday that a coronavirus outbreak has infected nearly half of the inmates at a prison in Anamosa. Testing last week revealed 476 inmates among 985 at the prison tested positive for the virus, said Cord Overton, a spokesman for the Iowa Department of Corrections. A report provided by the department indicates 37 staff members also tested positive. Across the nine institutions the department manages, 601 inmates were infected as of Friday afternoon. The report shows coronavirus has been active in the prison system since testing began in March with more than 21,000 tests administered to inmates. It said 1,252 inmates have recovered, an indication they have at one time tested positive but are no longer symptomatic are believed to be contagious. Four Iowa inmates have died during the pandemic, the report said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state saw most of a projected budget shortfall melt away Friday with a fiscal forecast that is less pessimistic about the economy and tax collections than a dire estimate issued this spring during a statewide lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic. The forecasting group boosted the state’s forecast for tax collections by $463 million, or 6.3%, for the 2021 budget year that began July 1. The group also issued its first calculations for the 2022 budget year that starts in July 2021, and while the forecast predicts a drop in tax collections of 2.1%, or $166 million, that’s due largely to the end of a temporary, pandemic-induced move to help income taxpayers. The Legislature’s nonpartisan research staff now projects a $153 million budget shortfall for the state’s 2022 budget year, an amount that almost can be covered by an internal shuffling of government funds that Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly already has proposed.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s bar and restaurant operators are getting a break from alcoholic beverage renewal fees in a cost-saving step as they struggle with revenue losses from the pandemic. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is granting a 12-month fee renewal waiver to license holders, Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday. Bar and restaurant operators who haven’t submitted the renewal fee this year won’t have to pay until 2021, he said. Those who have paid this year will have their fees waived in 2021, he said. “This has certainly been a difficult year for our bars, restaurants and venues, and they deserve this innovative support as we face what could be a very painful winter,” Beshear said. Bars and restaurants have endured capacity limitations to help contain the coronavirus. The fee waiver doesn’t apply to producers, distributors, wholesalers and others able to continue operations throughout the virus-related state of emergency.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: In response to complaints that family and clergy were barred from hospitals and nursing homes amid the coronavirus pandemic, legislators have rewritten state laws to lessen visitation restrictions during public health emergencies. The bills passed unanimously in the special session that ended last month and were signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. They still will give discretion to the Louisiana Department of Health to decide just how wide-open the visitation can be and what safety protections will have to be followed. One measure by Sen. Robert Mills, a Minden Republican, calls on the health department to create rules requiring inpatient health care facilities to allow pastors, priests and other members of the clergy to visit patients during a public health emergency, if the patient asks for the visit.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Officials on Friday recommended caution at more schools in the state because of the rise in coronavirus cases. The state uses a color-coded system to categorize the level of precaution schools should use. The administration of Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said it’s adding schools in Knox County and Franklin County to the “yellow” category, which is an intermediate level. Those counties join Somerset and Washington counties in the yellow category. All other counties in the state are in the “green” category, the lowest level, though officials said they’re closely monitoring schools in Waldo and Kennebec counties. The state recommends that schools located in counties in the yellow category consider hybrid instruction models to reduce the number of people in schools and classrooms. The change in category for some schools came as cases surged around the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city is tightening restrictions on restaurants and indoor and outdoor gatherings in response to rising cases of the coronavirus, Mayor Bernard “Jack” Young announced Friday. The changes will take effect Thursday at 5 p.m. Young said numbers of people in restaurants, religious facilities, theaters and malls will be limited to 25% capacity. Young said food service establishments must close indoor dining at 10 p.m. Bars that don’t have a license to sell food will be closed. “I am instituting these restrictions for the public health and to save lives in Baltimore city,” Young said. Also, the city’s health commissioner revised an order to require masks to be worn in public at all times, whether people are inside or outside. Dr. Letitia Dzirasa’s order is effective immediately. “Over the past month Baltimore city has seen our data trends move in the wrong direction,” she said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State officials on Friday urged more schools to return to full, in-person instruction, saying that only communities with the highest COVID-19 rates should be using any form of remote learning. Under previous guidance, schools were told to shift among remote learning, in-person learning or a mix of the two depending on their area’s infection rate. Areas with moderate spread were advised to use remote or hybrid learning, while only those with the lowest rates were encouraged to bring students back full time. But speaking at a news conference, Gov. Charlie Baker said there’s growing evidence that schools are not a significant source of spread and that keeping students at home hurts their learning and mental health. “We continue to see too many communities with children learning in remote-only models,” he said. “We all know that losing a week, a month, a quarter or more in the life of a kid’s education has real consequences.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Joe Biden reclaimed the Wolverine State for Democrats with a surge of support in urban regions like Detroit and Grand Rapids, offsetting high turnout in rural and exurban areas for President Donald Trump. Biden’s 146,000-vote margin, 2.7 percentage points, was powered by gains in big, vote-rich counties such as Oakland near Detroit and Kent, which includes Grand Rapids – amid a record 5.5 million people casting ballots statewide. Biden won Oakland by 14 points, besting Hillary Clinton’s 8-point edge in 2016. He carried Kent by almost 6 points after Trump netted it by 3 points four years ago. Trump again won traditional bellwether Macomb County outside Detroit, by roughly 8 points – less than his 11-point margin in 2016, however. Biden became just the second Democratic presidential candidate to carry Kent in more than 50 years, after Barack Obama did it in his first run.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: COVID-19 is sweeping across the state at an unprecedented pace, breaking records for new cases and daily deaths and raising concerns about the ability of hospitals to keep up. The Star Tribune reports Saturday’s tally of 4,647 new cases – a figure that would have easily set a record during the first eight months of the pandemic – wasn’t even close to the biggest single-day count of the past week. For the seven-day period ending Saturday, Minnesota reported more than 25,000 new COVID-19 cases, or more than 10% of the state’s cases since March. The Minnesota Department of Health reported another 34 deaths Saturday, bringing the week’s total to 168, the second-highest one-week count since the start of the pandemic. Hospitals, meanwhile, are scrambling to treat more COVID-19 patients even as the virus threatens to sideline more health care workers.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Health has been working around the clock to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Now, the agency will be responsible for starting a statewide medical marijuana program within the next nine months. Uncertified election results showed 74% of Mississippi voters approved the ballot measure that allows doctors to prescribe up to 5 ounces of marijuana per month for people who have at least one of more than 20 serious medical conditions. “This vote shows minds are changing,” said Jaqueline Temple Rudder, a homemaker from Madison County who lost her father-in-law to cancer and voted for Initiative 65. “We don’t want our sick suffering.” Both Gov. Tate Reeves and state’s top health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, opposed the initiative. Officials with the Department of Health will have until August to begin licensing treatment centers and certifying eligible patients.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Local health departments in the state don’t have enough staffers to conduct contact tracing for all the COVID-19 cases popping up, so they have been prioritizing the ones they try to trace back to their sources, officials said. The state’s rate of positive tests over the past two weeks is more than double the national average, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Larry Jones, who heads the Missouri Center for Public Health Excellence, said local health departments are struggling to keep up with contact tracing, which helps determine how a disease is spreading. Missouri on Sunday reported 4,131 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and three more deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Missouri has risen over the past two weeks, from about 1,789 new cases per day Oct. 24 to about 3,126 as of Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A nursing facility in Butte has reported 10 COVID-19-related deaths in less than two weeks, and Gallatin County on Friday enacted stricter measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. Montana has hit a record for hospitalizations, and the confirmed number of infection cases was closing in on 38,000, state officials said. The state health department confirmed 986 more cases of COVID-19 on Friday, bringing the total for the past week to 6,040, or an average of 863 cases per day. Over the previous week, the daily average was 779. Montana has reported 418 deaths, which may not include all 10 deaths tied to the outbreak at the Continental Care & Rehabilitation nursing facility in Butte. The Gallatin County health board on Friday said bars, restaurants and casinos must close by 10 p.m. instead of 12:30 a.m. They must also limit group sizes at tables to six adults plus children who are with a parent or guardian.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to report record numbers of new coronavirus cases and people hospitalized with the virus. Health officials said the surge in cases over the past month continued Friday with 2,681 new cases and 748 people hospitalized with the virus. Both those were new records, and the state’s rate of new cases was the seventh-highest in the nation. The state said 27 new deaths were reported Friday to give Nebraska 701 deaths. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has increased over the past two weeks from 836.71 new cases per day Oct. 23 to 1,408.86 new cases per day Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Also Friday, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said nine more staff members had tested positive for the virus to give it a total of 225 staff members who have been diagnosed with the virus. The department said the ill staffers are all isolating themselves at home.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Democrats successfully won reelection in the swing state’s two battleground congressional districts. First-term Rep. Susie Lee won reelection to a second term by defeating former professional wrestler Dan Rodimer in the 3rd District. Republicans believed the Las Vegas-area district offered them their best chance at unseating an incumbent. Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford was reelected in the state’s other battleground district, defeating Republican former Assemblyman Jim Marchant. Lee and Horsford’s victories cement a six-year hold on Nevada’s swing districts, which Democrats have won in the three most recent elections, and helps Democrats hoping maintain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, where many races remain too early to call with votes left to be counted. The result sends Nevada’s existing delegation back to Washington, D.C.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth-Hitchcock is again putting strict limits on visitors to its hospitals and outpatient clinics in response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Effective Friday, visitors are banned under most circumstances. Limited exceptions will be made for pediatric patients, women giving birth, patients at the end of life and those in a few other circumstances. The return to more restrictive policies applies to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon as well as the health system’s outpatient clinics and facilities. Officials said their decision was based on the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in both New Hampshire and Vermont. Meanwhile, the state’s court system said it is suspending in-person hearings for a few days after Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Day to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday named his associate counsel to lead the commission that will oversee the state’s new recreational marijuana marketplace. Dianna Houenou, who serves as legal counsel to Murphy’s administration, will chair the Cannabis Regulatory Commission. Before working in Murphy’s administration, Houenou was policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union in New Jersey. Murphy, a Democrat, made the announcement just days after New Jersey voters approved a constitutional amendment legalizing recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. The amendment goes into effect at the start of next year and calls for state regulators to set up a marketplace for the legal sale of the drug. It’s unclear when marijuana will be ready to hit retail shelves in the state. Advocates for legalization said the soonest they expect it could happen toward the end of 2021.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State officials have the power to impose civil penalties when enforcing public health orders that call for businesses to restrict their operations amid a public health emergency, the state Supreme Court said Friday. The unanimous written opinion details the legal reasoning for an oral decision made by the court in August in a case brought by businesses that challenged health orders issued as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had petitioned the court to resolve the dispute. Lujan Grisham has warned that more restrictions could be imposed as early as this week as infections, hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase. She also said she has been disappointed in enforcement, pointing to businesses and country clubs in Albuquerque and elsewhere that hosted Halloween parties despite the ban on gatherings.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Restrictions in some New York City pandemic hot spots will be rolled back, even as the state prepares to combat coronavirus flare-ups upstate, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday. The governor said he’s considering imposing additional social distancing restrictions in “microcluster” zones in the Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse areas because of rising infection rates. The addition of more of those zones upstate reflect the shifting state strategy as COVID-19 becomes a worsening problem beyond New York City, once an epicenter of the pandemic. The governor also said the National Guard will increase its presence at airports to help make sure travelers from non-neighboring states can provide proof of a negative coronavirus test. “In general, downstate New York is doing better than upstate New York, which is a total reversal from the first phase of COVID,” Cuomo said during a telephone briefing.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republicans pressed state election officials Friday to make public more information about the number of outstanding ballots from last week’s election that could be counted. Nearly a dozen Election Day races in North Carolina, including those for president and U.S. Senate, remained too early to call because as many as 172,000 ballots had either yet to be counted or rejected, or could trickle in before this week’s deadline to receive mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day. The actual number of ballots that will arrive is likely to be less, however, because many people who requested absentee ballots ended up voting on Election Day or perhaps didn’t vote at all. And past elections show a significant portion of the 41,000 provisional ballots cast Tuesday will be rejected.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A child with COVID-19 has been confirmed to have a rare condition that causes inflammation in different parts of the body, state health officials said Friday. The child, who was discharged from the hospital and is resting at home, is the first confirmed case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in the state. “This development is an unfortunate reminder that COVID-19 can impact people of any age, even children,” Dr. Joan Connell, Department of Health field medical officer and pediatrician, said in a statement. “The best way to help prevent your child from getting MIS-C is to take action to avoid exposure to the COVID-19 virus and teach your child how to do the same.” MIS-C – short for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children – can inflame the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs. Children with it have experienced persistent fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes and fatigue. Long-term effects are unknown.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The number of coronavirus cases in the state has continued to spike despite pleas from the governor for people to help slow the spread. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Ohio has risen over the past two weeks from 2,084 new cases per day Oct. 22 to 3,748 new cases per day Thursday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in the state has also risen over the past two weeks from 4.96% on Oct. 22 to 7.93% on Thursday, according to the tracking hub. The Health Department on Friday reported 5,008 probable and confirmed cases, another daily record high. Ohio has reported more than 240,000 probable and confirmed cases to date, including 5,494 deaths. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday that he planned to announce additional measures soon to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of newly reported coronavirus cases in the state Saturday more than doubled the previous one-day record, and the Department of Health said a backlog of cases and possibly duplicate reporting were the reason. There were 4,741 new cases, bringing the total to 136,492 since the pandemic began, the department said. The previous one-day record of 2,101 new cases was recorded Thursday as cases in the state have surged in recent weeks. “We have reason to believe that our normal case count would have continued on an upward trajectory without the backlog and duplication,” which is due to a transition from a manual to electronic reporting system, according to a health department statement. In a statement, Gov. Kevin Stitt called on residents to wash hands often, socially distance and voluntarily wear masks at indoor public places.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Following a record-breaking day of COVID-19 cases in the state, officials announced new restrictions Friday that will be implemented in at least five of the state’s counties as part of a two-week pause on social activities. The updated safety measures, which begin Wednesday, include halting visitations to long-term care facilities, reducing the capacity of indoor dining at restaurants to 50 people, encouraging all businesses to mandate working from home, and urging Oregonians not to gather with people who do not live in their household – but if they do to limit it to six people. If people have multiple get-togethers, which is discouraged, it should be the same social circle of six people. “Let me be clear, we cannot allow this disease to continue to spread so rapidly in our communities. Lives are at stake,” Gov. Kate Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Bail has been set at $750,000 each for two men authorities said were armed with loaded handguns when they were arrested near the city’s convention center where votes were being counted. Joshua Macias, 42, and Antonio LaMotta, 61, traveled from the Virginia Beach, Virginia, area in a Hummer and did not have permits to carry the weapons in Pennsylvania, police said. They were charged with carrying a concealed firearm without a license and carrying a firearm on a public street. The men were stopped Thursday about a block from the vehicle, Macias with a .40-caliber Beretta handgun inside his jacket and LaMotta with a 9 mm Beretta in a holster, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. An AR-style rifle and ammunition were found inside the vehicle, Outlaw said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: Protesters gathered near a prison that houses federal detainees Friday, denouncing the facility’s contract with U.S. immigration authorities and pointing to a surge in coronavirus infections among detainees. Demonstrators blocked roads leading to the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, where authorities say more than 150 detainees have tested positive for COVID-19. Activists have repeatedly called for Wyatt’s closure, saying conditions are subpar. The publicly owned but privately operated lockup has about 540 inmates in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In April, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal class-action lawsuit seeking the release of dozens of detainees, saying the virus was spreading “uncontrollably.” More than two dozen detainees subsequently were freed.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two days after his opponent proclaimed victory in South Carolina’s 1st District, freshman U.S. House Rep. Joe Cunningham conceded defeat Friday, saying he was proud of the work he had done in his single term in Congress and pledging to continue to work toward bipartisan progress as a private citizen. Standing in front of the U.S. Customs House in Charleston, Cunningham told supporters that he had called Republican Nancy Mace to offer support and congratulations. “She’s now my representative,” Cunningham said. “I’m rooting for her.” The Associated Press called the race for Mace early Wednesday morning, but Cunningham did not concede, citing scanning issues with absentee ballots in one of the district’s counties. In her victory, Mace, 42, becomes the first Republican woman elected to Congress in South Carolina and only the second-ever woman from the state elected to a full House term.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: More than 100 state residents have died of complications due to the coronavirus in the first eight days of November, health officials said Sunday. The Department of Health confirmed 13 deaths in the past day, for a total of 111 this month and 536 since the start of the pandemic. The overall death count is the 24th-highest per capita in the country in the past two weeks, Johns Hopkins University researchers said. The state reported 1,426 positive tests for COVID-19 since Saturday. South Dakota ranks second in the country behind North Dakota in the number of new cases per capita in the past two weeks. The top five counties with the most cases per capita in that time are Bon Homme, Dewey, Buffalo, Potter and Sanborn, according to the COVID Tracking Project. There are 546 people being treated in hospitals in the state, up 31 in the past day. Of those, 96 are in intensive care units, and 69 are using ventilators.\n\nTennessee\n\nJohnson City: Health officials in northeastern Tennessee say they do not have enough nurses to combat COVID-19 inside the region’s hospital system. “There are no longer enough nurses to fill the need that we have,” Ballad Health Senior Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer Lisa Smithgall told WJHL-TV. According to Ballad Health, the hospital system is looking to hire 350 registered nurses to fill its nurse shortage. “In the last eight weeks, we’ve had more than 900 patients admitted to COVID-19,” said Ballad Health Chief Administrative Officer Eric Deaton. After hitting 200 inpatients last week, the health care system has adjusted its COVID-19 surge plan to receive 300 inpatients. “These numbers represent lives; they’re non-encouraging,” Deaton said. “In fact, it’s really becoming a tragedy in the increased rates that we’re seeing.”\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: A district judge on Friday upheld an order from El Paso County’s top elected official shutting down businesses while the region fights an alarming surge in COVID-19 cases. The decision from Judge Bill Moody of El Paso’s 34th District Court came as federal military medical teams deployed to the border region at the request of the state. The county’s top elected official, El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, ordered a two-week shutdown of nonessential activities late last month. In making his decision, Moody pointed out that during the Spanish flu pandemic in the early part of the 20th century, city and county elected officials had authority to respond as they “thought was necessary to protect the health and financial interests of their individual communities.” Chris Hilton, an attorney with the Texas attorney general’s office, said the state would appeal.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s largest teachers union called for the governor to move all public secondary schools in high coronavirus transmission areas to remote learning Friday as the state reported a single-day record of 17 COVID-19 deaths. The Utah Education Association also called for Republican Gov. Gary Herbert to suspend all extracurricular activities that can’t comply with social distancing guidelines in high transmission areas from the Thanksgiving holiday throughout winter break. “We are now seeing multiple schools repeatedly shift back and forth from in-person to at-home learning due to outbreaks,” the union wrote in a statement. “This cycle is obviously not helping to control the virus spread and, as educators, we can unequivocally state the continual interruptions are not in the best interest of student learning.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Republican Gov. Phil Scott said Friday that comments by President Donald Trump casting doubts on the integrity of the election process are hurting society. Scott said all legal votes cast in the 2020 election need to be counted, including mail-in votes. Scott’s comments came a day after President Donald Trump made baseless claims of fraud in the ballot-counting process for the presidential election. Scott said that the president’s comments are “inciting a lot of rhetoric” and that many of his followers take him at his word. “I don’t believe any of the statements he made last night are true, and I do believe it is hurting our society and our ability to work together,” Scott said. After voting Tuesday, he said he had cast his presidential ballot for former Vice President Joe Biden. He said he had never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate before but had to put “country over party.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Freshman Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger has kept her seat in a competitive congressional race in the Richmond suburbs. The former CIA operations officer defeated Republican challenger and state House delegate Nick Freitas in a close race that was called Sunday. Spanberger is considered one of Congress’ more moderate Democrats and was part of a wave of women who helped Democrats retake the U.S. House in 2018. But Freitas had tried to tie Spanberger to her party’s leadership and said it was out of sync with constituents. Spanberger spent nearly a decade with the CIA, working on counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation cases. She is one of two moderate Virginia Democrats who held on to U.S. House seats they flipped from red to blue two years ago, as Democrats’ strength in the Old Dominion continues to grow.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state set a daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 1,777 new confirmed cases announced Saturday, and the state Department of Health warned that COVID-19 cases are spreading in the Puget Sound region. In a statement, the health agency said the high numbers the state has seen over the past week reflect an overall surge that started in mid-September. King, Snohomish and Pierce counties are currently the hot spots in the region, officials said. “COVID-19 is currently spreading very quickly in Washington state,” said Secretary of Health John Wiesman. “We are very concerned that disease transmission will only grow over the next few weeks with the holidays coming up. The threat to overwhelming not just our hospital systems, but our ability to do contact tracing, is real. We need everyone in Washington state to take action now to stop the spread.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported surging COVID-19 case numbers Saturday along with 15 newly reported deaths from the virus.

Jim Justice were tested for the virus after a staffer in the Capitol building tested positive Friday morning. The attorney general’s office later said the employee believed to have the virus tested negative Friday night.

He also urged West Virginians to get tested at sites around the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: State health officials reported a new daily high of more than 7,000 new COVID-19 cases – another new daily record.
