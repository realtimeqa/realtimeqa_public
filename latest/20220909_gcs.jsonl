Without offering details, Truss promised a “bold plan” to cut taxes and build economic growth, and “deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people’s energy bills but also dealing with the long-term issues we have on energy supply.”\n\nMonday’s announcement ends weeks of bitter campaigning during which Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), accused the Foreign Secretary of risking a prolonged recession if she goes ahead with her promised tax cuts.\n\nOnce Johnson formally resigns his post to the Queen on Tuesday, Truss will also visit the monarch at her Scottish residence Balmoral, where, as leader of the largest party in parliament, she will be invited to form a government.\n\nTruss had been the frontrunner for weeks, and the 47-year-old will now follow Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May to become Britain’s third female premier. Despite voting to remain in the European Union back in 2016, she has found herself to be the preferred candidate of the vast majority of Brexiteers in her party.\n\nHer victory was smaller than expected, Conservatives who supported both candidates are privately admitting. It had been predicted by many that her margin of victory would be larger than the 18 percentage points announced on Monday afternoon.\n\nIn terms of her premiership, this could mean that she cannot run roughshod over her MPs, who voted in greater numbers for Sunak than Truss in the parliamentary part of this leadership contest.\n\nAnd Truss could find that she has to accommodate a wider range of views from her party, which could mean embracing Sunak’s ideas for helping Britons with the cost-of-living crisis and a less aggressive approach to tax cuts – especially corporation tax.\n\nMany Conservative MPs are privately worried that Truss’s modern-day Thatcherism could cost them the next election and will be leaping on the surprisingly low margin of victory to encourage the next PM to soften her economic stance.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party immediately dismissed her arguments, saying in a statement, “after years serving in Tory cabinets, nodding through the decisions that got us into this mess, Liz Truss simply doesn’t have the answers to this crisis.”\n\nLong political journey\n\nIn the leadership campaign, Truss’s platform had featured plenty of red meat for the Conservative membership, from a hard line against the EU on Brexit to tax cuts as her main solution to the cost-of-living crisis. This tactic clearly proved decisive in winning over ordinary members, who had the final say in electing the leader of the ruling party, who consequently becomes prime minister.\n\nBut critics have accused her new-found hardline Brexit stance of being a cynical ploy. They have pointed to the fact that throughout her adult life Truss has evolved, from being an anti-monarchist Liberal Democrat in favor of legalizing drugs in her youth to the embodiment of the Conservative right today.\n\nThroughout her political career, especially during the leadership contest, Truss has been compared to Thatcher, who, for many on the right, remains the benchmark for Conservative leaders. She was a tax-cutting, hard-nosed leader who took on the unions and played a large role in ending the Cold War. Like Thatcher, Truss has come from relatively humble beginnings to dominate a world inhabited largely by men.\n\nSince becoming an MP, Truss has gone from being the darling of the liberal Conservative leader David Cameron, who took a personal interest in her career, to the Euroskeptic right’s figurehead.\n\nBefore the Brexit referendum, Truss said that she was “backing remain as I believe it is in Britain’s economic interest and means we can focus on vital economic and social reform at home.”\n\nCabinet colleagues at the time say that she never voiced any issue about supporting staying in the EU, despite having ample opportunities to express her own Euroskepticism.\n\nThese days, Truss is more than happy to pick fights with Brussels and to claim that it was the EU all along that held the British economy back.\n\nA country in turmoil\n\nTruss will take over a Conservative government that is facing multiple crises in the country. With steep rises in energy and food prices, long waiting lists for hospital treatment, and public sector workers, dock workers and even lawyers going on strike, making the case that the party deserves to win a historic fifth term at the next general election – due to be called by December 2024 at the latest – will be an uphill battle.\n\nInflation rose above 10% in July for the first time in 40 years, driven largely by the rising cost of energy, food and fuel. According to a forecast by the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% by the end of the year. The central bank also predicted that the UK would enter into recession before the end of the year. And on Monday, in a signal of these serious challenges ahead, the British pound dropped 0.3% to its lowest level against the US dollar since 1985.\n\nAnalysts are skeptical that Truss’s tax-cutting policies will do much help citizens, especially after a decade of austerity policies. The Institute for Fiscal studies, an independent research group focusing on public finances, said last month that the leadership contestants, who were both promising tax cuts and smaller government spending, “need to recognise this even greater-than-usual uncertainty in the public finances.”\n\nThe specter of Johnson\n\nLooming over Truss’s new government will be the long shadow of Johnson, whose time in office saw approval ratings and voter intentions plummet for the Conservative Party. He leaves office a deeply unpopular prime minister less than three years after romping home to an enormous landslide election victory in 2019.\n\nJohnson was forced to resign from office on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable. His downfall followed months of revelations over parties held in 10 Downing Street while the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nHowever, Johnson rode out the “Partygate” scandal. It was only when Chris Pincher, his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party, and Johnson delayed in acting over the matter, that his own party finally turned on him.\n\nIt is not yet known whether Johnson will remain in politics. He may still be forced to resign as a Member of Parliament after a House of Commons committee gives its verdict on whether or not Johnson knowingly misled Parliament when he claimed no rules were broken in Downing Street.\n\nRegardless, Johnson is likely to remain a high-profile figure. There is a good chance he will return to his former media career as a columnist and broadcaster, though the damage to his reputation in office might mean his appeal is limited compared to where it stood before he entered Downing Street.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Truss has been seen by most as the Johnson continuity candidate and enjoyed the backing of many of his loyalists.\n\nWhile this support has helped Truss during the leadership contest with Conservative members who saw her rival Sunak as a traitor, and who value tribal loyalty, it means she will be forever tied to the Johnson legacy.\n\nThat could ultimately become a weight around her neck, as the specter of Johnson risks overshadowing anything Truss might do to tackle the misery that many Britons are set to face this winter.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee Peter Wilkinson", "Luke Mcgee", "Peter Wilkinson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/uk/liz-truss-officially-new-prime-minister-uk-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "Liz Truss says UK can 'ride out the storm' in first speech as prime ...", "text": "London (CNN) Liz Truss became the third female prime minister in British history on Tuesday and pledged to immediately set about tackling the United Kingdom's spiraling cost of living crisis, saying she was confident that \"together we can ride out of the storm\" of economic problems facing the nation.\n\nTruss, 47, took office on a day of ceremony that saw her scandal-plagued predecessor Boris Johnson bow out in a defiant speech at Downing Street in London before both politicians flew to meet the Queen in Scotland for a transfer of power.\n\nTruss, who served as foreign minister in the previous government, enters office after winning the most votes in the Conservative Party leadership contest to replace Johnson, who announced his resignation in July in the wake of a series of scandals. Her appointment fills a monthslong leadership void that the UK has endured as its worst economic crisis in decades has worsened.\n\nSpeaking on the steps of Downing Street on Tuesday evening, Truss said her priorities were delivering tax cuts to grow the economy, improving Britain's energy security amid soaring prices, and fixing the National Health Service, thoug she did not outline any specific policies.\n\nShe also said she would defend freedom and democracy in the face of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\n\"I will deal hands on with the energy crisis forged by Putin's war. I will take action this week to deal with energy bills and to secure our future energy supply,\" Truss said. \"By delivering on the economy, on energy and on the NHS, we will put our nation on the path to long-term success.\"\n\nThe Queen welcomes Truss at Balmoral on Tuesdasy.\n\nShe ended on an optimistic note, acknowledging the many difficulties the UK faced at the moment.\n\n\"We should not be daunted by the challenges we face. As strong as the storm may be, I know that the British people are stronger,\" Truss said. \"Our country was built by people who get things done. We have huge reserves of talent, of energy and determination and I am confident that together we can ride out the storm.\"\n\nThe most urgent problem Truss must address is the skyrocketing cost of energy , which could unleash a wave of business closures and force millions of Britons to choose between putting food on the table and heating their homes this winter. Experts have warned that people will become destitute and cold-weather deaths will rise unless something is done fast.\n\nThe Bank of England anticipates that inflation in the UK will jump to 13% as the energy crisis intensifies, and that the country will enter recession before the end of the year. Goldman Sachs has warned inflation could even reach 22% if natural gas prices \"remain elevated at current levels.\"\n\nTruss was formally installed as prime minister on Tuesday after visiting Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle, one the royal estates in Scotland, in a break with norms.\n\nTraditionally, the Queen invites a new prime minister to form a government during an audience at London's Buckingham Palace -- but for the first time in her 70-year reign , the monarch chose not to travel to the British capital as a precaution due to her mobility issues.\n\nTruss's meeting with the monarch took place shortly after Johnson met with the Queen to officially resign as prime minister.\n\nIn his farewell speech outside Downing Street early Tuesday, Johnson touted his achievements, made no mention of failures, and pledged to support Truss' new government.\n\n\"Like Cincinnatus, I am returning to my plow, and I will be offering this government nothing but my fervent support,\" referring to a Roman statesman who according to legend devoted himself to the republic during times of crisis. \"It's time for us all to get behind Liz Truss and her team and her program.\"\n\nTruss will now set out to appoint a Cabinet, and will be expected to promote many allies who backed her leadership campaign. Kwasi Kwarteng and Suella Braverman are tipped for promotions; two Johnson loyalists, Nadine Dorries and Priti Patel, have quit.\n\nTruss will also be expected to outline her plans for dealing with the UK's urgent cost-of-living crisis as soon as possible. Her political opponents, both inside and outside the Conservative Party, will not deem it acceptable if the new leader fails to outline specific policies in the next 48 hours.\n\nTruss will then face the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, for her first Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday afternoon, which will be seen by her team as an important moment to set the tone of her leadership.\n\nParticular attention will be paid to how much Truss deviate's from Johnson's legislative agenda, particularly as she was seen as the Johnson continuity candidate in the leadership race.\n\nJUST WATCHED See how Boris Johnson left Downing Street for final time Replay More Videos ...

She was a tax-cutting, hard-nosed leader who took on the unions and played a large role in ending the Cold War. Like Thatcher, Truss has come from relatively humble beginnings to dominate a world inhabited largely by men.\n\nTruss ran her leadership campaign on a classic Conservative platform, promising tax cuts for citizens and no new taxes for businesses, including ruling out a windfall tax on energy companies to deal with the UK's cost-of-living crisis.\n\nAnalysts are skeptical that Truss's tax-cutting policies will do much help citizens, especially after a decade of Conservative austerity policies. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research group focusing on public finances, said last month that Truss and leadership rival Rishi Sunak, who were both promising tax cuts and smaller government spending, \"need to recognise this even greater-than-usual uncertainty in the public finances.\"\n\nDespite voting to remain in the European Union back in 2016, in recent years she has emerged as one of the most vocal critics of the European Union and staunchest supporters of Brexit.\n\nBut critics have accused her new-found hardline Brexit stance of being a cynical ploy.

She was born in 1975 into a family that she herself has described as “to the left of Labour,” Britain’s main left-wing party. She grew up in parts of the UK that didn’t traditionally vote Conservative, moving between Scotland and the north of England.\n\nIn contrast with her privately educated cabinet colleagues, Truss went to a state school in the Yorkshire city of Leeds, and later won a place at Oxford University. There she was an active member of the Liberal Democrats, a centrist opposition party that has long been an effective opponent to the Conservatives in large parts of England.\n\nDuring her time as a Liberal Democrat, Truss supported the legalization of cannabis and the abolition of the royal family – positions that are at total odds with what most would consider to be mainstream Conservatism in 2022.\n\nTruss says she joined the Conservatives in 1996, just two years after she gave a speech at a Liberal Democrat conference calling for the end of the monarchy.\n\nEven during her time as a Liberal Democrat, her peers questioned her sincerity and spotted traits that they say they still see in her today.\n\n“I honestly think she was playing to the gallery back then, whether she was talking about decriminalizing drugs or abolishing the monarchy,” Neil Fawcett, a Liberal Democrat councilor who campaigned with Truss in the 1990s, told CNN. “I think she is someone who plays to the gallery with whatever audience she is talking to, and I genuinely don’t know if she ever believes anything she says, then or now.”\n\nTruss has certainly continued to capture the attention of her audience. Since joining the Conservatives and becoming a lawmaker, she has fervently supported almost every conceivable ideology. She served loyally under three prime ministers in several different cabinet jobs, most recently as foreign secretary.\n\nMost notably, she supported remaining in the European Union in the UK’s referendum in 2016. At the time, Truss tweeted that she was backing those who wanted to remain in the bloc because “it is in Britain’s economic interest and means we can focus on vital economic and social reform at home.”\n\nTruss now backs Brexit, saying that her fears before the referendum that it could cause “disruption” were mistaken.\n\nTruss greets US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at a G7 summit in Liverpool last December. Phil Noble/Pool/Getty Images\n\nRecently, the new leader even went so far in burnishing her Brexiteer credentials as to refuse to call French President Emmanuel Macron an ally. When asked if he was friend or foe during a live broadcast, she said the “jury’s out.”\n\nThere is a debate within the Conservative Party as to how real this support of Euroskepticism is. Some think Truss was reluctantly following government orders, which opposed Brexit, in 2016. Others find that argument inconceivable.\n\nAnna Soubry, a former Conservative cabinet minister and anti-Brexit campaigner, told CNN that Truss “had the most cover out of any of us to support Brexit. Her brief at the time included the farming community, who supported Brexit on the whole. I sat around the cabinet table and heard everyone’s reason for doing what they did and find it hard to believe she’s changed her mind quite this much.”\n\nOn the other hand, Gavin Barwell, who served as former Prime Minister Theresa May’s chief-of-staff, said that, after the Brexit vote, “Truss made a decision very quickly that there wasn’t room for a compromise. If you were to do it, it needed to be done fully. And as the stalemate dragged on, she argued that a binary choice was coming between leaving with no deal and Brexit being reversed, and the latter would be catastrophic for the government.”\n\nTruss has been compared to Margaret Thatcher, who also wore a fur hat on an official visit to Moscow. Maxim Shemetov/Reuters\n\nThe closer she has edged to power, the more Britons have wondered what a Truss premiership would look like. She has campaigned to lead on the most conservative of agendas. She has pledged to slash taxes from day one, tear up EU regulations and encourage private sector growth with low corporation tax. She has said she will not impose a windfall tax on energy companies despite their posting huge profits during the current cost-of-living and energy crisis.\n\nTruss faces a challenge of forging a path for the Conservative Party, which has been in power for 12 years and has been bitterly divided over Brexit for half that period. Dan Kitwood/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThese sorts of policies were, of course, red meat to the Conservative members who ultimately voted for her. And while some of those who know her question how much she actually believes in them, there is little doubt she will put her full effort into implementing them and making her impact immediately felt.\n\nIt’s possible that a Truss government will ultimately look a lot like Johnson’s, but with a greater emphasis on cutting taxes, shrinking the state and, potentially, an even harder line on Europe.\n\nCritics have said the tax cuts she’s promised would lead to even greater inflation and rises in interest rates amid a forecast recession. Questions were also raised over a pledge Truss made to cut public sector pay, allegedly saving the public $8.8 billion. Her economics were questioned by her critics, and the uproar over perceived callousness toward public sector workers forced Truss to U-turn.\n\nJulian Glover, a journalist and speech writer to former Prime Minister David Cameron, was a university contemporary of Truss and remembers traits in her that are still recognizable today: determined but unfocused.\n\n“We only passed each other briefly and she was in a different year to me, but despite that, she stands out in my memory as a sort of strange, unfocused force, hugely in favor of action and change,” Glover told CNN. “It was always hard to see the aim of it all, or where it might lead, except that she would be at the center of it.”\n\nRoger Crouch, who succeeded Truss as president of Oxford University Liberal Democrats, told CNN that he remembers a woman who was “determined, single-minded and willing to challenge orthodox and prevailing, often male, wisdom.”\n\nUnlike many of those who knew Truss in her younger years, Crouch, who is now a teacher, thinks her opinions haven’t changed a huge amount since the 90s. “Liz was always more of a privatizing, libertarian liberal so there is a consistent thread of thought there. I remember a student discussion group in which she advocated privatization of lamp posts.”\n\nThose who know Truss say that while her views have changed over the years, she has always been determined and single-minded. Carl Court/Getty Images\n\nPrime Minister Truss will have a hard time uniting her party, which has been in power for 12 years and has been bitterly divided over Brexit for six of them.\n\nShe will also have to lead the country through its worst cost-of-living crisis in decades. Inflation is at a 40-year high, energy bills are set to increase by hundreds, possibly thousands, of pounds a year, and the UK is forecast to enter a recession before the end of the year.\n\nIn July, inflation rose above 10% for the first time in 40 years, driven largely by the rising cost of energy, food and fuel. According to the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% by the end of the year. The central bank also predicted that the UK will enter a recession before the end of 2022.\n\nAnalysts are skeptical that Truss’ tax-cutting policies will do much to help citizens. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research group focusing on public finances, said last month that the leadership contestants, who were both promising tax cuts and lower government spending, “need to recognise this even greater-than-usual uncertainty in the public finances.”\n\nThis winter, many families will have to make a grim choice between heating their homes and eating. And for a party that has been in power for more than a decade, it’s hard to deflect the blame for that onto anyone else.\n\nHer supporters see the chance for a fresh start in Truss. They believe that with Brexit less in the spotlight and the scandals that led to Johnson’s downfall soon to be a distant memory, the party will turn its focus to remaining in power and winning a historic fifth consecutive general election.\n\nAfter a vicious battle between Truss and Rishi Sunak (left), some question whether the new prime minister can keep the party in power at the next election. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nFor her detractors, it is more complicated. During this leadership contest those who have supported her rivals feel they have been unfairly maligned simply for disputing that Truss should be handed the keys to Downing Street.\n\nWhen it comes to running the country, this could be a problem for Truss. She had the support of fewer MPs than her rival Rishi Sunak during the early stages of the contest and the bad blood between the two camps has worsened over time.\n\nAnd for all Truss’ determination and single-mindedness, she takes over a party torn apart by infighting and suffering in the polls during a domestic crisis. So she may find her key objective – making her party electable at the next general election after so many years in power – too hard a task to achieve.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/02/uk/royal-news-newsletter-09-02-22-scli-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Queen Elizabeth prepares to appoint her newest prime minister - CNN", "text": "A version of this story appeared in the September 2 edition of CNN's Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain's royal family. Sign up here.\n\nLondon (CNN) We're back, royal readers, and just in time, with the announcement Monday of Liz Truss as the new leader of the governing Conservative Party -- and consequently, the country's next prime minister. As you'll recall, the Queen and politics don't usually mix, but she is involved in the transition, so let's break it down.\n\nAs head of state, the appointment of new prime ministers is one of Elizabeth II's core constitutional duties, along with the State Opening of Parliament and signing parliamentary bills into law. Truss will be the Queen's 15th prime minister when she takes over from Boris Johnson on Tuesday.\n\nNormally, the practicalities are straightforward. In a nutshell, the outgoing PM makes a statement outside 10 Downing Street and then heads off to Buckingham Palace for a final farewell audience with the monarch. Shortly after, their successor travels over for their appointment. All in all, it's relatively quick, taking around half an hour. However, this time ... not so much.\n\nThe sovereign had intended to interrupt her vacation in Scotland and return to London to appoint the new PM. But in a break with royal tradition, Buckingham Palace announced Wednesday that the 96-year-old will not be making the 1,000-mile round trip , with the outgoing leader and his successor traveling to Balmoral on Tuesday instead.\n\nAccording to a royal source, the decision to hold the two audiences at her Scottish country residence rather than at Buckingham Palace -- for the first time in her 70-year reign -- was made to provide certainty to the Prime Minister's diary. The source told CNN the decision was to avoid any last-minute alternative arrangements in the event the Queen finds herself experiencing any episodic mobility issues. As a result, Tuesday will likely be a more protracted event due to the distance between London and Balmoral and the logistics involved.\n\nThe decision also makes sense, given that more recently the Queen's presence has generally been confirmed on the day depending on how she is feeling. Case in point, a royal source told CNN Friday that the Queen would miss the annual Braemar Gathering this weekend but that Prince Charles, who usually accompanies her, would still be at the Highland Games. The decision was made for the Queen's comfort, the source said.\n\nFile photograph of Balmoral Castle.\n\nThe protocols for prime ministerial appointments are unwritten -- based instead on constitutional convention, according to experts.\n\n\"It's all a matter of convention that we just have a prime minister -- one minister who is more important than the others -- and that means that there are no real legal formalities to undergo for the appointment,\" explained Craig Prescott, a lecturer in law at Bangor University in Wales.\n\n\"Historically, the monarch would have had a much greater flexibility over who that primary adviser would be,\" he told CNN. \"That discretion has ebbed away because there are now constitutional conventions in place that regulate who the prime minister is.\n\n\"It's very much for the political parties, and for the electorate, to ultimately decide who the prime minister is -- and the Queen effectively puts that decision into action,\" he added.\n\nPrescott said the Queen is still involved because \"it has to be remembered that the government is still carried on in the name of the crown. It is still 'Her Majesty's Government.'\"\n\nSo how will Tuesday unfold? Well, at some point, Johnson will arrive and tender his resignation as prime minister and First Lord of the Treasury. (Fun fact: Most assume 10 Downing Street is the official residence of the prime minister but it's in fact that of the First Lord of the Treasury, a role usually held by the PM.) One of the last acts of the office is to advise the monarch on their successor (even if it's already been decided through a leadership contest). This is yet another quirk of proceedings, but one that ensures the Queen remains politically neutral, according to Prescott.\n\nThe Queen chats with Boris Johnson during a reception at Windsor Castle last October.\n\nLittle is truly known about these occasions, but some of Johnson's predecessors have touched on them in their memoirs. Gordon Brown said the final official duty of going to see the sovereign doesn't involve handing over seals of office or anything, but rather \"simply saying goodbye to the Queen -- and thanking her.\"\n\nIn his autobiography, \"My Life, Our Times,\" the former Labour prime minister said that \"as usual, she was charming and the occasion itself was relaxed.\" Brown also recalled how the Queen humanized the situation by permitting his two young sons to be present when he received a parting gift -- an inscribed photograph of the monarch.\n\n\"Fraser was just four, and when he looked at the photo he said, 'That's the Queen!' -- as if it was of someone other than the person who had just handed it to him. Queen Elizabeth, startled by his response, replied: 'But I'm the Queen, I'm the Queen.' We laughed, and then we left,\" Brown wrote.\n\nA short while later, the Queen will call up Johnson's replacement for a ceremonial audience known as \"kissing hands.\" Whether or not actual hands are kissed is up for debate. Some past PMs, like David Cameron, have said the name isn't literal, while others have suggested it is.\n\nFormer prime minister Tony Blair described understanding \"kissing hands\" as \"the laying on of the Queen's authority to govern.\" However, when it came to the moment, he wasn't exactly sure what that meant. In his autobiography, \"A Journey,\" the former Labour leader recalls waiting in an antechamber to be presented to the Queen, before becoming abruptly anxious.\n\n\"A tall official with a stick stood by me. 'I should tell you one thing, Mr Blair,' he began (note 'Mrk Blair' until I had been appointed), 'you don't actually kiss the Queen's hands in the ceremony of kissing hands. You brush them gently with your lips,'\" Blair wrote.\n\nTony Blair greets Labour supporters outside 10 Downing Street after a historic landslide election in May 1997.\n\nBlair said he was \"floored\" by the remark but was left with little time to mull it over. \"While I was still temporarily disconcerted, the door opened and I was ushered in, unfortunately tripping a little on a piece of carpet so that I practically fell upon the Queen's hands, not so much brushing as enveloping them,\" he continued, adding that the rest of the occasion went off without a hitch.\n\nMeanwhile, the changing of location matters little constitutionally, with Prescott recalling how Herbert Henry Asquith traveled to meet King Edward VII, who was in the French city of Biarritz, to take office. It is the only appointment to have ever occurred on foreign soil and \"reflects how there are so few formalities about this.\"\n\nInstead, the fact that the Queen has allowed the process to be adapted for her will likely be what's important to Johnson and Truss.\n\n\"I think both the outgoing prime minister and the incoming prime minister will very much want that moment with the Queen. They will want to be seen to have a historical continuity with what's gone before. I think that that will be very important for them,\" Prescott said.\n\nAnd amending the ceremonial formalities will also go some way to alleviating concerns from royal-watchers over her health. The fact that the monarch is making the concession to host the audiences at Balmoral rather than issue a directive authorizing Charles and his eldest son, Prince William, to step in -- as they did to open Parliament in May -- gives yet another indication that neither age nor mobility difficulties will stop the resolute sovereign from carrying out her royal duties.\n\nFEATURED PHOTOS\n\nThe Queen has been served by 14 prime ministers during her reign so far. Many relationships were formed, from Winston Churchill to \"Iron Lady\" Margaret Thatcher -- with some proving more difficult than others.\n\nIn celebration of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, which marked 60 years as British sovereign, then-prime minister David Cameron hosted a lunch at Downing Street for the monarch. The occasion was also an opportunity to catch up with several of her former premiers. Here she stands with Cameron (left), John Major (2nd from left), Tony Blair (2nd from right) and Gordon Brown (right) on July 24, 2012 in London.\n\nWinston Churchill (1951-1955): The Queen was said to be in awe of her first prime minister, Winston Churchill. Once when asked which PM she enjoyed meeting with most, she replied: \"Winston of course, because it's always such fun.\"\n\nHarold Wilson (1964-1970, 1974-1976): Wilson, who came from a lower-middle-class background, became the Queen's first Labour Party prime minister. Wilson, seen here on the right, next to Prince Philip, often broke away from protocol, and he enjoyed helping with the washing-up after barbecues at Balmoral -- one of the Queen's residences. The Queen, however, warmed to Wilson's informal presence and even invited him to stay for drinks after their first meeting, which was not commonplace.\n\nMargaret Thatcher (1979-1990): While Thatcher and the Queen were the closest in age, Thatcher kept their encounters strictly professional, formal and famously stiff. The \"Iron Lady,\" as she became known, reportedly had a tense relationship with the monarch during their traditional weekly meetings. Thatcher also viewed her annual visits to the royal home in Balmoral as interrupting her work. Despite this, Thatcher is said to have been incredibly respectful of the Queen and eventually became her longest-serving prime minister.\n\nNO UK PM HAS EVER RAISED CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS THE WAY JOHNSON HAS\n\nAnalysis from CNN's Luke McGee, UK and European Policy and Politics Editor\n\nThe Queen will finally see the back of Boris Johnson -- for now at least. The prime minister will officially resign to the monarch on Tuesday.\n\nWhile Her Majesty never makes her political opinions known and defers to her advisers and government ministers on almost all matters, you'd forgive Elizabeth II for breathing a sigh of relief.\n\nJohnson has on more than one occasion pushed the monarch's position of impartiality to its limits and led to Brits asking questions that once seemed unfathomable.\n\nEarly on in his premiership, Johnson prorogued -- or suspended -- Parliament, so that lawmakers would not be able to intervene and stop the Brexit deadline from expiring, forcing Britain to crash out of the European Union with no deal. The Queen followed her prime minister's advice allowing the prorogation -- only to later be told that the advice Johnson had given her was unlawful . Many called for Johnson to apologize for embarrassing the monarch\n\nAnd it wouldn't be the only time in his premiership that his government would have to do so. Officials were left with little other choice in January when revelations about pandemic lockdown-busting parties emerged out of 10 Downing Street, including one on the night before Prince Philip's funeral.\n\nBoris Johnson's first audience with the Queen as prime minister on July 24, 2019.\n\nAs Johnson's position became untenable earlier this year, there were fears that his refusal to resign, despite mass protest from his own cabinet, would once again force the Queen and her advisers to act.\n\nHad Johnson clung to power, he could have found himself removed as Conservative leader and without a government serving him. Due to the UK's odd un-codified constitution, he could have remained prime minister of around 66 million people, creating a host of new problems to resolve. Fortunately, it didn't come to that and Johnson has decided to make a (relatively for him) quiet exit.\n\nJohnson is a man who has always described himself as a monarchist who holds the Queen in the highest regard. And critics might say he could have demonstrated this respect by not bringing the country's constitution to breaking point and dragging her into the mucky business of politics.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?\n\nBBC donates to charities linked to Diana.\n\nBritain's public service broadcaster has given £1.42 million ($1.64 million) to seven charities connected to the late Princess Diana. The amount reflects the sales made from the 1995 Panorama interview with the Princess of Wales, which an independent inquiry last year determined was secured using \"deceitful\" methods. The charitable donations come from the BBC's commercial revenue rather than the taxpayer's license fee, the broadcaster said. \"The BBC had indicated its intention to donate to charity the sales proceeds derived from the 1995 Panorama interview with Diana, Princess of Wales. The BBC has now done so. Given the findings of Lord Dyson, we think this is the right and appropriate course of action,\" the organization said in a statement Friday.\n\nHarry and Meghan are back.\n\nWe're pretty sure you won't have forgotten, but just a reminder that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be visiting the United Kingdom and Germany this week. A spokesperson for the Sussexes told CNN that the pair \"are delighted to visit with several charities close to their hearts in early September.\" The couple are due to attend the One Young World 2022 Manchester Summit on Monday, then head to the Invictus Games Düsseldorf 2023 One Year to Go event in Germany on Tuesday, before flying back to the UK for the WellChild Awards 2022 in London on Thursday. Meghan has been making headlines in recent weeks after her much-anticipated podcast \"Archetypes\" dropped on Spotify. The first two episodes featured G.O.A.T. Serena Williams (discussing the gendered connotations of \"ambition\") and superstar singer-songwriter Mariah Carey (talking biracial identity ).\n\nThe Sussexes at the 2020 Invictus Games in the Netherlands.\n\nPrince Charles edits special edition of Black British newspaper.\n\nThe Prince of Wales has guest-edited a special issue of British African-Caribbean newspaper The Voice to mark its 40-year anniversary. Founded in 1982, the paper is the only national Black newspaper operating in the UK. Prince Charles described the publication as \"crucial,\" before adding that he was \"so touched\" to be asked to helm the special edition. Clarence House said Charles' issue \"touches on themes including community cohesion, education, climate, the Commonwealth, faith and the arts.\" It was released on Thursday and features interviews with actor Idris Elba and Doreen Lawrence, the mother of 18-year-old student Stephen Lawrence who was murdered in an unprovoked racist attack in southeast London in 1993, among others.

With that simple interaction, Truss became the 56th British prime minister.\n\nDuring the queen's 70-year reign she has done this – \"kissing of the hands\" – 15 times before, although this is the first time her participation in the ceremony took place outside London. The event was moved to Balmoral Castle amid what Buckingham Palace described as the queen's \"mobility issues.\" Johnson also made the 1,000-mile round trip to tender his resignation, which the Palace said the queen was \"pleased to accept.\"\n\nThe latest\n\nTruss was named the new U.K. prime minister on Monday after an internal Conservative Party contest following Johnson's resignation in July. She defeated Rishi Sunak, a former banker who served as Johnson's finance minister.\n\n\n\nIn his Tuesday farewell speech, Johnson compared himself to Roman statesman Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, a military leader in the early days of the Roman Republic. Cincinnatus was a symbol of civic virtue, especially in times of crisis. \"This is it folks,\" Johnson said as he spoke outside Downing Street, the prime minister's official office and residence. \"Like Cincinnatus, I am returning to my plough and I will be offering this government nothing but the most fervent support.\"\n\n\n\nBut the Cincinnatus namedrop could be a coded reference to Johnson's ambition to one day lead the country again. Cincinnatus resigned from power – he was a dictator – only to return later on. Johnson will for now remain a lawmaker. In his speech, Johnson added that he was proud of what he regarded as his achievements, such as steering Britain out of the European Union, support for Ukraine in Russia's illegitimate war and a fast rollout of the coronavirus vaccine.\n\n\n\n\"On the subject of bouncing around in future careers, let me say that I am now like one of those booster rockets that has fulfilled its function,\" he said. \"And I will now be gently re-entering the atmosphere and splashing down invisibly in some remote and obscure corner of the Pacific.\"\n\n\n\nIn her first major speech as prime minister, which was short and to the point, Truss paid tribute to Johnson for \"delivering Brexit (the U.K.'s exit from the EU), the COVID vaccine (rollout) and standing up to Russian aggression in Ukraine.\" She said \"now is the time to tackle the issues holding Britain back.\" Truss said she would build roads, homes and make sure the country had quicker Internet services. Truss said she wants to turn Britain into “an aspiration nation\" by cutting taxes and boosting growth and investment.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nA self-described Thatcher acolyte, Truss favors a combination of low taxes, a smaller state and, like Johnson, feels Britain's EU exit will enable the country to prosper in ways that the bloc did not allow.\n\n\n\nOver the coming hours and days, Truss will start appointing a pro-growth Cabinet that shares her right-leaning ideology. Kwasi Kwarteng is widely expected to be Chancellor of the Exchequer, similar to finance minister. If Kwarteng gets the job he would be the first Black person to hold Britain's second most powerful job. Kwarteng has promised a \"lean state\" under Truss.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Truss will be subject to a political baptism by fire when she takes part in Prime Minister's Questions, or PMQs, a weekly event broadcast live in which the serving prime minister squares off against the leader of the opposition for a series of mostly spontaneous, open-style questions from lawmakers. The sessions tend to get rowdy and shouty; previous prime ministers have said, after leaving office, that they dreaded the PMQs.\n\n\n\nTruss served in Johnson's government as foreign secretary. She is familiar with many world leaders. In her first call to a foreign counterpart, she spoke with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy and accepted an invitation to visit his war-torn country soon, according to Truss's office. Truss has advocated a hardline approach to Russia over the Ukraine war. She also spoke with President Joe Biden on Tuesday.\n\nTruss is under pressure to intervene in Britain's energy markets to relieve spiraling household energy costs, which are some of the highest in Europe. She said in her speech Tuesday that she would \"take action this week.\" Economists have predicted Truss could move to freeze the cost of rising energy bills.\n\nWhat are they saying\n\nBiden congratulated Truss in a tweet. \"I look forward to deepening the special relationship between our countries and working in close cooperation on global challenges, including continued support for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russian aggression,\" he wrote on the social media platform.\n\n\n\n“At the heart of her political identity is a notion which is both a strength and a potentially calamitous weakness – a love of the notion of being a disrupter which injects a deliberate unpredictability into her approach towards a world in extreme flux,\" said Bronwen Maddox, director of the London-based think tank Chatham House, of Truss. “If she indulges this without good judgment, she could do real damage to Britain’s prospects and standing in the world\"\n\nTruss's priority \"should be serious, strengthened relations with the EU, using the language to match,” said Maddox, referring to Britain's departure from the EU and a number of lingering issues that exit has caused, including disagreements over what to do with the border between Northern Ireland (part of the U.K.) and Ireland (part of the EU).\n\n\n\nIn Russia, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Truss would not be good for the U.K. \"I don't think this will help to maintain, or strengthen, the position of the country ... London has for quite a long time been actively trying to compensate for the loss of identity and influence in the EU by taking drastic steps on the world stage, including aggressive actions over the situation that has developed around Ukraine.\"\n\n\n\nZelenskyy, by contrast, said he looked forward to working with Truss. \"I believe that together we will be able to do a lot more to protect our nations and to thwart all Russian destructive efforts.\"\n\nWant to know more?

But it makes a mockery of our system and in the current chaotic free world there is simply no way for a serious country to run itself,” Sunak said in the video.\n\nThe measures he proposes include a cap set annually by the UK parliament on “number of refugees we accept each year via safe and legal routes, amendable in the face of emergencies,” according to the plan published on Sunak’s campaign website.\n\nHe also put forward a measure making “aid, trade, and visas conditional on a country’s willingness to cooperate on returns” of migrants who have illegally entered the UK.\n\nSunak also notably committed himself to “doing whatever it takes to get our partnership with Rwanda off the ground and operating at scale and pursuing other migration partnerships.”\n\nThe UK government’s partnership with the East African country has been the subject of fierce criticism since it was announced by UK Home Secretary Priti Patel in April.\n\nThe policy will see asylum seekers deemed to have entered the UK illegally sent to Rwanda to have their asylum claims processed.\n\nThe first such flight to Rwanda was set to take off on June 14, but the European Court of Human Rights stepped in at the eleventh hour.\n\nJudicial review proceedings taken by a group of NGOs, asylum seekers and a civil service trade union questioning the legality of the scheme are set to begin in the UK High Court on September 5.\n\nIn an interview with British newspaper, the Mail on Sunday, UK Foreign Secretary and Conservative Party leadership candidate Liz Truss also backed the Rwanda scheme, calling it “the right policy.”\n\nShe said she intended to “to see it through to full implementation” and even to expand the project by exploring similar partnerships with other countries.\n\nPublishing details of her plans for immigration in a tweet Sunday, Truss also pledged to increase frontline Border Force staff by 20% if elected leader of the Conservative Party.", "authors": ["Niamh Kennedy"], "publish_date": "2022/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/09/05/liz-truss-uk-leader-margaret-thatcher-devotee/7957970001/", "title": "Liz Truss to become U.K.'s prime minister: What it means, what to know", "text": "Liz Truss is Britain's third prime minister in three years\n\nTruss won 57% of votes from 172,000 Conservative Party activists - less than 1% of UK population\n\nTruss replaces Boris Johnson, who leaves office Tuesday\n\nLONDON – Liz Truss became Britain's third female prime minister after Monday's announcement by the ruling Conservative Party that she would replace Boris Johnson.\n\nTruss, 47, has portrayed herself as the political heir to Margaret Thatcher, Britain's formidable cheerleader for free markets and low taxes, a strong supporter of the Anglo-American alliance and a dynamo who played a key role in ending the Cold War.

Author Kathy Freston started a Change.org petition asking for McDonald's to add a vegan burger about seven years ago. The petition has more than 234,000 signatures.\n\n\"There are other plant-based burgers out there, but the McPlant delivers our iconic taste in a sink-your-teeth-in (and wipe-your-mouth) kind of sandwich,\" McDonald's said in a blog post Monday. \"It’s made with a juicy, plant-based patty and served on a warm, sesame seed bun with all the classic toppings.\"\n\nBorden said some markets will test the burger next year. Whether or not the vegan-friendly burger will arrive in the U.S. and a potential timeline was not immediately known.\n\n\"We are excited about the opportunity because we believe we have a proven, delicious-tasting product,\" Borden said. \"When customers are ready for it, we will be ready for them.”\n\nLast September, McDonald's started testing a plant-based burger called the P.L.T., which stands for plant, lettuce and tomato that featured a non-meat patty crafted exclusively by McDonald’s by Beyond Meat.\n\nA Beyond Meat spokesperson confirmed the company co-created the plant-based patty that will be part of the McPlant platform with McDonald's.\n\nMcDonald's has also had plant-based options in other countries and launched the Big Vegan TS in Germany in May 2019.\n\nMichele Simon, executive director of the Plant Based Foods Association, previously told USA TODAY that the growth of plant-based products in restaurants and stores isn't a trend but a movement.\n\n“Major fast-food chains are realizing that they have to respond to this growing consumer demand,\" Simon said. “We’re talking of a mainstreaming of this way of eating. You can’t get more mainstream than Burger King and Carl’s Jr.”\n\nCrispy Chicken Sandwich coming soon\n\nMcDonald's USA President Joe Erlinger said U.S. restaurants would introduce the new Crispy Chicken Sandwich in 2021. The premium chicken sandwich was tested in Houston and Knoxville, Tennessee, in late 2019 through late January.\n\n“It’s a simple build relevant for our U.S. customer base – with chicken, a potato roll, crinkle-cut pickles, and butter. It’s extremely craveable. I love it,” Erlinger said. “More importantly, our customers loved it in test.”\n\nThe chicken sandwich war of 2019 began after Popeyes' debut of its New Orleans-style fried chicken on a bun when the chain started a viral Twitter feud with Chick-fil-A and other restaurants.\n\nMcDonald's U.S. franchise owners, part of the National Owners Association, said in July 2019, prior to Popeyes sandwich being released that a new premium chicken sandwich should be McDonald's top priority.\n\n\"We believe it’s going to jump-start our chicken journey, build our chicken credentials and get people to start looking at us differently,\" Erlinger said Monday. \"We’re excited about the moves we’re making to meet – and exceed – customer expectations for great-tasting chicken. That is how we will start to build our chicken credibility.\"\n\nMcDonald's has trimmed its menu because of staffing challenges amid the coronavirus pandemic but in recent months has made additions including new pastry items, limited-time celebrity meals with Travis Scott and J Balvin and Spicy McNuggets.\n\nIn December, McDonald's is bringing its iconic barbecue sandwich, the McRib, back for a limited time. It's the first time since 2012 that it will be available at restaurants nationwide.\n\nMcDonald's to launch loyalty program\n\nMcDonald’s announced plans to launch a loyalty program called “MyMcDonald’s,” which will launch as a pilot in the Phoenix area in the coming weeks.\n\nOfficials said the rewards program will be a spend-based program, which is similar to other restaurants.\n\nIn July, Wendy's launched the Wendy's Rewards loyalty program where members can cash in points earned on purchases for free food.

Granted, it wasn’t the send-off she was hoping for, which Olympic teammate A’ja Wilson (29 points, six rebounds) felt somewhat bad about.\n\n“I wasn’t trying to crash Sue’s party, she invited me!” Wilson said, laughing. “I was just trying to have some fun. I’m just so happy for Sue. The things Sue has done within this franchise, we’ve all gotta give her respect.”\n\nThe Storm are already a lock for the playoffs and likely to play more home games — and given Bird’s excellence over her 21-year career, and the fact that the Aces spoiled her celebration, probably none of us should rule out a potential fifth WNBA ring before she heads to retirement this offseason. But to be safe, to ensure she was properly appreciated in case her career ends on the road, Seattle fans showed up en force Sunday.\n\nBased on the roar when Bird ran onto the floor and the fact that there was nary an empty seat in the arena, most of the city showed up to send their point guard off in style. To make sure everyone in attendance understood her importance, the Storm passed out black shirts with a golden goat emblazoned on the front. Those who looked closely saw the animal was actually comprised of a list of Bird’s accolades, a nod to the GOAT (greatest of all time).\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, she’s also the most influential player in the history of the WNBA and one of, if not the most, influential athletes in the history of Seattle sports, regardless of gender.\n\nWith an assist from Storm great Lauren Jackson, who retired in 2016, and Breanna Stewart, the 2018 MVP who is a candidate to win again this season, Bird has built Seattle into a women’s sports mecca. And in a nod to Bird’s legacy, the sports world at large — but Seattle especially — will continue to benefit from the Sue Bird Effect.\n\nConsider the following:\n\n— The Storm debuted in the 2000 season before drafting Jackson the following year with the top overall pick. In 2002, again holding the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft, Seattle selected Bird. The Storm’s staying power can be attributed partially to a rabid fanbase that consistently showed up for Bird. Not only does Seattle lead the league in average attendance, but on Sunday, the team set a franchise record with a sellout of 18,100.\n\n— Without Bird, who helped Seattle fall in love with women’s sports, there’s likely no raucous crowds for Washington women’s basketball, when Kelsey Plum starred for the Huskies and led them to the 2016 Final Four.\n\n— Without Bird, whose excellence demanded that women’s sports be taken seriously in a city long defined by its professional men’s teams, there is likely no OL Reign, Seattle’s NWSL team.\n\nPerhaps no young WNBA player is more qualified to speak to Bird’s impact than Plum, now in her sixth professional season with Las Vegas. Plum, who finished with 16 points and four assists Sunday, was a beneficiary of Bird’s influence on the Seattle sports market. Bird was one of thousands who packed Alaska Airlines Arena to watch Plum at Washington from 2013-17, where she ultimately broke the NCAA scoring record.\n\n“She’s been tremendous in transcending the game,” Plum told USA TODAY Sports. “She’s one of those athletes that breaks through the sex barrier — she has the ultimate respect from both sides. Seattle is amazing. It embraces sports, no matter gender … but the love this city has for women’s basketball, Sue built that.”\n\nFor her part, Bird had never thought about that — until Sunday.\n\nEver the point guard, she first deferred, saying that “you have to give a little bit of a nod to the Seattle Reign,” the city’s former ABL team. Then she recognized her role, too.\n\n“What’s really coming across my mind is … you always knew what you were gonna get from me,” Bird said. “To have a player like that, in the same city, you can attach to that, you can connect with that, you can connect with the team — and the fans here have done that. They were connected to Lauren, they’re connected now to Stewie (Breanna Stewart) and others but I was the constant, and a consistent constant. So it was easy to latch on.”\n\nShe mentioned other standouts including Plum and fiancé Megan Rapinoe, an OL Reign star, saying those players are “doing their own thing” in continuing to keep Seattle sports fans engaged in women’s games.

And for Bird, there’s no role more fitting, or more fulfilling.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2022/08/12/serena-williams-women-sports-retirement-sue-bird/65398374007/", "title": "Serena Williams, other stars improve women's sports after retirement", "text": "Serena Williams. Sue Bird. Allyson Felix. Sylvia Fowles.\n\nSome of greatest female athletes in the world have reached the end of their careers this year, and are now pivoting to build their legacies beyond sport. For some, that means improving the games they long dominated as part of their next chapter. For others, it means finding a way to use their hard-earned capital to elevate like-minded leaders.\n\nThis conversation was thrust into the spotlight when Williams, one of the best tennis players in history, announced in a Vogue magazine cover story that she would step away from the game after playing in this year's U.S. Open, which starts Aug. 29. Many have lauded the tennis star for leaving the game exactly as she played it for more than two decades — on her own terms.\n\n“I have never liked the word retirement. It doesn’t feel like a modern word to me,” Williams wrote in the piece. “Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to is evolution. I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.”\n\nFor Williams, that means growing her family. It also means focusing on Serena Ventures — the company she founded to invest in others like her, as she explained in Vogue. She learned that only 2% of venture capital money went to women. “In order for us to change that, more people who look like me need to be in that position, giving money back to themselves,” she wrote.\n\nThis idea of giving back has become a pillar of women’s sports. Now, more than ever, some of the biggest names in sports are turning to improving the games they played.\n\nAllyson Felix has been doing it for years. Felix, the most decorated American track and field athlete in Olympic history, ran down a 100-meter track in downtown Los Angeles this week in what is being described as the last race of her professional career. The race concluded “The Allyson Felix Race for Change,” an event presented by Athleta to raise awareness about the importance of child care and equity for women.\n\nThat cause is personal for Felix. In 2019, she spoke out in a in a New York Times essay against her sponsor, Nike, when the company refused to pay her while on maternity leave. Her advocacy led Nike to announce a new maternity policy for all its sponsored athletes, and just this week the shoe giant said it’s launching a maternity training program.\n\nFelix has said she will now shift her focus to her footwear company, Saysh, and will use her involvement in the International Olympic Committee Athletes’ Commission to further raise awareness on child care and gender equity issues. In the past, she’s partnered with organizations to help fund child care costs for traveling athletes. In June, she worked to provide onsite child care to fellow athletes at the USA Track & Field Outdoor Championship in Eugene, Oregon.\n\nMore:Women & Sport: A look at female athletes from rec league to pros\n\n“The dream is for that to be the norm at all events,’’ she told USA Today Sports. “And obviously that’s going to take a lot of work to get that in place, but that’s where I want to see that going, and just finding ways to be thoughtful and supporting women in general.’’\n\nSometimes giving back means investing in the next generation. That’s what Fowles, a less talked about WNBA icon, has quietly done for years. The Minnesota Lynx star sponsors Team Fowles, an AAU team within the Miami Suns organization, and pays for scholarships for girls who can’t afford it. She’s even invited one player to play in WNBA pickup runs, as described in a recent Ringer profile.\n\nMeanwhile Sue Bird, the WNBA star who also is in the final stretch of her legendary career with the Seattle Storm, was recently introduced as one of the newest investors in Gotham FC. In a statement released by the National Women's Soccer League club, Bird said: “There is a lot of talk about the power of investing in women’s sports. As an athlete in a position to invest, I’m excited to now lead by example.”\n\nBird is joining a Gotham FC ownership group that includes Carli Lloyd, another Team USA great. This past spring, after ending her playing career with Gotham, Lloyd was named a surprise minority investor in the club. It shouldn't have come as much of a shock, though. In her final USWNT game in October, she concluded her farewell to fans with an iconic mic drop. She told the crowd: “You will not see me on the field, but you best believe that I will be around helping this game grow.\"\n\nIn many ways, the sports world will look different next year. Tennis without Williams. Track and field without Felix. Basketball without Bird and Fowles. But there’s little doubt that some of the greatest to have ever played won't stray too far.\n\nWomen & Sport is a NorthJersey.com column devoted to female athletes from the rec league level to those in college and the pros.

But they show the stage isn't too big for Phoenix, particularly with three Tokyo Olympic gold medalists in Taurasi, Brittney Griner and Skylar Diggins-Smith (combined eight Olympic golds).\n\nThe Mercury will be without starting wing Kia Nurse, after her knee injury in the first minute of Game 4 on Wednesday, and perhaps without her backup Sophie Cunningham (questionable with a calf strain) for a second straight game.\n\nSo the Big Three, not just Taurasi, will need to rise to the occasion if the No. 5-seeded Mercury are to prevail over the No. 2 Aces and reach the WNBA Finals for the first time since 2014.\n\nThe No. 6 Chicago Sky await the winner with Finals Games 1-2 on Sunday and Wednesday in either Phoenix or Las Vegas.\n\n\"We haven't won anything,\" Aces coach Bill Laimbeer said after his team's 93-76 win in Game 4. \"It's 2-2, we're where we're supposed to be. We play the whole regular season to play at home (in Game 5). They had their chance tonight, and we're going to get a chance win the series Friday night. So let's go throw the ball up and see what happens.\"\n\nWhat's happened in the last three games is dominance by one team over three quarters making the fourth largely irrelevant. The Mercury led 98-78 after three in Game 2 (117-91 win) and 72-52 in Game 3 (87-60) then the Aces used a 24-0 third-quarter run to go up 78-57 in Game 4 (93-76 win).\n\nEven in Game 1, the Aces led by 10 (76-66) after the third quarter, but the Mercury pulled within four in the final minute before falling 96-90.\n\nMaybe the teams are due for something close and dramatic akin to 2018 when the Mercury were tied at 76 late in a semifinal Game 5 at Seattle that Sue Bird finished off in the Storm's favor. Or last season for the Aces when A'ja Wilson converted on four free throws in the final 1:47 for a 66-63 Game 5 semifinal win over Connecticut (Las Vegas also trailed 2-1 in that series).\n\nThe commonality in the Aces' wins are big scoring outputs from guards Chelsey Gray, Riquna Williams and Kelsey Plus (68 points in Game 1, 59 in Game 4). Without 6-0 Nurse and perhaps 6-1 Cunningham, limiting the trio becomes more difficult in part because 39-year-old Taurasi (ankle) is not fully healthy and Shey Peddy, while a quality defender, is just 5-7.\n\nBria Hartley, who played 20 minutes (7 points, 2 rebounds, 3 assists) in Game 4, is a wing option for coach Sandy Brondello although she did not begin playing this season until Sept. 4, returning from major knee surgery.\n\n\"You have to stay ready, people get injured at any time, people need to step up,\" Hartley said. \"I just try to do the best I can in the gym and be sure I'm prepared for when I go out there. It sucks that we lost and we want to make sure we're building for the next game. I haven't played much this season so I want to make sure I'm building my confidence so I can make an impact.\"\n\nThe Aces had success single covering 6-9 Griner primarily with 6-8 Liz Cambage in Game 4 and Brianna Turner only scored six points, down from a career high 23 in Game 3. The Mercury posts need to combined for more than 19 points (Game 4) and help to regain a rebounding edge that Phoenix held in Games 2-3.\n\nNothing, of course, would be better for the Mercury than Taurasi approaching her 37-point performance in Game 2 when she was 8-of-11 from 3-point.\n\nStill waiting on the birth of her second child, Taurasi traveled with the Mercury to Las Vegas on Thursday and is expected to play in Game 5. Whether that could change before tip-off is uncertain, but it's hard to imagine Phoenix prevailing without the WNBA career scoring leader.\n\nThe Mercury are 8-9 in games without Taurasi this season for three separate injuries. That includes a win over New York in a playoffs first-round single elimination game when Cunningham scored 21 off the bench. Phoenix also won a second-round single elimination game at Seattle.\n\nDiggins-Smith is averaging 11.5 points in the series, down from 17.7 in the regular season, and was just 6-of-17 shooting in Game 4.\n\n\"They changed their whole defensive plan against us,\" Brondello said. \"There was less trapping, they're going over on Dee (Taurasi) and Sky and every time downhill they're bringing a crowd. I still Sky got some pretty good looks, she just missed them. Dee's a little bit different because they're playing in her space and not giving her anything. We'll put her in some off ball action. Maybe we have to put her as a screener to get her open.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nNew York CNN Business —\n\nNASA has two new dates in mind — September 23 or September 27 — for the next attempt at launching its massive new moon rocket on an uncrewed test mission. But there are still several things that could stand in the way of getting the Artemis I mission off the ground, any of which could push the launch date back further.\n\nNASA is trying to work through a leaky fuel problem with the rocket, called the Space Launch System or SLS. During the last launch attempt at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday, September 3, the rocket sprung a big leak as it was being fueled up with super-chilled liquid hydrogen.\n\nAnd while the rocket is still on the pad, NASA is looking to troubleshoot that issue by repairing and replacing some seals before running tests to make sure all the leaks are plugged, NASA officials said at a Thursday press conference.\n\nIt’s not yet clear how long that will take.\n\nThen, there’s the issue with certification. The US Space Force, an arm of the military, still oversees all rocket launches from the United States’ East Coast, including NASA’s Florida launch site, and that area is known as the “Eastern Range.”\n\nThe officials at the range are tasked with making sure there’s no risk to people or property with any launch attempt. And that means the Eastern Range also must give NASA the thumbs up that the rocket’s Flight Termination System — a system that will essentially destroy the rocket mid-air if it veers off course and starts heading in a populated direction — is ready to fly.\n\nThat system relies on batteries, however, that, under current rules, must be recharged at a nearby indoor facility before the newly proposed launch dates arrive.\n\nNASA is hoping to get a waiver on that rule. But it’s not yet clear when or if that request will be granted. If NASA does not get that waiver approval, the SLS rocket will have to be rolled off the pad and back into the nearby Vehicle Assembly Building, triggering more delays.\n\n“If they decide that is not the right thing to do, we obviously will support that and stand down and look for our next launch attempt,” Jim Free, associate administrator for NASA’s Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, said at the Thursday press conference.\n\n“But we still will press with the tanking test,” he said, referring to the tests NASA plans to run to fix the hydrogen leaks while the rocket is still on the pad.\n\nThe Space Force’s Eastern Range said in a statement only that it “will review NASA’s request.” It declined to share details on timing.\n\nOn Thursday, NASA did give some insight into what it’s discovered about the leak issue, however. The space agency had already revealed that there was an “inadvertent pressurization of the hydrogen line,” putting it under 60 pounds per square inch of pressure rather than the 20 pounds per square inch they’d hoped, Michael Sarafin, Artemis Mission Manager, said Saturday.\n\nIt’s still not yet clear if that over-pressurization is what caused the leak, but NASA does know why the over-pressurization occurred in the first place — and human error was involved.\n\n“Our management team apologize to [the operator in charge of overseeing the process] because we had made some manual procedure changes between the attempt on Monday and attempt on Saturday,” Free said. “We practiced it during the week but they’d only had a couple of chances. So we didn’t as a leadership team, put our our operators in the best place we could have we rely really heavily on our credit team.”\n\nThat overpressurization is definitely something NASA wants to avoid, according to Free. NASA is looking for a “kinder and gentler, if you will, loading process.”\n\nFor now, there’s still a waiting game and a lot of “ifs” surrounding the timeline for the Artemis I launch. The ultimate goal of this project is to get the SLS rocket to orbit and deploy the Orion capsule, which is built for astronauts but will fly empty for this test mission. The capsule will go on to orbit the moon before making the 239,000 mile trek back home.\n\nThe Artemis I mission is just the beginning of a program that will aim to return humans to the moon and eventually land crewed missions on Mars.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nNew York (CNN Business) NASA's massive new moon rocket hit another snag during its latest attempt to launch an uncrewed test mission, and it will be at least a few weeks — rather than days — before the rocket can make its next attempt.\n\nThe longer delay can be attributed to several factors, including quirks of scheduling, possible traffic at the launch site, and NASA's desire to make sure it's solved the latest issues with leaky fuel.\n\nTo recap what went down on Saturday, September 3: Launch officials went confidently into this weekend's attempt to launch the rocket, called the Space Launch System or SLS. But then, as the rocket was once again being loaded with super-cold liquid hydrogen propellant, it sprung a big leak. And NASA said Tuesday that it will begin to attempt to correct those issues while the rocket is still on the launch pad.\n\nBut, eventually, the space agency will still need to roll the rocket back to the nearby Vehicle Assembly Building, a 4.2-mile trip that takes roughly 10 hours, in order to \"reset the system's batteries,\" according to a Tuesday blog post from NASA.\n\nAnd when it comes to setting a new launch date, timing will be complicated.\n\nTiming can be everything\n\nOn a given day, there are specific spans of time — or \"launch windows\" — set aside when the rocket is permitted to launch, and they can range from about a half hour to a few hours per day. But even those windows aren't available every day. There are also \" launch periods ,\" which are spans of days when the moon lines up with the Earth in a way that's favorable for this mission.\n\nThe latest launch period ended on Tuesday, September 6, and NASA had said there was no way the SLS would be ready to fly during that time.\n\nThe next launch period runs from September 19 to October 4. But there's another potential issue: NASA is planning to launch its Crew-5 mission , which will carry a fresh crew of astronauts to the International Space Station aboard a SpaceX rocket, on October 3. And NASA will have to work to make sure that one launch won't conflict with another.\n\nLater in October, yet another launch period will begin, running from October 17 to October 31. That period will offer up 11 possible launch windows for the SLS. (Note: there are no available launch times on October 24, 25, 26 and 28.)\n\nExactly which period and window NASA targets will depend on a variety of factors, including how well it can coordinate with SpaceX regarding the Crew-5 launch and how long the SLS rocket remains on the launch pad as engineers work through the leak issue, according to Jim Free, NASA's associate administrator for exploration systems development.\n\nSuper-cool fuel\n\nWhen the SLS rocket is fueled up, it requires massive amounts of super-chilled liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen to be pumped into the rocket's tanks. When loading the hydrogen, the fuel begins pumping in slowly but then ramps up its speed in what's called a \"fast fill.\" And it was during that fast fill that a \"large leak\" occurred — bigger even than the leaks that NASA identified during the August 29 launch attempt.\n\nThat's why launch officials want to make sure they pin down a fix and the root of the issue before making the next attempt. As of Saturday, one guess was that an issue with a valve may have caused the hydrogen to be overpressurized, putting it under 60 pounds per square inch of pressure rather than the 20 pounds per square inch they'd hoped, Michael Sarafin, Artemis Mission Manager, said Saturday.\n\nLeading up to Saturday, NASA had also tried to troubleshoot several issues it encountered during the first attempt to launch the SLS rocket on August 29. It addressed some leaks that occurred during fueling, and assessed the risks on an issue with an engine cooling system and a crack in some foam coating one of the rocket's tanks.\n\nNASA may choose to take another peek at those issues as it works toward the next launch attempt as well.\n\nFurther complicating the selection of the next target launch date is the precarious Florida weather. For any rocket launch, rough winds, lightning or other unfavorable conditions can force more delays. Late summer and early autumn can also bring hurricanes to the Florida coastline where the SLS sits.\n\nNASA is working through the possibilities, and the public can expect more answers in the coming days and weeks.\n\nThis is rocket science\n\nAs NASA officials have said before, they're hoping to convey that these delays and technical issues don't necessarily point to a significant issue with the rocket.\n\nBefore the SLS, NASA's Space Shuttle program, which flew for 20 years, endured frequent scrubbed launches. SpaceX's Falcon rockets also have a history of scrubs for mechanical or technical issues.\n\nThis is, after all, rocket science.\n\n\"I can tell you that these teams know exactly what they're doing, and I'm very proud of them,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Saturday. \"We tried to stress that this is a test and a test has certain risk, and we pounded that in every public comment that we had in order to get expectations in alignment with reality.\"\n\nFree, the NASA associate administrator, added that his team will always go into a launch attempt optimistic that liftoff will occur.\n\n\"I'm sure there's going to be a question of, 'Are we confident?'\" he said. \"I actually love that question because it's like (asking), 'Are you confident you were going to get out of bed this morning?''\n\nThis mission, called Artemis I, is expected to pave the way for numerous other missions to the moon. The Artemis II mission, slated for as early as next year, is expected to follow a similar flight path around the moon but will have crew on board.

The leak prevented the launch team from being able to fill the liquid hydrogen tank despite trying various troubleshooting procedures.\n\nPreviously, a small leak had been seen in this area, but it became a much larger leak on Saturday. The team believes an overpressurization event might have damaged the soft seal on the liquid hydrogen connection, but they will need to take a closer look.\n\n\"This was not a manageable leak,\" said Mike Sarafin, Artemis mission manager.\n\nIt's the second time in a week that the space agency has been forced to halt the launch countdown in the face of technical issues. The first launch attempt, on Monday, was called off after several issues arose, including with a system meant to cool the rocket's engines ahead of liftoff and various leaks that sprung up as the rocket was being fueled.\n\nThe liquid hydrogen leak was detected Saturday at 7:15 a.m. ET in the quick disconnect cavity that feeds the rocket with hydrogen in the engine section of the core stage. It was a different leak than one that occurred ahead of the scrubbed launch on Monday.\n\nThe launch controllers warmed up the line in an attempt to get a tight seal and the flow of liquid hydrogen resumed before a leak reoccurred. They stopped the flow of liquid hydrogen and proceeded to \"close the valve used to fill and drain it, then increase pressure on a ground transfer line using helium to try to reseal it,\" according to NASA.\n\nThat troubleshooting plan was not successful. The team attempted the first plan again to warm up the line, but the leak reoccurred after they manually restarted the flow of liquid hydrogen.\n\nThere was a 60% chance of favorable weather conditions for the launch, according to weather officer Melody Lovin.\n\nThe Artemis I stack, which includes the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft, continues to sit on Launchpad 39B at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nThe Artemis I mission is just the beginning of a program that will aim to return humans to the moon and eventually land crewed missions on Mars. Nelson said that the issues during the first two scrubs have not caused any delays to future Artemis program missions.\n\nJUST WATCHED Here's how NASA wants to send humans back to the moon Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Here's how NASA wants to send humans back to the moon 04:10\n\nIn the last few days, the launch team has taken time to address issues, like hydrogen leaks, that cropped up ahead of Monday's planned launch before it was scrubbed. The team has also completed a risk assessment of an engine conditioning issue and a foam crack that also cropped up, according to NASA officials.\n\nBoth were considered to be acceptable risks heading into the launch countdown, according to Mike Sarafin, Artemis mission manager.\n\nOn Monday, a sensor on one of the rocket's four RS-25 engines, identified as engine #3, reflected that the engine could not reach the proper temperature range required for the engine to start at liftoff.\n\nThe engines need to be thermally conditioned before super-cold propellant flows through them prior to liftoff. To prevent the engines from experiencing any temperature shocks, launch controllers gradually increase the pressure of the core stage liquid hydrogen tank in the hours before launch to send a small amount of liquid hydrogen to the engines. This is known as a \"bleed.\"\n\nThe team has since determined it was a bad sensor providing the reading -- they plan to ignore the faulty sensor moving forward, according to John Blevins, Space Launch Systems chief engineer.\n\nMission overview\n\nOnce Artemis I launches, Orion's journey will last 37 days as it travels to the moon, loops around it and returns to Earth -- traveling a total of 1.3 million miles (2.1 million kilometers).\n\nWhile the passenger list doesn't include any humans, it does have passengers: three mannequins and a plush Snoopy toy will ride in Orion.\n\nThe crew aboard Artemis I may sound a little unusual, but they each serve a purpose. Snoopy will serve as the zero gravity indicator -- meaning that he will begin to float inside the capsule once it reaches the space environment.\n\nAdditional science experiments and technology demonstrations are also riding in a ring on the rocket. From there, 10 small satellites, called CubeSats, will detach and go their separate ways to collect information on the moon and the deep space environment.\n\nCameras inside and outside of Orion will share images and video throughout the mission, including live views from the Callisto experiment , which will capture a stream of Commander Moonikin Campos sitting in the commander's seat. And if you have an Amazon Alexa-enabled device, you can ask it about the mission's location each day.\n\nExpect to see views of Earthrise similar to what was shared for the first time during the Apollo 8 mission back in 1968, but with much better cameras and technology.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland", "Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/09/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/tech/nasa-artemis-launch-date-update-scn?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_google", "title": "Artemis I: NASA is eyeing two dates in late September for launch ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nNew York CNN Business —\n\nNASA has two new dates in mind — September 23 or September 27 — for the next attempt at launching its massive new moon rocket on an uncrewed test mission. But there are still several things that could stand in the way of getting the Artemis I mission off the ground, any of which could push the launch date back further.\n\nNASA is trying to work through a leaky fuel problem with the rocket, called the Space Launch System or SLS. During the last launch attempt at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday, September 3, the rocket sprung a big leak as it was being fueled up with super-chilled liquid hydrogen.\n\nAnd while the rocket is still on the pad, NASA is looking to troubleshoot that issue by repairing and replacing some seals before running tests to make sure all the leaks are plugged, NASA officials said at a Thursday press conference.\n\nIt’s not yet clear how long that will take.\n\nThen, there’s the issue with certification. The US Space Force, an arm of the military, still oversees all rocket launches from the United States’ East Coast, including NASA’s Florida launch site, and that area is known as the “Eastern Range.”\n\nThe officials at the range are tasked with making sure there’s no risk to people or property with any launch attempt. And that means the Eastern Range also must give NASA the thumbs up that the rocket’s Flight Termination System — a system that will essentially destroy the rocket mid-air if it veers off course and starts heading in a populated direction — is ready to fly.\n\nThat system relies on batteries, however, that, under current rules, must be recharged at a nearby indoor facility before the newly proposed launch dates arrive.\n\nNASA is hoping to get a waiver on that rule. But it’s not yet clear when or if that request will be granted. If NASA does not get that waiver approval, the SLS rocket will have to be rolled off the pad and back into the nearby Vehicle Assembly Building, triggering more delays.\n\n“If they decide that is not the right thing to do, we obviously will support that and stand down and look for our next launch attempt,” Jim Free, associate administrator for NASA’s Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, said at the Thursday press conference.\n\n“But we still will press with the tanking test,” he said, referring to the tests NASA plans to run to fix the hydrogen leaks while the rocket is still on the pad.\n\nThe Space Force’s Eastern Range said in a statement only that it “will review NASA’s request.” It declined to share details on timing.\n\nOn Thursday, NASA did give some insight into what it’s discovered about the leak issue, however. The space agency had already revealed that there was an “inadvertent pressurization of the hydrogen line,” putting it under 60 pounds per square inch of pressure rather than the 20 pounds per square inch they’d hoped, Michael Sarafin, Artemis Mission Manager, said Saturday.\n\nIt’s still not yet clear if that over-pressurization is what caused the leak, but NASA does know why the over-pressurization occurred in the first place — and human error was involved.\n\n“Our management team apologize to [the operator in charge of overseeing the process] because we had made some manual procedure changes between the attempt on Monday and attempt on Saturday,” Free said. “We practiced it during the week but they’d only had a couple of chances. So we didn’t as a leadership team, put our our operators in the best place we could have we rely really heavily on our credit team.”\n\nThat overpressurization is definitely something NASA wants to avoid, according to Free. NASA is looking for a “kinder and gentler, if you will, loading process.”\n\nFor now, there’s still a waiting game and a lot of “ifs” surrounding the timeline for the Artemis I launch. The ultimate goal of this project is to get the SLS rocket to orbit and deploy the Orion capsule, which is built for astronauts but will fly empty for this test mission. The capsule will go on to orbit the moon before making the 239,000 mile trek back home.\n\nThe Artemis I mission is just the beginning of a program that will aim to return humans to the moon and eventually land crewed missions on Mars.

But there are still several things that could stand in the way of getting the Artemis I mission off the ground, any of which could push the launch date back further.\n\nThe companies so far tapped to join the military in exploring ways to bring that idea to fruition include Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, and, most recently, Rocket Lab, according to a Tuesday press release.\n\nTwo other startups, Colorado-based Sierra Space Corporation and the Richard Branson-backed company Virgin Orbit, have also signed deals.\n\nEssentially, the lineup is a who’s-who of the commercial “new space” sector — relatively young rocket companies that are already shaking up the business of getting satellites to orbit at cheaper price points.\n\nBut these deals with the military are something different. Rather than rockets leaving their freight in Earth’s orbit, this program aims to use them to get weapons, supplies or perhaps even people from one country to another at speeds far surpassing that of other types of transportation.\n\nAnd that’s because rockets have a speed advantage over airplanes. Rockets that can shoot into the high atmosphere have much less air to cut through as they zoom over the planet. With less air dragging them back, they can go much faster than something that needs air to move, like a jet. The tradeoff, however, is that rockets tend to be far more expensive than aircraft.\n\n“Imagine traveling from the continental United States to anywhere in the Pacific region and measuring your transit time in minutes,” reads an August press release from the military’s US Transportation Command. “Picture the U.S. delivering assistance to an ally needing disaster relief, or combating an adversary planning provocative actions against U.S. national interests at rocket-speed.”\n\nIt’s a similar idea to one employed by the largest militaries in the world for decades, that of the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. But while those are designed to slam into the Earth at hypersonic speeds when they reach their target, the idea here is for the payload to come to a gentle landing.\n\nThe contracts fall under a program headed by the Air Force Research Laboratory, simply called “Rocket Cargo.” And it’s one of the Air Force Department’s four “Vanguard Programs,” which are high-profile projects pegged for accelerated development.\n\nThe military’s current investment in the program is “small,” according to a May statement from Air Force deputy assistant secretary Kristen Baldwin, though the goal is for the military to influence “early commercial design efforts and leverages $5-10B ongoing industry and NASA investments.”\n\nThe idea of using rockets for point-to-point travel on Earth isn’t new. SpaceX, for example, has advertised that its forthcoming Starship rocket could be used to shuttle paying customers from New York to Shanghai in 40 minutes.\n\nThat option remains a long way off for consumers. And broadly speaking, rockets making point-to-point trips are still a distant goal. The trips would be extremely expensive as well as technologically and geopolitically complicated. (There aren’t, after all, a ton of pressing reasons to get people or cargo from one place to another at breakneck speeds.) But with current trends in the burgeoning commercial space industry, some believe it’s inevitable. The market for hypersonic passenger travel could be a $20 billion per-year industry, UBS estimated in 2019.\n\nAnd the military’s goal with the Rocket Cargo program, which was first announced last year, is to get involved with such efforts early in the hopes that it can quickly put that tech to work for the US and allies when it is available.\n\n“Logistics speed is at the heart of military supremacy. If a commercial company is in advanced development for a new capability to move materiel faster, then [the Department of Defense] needs to promptly engage and seek to be early adopters,” according to the program’s website.\n\nFor its part, Rocket Lab plans to use its new deal with the military to explore ways of using its Electron rocket — which the company hopes will also be reusable if it can figure out how to capture it with a helicopter mid-air after launch — to shuttle cargo around the Earth as well as a larger, forthcoming rocketing called Neutron.\n\nAdditionally, the company hopes to explore how it might use its Photon spacecraft to establish “cargo depots” in Earth’s orbit that will have the ability to re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere and get needed supplies to a targeted area, according to a press release.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/25/tech/boeing-starliner-landing-oft-2-scn/index.html", "title": "Boeing's Starliner capsule makes safe return from test mission ...", "text": "New York (CNN Business) Boeing's Starliner spacecraft made a safe return home from its five-day stay at the International Space Station on Wednesday, concluding a long-awaited test mission that could pave the way for the Starliner to launch astronauts for the first time later this year.\n\nA Boeing Starliner capsule is lowered to Earth underneath three parachutes as it landed in the New Mexico desert.

It will be the twelfth Starlink launch so far this year, and it could be followed over the weekend with another mission set to take off out of Florida.\n\nIt's been an dizzying year of activity so far, further cementing SpaceX's dominance over the commercial launch industry.

Space correspondent Kristin Fisher will bring us moment-by-moment reporting from the launch, along with a team of experts.\n\nAlmost 50 years after the last Apollo mission ventured to the lunar surface, NASA has established a program that promises to land humans on unexplored lunar regions and eventually the surface of Mars -- and it all begins with Artemis I.\n\nIt's no coincidence that the Artemis program is named for the twin sister of Apollo from Greek mythology. Artemis will pick up where the famed Apollo program left off in 1972 by sending crewed missions to the moon, but in a new way.\n\nGoals of the Artemis program include landing diverse crews of astronauts on the moon and exploring the shadowy lunar south pole for the first time. The ambitious effort also aims to establish a sustained presence on the moon and create reusable systems that can enable human exploration of Mars and perhaps beyond.\n\nBut none of this is possible without first taking one big leap. When Artemis I launches on September 3, the uncrewed mission will test every new component that will make future deep space exploration possible before humans make the journey in 2024 and 2025 aboard Artemis II and Artemis III, respectively.\n\nThe mission team expects liftoff of the new Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft on Saturday from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nAfter launching from Earth, Artemis I will go on a 37-day mission. During the journey, the Orion spacecraft will travel 40,000 miles (64,000 kilometers) beyond the moon -- 30,000 miles (48,000 kilometers) farther than the record set during Apollo 13. This path mimics the journey that the Artemis II crew will take in 2024.\n\nIt will be the farthest that any spacecraft built for humans has flown, according to NASA officials.\n\nHistoric launchpad 39B is no stranger to monster rockets, as NASA Administrator Bill Nelson pointed out at a news conference earlier in August. It was once the home of the Saturn V rocket, which carried the Apollo missions to the moon and lifted off with 7.6 million pounds of thrust. The SLS rocket will punch off the pad with 8.8 million pounds of thrust.\n\n\"As we embark on the first Artemis test flight, we recall this agency's storied past, but our eyes are focused not on the immediate future but out there,\" Nelson said.\n\n\"It's a future where NASA will land the first woman and the first person of color on the moon. And on these increasingly complex missions, astronauts will live and work in deep space and we'll develop the science and technology to send the first humans to Mars.\"\n\nA new generation of exploration\n\nReturning to the moon, with an eye on an eventual trip to Mars, requires a new ride.\n\nLessons learned from the Apollo and shuttle programs informed the design of the Space Launch System rocket, the world's most powerful rocket. The mega moon rocket will propel the spacecraft almost 1,000 times farther than the International Space Station's location in low-Earth orbit. The SLS rocket will boost Orion to a speed of 22,600 miles per hour (36,370 kilometers per hour) to escape Earth's gravity and reach the moon.\n\n\"It's the only rocket that's capable of sending Orion and a crew and supplies into deep space on a single launch,\" said John Honeycutt, Space Launch System program manager at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nAtop the rocket is the Orion spacecraft, designed to carry a crew through deep space and safely return the astronauts to Earth.\n\nThe spacecraft has a crew module, a service module and a launch abort system that has the capability to take the spacecraft and its crew to safety during any emergency that could occur during launch or ascent. Orion's trajectory through space will test the craft's ability to maintain communication with Earth beyond the moon and protect its crew from radiation.\n\nBeneath Orion is the European Service Module.\n\n\"It's the power house side of the vehicle where it's got the primary propulsion, power and life support resources we need for Artemis I,\" said Howard Hu, Orion program manager at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\nThe Orion spacecraft has hardware and software that will allow future crews to have complete insight into what's happening with their vehicle when they are thousands of miles from home, Hu said.\n\nOne of the biggest trials for Orion may be testing its heat shield, the largest one ever built.\n\nWhen the spacecraft returns to Earth in October, it will face temperatures half as hot as the sun's surface and hit the top of Earth's atmosphere at 25,000 miles per hour (40,200 kilometers per hour) -- that's 32 times the speed of sound, Nelson said.\n\n\"Orion will come home faster and hotter than any spacecraft has before at 32 Mach,\" Nelson said. \"On the space shuttle, we were at 25 Mach, which is about 17,500 miles an hour (28,160 kilometers per hour).\" (Mach 1 is the speed of sound.)\n\nThe heat shield has been tested on Earth, but returning from space is the one true test that simulations can't completely replicate.\n\n\"Re-entry will be great to demonstrate our heat shield capability, making sure that the spacecraft comes home safely, and of course for future missions, protecting the crew,\" Hu said.\n\nThe ultimate test\n\nAll of the objectives for the inaugural Artemis flight will demonstrate capabilities necessary for when Orion carries humans to deep space. The list includes an overall safe flight, the performance of the SLS rocket, testing the heat shield and retrieving the spacecraft once it splashes down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego.\n\nOrion won't carry a crew on this initial mission, but it will be full of data from the flight -- including sensors attached to some very necessary passengers. Three mannequins will ride aboard Artemis I to simulate what humans might experience, and the data from their sensors will reveal how much vibration they experienced, as well as radiation exposure and the utility of their flight suits and radiation vests.\n\nBecause Artemis I is a test flight, the Artemis team is willing to take more risks, said Mike Sarafin, NASA's Artemis I mission manager. Taking these risks now can eliminate issues when actual crew are aboard, he said.\n\nBut more than all of the data and science the mission team will garner is the idea of resuming human space exploration by taking a big step forward from Apollo to Artemis.\n\n\"Artemis I shows that we can do big things things that unite people, things that benefit humanity -- things like Apollo that inspire the world,\" Nelson said. \"And to all of us that gaze up at the moon, dreaming of the day humankind returns to the lunar surface: Folks, we're here, we are going back and that journey, our journey, begins with Artemis I.\"", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/04/tech/blue-origin-launch-space-for-humanity-scn/index.html", "title": "Blue Origin launches first Mexican-born woman to go to space ...", "text": "New York (CNN Business) A rocket built by Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin carried its fifth group of passengers to the edge of space, including the first-ever Mexican-born woman to make such a journey.\n\nThe 60-foot-tall suborbital rocket took off from Blue Origin's facilities in West Texas at 9:26am ET, vaulting a group of six people to more than 62 miles above the Earth's surface — which is widely deemed to make the boundary of outer space — and giving them a few minutes of weightlessness before parachuting to landing.\n\nMost of the passengers paid an undisclosed sum for their seats.

They’ll spend all day Thursday free flying through orbit as their spacecraft maneuvers closer to the edge of the Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nThe four astronauts on the Crew-3 mission are NASA’s Raja Chari, Tom Marshburn, and Kayla Barron, as well a German astronaut with the ESA, Matthias Maurer.\n\nAfter the capsule made a safe landing, bobbing up and down in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, Chari told mission control: “Thanks for letting us take [Crew Dragon] Endurance on a shakedown cruise.”\n\n“Looking forward to watching many more flights of Endurance in the future,” he said, using the “Endurance” name bestowed on Crew-3’s capsule. “That was a great ride. Enjoyed working with the NASA and SpaceX team. Thanks for getting us to the space station and back safely.”\n\nThis will mark the conclusion of SpaceX’s third operational mission to the ISS that the company has conducted in partnership with NASA.\n\nSpaceX has had a whirlwind month of activity. It kicked off with the launch of the private AX-1 mission to the ISS on April 8, and the company brought that crew home just last week. Then SpaceX launched the Crew-4 astronauts, who will replace the Crew-3 astronauts on the ISS staff, last Wednesday, then immediately began gearing up for Crew-3’s return. Meanwhile, the company’s Falcon 9 rocket has kept busy launching satellites to orbit, which includes a batch of the company’s Starlink internet satellites, just last Friday.\n\nFalcon 9 rockets have already notched 17 launches so far this year.\n\nThe intent of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon program was to return astronaut launches to the United States for the first time since NASA’s Space Shuttle program retired in 2011, allowing NASA to keep the space station fully staffed with its own astronauts as well as astronauts from partner space agencies such as the European Space Agency (ESA).

But last month's ruling that found there was no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion could drive even more attention to the Senate since it's Congress that would set any future nationwide abortion policies.\n\nPressed on how to respond to the ruling in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash last month, Vice President Kamala Harris repeatedly said, \"There's an election happening.\"\n\nFor Democrats or Democratic-leaning voters, especially those feeling uninspired by Biden's first term so far, the ruling could motivate them to vote this fall. It remains to be seen, however, how much of that energy is sustainable and to what degree the ruling also persuades independents or moderate Republicans to vote Democratic. In the immediate term, the elimination of federal abortion rights has resulted in Democratic outside groups such as Planned Parenthood Votes and Women Vote! , the super PAC arm of EMILY's List, going up on the air attacking Republicans.\n\nAnother bright spot for Democrats, underscored by the abortion issue, is that the Senate playing field includes states such as Nevada, New Hampshire and Colorado that have recently voted blue. In fact, seven of the 10 races on this list of seats most likely to flip are in states Biden won in 2020.\n\nThe addition of Colorado at No. 10 on this latest ranking, however, speaks to the challenging national environment for Democrats. Economic issues -- high inflation and gas prices this summer travel season -- are still weighing on voters and are often cited as their most pressing concern. Republicans have also tried tapping into Americans' post-pandemic anxieties about safety, with ads suggesting Democrats are soft on crime. Some Democratic candidates have worked to get ahead of those attacks early by featuring uniformed police in their own spots and directly refuting the idea of \"defunding the police.\"\n\nBesides Colorado's appearance on the list, the biggest change to this month's ranking is Nevada and Georgia trading places. It may seem somewhat counterintuitive, especially in this era of hyper-nationalized elections and considering Nevada is a more Democratic state than Georgia. But the change was driven by the candidate matchups in the two states, as things stand now. The ranking is based on CNN's reporting, fundraising and advertising data, and polling, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed.\n\nJust a handful of important Senate primaries that will shape the November midterms remain. They key ones to watch in August and September: The Republican primaries in Arizona, Missouri and New Hampshire and the Democratic primary in Wisconsin.\n\n1. Pennsylvania\n\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\n\nThe start of the general election in the Keystone State was a mixed bag for Democrats trying to flip the seat of retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey. Their nominee, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, was sidelined by a stroke just before he won the primary and has been off the trail recuperating. But then they got the Republican opponent they wanted in celebrity surgeon Mehmet Oz.\n\nThe Donald Trump -backed candidate narrowly won the GOP nomination after a recount, but not without his image taking a serious hit -- weeks of attack ads from Republican rival Dave McCormick and his allies had driven up Oz's negatives. (In a Fox survey ahead of the primary, for example, 46% of GOP voters had an unfavorable view of Oz.) The race is expected to tighten as some of those Republican voters get behind Oz now that he's the party nominee.\n\nBut Democrats' message is picking up where the primary left off. Fetterman's TV spots , which lean into an \"us vs. Washington\" theme that never mentions the candidate's party ID, repeat that he's \"from Pennsylvania, for Pennsylvania\" -- an implicit knock on Oz, who has said he moved from New Jersey in late 2020. Republicans are equally happy to be running against Fetterman, a former Bernie Sanders supporter who handily defeated his more moderate primary challenger. But in a state that Biden carried and with the GOP primary forcing Oz to the right, this seat is still the most likely to flip in the fall.\n\n2. Nevada\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\n\nNevada moves up one spot, trading places with Georgia, where the fundamentals of the state (for example, past presidential performance) would seem to give Republicans a better chance of unseating a Democratic incumbent. But the Republican Senate nominee in the Silver State, former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, is a more tested candidate than the GOP nominee in Georgia, ex-NFL star Herschel Walker.\n\nThat may not be saying much considering Walker, a political neophyte, is widely seen as the biggest wild-card candidate of the cycle and Laxalt lost his last bid for statewide office (the 2018 gubernatorial race). Laxalt, however, has held statewide office before and is the grandson of the former governor and senator with the same last name. Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, who was on the ballot just last year, also started the cycle as a better defined (and funded) Democratic incumbent than Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, who hasn't faced voters in this transient state in six years. Masto has a tough road ahead, to be sure -- and fissures in the state Democratic Party aren't helping -- but the Supreme Court ruling on abortion could work in Democrats' favor in a state where even the most recent GOP governor supported abortion rights.\n\nLaxalt sought to downplay the political impact of the court's decision last month, saying in a statement that abortion rights were \"settled law\" in the state. But that likely won't stop Democrats from pointing to his praise for the decision and arguing that he'd be another Republican vote in the Senate should Congress attempt to pass an abortion ban.\n\n3. Georgia\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\n\nEven Democrats are somewhat skeptical about a recent Quinnipiac University poll that showed Warnock, who's running for a full six-year term after winning a special election last year, ahead of GOP challenger Walker by 10 points among registered voters. But even if that margin was too big to be true -- there aren't yet many other public surveys for comparison -- it was notably wider than Georgia's gubernatorial matchup, suggesting there's something specific to this race, rather than the poll itself, going on here.\n\nThe margin was also a departure from Warnock's and Walker's neck-and-neck standing in Quinnipiac's January poll, which could reflect recent troublesome headlines for Walker, who received negative ratings for honesty in the June survey. His campaign recently acknowledged , for example, that he has three children by women he was not married to, in addition to his son by his former wife. That's opened him up to charges of hypocrisy given his public criticism of absentee fathers, especially in Black families. (Walker just went up with his first ad of the general election, and the positive spot -- a hybrid ad paid for by the National Republican Senatorial Committee -- doesn't offer more than bland platitudes about him wanting to serve Georgia.)\n\nWhat's most encouraging for Democrats facing a tough national environment may be that Warnock is still viewed more positively than Biden. The senator's job approval rating was at 49% in the Quinnipiac poll, compared with 33% for the President. That's some impressive separation the first-term senator has been able to create from the White House in a state not predisposed to vote Democratic. The poll was mostly conducted after the Supreme Court's abortion decision on June 24, so Warnock's advantage over Walker may also reflect some of the immediate backlash to that ruling, which won't necessarily be sustained through the fall.\n\nThe good news for Republicans? A plurality of Georgians said inflation was the most urgent issue facing the state, which means the GOP still has four months to double down on messages like this one, from One Nation , accusing Warnock of voting for \"reckless spending\" that, the ad contends, has led to higher costs for Georgians.\n\n4. Arizona\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\n\nArizona is hosting one of the few outstanding GOP primaries that will help shape how competitive things are in the fall. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is running for a full six-year term after winning a special election in 2020. He's used his fundraising advantage to go on the air while his would-be GOP opponents duke it out amongst themselves.\n\nTrump-backed Blake Masters has the support of billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel and the Club for Growth. Solar energy entrepreneur Jim Lamon is largely self-funding his campaign, which has spent nearly $8 million on TV, including future reservations, according to AdImpact data from the beginning of July. State Attorney General Mark Brnovich -- a frequent Trump target for having helped certify Biden's win in the state -- was once thought to have been the front-runner because he holds statewide elected office, but there's little sign he's put together a competitive campaign.\n\n5. Wisconsin\n\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\n\nSen. Ron Johnson is the most vulnerable Republican incumbent of 2022. And with his favorability numbers mired in the 30s, it's no surprise his campaign has been rolling out a series of positive ads featuring constituents testifying directly to the camera about what a good senator he's been. In a June Marquette Law School poll , 37% of Wisconsin voters viewed Johnson favorably. The two-term senator, who broke a term limit pledge to run again, has been known to generate controversy . Revelations that his office was involved in an effort to send then-Vice President Mike Pence a slate of fake electors prompted several of his Democratic challengers to call on him to resign. (Johnson has dismissed the story , saying they were staff-level discussions.)\n\nBut Democrats have discounted him before. His 41% favorability rating in October 2016 -- just before he won a second term -- isn't much better than his numbers now. And even if their incumbent isn't in as strong a position as they'd like, the good news for Republicans is that Biden's job approval in the Badger State is at 40% -- the lowest mark in Marquette's polling since he took office. GOP enthusiasm to vote also outpaced Democratic enthusiasm -- 67% to 58% -- in the Marquette survey.\n\nThe task for Democrats, who pick their nominee on August 9, is to show that Johnson has changed and is no longer the senator Wisconsinites elected twice. The primary is the last truly unsettled Democratic contest in a competitive general election state. Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes continues to lead the primary field with 25% in the Marquette poll, but his lead over Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry (21%) is within the margin of error. State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski was at 9%, while Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson was at 7%. Marquette tested hypothetical general election matchups for the first time this cycle, finding a margin-of-error contest regardless of the pairing.\n\n6. New Hampshire\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\n\nA recent 30-second, direct-to-camera spot from Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan says a lot about the contours of this race. \"The Supreme Court has taken away a woman's most fundamental freedom,\" the first-year senator says, before raising the specter of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and a GOP-controlled Senate trying to ban abortion nationwide.\n\nHassan is running for reelection in a state that increasingly votes blue in federal elections and has a GOP governor who supports abortion rights. Still, a bad national environment for Democrats, combined with the Granite State's swingy nature, has Hassan on notice. Even if most of her would-be GOP challengers aren't very well known ahead of the September 13 primary, it may not take much more than a generic Republican to unseat her if that's the way the winds are blowing in November.\n\nThat explains why Hassan, whose campaign announced it had raised more than $5 million in the second quarter, is using the Supreme Court's abortion ruling to try to shift the conversation toward a hypothetical Republican-controlled Washington that New Hampshire voters may not like. The great unknown, however, is whether frustrations with the economy and dissatisfaction with the direction of the country will outweigh other concerns in November.\n\n7. North Carolina\n\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\n\nRepublican Rep. Ted Budd enters the general election with a built-in advantage in the race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Richard Burr given that Trump twice carried the state. And while the conservative congressman's fundraising hasn't impressed, outside GOP groups are carrying the weight on TV, attacking Democratic nominee Cheri Beasley's judicial record. Local TV stations took down one of those ads, but the soft-on-crime attack line is a central message Republicans are deploying against the first Black woman elected as chief justice to the state Supreme Court.\n\nBeasley has responded by touting her law enforcement support, including with a spot that features sheriffs and police captains . \"Cheri's always had our backs, and we know she always will,\" Richmond County Sheriff Mark Gulledge says. Another recent Beasley ad tries to distance the candidate from Democratic control of Washington, as she says, \"Neither political party is getting it right\" while promising to hold Washington accountable.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are trying to portray Budd, who was boosted by the campaign arm of the Club for Growth in the primary, as too extreme for the state. Senate Majority PAC, a major Democratic super PAC, invested in this race after initially leaving it off its early reservations -- a sign that Democrats haven't counted this one out even if it's less of a priority than other GOP-held seats in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\n8. Florida\n\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\n\nGOP Sen. Marco Rubio still has the advantage in this race, but Democratic Rep. Val Demings, who's heavily favored to win the Senate nomination on August 23, is keeping the race interesting by raising impressive money.\n\nWhile Rubio has the backing of some major law enforcement groups in the state, Demings is leaning into her background as the former Orlando police chief to try to refute his attempts to tie her to the national party. \"In the Senate, I'll protect Florida from bad ideas like defunding the police. That's just crazy,\" she says in her first ad\n\nBut in a state that has grown incrementally Republican in recent elections, Demings would face a difficult general election against Rubio, who has built a national profile over his two terms in the Senate and should benefit from political tailwinds this fall.\n\n9. Ohio\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\n\nRep. Tim Ryan, the Democrat running an uphill campaign to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman, is also trying to show his support for law enforcement. \"Tim Ryan knows defunding the police is ridiculous,\" the Stark County sheriff says in a recent ad for the Democratic nominee.\n\nRyan, a 10-term congressman who easily won his May primary, is up against \"Hillbilly Elegy\" author JD Vance , who emerged from one of the ugliest GOP contests of the cycle helped by Trump's backing. The former President has twice won Ohio, which hasn't been very hospitable of late to Democrats running for federal statewide office -- US Sen. Sherrod Brown being the notable exception.\n\nThat's why Ryan, who once challenged Nancy Pelosi for House Democratic leader, is being vocal about distancing himself from his party. \"When (President Barack) Obama's trade deal threatened jobs here, I voted against it,\" he says in another ad as he walks through Youngstown sporting a gray hoodie. \"And I voted with Trump on trade,\" he adds, trying to project an image of Buckeye State authenticity. It's not clear that'll be enough against a Trump-backed candidate in a nationalized election, but it may be Ryan's best shot. And with his campaign announcing that he raised $9 million in the second quarter that ended June 30, it looks like he'll at least have the resources to carry that message.\n\n10. Colorado\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Michael Bennet\n\nColorado steals the 10th spot on this list from Missouri. What's going on in the Centennial State? Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet is running for a third full term against businessman Joe O'Dea, whose emergence from last month's GOP primary makes this race competitive. (Democrats had spent millions trying to help his primary opponent win because they thought he'd be a weaker general election candidate.)\n\nAs a Republican who supports abortion rights in the early stages of pregnancy, O'Dea brings a unique profile to the race. Colorado has trended blue in recent federal elections -- Biden won it by more than 13 points in 2020, the same year GOP Sen. Cory Gardner was unseated by 9 points. But Bennet's previous elections have been close. In 2016, for example, he prevailed by only about 6 points against an underwhelming opponent whom the national GOP had abandoned. Against a more formidable Republican challenger in a tough year for Democrats, Bennet could be vulnerable.\n\nIn Missouri, meanwhile, the Republican field is still unsettled ahead of the August 2 primary. Looming over the party is the possibility of disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens winning the nomination, which is the only way this seat would be competitive for Democrats.\n\nThe entrance of independent candidate John Wood could potentially complicate the race. Wood, a former senior investigator for the House January 6 committee, describes himself as a \"lifelong Republican\" and has said he would back McConnell for Senate leader, if elected. But if Greitens is the GOP nominee, Wood's candidacy could end up splitting the anti-Greitens vote in the general election, making it more likely the controversial Republican keeps this seat in party hands. We'll revisit Missouri's spot on the list after the crucial GOP primary.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct Adam Laxalt's relationship to the former Nevada governor and senator with the same last name.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/politics/senate-race-rankings-september-elections/index.html", "title": "The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 - CNNPolitics", "text": "CNN —\n\nA lot can change in a couple of months. Democrats now face a midterm environment that looks decidedly brighter than it was in the middle of the summer.\n\nThere were glimmers of optimism back in July for the party trying to hold on to its narrow Senate majority, in the immediate aftermath of the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The ruling appeared to energize the Democratic base – something the party had been struggling with given President Joe Biden’s low approval ratings.\n\nStrong performances by Democrats in special House elections and a defeated anti-abortion ballot initiative in deep-red Kansas have given them more confidence that running on abortion, especially when framed in terms of rights and liberties, can be effective.\n\nOn top of that, Democrats have enacted a sweeping health care, tax and climate law, gas prices have come down and former President Donald Trump has thrust himself back in the headlines by revealing the FBI’s search of his Mar-a-Lago home, offering a foil for Biden and the party in power.\n\nAt the individual Senate race level, Republican candidates are struggling – both with fundraising, which is nothing new, and with how to adapt to a general electorate after months of trying to appeal to Trump and his base during the primaries. There have been frequent stories, for example, about GOP nominees scrubbing their websites of Trump-centric rhetoric and hard-line anti-abortion stances.\n\nIt hasn’t helped that the two men who are ostensibly in charge of winning Republicans the Senate – Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Florida Sen. Rick Scott, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee – have sparred publicly about midterm strategy. “Candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome,” McConnell said last month, before later describing the GOP’s chances of flipping the Senate as a “50/50 proposition.” Scott responded in an op-ed without mentioning the Kentucky Republican by name, writing, “If you want to trash-talk our candidates to help Democrats, pipe down.”\n\nThe shifting winds, both nationally and in specific races, have resulted in several changes to this month’s ranking of the top 10 Senate seats most likely to flip since CNN’s last list in July. The ranking is based on CNN’s reporting, fundraising and advertising data, and polling, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. Wisconsin, where Sen. Ron Johnson is the only Republican running for reelection in a state Biden carried, moves up the list as several public polls show him in a vulnerable position. And Arizona, where Republican Blake Masters has struggled to fundraise, moves down the list as allies have either not yet come to his defense or have actively moved money away from his race to shore up seats such as Ohio, which bumps up one spot in the rankings – at least for now.\n\nDespite the recent good news for Democrats and the structural fact that this year’s battleground states were largely won by Biden two years ago, Republicans still have a good shot of winning the Senate, especially with the economy in flux. All they need is a net gain of one seat. Biden’s approval numbers may have improved slightly in certain polls, but that’s not saying much considering most Americans still disapprove of his performance. And the historical trend of first-term presidents seeing their party lose congressional majorities in the midterms looms large.\n\n1. Pennsylvania\n\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\n\nSarah Silbiger/Pool/Getty Images\n\nAmid all the viral jeering in Pennsylvania – whether over crudités or Snooki – the real question heading into the post-Labor Day sprint is whether Republican voters will “come home” for Senate nominee Mehmet Oz. That is: Will they show up and cast their ballots for the celebrity doctor, who doesn’t seem to have used the summer to try to repair his image after an ugly May primary? That’s one reason why Pennsylvania, which Biden narrowly won in 2020, remains the seat most likely to flip this fall, as Oz and Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman vie to replace retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey.\n\nBut in this critical battleground, which saw visits from both Biden and Trump over the holiday weekend, the race is expected to tighten – the question is by how much. As it tries to make up lost ground, Oz’s campaign has been mocking Fetterman’s health in the wake of his May stroke – an unusual and arguably risky strategy coming from a cardiothoracic surgeon. (Fetterman, newly back on the trail, struggles with “auditory processing,” his campaign has acknowledged.) Outside Republicans are sticking to a more predictable script, trying to paint Fetterman, who backed Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 campaign for president, as weak on crime.\n\nThe Democrat has responded in ads of his own by mocking Oz’s “Gucci loafers” and arguing that he couldn’t hack it in Braddock, the western Pennsylvania borough where Fetterman served as mayor. “We did whatever it took to fund our police,” Fetterman says in one spot – an example of how Democratic candidates this cycle are trying to get ahead of GOP efforts to tie them to “defund the police” rhetoric.\n\n2. Nevada\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\n\nCNN\n\nNevada, a state that Biden won by about 2 points in 2020, remains the seat second most likely to flip. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto didn’t start off the cycle as well defined as other swing-state Democratic incumbents facing reelection for the first time, and she’s running in a state with a transient population where economic concerns remain pressing. Her challenger, former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt – the grandson of a former governor and senator with the same last name – secured support early on from both McConnell and Trump and comfortably won his primary in June.\n\nBut if there’s one issue that could work in Democrats’ favor come November, regardless of economic conditions, it may be abortion. A recent ad from Cortez Masto uses audio of Laxalt calling Roe v. Wade a “joke.” The Republican has attempted to defuse such efforts to paint him as a threat to abortion rights, arguing in an August op-ed that he does not support a national abortion ban and that voters already settled Nevada’s “pro-choice” policy. However, both Democrats and Republicans acknowledge that the issue of abortion has some power here to make a difference. Whether it’ll be salient enough for voters when they enter the voting booth, however, remains to be seen.\n\n3. Wisconsin\n\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\n\nLeigh VogelPool/Getty Images\n\nThe Badger State moves up two spots on this list, with the seat now looking more likely to flip than it did in the middle of the summer.\n\nAt least two public polls have suggested GOP incumbent Ron Johnson is in trouble against Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who easily won last month’s Democratic primary after his closest challengers dropped out and endorsed him. Barnes was at 50% to Johnson’s 46% among registered voters in Fox’s mid-August survey, which was within the poll’s margin of error. In a Marquette Law School poll taken around the same time, Barnes led Johnson 51% to 44%. In both surveys, inflation was the most important issue to voters, which should benefit Republicans. (Voters who said inflation was the most important issue for their Senate vote overwhelmingly broke for Johnson in the Fox poll.) As it has in other states, the GOP-aligned nonprofit group One Nation has tried in ads to tie “Washington spending” to rising consumer prices. But the Marquette survey found that voters were less concerned about inflation than they had been in June, thanks to falling gas prices and costs – a positive trajectory for Democrats.\n\nNow that they have an opponent, however, Republicans are going hard after Barnes, arguing that his numbers will look different once they’re done with their attacks. The GOP playbook so far has been to try to tie Barnes to the “squad” of House progressives, with the NRSC saying he’s “not just a Democrat, but a dangerous Democrat” in an ad about ending cash bail. Wisconsin Truth PAC, a pro-Johnson super PAC, ran an ad saying Barnes “supports defunding the police” – which the Democrat calls a “lie” in his own spot that features him unpacking groceries.\n\n4. Georgia\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\n\nMegan Varner/Getty Images\n\nGeorgia lands at No. 4 this month, with Wisconsin moving up. While the Peach State went blue in 2020 and elected two Democratic senators in runoffs last year, voters here have otherwise been accustomed to voting for Republicans statewide. That means Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who’s seeking a full six-year term in November, is in for a tough reelection regardless of the tailwinds his party may be picking up elsewhere.\n\nBut the wild card here is his GOP opponent, Herschel Walker, a Trump recruit whom many Republicans had tried to keep out of this race. A new ad from a Democratic outside group uses footage of the candidate and his ex-wife describing how he once put a gun to her head. (Walker has said he has dissociative identity disorder, which was previously known as multiple personality disorder, and has sought to advise people with mental health problems.) Walker has raised decent money – although his haul still pales in comparison with Warnock’s – and observers credit a staff shakeup for helping the Republican get his campaign on track.\n\nStill, Democrats think they have plenty to attack him on, including his habit of saying controversial or illogical things when he goes off script. While Warnock has worked to build an identity that’s his own and to explain the health care, tax and climate law in his ads, Republicans have been trying to tie him to Biden and to blame the President’s agenda – and Warnock’s votes for it – for the pain Georgia voters are feeling in the grocery checkout line.\n\n5. Arizona\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\n\nCourtney Pedroza/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Kelly, who’s running for a full six-year term in November, faces a tough reelection because of the ancestrally red state he’s running in. But Arizona drops a spot on this list in light of his challenger’s struggles. Republican Blake Masters won the early August primary with backing from Trump and financial support from billionaire tech mogul Peter Thiel. But as CNN has reported, Thiel isn’t committing to getting him over the finish line – and Masters himself has struggled to raise money to compete with Kelly. And if he was counting on outside funding propping him up, that’s mostly gone for now – the GOP super PAC Senate Leadership Fund cut its September ad reservations for Masters while it moved money around to Ohio. (It still has airtime reserved in October.)\n\nMasters has earned media attention for scrubbing his website of language that included the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, along with a section arguing that the country would be better off if Trump were still president, and some strict anti-abortion positions – a sign of how Republicans are trying to distance themselves from previously held abortion stances heading into the general election. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is attacking Masters on abortion, with one ad featuring a testimonial from a female voter: “Blake Masters has no idea what I went through, and he has no business making that decision for me.”\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are still hoping the conservative DNA of Arizona, which backed Biden narrowly in 2020, will help their candidate, with the NRSC blasting what it calls Kelly’s “radical, extreme America.”\n\n6. New Hampshire\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\n\nErin Scott/Getty Images\n\nNew Hampshire is the only competitive state with an outstanding primary. The September 13 Republican contest will decide who’s taking on first-term Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan – and potentially how competitive that November election will be.\n\nRetired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, who unsuccessfully sought the state’s other Senate seat in 2020, led the GOP field with 43% among likely primary voters, well ahead of state Senate President Chuck Morse’s 22%, according to an August Granite State Poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. That could be a concern for Republicans looking to flip this seat. Gov. Chris Sununu, whose late decision not to challenge Hassan left the GOP without a field-clearing candidate, recently called Bolduc “kind of a conspiracy theorist-type candidate.” Besides going hard right, Bolduc lacks resources. He’d raised just $579,000 by the end of the pre-primary reporting period on August 24, compared with Hassan’s $31.4 million.\n\nThe fear that Bolduc could jeopardize their chances of flipping the seat has prompted outside Republicans to boost Morse on the airwaves, which in turn has Democrats’ Senate Majority PAC attacking him. And in a sign of Republican optimism about this race, the Senate Leadership Fund has said it’s planning to spend $23 million for fall TV reservations here.\n\n7. North Carolina\n\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\n\nDemetrius Freeman/Pool/Getty Images\n\nAs Republicans look to hold the seat of retiring Sen. Richard Burr, they have yet another nominee who has been outraised. GOP Rep. Ted Budd had brought in more than $6 million by the end of June, while Democratic nominee Cheri Beasley had raised $16 million.\n\nBudd won the GOP nomination with early backing from Trump, but Democrats argue he’s too conservative for a purple state – which Biden lost by a point – and is further to the right than its current GOP senators. (Sen. Thom Tillis, for example, has said he’d vote for legislation codifying same-sex and interracial marriage, a bill that Budd opposed in the House.) Democrats are hitting Budd on the airwaves over abortion, which comes amid the recent reinstatement of North Carolina’s 20-week abortion ban. Beasley, a former state Supreme Court chief justice, is trying to run as an outsider. “I like that Cheri Beasley hasn’t worked in Washington,” one woman says in an ad for the Democrat.\n\nBudd has run hybrid ads with the NRSC that attack Biden over inflation, with montages of a little girl’s disappointed face when her mother signals they cannot afford to buy cupcakes. Another features Budd standing on an empty stage in front of a fake banner that reads “Cheri Beasley Welcomes Joe Biden” as the Republican says Biden won’t show up in North Carolina because “he’s too busy making life harder for you.” Beasley still faces an uphill battle in a state Trump carried twice, but Democrats hope that the first Black woman to serve as chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court may be able to juice turnout among communities that don’t always vote, especially in midterms.\n\n8. Ohio\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\n\nTING SHEN/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nOhio switches places with Florida this month, although that could change again before Election Day. At this moment, however, retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman’s seat appears more likely to flip because Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan is running a better campaign than Republican J.D. Vance, who, as CNN reported, hasn’t been very active on the trail.\n\nPerhaps even more concerning to Washington Republicans is Vance’s fundraising – Ryan had raised six times more by the end of June. All of that prompted the Senate Leadership Fund to pull ad reservations in Arizona, a state Biden narrowly won, and invest $28 million in Ohio, a state Trump twice won by 8 points. One Nation, the GOP-affiliated nonprofit group, has already been hitting Ryan for supporting legislation in Congress it asserts has worsened inflation.\n\nRyan has been working hard to distance himself from the national party – most recently, for example, he came out strongly against Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan. He’s running on an economic populist message, declaring in an ad that he “voted with Trump on trade,” but he’s also talking about abortion. He called the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade “the largest governmental overreach into the private lives of American citizens in the history of our lifetime” on CNN’s “State of the Union” last month – one example of how Democrats have been adopting GOP rhetoric about freedom and liberty in their messaging on abortion.\n\nStill, Ryan may soon hit a ceiling of support in this red state, and with more resources coming in from Republicans, Vance may again have the advantage. If that doesn’t start to make a difference for him soon, though, this race will deserve another closer look.\n\n9. Florida\n\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\n\nDREW ANGERER/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nFlorida drops one spot this month on account of Ohio moving up, but the fundamentals of the two states suggest that the Sunshine State may eventually revert to being the more competitive race for Democrats. (Trump carried it by just 3 points in 2020, less than half his margin in Ohio.) Unlike the Republican nominee in the Buckeye State, GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida isn’t having the same struggles with fundraising, even though he has been outraised by his Democratic challenger, US Rep. Val Demings, who easily won her primary last month. (She had raised nearly $48 million by the beginning of August compared with Rubio’s nearly $37 million.)\n\nLaw enforcement and policing remain a big focus of the attacks between them, and Demings’ background as a former Orlando police chief provides an interesting dynamic. “I’ll protect Florida from bad ideas like defunding the police,” she says in a spot that touts her experience fighting crime. “That’s just crazy.” Rubio and the NRSC argue, however, that her voting record compares with that of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and undermines her law enforcement background. “Maybe she used to be a cop, but in Washington, Val Demings is just another radical, rubber stamp,” one of their hybrid ads says.\n\n10. Colorado\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Michael Bennet\n\nDEMETRIUS FREEMAN/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nIt’s hardly surprising that one of Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet’s first negative ads in his bid for a third full term is about abortion. In a state that Biden won by nearly 14 points in 2020, Democrats are making the elimination of federal abortion rights a central part of their midterm message.\n\nRepublican nominee Joe O’Dea is responding in ads narrated by his daughter and his wife. “When Joe O’Dea says he’s American before he’s a Republican, he means it,” his wife says. O’Dea, who told CNN he disagreed with the Supreme Court’s abortion decision, is trying to cast himself as a moderate. But Democrats are quick to point out that he voted for a failed 2020 state ballot measure to ban abortion after 22 weeks of pregnancy. And O’Dea acknowledges he would’ve voted to confirm the conservative justices who backed overturning Roe v. Wade. (He also said he would have supported Obama-nominated Justice Elena Kagan, who dissented in the high court’s abortion ruling.)\n\nDemocrats still remember when overplaying the abortion issue cost them a Senate race here in 2014. And Bennet, who won reelection in 2016 by less than 6 points against a challenger without national GOP backing, knows he’ll need support beyond the Democratic base to win in light-blue Colorado. He recently criticized the Biden administration’s student loan forgiveness announcement, for example, saying it should have been further targeted. And he’s tried to convey an across-the-aisle appeal in advertising, with a fly fishing instructor in a recent ad stating, “I’m not a Democrat, but I know Michael doesn’t take the bait from Washington.”", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/01/politics/senate-race-rankings-may-elections/index.html", "title": "The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 - CNNPolitics", "text": "(CNN) The month of May brought the first Senate primaries of the year . Ohio voted first, followed by a near weekly stream of contests that are shaping the midterm campaign for control of the chamber. At the close of the month, the general election matchups in almost half of this year's most competitive races are nearly set, with the exception of Pennsylvania, where the Republican primary has gone to a recount.\n\nRepublicans only need a net gain of one seat this fall to win the Senate, and much of the intrigue about primaries has so far been on the GOP side. Former President Donald Trump endorsed in all four Senate contests that were on the ballot in May that are expected to be competitive in the fall -- Ohio , where his chosen candidate won on May 3; North Carolina , where his chosen candidate won on May 17; Georgia , where his chosen candidate won on May 24, and in Pennsylvania, where his chosen candidate leads by roughly 900 votes. Those primaries cemented his hold on the party because of the way so many GOP candidates, even those without his endorsement, tried to appeal to him -- in some cases, twisting themselves into almost unrecognizable versions of their former selves.\n\nTrump's support played differently in each state. In Ohio, it helped \"Hillbilly Elegy\" author J.D. Vance win the primary, likely blunting the biggest attack attack on him -- the candidate's past criticism of Trump.\n\nThe former President's backing of Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania did not have as clear of an immediate impact, especially considering voters might have already associated the two celebrity Republicans together. Near the end of the race, the millions of dollars spent attacking Oz and former hedge fund executive David McCormick seemed to open a lane for conservative commentator Kathy Barnette , but she's in a distant third place behind Oz and McCormick.\n\nTrump weighed in on the North Carolina primary nearly a year ago, but his backing of US Rep. Ted Budd didn't clear the GOP field immediately. In Georgia, however, his commitment to Herschel Walker likely kept other top-name Republicans out of the race, leaving the former NFL star gliding to the GOP nomination.\n\nDemocrats argue that messy and expensive GOP primaries will leave Republican nominees bruised heading into the general election. (Democrats also had a crowded primary in Pennsylvania , but it didn't attract anywhere near the level of spending or vitriol as the GOP contest.)\n\nAfter watching Republican candidates run to the right to try to win their party nods, Democrats are hoping to make general election matchups a contrast in candidates. But that gets harder to do if the national environment continues to work against the party. President Joe Biden 's approval rating was at 41%, with 59% disapproving, according to a CNN poll , conducted by SSRS from April 28-May 1. Democrats know Republicans will tie them to him, which is one reason why a number of them broke with the White House on lifting Title 42 , a Trump-era public health authority that allows border authorities to turn migrants back to Mexico or their home countries.\n\nSenate contests are increasingly becoming nationalized affairs, so while candidate quality does matter (see No. 10 on this list), Democrats face a tough challenge in holding their razor-thin Senate majority, regardless of which Republicans they're facing.\n\nCNN's ranking of the Senate seats most likely to flip saw a few changes in May, all in Republicans' favor. But the states that held May primaries remain in the same positions for now, with uncertainty still reigning in Pennsylvania. The ranking, which will be updated in June, is based on CNN's reporting and fundraising and advertising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed.\n\n1. Pennsylvania\n\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\n\nPennsylvania -- a state Biden won in 2020 -- has long been the seat most likely to flip, but the May 17 GOP primary hasn't yet given us an answer to what the general election matchup to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey will look like in November. Celebrity heart surgeon Mehmet Oz , who has Trump's backing, and former hedge fund executive David McCormick finished in a near tie -- with a margin close enough to trigger the state's automatic recount process.\n\nCounties need to finish recounting -- which they must do using a different device than the one used in the initial tabulation -- by noon on June 7 and submit their results by noon on June 8. CNN has not made a projection in the race.\n\nThe winner will face Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who easily won the Democratic nomination on May 17.\n\nOz has declared himself the \"presumptive\" nominee , following the lead of Trump, who urged him to declare victory while counting was still underway. While Oz had tried to capitalize on the former President's support after receiving his endorsement in early April, McCormick and his allies argued that McCormick is the real conservative. \"I like Trump ... but not his Senate pick,\" voters said in one McCormick ad ahead of the primary.\n\nJUST WATCHED See tense exchange in Dr. Oz's first Senate primary debate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH See tense exchange in Dr. Oz's first Senate primary debate 02:02\n\nPolitical commentator Kathy Barnette emerged as a late electoral threat to both men, with the political arm of the Club for Growth announcing a nearly $2 million investment to boost her candidacy, as well as the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List and CatholicVote backing her. That late surge wasn't enough, though. Barnette trailing Oz and McCormick.\n\nThe lingering question in the Keystone State is whether Trump's backing of Oz will have made a difference if he holds on to his narrow lead after the recount -- and what that means for the general election. Oz's negatives were notably high compared with his opponents in a Fox poll ahead of the primary. Forty-six percent had an unfavorable view of Oz, while 27% and 12% had unfavorable views of McCormick and Barnette, respectively.\n\nFetterman already debuted a general election message in one of his ads ahead of the primary, in which he vowed to \"take on Washington,\" coming across as a progressive trying to run as a populist outsider . His primary opponents had trained their attacks on him in debates , especially over a 2013 incident in which he brought along his shotgun to confront someone who later turned out to be an unarmed Black jogger. And the primary had been rocked in the final days by news that Fetterman had suffered a stroke , leaving him in the hospital on election night.\n\nThe former Braddock mayor finished with about 59% of the vote to 26% for US Rep. Conor Lamb, who's also from western Pennsylvania, but ran as more of a moderate and highlighted his success defeating \"Trump Republicans\" in his Pittsburgh-area House seat.\n\n2. Georgia\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\n\nDespite enduring attacks from GOP opponents, former NFL player Herschel Walker , who has the backing of both Trump and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, easily won the GOP nomination to take on Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock\n\nHaving won a special election runoff in January 2021, Warnock is now seeking a full six-year term. He raised an astounding $13.6 million in the first three months of the year, which follows impressive earlier quarterly hauls, and is running direct-to-camera ads on issues with bipartisan appeal such as jobs, infrastructure and health care. Meanwhile, Democrats hope that Warnock and gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams will generate the base turnout they desperately need in a midterm year.\n\nBut Warnock is in serious jeopardy, even against a wildcard candidate like Walker, who faces a myriad of questions about his business background and allegations of threats he made against women. Much of the GOP establishment viewed Walker as a liability at the beginning of the cycle but have, publicly at least, come around, while his team has worked to keep him relatively on script. Democrats' road to Senate control ran through Georgia last cycle, but it's still challenging political terrain for them, especially in a midterm year with an unpopular Democratic President.\n\nOne unknown wrinkle, however, is how the loss of Trump's endorsed candidates for other statewide offices in the Peach State's GOP primaries could shape turnout in the fall. Georgia proved that Republican voters, even committed Trump supporters, won't necessarily follow his lead at the ballot box. They chose to stick with GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, for example, despite the former President railing against him for refusing to help him overturn the 2020 election. But some GOP strategists are still afraid of a repeat of the January 2021 Senate runoffs, when Trump's outspoken criticism of the election system may have kept some of his voters home, allowing Democrats to pick up both of the state's Senate seats.\n\n3. Nevada\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\n\nThe Silver State moved up two slots in May's ranking. Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto faces a tough race in a transient state that Biden won by 2 points in 2020. The President's approval rating has sunk since then, and Nevada has some of the highest gas prices in the nation, which could play into the GOP messaging that's trying to pin steep daily living costs on the party in power. Even if Cortez Masto manages to differentiate herself from generic Democrats, that effort could be overtaken by a bad national environment, especially if Republicans are able to make more inroads with Latino voters . It doesn't help that the state Democratic Party is fractured.\n\nCortez Masto, the former chair of Senate Democrats' campaign arm, outraised likely GOP nominee Adam Laxalt in the first quarter of the year -- $4.4 million to $1.6 million. But money isn't expected to be an issue for Laxalt, a former state attorney general -- he succeeded Cortez Masto in that role -- and grandson of a former senator and governor, who will benefit from GOP outside spending. Democrats argue that Laxalt, who co-chaired Trump's 2020 campaign in the state, has gone too far down the election conspiracy road and that his anti-abortion positions will alienate voters. But that may not matter as much if voters decide it's time for a change in Washington.\n\n4. Arizona\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\n\nHolding steady in fourth position is Arizona, where Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is running for a full six-year term after winning a special election in 2020. He's one of the best-positioned Democratic incumbents when it comes to his personal story and campaign coffers. But the former astronaut has a voting record now and is running in a purple border state that only narrowly backed Biden. Kelly is trying to stake out differences from the White House -- such as his opposition to lifting Title 42. But regardless of any real separation between him and Biden, messaging those nuances is an arguably tougher job than it is for Republicans to blanketly tie him to an unpopular President.\n\n5. Wisconsin\n\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\n\nThat's not why Wisconsin slides down two spots on this list. The senator remains unpopular -- 36% of registered voters viewed Johnson favorably while 46% viewed him unfavorably, according to a Marquette University Law School poll released Wednesday. (In February, the same poll found him underwater by a slightly worse 12 points.) Half of voters in the April Marquette survey said the phrase \"cares about people like me\" did not describe Johnson. That explains why Democrats continue to believe this seat is a better pickup opportunity with Johnson running than had it been an open seat.\n\nBut Biden is also unpopular in Wisconsin. After winning the state with about 49% in 2020, his approval rating has hovered at about 43%, with some 53% disapproving, since last fall. The winner of the Democratic primary in August will likely be tied to Biden, especially with inflation emerging as a top concern, according to the Marquette poll, and worries over the coronavirus (about which Johnson has said plenty of controversial things) reaching a new low.\n\nThe Democratic field is still uncertain. Support for Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes , who has been seen as the front-runner, declined slightly among likely primary voters in the Marquette poll, while support for Milwaukee Bucks basketball team executive Alex Lasry ticked up. State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson remained in the single digits. Nearly half of those likely primary voters, however, said they hadn't picked a candidate. Lasry and Godlewski are pouring their own resources into the race to go up on TV. Barnes, who raised $1.7 million in the first quarter of the year, went up with his first TV ad in mid-May. But none of the candidates has emerged as a fundraising powerhouse the way other Democrats challenging unpopular Republicans (think Sens. Ted Cruz or Lindsey Graham) have in cycles past.\n\n6. New Hampshire\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\n\nNew Hampshire remains at No. 6 as the Republican field -- upended late last year by Gov. Chris Sununu's decision not to seek the nomination -- develops. Republicans looking to challenge Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan include state Senate President Chuck Morse, former Londonderry town manager Kevin Smith and retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, who unsuccessfully sought the nomination for the state's other Senate seat in 2020. And other Republicans have been throwing their hats in the ring ahead of New Hampshire's late primary in September.\n\nHassan, a former two-term governor, is seeking a second Senate term in a state that, on paper, should be more favorable to Democrats than any other state on this list. Biden carried New Hampshire by 7 points in 2020. An unfavorable national environment, however, could hurt her reelection chances, even without an opponent of Sununu's caliber. Hassan has come out against the Biden administration's plan to lift Title 42, making her own trip to the border last month that angered several Latino leaders back home.\n\n7. North Carolina\n\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\n\nOne of Trump's earliest Senate primary endorsements -- for US Rep. Ted Budd last June -- resulted in victory here on May 17, with Budd easily dispatching former Gov. Pat McCrory and former US Rep. Mark Walker for the GOP nomination to succeed retiring Sen. Richard Burr.\n\nThe Trump endorsement didn't clear the field for Budd, but heavy spending from the conservative Club for Growth Action helped boost him. One spot ahead of the primary featured Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson praising Budd and knocking McCrory. \"Pat's a nice guy, but he's no conservative,\" Robinson says, admitting that he'd voted for McCrory in the past \"but not this time.\" McCrory and his allies touted his record on immigration and argued that Budd is \"weak\" on a host of issues.\n\nOn the Democratic side, former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley, who won 81% of the vote in the primary, had essentially already cleared the primary field and pivoted to the general election. \"Looking at Washington, I think both parties are doing the job wrong,\" she said in an ad ahead of the primary. Beasley had outraised all the Republicans in the first quarter of this year, but money won't be enough in a state Trump won twice, especially in a midterm year, when Democratic turnout has often waned. Senate Leadership Fund, the GOP super PAC aligned with McConnell, made ad reservations in the state ahead of the primary to help the GOP nominee. The Democratic equivalent, Senate Majority PAC, announced an ad buy defending Beasley after the primary, despite leaving North Carolina off its list of initial reservations earlier this spring.\n\n8. Florida\n\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\n\nDemocratic Rep. Val Demings , a former Orlando police chief with a compelling story, continues to outraise Republican incumbent Marco Rubio, bringing in more than $10 million during the first three months of the year to Rubio's $5.8 million. Her campaign recently announced a Hispanic outreach effort and a $3 million investment in a state bilingual coordinated campaign.\n\nBut while money is important in this expensive state, it won't be enough to flip the seat. And none of the major outside groups have made ad reservations here, signaling that they view the race as less competitive. Demings already started at a disadvantage in a state where Trump expanded on his victory margin in 2020 from four years earlier, but her job would be even harder if the national mood continues to sour on Democrats this fall. She and Rubio have traded barbs on gas prices and immigration. Rubio's campaign has tried to tie Demings to Biden's decision to rescind Title 42 . Demings' team recently said she does not support lifting the measure \"until there is a plan to put more boots on the ground and support our law enforcement officers at the border.\"\n\n9. Ohio\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\n\nThe first major test of Trump's endorsement in a Senate primary this year was a success for the former President. \"Hillbilly Elegy\" author J.D. Vance , who received Trump's backing in mid-April, won the nomination on May 3 with about 32% of the vote , finishing ahead of former state treasurer Josh Mandel (24%) and state Sen. Matt Dolan (23%).\n\nVance's public criticism of Trump from 2016 had been a treasure trove for his primary opponents and their ad-makers. The former President, though, was willing to look past that. And it paid off for Vance, who saw his support double in a Fox poll ahead of the primary. It was a topsy-turvy race, but it's likely that Vance landed on top at just the right moment for it to matter.\n\nOnly Dolan ran truly outside the Trump election conspiracy lane in the GOP primary. Interestingly, his stock had risen in polling right before the election, presaging his third-place finish ahead of candidates who had tried to tie themselves more closely to Trump, including former state party chair Jane Timken, who had the backing of retiring Sen. Rob Portman, and businessman Mike Gibbons.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Tim Ryan easily won his party's nomination but starts at a disadvantage in this reddening state.\n\n10. Missouri\n\nIncumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring)\n\nIt's still all about Eric Greitens in Missouri -- does the former governor, who resigned in disgrace in 2018, stay in the Republican race? Does he score Trump's endorsement? And does he win the GOP nod in August? Those are the series of questions that will determine whether Missouri -- a red state that shouldn't otherwise be competitive -- remains on this list.\n\nSome Democrats smell opportunity. Trudy Busch Valentine, a nurse and Anheuser-Busch beer heiress, jumped into the race this spring. She hasn't said how much she'll invest in her campaign, but should this race become competitive, Democrats may benefit from having a candidate with her own money to spend. But Valentine first has a primary to win -- while one Democrat dropped out of the race and endorsed her, the top fundraiser, Marine veteran Lucas Kunce, doesn't look like he's going anywhere.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details in Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/27/politics/senate-race-rankings-march-elections/index.html", "title": "The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 - CNNPolitics", "text": "(CNN) The war in Ukraine has shifted attention overseas, but even if President Joe Biden 's approval has ticked up nominally, the national environment heading into the 2022 midterms still looks treacherous for his fellow Democrats as they try to hold their Senate majority .\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has given Biden a convenient foil on whom to blame high gas prices. (\"Putin's price hike,\" he has called it.) But Republicans are hammering Democrats for rising inflation , which they argue predates the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats point to the pandemic and stuck supply chains for the current inflation woes, blaming corporations for pocketing profits while Americans pay the price at the pump. The most vulnerable Democratic Senate incumbents -- Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire -- have tried to get ahead of the inevitable GOP attacks by introducing legislation that would suspend the federal gas tax through the end of the year.\n\nIn a sign they're trying to distance themselves from the national party, most of them also sided with Republicans on a recent vote to overturn the requirement that passengers wear masks on public transportation. Establishing their own brands in their states, independent of Biden, will be a challenge for Democrats running in November if the President's approval rating remains in the low 40s . The party in the White House traditionally loses seats during the first midterm of a new president's term.\n\nDespite those obstacles, the Senate seat most likely to flip is still a pickup opportunity for Democrats. Pennsylvania has led this list since its incarnation -- a testament to it being an open seat in a state Biden carried in 2020. The ranking is based on CNN's reporting and fundraising and advertising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. Two seats have traded places on the latest list, however, which underscores the difficult environment for Democrats: New Hampshire slides above North Carolina as more likely to flip.\n\nRepublicans have their own challenges, though, mostly candidate-driven. May primaries in Ohio and Pennsylvania are heating up as GOP candidates jockey for former President Donald Trump 's blessing. At the same time, candidates who do have his backing are finding that it doesn't solve all their problems. (Trump just rescinded his endorsement for the open Senate seat in Alabama, where Rep. Mo Brooks' campaign was underwhelming.) He's backed candidates in two competitive states with May primaries -- Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nMuch to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's chagrin, the chair of the GOP committee charged with flipping the Senate recently released an 11-point plan that calls for all Americans to pay income tax. Expect Democrats to tie all Republicans, even those who have disavowed the tax proposal, to Florida Sen. Rick Scott's plan (released by his campaign, not the National Republican Senatorial Committee). It's a tactic that House Democrats successfully used against the GOP in 2018, when they tied even Republicans who had voted against repealing Obamacare to that effort, and that Republicans used against Democrats in 2020 in linking the entire party to the \"defund the police\" movement.\n\nThe paid media (i.e., television advertising) portion of the campaign is just taking off in many of these races, so we'll see how much that message sticks in the months to come.\n\nHere are the 10 Senate seats most likely to flip with less than eight months to go before Election Day:\n\n1. Pennsylvania\n\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\n\nPennsylvania once again tops the list of seats most likely to flip. Republican candidates and super PACs have spent nearly $40 million in the open-seat race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey ahead of the May 17 primary, with much of it coming from Mehmet Oz and David McCormick and their allies. Trump has yet to weigh in after his chosen candidate dropped out in November, which is fueling even more spending as Republicans try to prove their loyalty to the former President.\n\nAs the GOP field has grown, the Democratic one has thinned with Val Arkoosh -- a doctor and the only woman in the primary -- dropping out in February. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and US Rep. Conor Lamb , both from Western Pennsylvania, are on the air, mostly with positive bio spots that give the primary a noticeably different tone than the GOP contest. Fetterman is seen as the current front-runner because of his fundraising advantage and statewide name recognition. But Lamb has a record of winning tough House races, with his ads touting that he's previously beaten \"the Trump machine.\" Lamb has also picked up the endorsement of the Philadelphia Democratic Party. State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who hails from the vote-rich city, has some significant labor endorsements but is not on TV.\n\nThe bottom line here is that both parties think the other side's primary will take the eventual nominee too far to the extremes. But, given how much the GOP primary is pushing candidates toward Trump in a state Biden won (and all the millions of dollars putting that message in front of voters), this Democratic pickup opportunity is still the most likely to change party hands.\n\n2. Georgia\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\n\nDemocratic Sen. Raphael Warnock is running for a full six-year term after winning a special election runoff last year. He has impressed with strong fundraising and is on the air with positive spots leaning into his background as a pastor and touting the legislation he's co-sponsored that would temporarily suspend the federal gas tax.\n\nFormer NFL star Herschel Walker is the prohibitive Republican favorite in the May 24 primary, with both McConnell and Trump behind him. But attacks from his primary rivals and recent negative headlines over his business record could preview some of the scrutiny to come in the general election as Democrats gear up to face a first-time candidate whom much of the GOP establishment was bad mouthing this time last year.\n\nBut even with an untested likely opponent and a fundraising prowess that bests longer-serving Democratic incumbents on this list, Warnock is highly vulnerable because of the fundamentals of Georgia. He narrowly overperformed Biden in 2020, but both won by close margins in this purple state. And given Biden's sagging approval ratings, the senator will need to maintain -- and grow -- his margins over the President. Turnout will be a crucial question in a midterm year, but in that regard, Democrats are excited that Stacey Abrams' candidacy for governor may help energize nonwhite voters.\n\n3. Wisconsin\n\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\n\nAs the only Republican running for reelection in a state Biden won in 2020, Sen. Ron Johnson remains the most vulnerable GOP incumbent this year. A Marquette University Law School poll conducted at the end of February found that 45% of registered Wisconsin voters had an unfavorable view of him with only 33% seeing him favorably.\n\nDemocrats were ecstatic that Johnson decided to break a pledge to serve only two terms, and they see political hay in his penchant for controversial remarks. See, for example, his recent call for Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act if they win control of Congress. That's a debate Democrats are happy to have after running on defending Obamacare in the 2018 midterms, when the law was much more popular than when Johnson last faced voters, in 2016. (Johnson later issued a clarifying statement, saying he he did not mean to suggest that repealing and replacing Obamacare should be a top priority for his party.)\n\nStill, Republicans note that Johnson has been underestimated before and has come from behind to win. And while Biden narrowly carried the Badger State, his approval rating is at 43% (with 52% disapproving), according to the same Marquette poll.\n\nThe Democratic field remains largely unknown. Even Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, whom the Marquette poll found in the lead among Democratic primary voters with 23%, was unknown to 53% of them. Two of his challengers who have poured their own money into their campaigns -- Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry and state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski -- are on TV, so voters' familiarity with them could grow ahead of the August primary.\n\n4. Arizona\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\n\nThe biggest news in Arizona over the past month is that GOP Gov. Doug Ducey said (again) that he would not run for Senate , which was a major relief for Democrats as Sen. Mark Kelly runs for a full six-year term in the purple state.\n\nThe crowded field of GOP challengers, all jockeying for a Trump endorsement, is pulling the candidates to the right, potentially complicating the eventual nominee's ability to make a general election pivot after the August primary. (Former Sen. Martha McSally, whom Kelly defeated in a 2020 special election, struggled with this dynamic in her races for Senate.)\n\nState Attorney General Mark Brnovich is seen as the GOP front-runner, considering he's already won statewide, but he's struggled with fundraising. Venture capitalist Blake Masters picked up the backing of the anti-tax Club for Growth and already had the support of a super PAC funded by tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel, his onetime boss, so he's not suffering for lack of outside assistance. Solar energy entrepreneur Jim Lamon, who had loaned his campaign $8 million by the end 2021, is up with plenty of ads talking about immigration.\n\nWith the GOP primary still in flux, Kelly's using his massive fundraising advantage to run positive spots about infrastructure and his work to address supply chain issues , with Democrats also spending on Spanish-language ads . Like Warnock, Kelly overperformed Biden in 2020, but the national environment has gotten worse for Democrats since and they cannot count on presidential-level turnout this year.\n\n5. Nevada\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\n\nSen. Catherine Cortez Masto is running ads featuring hospitality and restaurant workers touting her pandemic recovery efforts -- another Democratic incumbent who's using her campaign coffers to go up with positive spots while she has the airwaves to herself. Her campaign and Democratic outside groups are also running Spanish-language ads -- an important early investment in the Silver State.\n\nFormer state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who has the backing of Trump and McConnell, is expected to win the June Republican primary, but he still faces a well-funded opponent. Laxalt is the grandson of a former governor and senator with the same last name, but he lost his most recent election, the 2018 governor's race. Voters may know him more recently for serving as Trump's state campaign co-chair and echoing his election fraud claims, which Democrats point to in calling Laxalt too extreme for the state.\n\nBut Biden didn't win Nevada by all that much (about 2 points), and in a challenging national environment -- with voters here especially worried about inflation and the economy -- Cortez Masto is likely in for a tough race. The former Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chair hasn't raised nearly as much money as two of her higher-profile colleagues up for reelection (Warnock and Kelly) and has less recent experience trying to distance herself from the national party when facing voters. She won with about 47% of the vote in 2016, underperforming Hillary Clinton, to become the first Latina elected to the US Senate\n\n6. New Hampshire\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\n\nDemocratic Sen. Maggie Hassan is in for a competitive race, even without a challenge from GOP Gov. Chris Sununu. Yes, the Granite State has gone blue in every federal election in the past six years. And yes, by the numbers, it's the most daunting for Republicans given that Biden carried it by 7 points. But given Biden's low approval rating and a sour national mood, even a Republican with a much lower profile than Sununu should be able to keep this one close.\n\nFifty-five percent of New Hampshire adults disapproved of Biden's job performance while 43% approved, according to a University of New Hampshire poll conducted in late February. Ratings of his handling of the economy were worse. Those may be difficult numbers for Hassan, a first-term senator, to overcome in an era when Senate races are increasingly nationalized.\n\nJust how competitive November's race is, however, may depend on what kind of campaigns Republicans Chuck Morse and Kevin Smith put together. There's still time for these relatively unknown candidates to introduce themselves, but a September primary also doesn't give them much time to position for the general election.\n\nDemocrats think New Hampshire is one state where the abortion issue may prove to be particularly salient if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade this year, because of the higher concentration of college-educated voters in the Granite State. Nearly two-thirds of New Hampshire adults in that UNH poll (which was taken before Biden nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court) said they wanted him to pick a justice who would vote to uphold Roe v. Wade.\n\n7. North Carolina\n\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\n\nTrump took sides in the GOP primary in June, but his chosen candidate, US Rep. Ted Budd, hasn't cleared the field. \"He's loved by, especially, the conservative wing of the party — highly respected guy,\" Trump told the Washington Examiner earlier this month. Budd has had plenty of help on the airwaves from the political arm of the Club for Growth, which has spent millions attacking former Gov. Pat McCrory ahead of the May 17 Republican primary.\n\nThe latest back-and-forth in this race is about Putin. McCrory's first statewide TV ad accused Budd of being \"friendly\" toward Russia, selectively splicing comments the congressman has made about the Russian President, including calling him a \"very intelligent actor.\" The club responded with an ad calling McCrory's attack a \"low-down, dirty hit job\" and surfacing footage of Budd calling Putin \"evil\" and expressing support for Ukraine.\n\nFormer Rep. Mark Walker and combat veteran Marjorie K. Eastman are still in the race but even if they peel some votes away from Budd or McCrory, it may not be enough to spoil an outright victory since the threshold needed to avoid a primary runoff is only 30%.\n\nThe Democratic field is essentially set, with Cheri Beasley seeing her most viable opponents drop out. The former state Supreme Court chief justice hasn't raised as much money as some Democrats in other races. And even though she doesn't have a voting record, her judicial record could provide fodder for Republicans to try to paint her as soft on crime, similar to the way they've gone after Jackson since her Supreme Court nomination. Democrats are hopeful that a Black woman who's previously been elected statewide will help mitigate the turnout problem they've often faced in North Carolina, especially in midterm years, but that may not be enough to overcome any anti-Democratic headwinds in a Trump state.\n\n8. Florida\n\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\n\nGOP Sen. Marco Rubio, who's likely to face Democratic Rep. Val Demings in the fall, starts this race ahead in a state that Trump carried twice. The war in Ukraine has brought plenty of earned media opportunities for the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. His campaign has attacked Biden and Democrats for not doing more to increase domestic oil production amid a surge in gas prices.\n\nDemings, who has impressed with her fundraising, has a compelling profile -- she's a former Orlando police chief with firsthand experience fighting crime, a detail that appears prominently in her campaign media. But Republicans are signaling they will continue to tie her to the national party, even on the issue of rising crime rates.\n\n9. Ohio\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\n\nThe Buckeye State is playing host to one of the nastiest Republican primaries of the election cycle. But regardless of how badly dinged the eventual nominee emerges from the primary, he or she will start with the advantage for this open seat in an increasingly red state that Trump twice won by 8 points. Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan faces a primary, too, but he's largely consolidated party support.\n\nIt's possible the May 3 primary will be delayed because of uncertainty over state legislative and congressional maps. That would only give Republicans more time for the kinds of attacks that have made this a topsy-turvy race, with poll leads fluctuating depending on who's on the receiving end of the most televised vitriol.\n\nBy far the biggest motif in GOP advertising isn't Russia, but something a little closer to home, although still some 1,500 miles away from Ohio -- the US southern border with Mexico.\n\n10. Missouri\n\nIncumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring)\n\nThe prospect of former Gov. Eric Greitens winning the GOP nomination was already causing headaches in a red state that has no other reason to go blue. Those pains got more intense when Greitens' ex-wife alleged he was physically abusive toward his children and her, according to court documents filed last week. (Greitens has denied this.) His primary opponents immediately called for him to drop out of the race, with some members of GOP leadership in Washington, DC, echoing that.\n\nLater in the week, Trump, who had previously left the door open to endorsing Greitens, gave US Rep. Billy Long reason to hope when he issued a positive statement about the former auctioneer. \"Have the great people of Missouri been considering the big, loud, and proud personality of Congressman Billy Long for the Senate?\" Trump said. \"This is not an Endorsement, but I'm just askin'?\"", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/03/politics/senate-race-rankings-february/index.html", "title": "The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 - CNNPolitics", "text": "CNN —\n\nThere’s nothing like a Supreme Court vacancy to get people in Washington talking about the Senate.\n\nIt’s less clear, however, whether the voters who will decide control of the Senate nine months from now are attuned to that conversation, especially since the ideological makeup of the court is not in the balance.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer’s decision to retire came as President Joe Biden’s approval rating stood at 42%, with 55% disapproving, according to CNN’s average of six recent national polls. The best scenario for Democrats is that the vacancy and Biden’s pledge to nominate a Black woman will help drive base enthusiasm and remind moderates who care about abortion rights, for example, of what’s at stake in the battle for the Senate. But that may be a lot of theoretical dot-connecting for most Americans preoccupied with high prices at the pump and the checkout line.\n\nStill, the seat most likely to flip partisan control is the place where Democrats see the Supreme Court vacancy as having perhaps the biggest impact. That’s not a new development: Pennsylvania has led the list since CNN started ranking the 2022 races nearly a year ago. But it speaks to the demographics Democrats need to turn out in the Keystone State – their urban base and suburban voters.\n\nThe ranking is based on CNN’s reporting and fundraising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. Fundraising reports for the fourth quarter of 2021, which were due to the Federal Election Commission by Monday, showed some Democrats raising massive sums of money, while some Republican candidates poured significant personal wealth into their campaigns. As the year progresses, more polling and advertising spending data will become bigger factors in the ranking.\n\nWhile Pennsylvania still leads the list, Republicans are feeling more confident about the seat, which GOP Sen. Pat Toomey is vacating, than they have in months, thanks to some new candidates. But it remains a question, as is the case in several other races, how much embracing former President Donald Trump in the primary comes back to haunt the eventual GOP nominee in the general election in a state Biden won in 2020.\n\nAs he resumes his campaign-style rallies, with a heavy focus on his 2020 election lies, Trump is signaling that he won’t be sitting 2022 out quietly, even if he’s not on the ballot. The jockeying for his support has already led to massive spending – especially in Pennsylvania, where the GOP primary has attracted $18 million, mostly in December and January alone, according to a CNN analysis of AdImpact data.\n\n“I still say it’s 50-50,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told CNN’s Manu Raju last week about the GOP’s chances of flipping the chamber.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican backed the bipartisan infrastructure law, one of Biden’s biggest achievements to date, but he’s standing in the way (along with two moderate Democrats) of the President’s other priorities, such as his social spending and climate change plan and voting rights legislation, both of which stalled in the Senate.\n\nVulnerable Democratic incumbents on this list – Sens. Mark Kelly, Catherine Cortez Masto, Maggie Hassan and Raphael Warnock – all voted in favor of eliminating the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation. While taking that position has become a new litmus test of sorts in Democratic primaries (again, see Pennsylvania), and some Republicans are attacking Democrats over it, it’s far from clear that the fate of the 60-vote threshold is a salient issue for American voters.\n\nThere’s been plenty of effort to get voters’ attention. Candidates and outside groups have already spent twice as much on TV and radio ads as they had at similar points in the 2018 and 2020 cycles, according to a CNN analysis of AdImpact data.\n\nLook for that spending to increase quickly ahead of spring primaries, with the first big Senate contest of the year (Ohio) happening on May 3. Until then, stay tuned for more updates to this ranking.\n\nHere are the top 10 Senate seats most likely to flip as of this month:\n\n1. Pennsylvania\n\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\n\nSarah Silbiger/Pool/Getty Images\n\nPennsylvania remains the seat most likely to flip, although Republicans feel better about holding retiring Sen. Pat Toomey’s seat now that the Trump-backed candidate is out of the race and several new candidates have jumped in.\n\n“We have an embarrassment of riches,” McConnell told Raju in late January. The biggest new name is hedge fund executive David McCormick. A former Treasury official in the George W. Bush administration who lived in Connecticut for years, McCormick has rolled out ads trying to convince voters that “his Pennsylvania roots will keep him grounded.” He’s the husband of Dina Powell McCormick, who was Trump’s deputy national security adviser. Sean Parnell, the Trump endorsee who suspended his campaign after a public custody battle that was generating worrisome headlines for the GOP, quickly backed McCormick, as did Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who recently rallied with him in the state.\n\nMcCormick and his allies are already in a sniping contest with Dr. Mehmet Oz, who entered the race late last fall and had loaned his campaign more than $5 million, according to his recent FEC filing. Honor Pennsylvania, an anti-Oz group, is attacking the former talk show host as a “Hollywood liberal.” (Like McCormick, Oz recently lived out of state, in New Jersey.) American Leadership Action, a pro-Oz group, is going after McCormick’s business record, as is Oz’s campaign.\n\nThere were already Republicans running here – allies of businessman Jeff Bartos, for example, are attacking the two newcomers as carpetbaggers – and Carla Sands, who was ambassador to Denmark under Trump, loaned her campaign another $500,000 in the fourth quarter.\n\nWhile Democrats are enjoying watching Republicans duke it out, they have their own crowded primary. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman is still the fundraising leader, raising $2.7 million in the fourth quarter. Rep. Conor Lamb – who, like Fetterman, is from the western part of the state – has picked up some labor endorsements and the backing of the mayor of Philadelphia. He finished ahead of the other candidates in a state party committee vote last weekend but fell short of the threshold for an endorsement.\n\n2. Georgia\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\n\nMegan Varner/Getty Images\n\nAfter winning a special election runoff last winter that helped flip the Senate, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock never slowed down. He raised $9.8 million in the fourth quarter as he seeks a full six-year term in November. Only a sum like that could make the nearly $5.4 million that Republican challenger Herschel Walker raised seem paltry. Since Biden won the state in 2020, Georgia has remained one of the most interesting political battlegrounds that’s also home to a high-profile gubernatorial race and is ground zero for the fight for voting rights, which Democrats hope could energize turnout on their side. With the national spotlight on his state, Warnock isn’t likely to be hurting for money anytime soon.\n\nAnd while staggering Democratic fundraising hasn’t always translated to success (see South Carolina in 2020 or Texas in 2018), public polling suggests this race is competitive. A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed no clear leader, with Walker at 49% and Warnock at 48% among registered voters. Republicans are feeling confident about this race now that McConnell and Trump are united behind Walker, even if the former NFL star remains largely untested as a candidate, and because the national environment has looked increasingly strong for them. Biden’s job approval rating in the Peach State in that Quinnipiac poll, for example, was 36%. But Democrats take heart that Warnock’s job approval was a higher 47%. With Senate races so nationalized these days, Warnock will need to continue to overperform Biden – as he did in 2021 – if he’s going to survive in November, regardless of how many millions he raises.\n\n3. Wisconsin\n\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images\n\nThe big news here is GOP Sen. Ron Johnson is running for reelection, which reassured Republicans and enthused Democrats. Republicans are glad to be avoiding another messy primary, and they’re thankful Johnson didn’t wait even longer to make his announcement. In a video explaining his decision, Johnson says he intended for his current term to be his last but cannot “walk away” after seeing “the Democrats in total control.”\n\nDemocrats, however, are thrilled that Johnson – who has continued to make controversial and misleading statements about Covid-19 and January 6 – is running. They believe he’s a damaged enough incumbent that it will be easier to flip this seat with him in it than if he weren’t. Senate Majority PAC, the preeminent Democratic super PAC, quickly attacked Johnson for being “deep in the swamp.” Johnson’s announcement also prompted the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to launch its first TV ad of the cycle, hitting him for “looking out for himself.”\n\nRepublicans think a strong national environment will help them hold on to this seat, especially if they can paint the eventual Democratic nominee as too far left for the state, which backed Biden by less than a point in 2020. They’re excited about the prospect of running against Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, for example, who has the support of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Barnes raised $1.2 million in the fourth quarter – which is more than Johnson’s $711,000 but lower than some Democratic challengers across the country. And he faces a crowded primary, including Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry, who loaned his campaign about $1.5 million in the fourth quarter and has been running a series of ads on TV.\n\n4. Arizona\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\n\nCourtney Pedroza/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Kelly, like Warnock in Georgia, continues to post impressive fundraising numbers as he runs for a full six-year term in November. Kelly raised nearly $9 million in the last quarter. That, on its own, should put Republicans on notice in an increasingly purple state that Biden narrowly won in 2020. But unlike Georgia, where the GOP has largely coalesced around one candidate, Republicans here face a real headache with a messy candidate field ahead of the August primary. There have been renewed rumors about Gov. Doug Ducey running, which would please McConnell and national Republicans, but he’s a frequent target of Trump and doesn’t appear to have made any moves ahead of the April filing deadline.\n\nThat leaves Attorney General Mark Brnovich, whose fundraising continues to be underwhelming (he raised about $800,000 last quarter) and venture capitalist Blake Masters, among several others, duking it out. Masters raised nearly $1.6 million, but he also has the advantage of a Peter Thiel-backed super PAC touting him as a “Trump conservative.” Based on the advertising in the state – which has already crept past $30 million, according to CNN’s analysis of AdImpact data as of Friday – Republicans are leaning into the Trump loyalty contest. Solar energy entrepreneur Jim Lamon, for example, who loaned his campaign $3 million in the fourth quarter, is going all-in on Trump’s claims of a rigged election.\n\nRegardless of their nominee, Republicans think it’s a winnable race, especially if the national environment continues to look bleak for Biden and other Democrats, and they’re eager to go after Kelly’s voting record and exploit the differences between him and his more moderate Democratic Arizona colleague, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema.\n\n5. Nevada\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\n\nCNN\n\nThis is one of the few contests, like Georgia, where Trump and McConnell have already united behind the same candidate. In Nevada, it’s former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, the grandson of the former governor and senator with the same last name. The GOP’s ability to coalesce around him ahead of the June primary could be critical to winning the seat, but he still faces competition. Retired Army Capt. Sam Brown raised about $1 million in the fourth quarter, just shy of Laxalt’s $1.3 million.\n\nRepublicans are hopeful that Biden’s sagging approval ratings and voters’ anxieties will help them in the state, which has seen its share of pandemic and inflation woes.\n\n“I don’t know if it’s the President, or what happened, but (under Trump) it was so much better,” one Nevada voter who has recently voted for Democrats told CNN’s Maeve Reston in early January.\n\nSen. Catherine Cortez Masto, the former chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, raised about $3.3 million last quarter and hasn’t yet really reintroduced herself to voters. Democrats have long believed that abortion could be a salient issue here – especially since Laxalt’s opposition to abortion rights puts him at odds with the state’s most recent GOP governor – and are hoping the Supreme Court vacancy will help bring more attention to that contrast by reminding voters what’s at stake. But Republicans’ inroads with Hispanics, combined with the state’s non-college-educated White population, make this race among the most competitive.\n\n6. North Carolina\n\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\n\nDemetrius Freeman/Pool/Getty Images\n\nTrump’s endorsement in this race nearly eight months ago has yet to clear the GOP field, with none of the candidates posting stellar fundraising. In fact, former Rep. Mark Walker announced last week that he would carry on with his Senate campaign rather than drop down to a House race with the possibility of an endorsement from the ex-President. Rep. Ted Budd, Trump’s pick for Senate, raised $968,000 in the fourth quarter and continues to introduce himself to voters statewide, while the Club for Growth’s political arm spends big to help him. That includes going hard after former Gov. Pat McCrory, who raised $748,000. Combat veteran Marjorie K. Eastman raised $423,000 and is less well known but has benefited from nearly $1 million in outside spending from a group called Restore Common Sense. The delay in the state’s primaries from March to May, thanks to redistricting litigation, will give Republicans more time to sort out their field.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have a prohibitive favorite in former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley after other major candidates dropped out. She raised $2.1 million in the last quarter. While Republicans likely start with the advantage in this state that Trump carried by about a point in 2020, Democrats are hopeful Beasley can energize minority turnout in a non-presidential year.\n\n7. New Hampshire\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\n\nErin Scott/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Sen. Maggie Hassan got a huge break when Republican Gov. Chris Sununu decided late last year to run for reelection rather than challenge her. Besides retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, several other Republicans are now hoping to take on Hassan, although none of Sununu’s stature. Londonderry Town Manager Kevin Smith, who unsuccessfully sought the GOP gubernatorial nod in 2012, announced his campaign last month. State Senate President Chuck Morse followed over the weekend, riding a skid-steer loader into his snowy announcement event, WMUR reported. McConnell singled out Morse in his interview with CNN last week, saying, “We think we’ll have a good candidate there.”\n\nDemocrats have done well in the Granite State in recent federal elections, with Biden carrying the state by 7 points in 2020. But his approval rating slipped last fall, giving Republicans hope they’d unseat Hassan even without their preferred candidate. Biden’s numbers had somewhat improved by mid-December, returning to July levels, according to the most recent University of New Hampshire Granite State Poll. Hassan, who raised $3.2 million in the last quarter, isn’t in as competitive a race as she could have been had Sununu thrown his hat in the ring, but she still has to hope that the national environment doesn’t endanger her. Only 28% of New Hampshire residents in that Granite State Poll, for example, said things in the US “are headed in the right direction.”\n\n8. Florida\n\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\n\nDREW ANGERER/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nGOP Sen. Marco Rubio is running for a third term in a state that has favored Republicans recently. (Trump carried it by 3 points in 2020.) That means he starts as the favorite, but Democratic Rep. Val Demings, who was a contender for Biden’s running mate, has been an impressive fundraiser. She raised about $7.2 million in the fourth quarter – more than Rubio’s $5.2 million, although he ended 2021 with more cash on hand. Demings will need the money to introduce herself statewide across expensive media markets.\n\nRubio has recently been touting his support from law enforcement, trying to counter any advantages Demings might bring to the race as a former Orlando police chief. The congresswoman responded last week by calling Rubio a “lifelong politician,” saying that during her tenure with the police she had helped respond to “some dark, scary places” while he was “home in his bed sleeping,” according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel.\n\n9. Ohio\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\n\nTING SHEN/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nThe Republican primary field to replace retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman remains unsettled ahead of the May primary as candidates and their allies frantically put out polls to try to shape their own narratives of the race. The Club for Growth’s political arm is spending for former state Treasurer Josh Mandel, attacking “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance and former state party Chair Jane Timken. Almost all the candidates, including a couple of big-spending businessmen, are leaning heavily into Trump’s rhetoric, creating a sharp distinction from the senator they’re hoping to succeed.\n\nVance claimed in a tweet thread on the anniversary of the US Capitol insurrection that many of the rioters in a DC jail are “political prisoners,” adding, “They are our people.” He also recently secured the endorsement of controversial GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, which he likely hopes will blunt some of his past public criticism of Trump. State Sen. Matt Dolan was the rare candidate to describe January 6 as “an attack on American democracy” in a statement on the one-year anniversary, calling out “fake conservatives willing to sacrifice our most sacred text, the Constitution, in favor of political expedience.” He’s invested a stunning $10.5 million of his own money into his campaign (mostly in contributions, not loans) but faces a steep uphill battle in a GOP primary that revolves around Trump.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Rep. Tim Ryan, who raised $2.9 million last quarter, has largely consolidated support, but Ohio, which Trump carried by 8 points, remains a tough state for anyone in his party who’s not Sen. Sherrod Brown.\n\n10. Missouri\n\nIncumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring)\n\nSaul Loeb/Pool/Getty Images\n\nMissouri is different from most of the states on this list in that it really wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for one man. “Missouri is potentially challenging depending on the outcome in the primary,” McConnell told Raju. Former Gov. Eric Greitens, who resigned from office following a probe into allegations of sexual and campaign misconduct, threatens to put in play a red state that Trump won by 15 points in 2020. He’s trying to align himself with Trump, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, the fiancée of the ex-President’s son, is his campaign’s national chair.\n\nGreitens faces a handful of Republicans also trying to secure Trump’s support ahead of the August primary. Rep. Billy Long, for example, ran an ad about Democrats “rigging the election.” State Attorney General Eric Schmitt recently announced lawsuits against school districts with masking rules, which is becoming a conservative rallying cry as the third year of the pandemic gets underway. GOP Rep. Vicky Hartzler – the only woman in the race – hasn’t hesitated to go after Greitens, taking an implicit jab at his extramarital affair in her first ad released last fall.\n\nThe fear is that Greitens could jeopardize the general election much like GOP nominee Todd Akin did in the 2012 Senate contest. And the more Republicans in the race, the more splintered the primary vote will be, thereby lowering the threshold Greitens would need to win the nomination. Democrat Lucas Kunce raised $710,000 in the fourth quarter – more than any of the Republicans excluding personal loans. But the Marine veteran will need more than money to make the race go his way.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/10/politics/democrats-senate-battlefield-hope/index.html", "title": "Democrats see glimmers of hope as the Senate battlefield takes ...", "text": "(CNN) After Tuesday's primaries , the general election matchups for the Senate races that are expected to be the most competitive this fall are now set.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes officially became the Democratic nominee for US Senate. He will face Ron Johnson, the incumbent Republican senator Democrats view as the most vulnerable this year.\n\nLast month, CNN ranked Johnson's seat as the fifth most likely to flip party control in the midterm elections. Here is how the rest of the races in the top five shook out:\n\n1. Pennsylvania: Lt. Gov John Fetterman (D) vs. celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz (R)\n\n2. Nevada: Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D) vs. former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt (R)\n\n3. Georgia: Sen. Raphael Warnock (D) vs. former football player Herschel Walker (R)\n\n4. Arizona: Sen. Mark Kelly (D) vs. venture capitalist Blake Masters (R)\n\nOf the rest of the races in the top 10, only two other November matchups are yet to be finalized. In New Hampshire, ranked sixth on the list, Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan won't know who will emerge from a field of relatively unknown Republican candidates until mid-September. And in Florida, number eight in the rankings, Rep. Val Demings is the heavy favorite to win the August 23 Democratic primary to take on GOP Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\nAs the landscape becomes clearer 90 days out from Election Day, there are reasons for Democrats to start feeling slightly more optimistic about their chances of keeping control of the 50-50 Senate.\n\nAt the macro level, the stiff headwinds the party has faced for most of the cycle may be starting to abate somewhat.\n\nWhile recent polls suggest President Joe Biden's approval ratings are still abysmal, he has finally started to string together some legislative victories. This week, he signed bills into law aimed at boosting American chip manufacturing and expanding health care benefits to military veterans who were exposed to toxic burn pits. The Senate also passed a major climate, tax and health care bill over the weekend, which will likely head to Biden's desk after the House takes it up in the coming days.\n\nThere are some positive indicators at the individual race level Democrats can point to as well.\n\nIn the five most hotly contested races listed above -- all of which are in states Biden won in 2020 -- incumbent Democratic senators are vastly outraising their Republican opponents in three of them (Nevada, Georgia and Arizona). In Pennsylvania, Fetterman, who has opened up an early polling and fundraising advantage , is scheduled to return to the campaign trail this week after suffering a stroke in May. And in Wisconsin, Democrats were already largely united behind Barnes after his main primary opponents dropped out in the final stretch of the race.\n\nRepublicans also took risks by nominating first-time candidates like Oz, Walker and Masters, all of whom have already found themselves embroiled in controversies.\n\nEven Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell tempered expectations during a recent appearance on Fox News. \"I think it's going to be very tight,\" he said. \"I think when this Senate race smoke clears, we're likely to have a very, very close Senate still, with us up slightly or the Democrats up slightly.\"\n\nThis is all not to say Democrats have somehow completely turned the tide heading into the fall. But it does underscore that the playing field for the Senate is much more fertile for the party than the House. The latest forecasts from FiveThirtyEight show Democrats have a 60% chance to maintain control of the Senate, compared to just a 20% chance to hold the House.", "authors": ["Analysis Adam Wollner"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/politics/2022-midterm-election-biden-senate-democrats/index.html", "title": "2022 midterm elections: Biden states will decide who controls the ...", "text": "(CNN) The one silver lining for Democrats on an otherwise stormy political horizon may be the map of states with competitive Senate races this fall.\n\nAll of the Senate contests both sides consider the most competitive will be in states that Joe Biden won in 2020, albeit in most cases narrowly.\n\nThat geography could provide a critical boost for beleaguered Democrats in an era when both parties are finding it more difficult to win Senate races in states that usually vote the other way for president. That dynamic has grown so powerful that each party now holds just three of the 50 Senate seats in the 25 states that voted against their presidential candidates in the 2020 election.\n\nNone of the three Democratic senators in states that then-President Donald Trump won in 2020 is on the ballot this fall, which leaves the battlefield centered overwhelmingly on terrain Biden captured. But Biden's eroding job approval numbers could undermine that potential geographic advantage. Each side has won very few 21st-century Senate races, either with incumbents or for open seats, in states where the approval rating is lagging for a president of its party.\n\nNow Republicans are confident that Biden's sagging approval ratings in the key states will create a comparable undertow on Democrats.\n\n\"I think Biden's numbers will very much drive the 2022 elections,\" says Republican consultant John Brabender.\n\nA pivotal question for Democrats is whether Biden has a better chance of recovering at least somewhat by November in the states that he won -- and where more voters therefore have some history of viewing him favorably. Or, failing that, whether in these states that rejected Trump in 2020 (and in some cases 2016 as well), Democratic Senate candidates can survive even lackluster numbers for Biden by reminding voters what they don't like about the GOP alternatives.\n\n\"It's not just a referendum on Biden,\" insists Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who worked for the President during the campaign. \"In Senate races you have the resources to make it a real choice; it doesn't have to be a derivative choice of an affirmation of the president or not.\"\n\nUnless Biden can get a second wind before November, especially in states that he won, the Democrats' chances of holding the Senate will turn on whether she's right.\n\nTicket-splitting declines\n\nThe basic trend of Senate results aligning more thoroughly with presidential results in the same state is one of the most powerful dynamics of modern American politics -- and a big shift from the politics during the second half of the 20th century. The first decades after World War II were a heyday for ticket-splitting in Senate elections. Republicans, for instance, held only about half the Senate seats in the states that voted twice for GOP Presidents Richard Nixon in 1968 and 1972 and Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.\n\nThe reason Senate and presidential results diverged in so many states is that many voters in that era voted for one party for president and the other in Senate races. (The same dynamic largely shaped the results of House races in these years as well.) Data from the University of Michigan's American National Election Studies found that during the 1970s one-fourth of voters backed Senate candidates of one party and presidential nominees of the other, and nearly that many did so again in the 1980s, according to analysis by Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz. The phenomenon was most intense those years in the South -- where conservative Whites backed GOP presidential nominees but still pulled the lever for conservative Democrats in congressional elections -- but not confined to that region.\n\nBut as American politics has grown more polarized since the 1980s, such split-ticket voting has plummeted. More people have treated their votes for Senate (and also House races) less as a choice between two individuals than as a quasi-parliamentary referendum on which party they wanted to control Congress -- a judgment that increasingly pivoted on their assessments of the president and his party. Just 1 in 6 people split their votes between presidential and Senate races in the 1990s, according to Abramowitz's calculations. The number of split-ticket voters, though oscillating somewhat from election to election, has fallen even further during presidential contests in this century, frequently dropping to only about 1 in 10.\n\nWith fewer voters splitting their tickets, each party is electing fewer senators in effect behind enemy lines -- in states that usually vote the other way for president. By the time of President Barack Obama 's reelection in 2012, Democrats held more than four-fifths of the Senate seats in the states he had won twice, while Republicans controlled over three-fourths in the states that had voted against him twice.\n\nThe numbers were even more dramatic after 2020: Republicans now hold 94% of the seats in the states that voted for Trump two times. (That reflects their hold of 47 of the 50 Senate seats in the 25 states he carried in 2020, since all of them also voted for him in 2016.) Twenty states voted against Trump both times: Democrats now control 98% of their Senate seats -- all but the one held by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, on February 24, 2021, on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe remaining five states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- flipped from supporting Trump in 2016 to backing Biden in 2020. Democrats now hold eight of their 10 Senate seats.\n\nIn each column of that ledger, those numbers could shift after this fall's elections:\n\nIn the states that voted against Trump twice, Republicans are targeting three Senate Democratic incumbents. Their chances are best against Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada, a state Trump lost only narrowly each time, but Republicans also believe they can threaten New Hampshire's Maggie Hassan and even Colorado's Michael Bennet if a big enough red wave develops. Democrats have no opportunities in this column this year because the sole Republican senator left in the 20 states that opposed Trump twice -- Collins -- won reelection in 2020.\n\nIn the states Trump won twice, Democrats dodged a bullet because none of their three senators in this category -- Montana's Jon Tester, Ohio's Sherrod Brown and West Virginia's Joe Manchin -- is up for reelection this fall. All might have faced very difficult odds in this political environment: In the four midterm elections since 2006, the party holding the White House has lost 12 of the 14 Senate seats it was defending in states that voted against the president in the previous election, according to recent calculations by political analyst Amy Walter. Instead, Democrats are hoping to take the offense in three states Trump carried: Ohio, Florida and North Carolina. Democrats have unified behind credible candidates in Ohio (Rep. Tim Ryan) and Florida (Rep. Val Demings) and have a clear favorite in North Carolina (former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley). But all of those states have moved away from Democrats during the Trump era, and each will be tough in a midterm when the national current is running further toward the GOP. Brabender predicts that Democrats will ultimately shift their focus away from such challenging terrain toward protecting their own incumbents.\n\nIn the states that flipped from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020, only Michigan is not electing a senator this year. The remaining four will likely decide control of the Senate. They divide in intriguing symmetry: In the Rust Belt, Democrats are seriously pursuing the open seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania and the Wisconsin seat held by Sen. Ron Johnson. In the Sun Belt, Republicans, in turn, are seriously threatening the seats held by Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Raphael Warnock of Georgia, each of whom is running for a full six-year term after winning a special election to finish an unexpired term in 2020.\n\nChilling precedent for Democrats\n\nThe clear message of midterm elections in this century is that Biden's approval rating will cast a huge shadow over the contests in all three of these categories. In 2018 , for instance, Republicans lost all 10 of the Senate races in states where Trump's approval rating registered at 48% or below, according to the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN.\n\nSimilarly, in the 2014 midterm elections, Democrats lost 14 of the 15 Senate races in states where Obama's approval rating stood at 42% or less, according to the exit polls. In 2010, Democrats likewise lost 13 of the 15 where Obama stood at 47% or less. In 2006, Republicans lost 19 of the 20 Senate races in states where President George W. Bush's job approval stood at 45% or less.\n\nThose are scary precedents for Democrats, because Biden's approval ratings are lagging in the key states on the Senate map. Recent public polls show his job approval at 43% in Wisconsin and between 35% and 40% in Georgia New Hampshire and Florida . On a slightly different metric, only 3 in 10 described his performance as excellent or good in a recent Pennsylvania poll\n\nMike Noble, a former Republican consultant who now polls for nonpartisan clients in Arizona, says his numbers show comparable erosion there for Biden since he faced disillusionment over the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last summer. \"We haven't seen him recover ever since that first domino in Afghanistan,\" Noble says.\n\nThat history, and Biden's current distress, raise two core questions. One is whether the President has a better chance to rebuild his approval rating by November in states he won than in those he lost because more voters have histories of viewing him positively. Lake, the Democratic pollster, says recovery is \"much\" easier in states \"where people already voted for you and people already liked you.\" In states that a president lost, she continued, \"it is very, very hard in the first off-year election to create something from scratch.\" But in states that he won, she argues, it's easier for voters to be moved by changes in circumstance, such as the leadership Biden has displayed in coalescing the Western response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In those states, \"It's easier for voters to say, 'Where were you? This is the Biden I voted for; this is the Biden I was looking for.' \"\n\nBiden's approval rating, as noted above, has sagged in states he won as well as those he lost.\n\n\"It's worse in the states that he lost because they are predisposed to think negatively of him, but you don't have the kind of collapse he's had ... without it being across the board,\" says Republican pollster Whit Ayres.\n\nBut there's evidence in public polling that in the states Biden won, dissatisfaction with him may not be as intense, and thus as unmovable. The latest Franklin & Marshall College poll in Pennsylvania captures the dynamic. In the survey, just that 30% described Biden's performance as excellent or good, while 51% described it as poor. But another 18% of those surveyed described his performance as only \"fair.\"\n\nBerwood A. Yost, director of the college's Center for Opinion Research, told me that fully four-fifths of the poll respondents who gave Biden that equivocal \"fair\" rating had voted for him in 2020. The President would provide Pennsylvania Democrats a huge boost if he can move those ambivalent former voters back to fully positive, because almost all of those in the poll who gave him excellent or good marks said they intend to vote Democratic for Congress in November.\n\n\"He's probably not going to get those Trump voters,\" Yost told me. \"His hope is in his base and his ability to get the moderate or independent voters back to his side.\"\n\nAyres is skeptical that Biden can recover too many of those swing voters, even in states like Pennsylvania where they include more people who voted for him in 2020.\n\n\"He got a significant share of independents who believed that he was going to be a centrist, competent president and he's done a pretty good job of blowing up both of those characteristics by continually veering to the left on policy and demonstrating with the withdrawal from Afghanistan that his reputation for foreign policy expertise may have been a mirage,\" Ayres argues. \"People who believed that you ran one way and then governed another are not going to be real open to coming back as long as he continues to pursue the current course.\"\n\nWorking 'both sides'\n\nThe other key question is the extent to which individual Democratic Senate candidates can separate their fates from Biden's. The general trend is unmistakably toward greater synchronization between Senate results and views of the president, but there remain occasional exceptions, such as Collins' victory in 2020 in a state Biden won comfortably, or the 2018 victories of Democratic Sens. Manchin, Tester and Brown in states where Trump's approval rating in the exit polls exceeded 50%.\n\nTo escape the undertow of negative views about Biden, Democratic Senate candidates need to work on what party pollster Andrew Baumann calls \"both sides\" of the choice in their elections.\n\n\"You need to lift up the Democratic candidate and show some separation,\" he says, \"and you need to just make it clear that even if these voters are not happy with Biden that the Republican alternative here is unacceptable.\"\n\nAlready, Democrats can point to polls showing some of their senators enjoying better ratings than Biden in their state. A January Quinnipiac poll in Georgia , for instance, put Warnock's approval rating there 11 percentage points higher than the President's -- and a striking 15 points better with independents.\n\nEven more important for Democrats in most of these races, though, may be the second half of Baumann's equation: disqualifying the Republican alternative. Of the races that both sides are seriously contesting, only two involve Republican incumbents: Wisconsin's Johnson and Florida's Marco Rubio . Recent polls show voters divided only evenly on Rubio's performance and a clear plurality of Wisconsin voters expressing unfavorable views toward Johnson.\n\nIn the other contests, Democrats are optimistic that the GOP will, in many instances, put \"forward flawed candidates who are stuck in vicious expensive primaries that will drain their resources and leave their eventual nominee badly out of step with the voters that decide the general election in their states,\" as David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, says.\n\nBrabender, the GOP consultant, says Democratic hopes of disqualifying Republican nominees by linking them to Trump probably won't prove as effective as they anticipate -- even in states that rejected him in 2020. One reason, he argues, is that Trump is simply less visible than he was while in office. \"Secondly, I don't think there is the negative connotation of Trump at this moment that there was,\" Brabender adds, \"because [voters] don't look at Biden as an improvement.\"\n\nBut to the extent Republicans do emerge from Senate primaries damaged or positioned too far to the right -- a real risk for the GOP particularly in Arizona, Colorado, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania -- they may struggle to consolidate the voters disenchanted with Biden. One early marker of that possibility: Less than three-fifths of the Wisconsin residents who disapproved of Biden's job performance expressed favorable views toward Johnson in the latest Marquette University Law School poll , according to data provided by Charles Franklin, the survey's director. (By comparison, nearly four-fifths of those who approved of Biden already hold unfavorable views about Johnson.)\n\nAll of these factors, most experts agree, give Democrats better odds of holding the Senate in November than the House. But unless Biden's approval rating substantially recovers by fall, their chances will remain murky on both fronts. A more favorable map may be a necessary condition for Democrats maintaining their Senate majority, but it's far from clear it will be sufficient.", "authors": ["Analysis Ronald Brownstein"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/03/politics/house-midterms-2022-republicans-democrats/index.html", "title": "Will Republicans win back the House in 2022? Here's how the race ...", "text": "(CNN) The House committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol is racing against a political clock to get to the bottom of what happened that day, and in the lead-up to the attack .\n\nSo how likely are Republicans to win this fall? Historically, very likely. The party in the White House traditionally loses seats in the first midterm election of a new president's term. In fact, the president's party has lost an average of 30 House seats in midterm elections over the last 100 years, according to Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales . Republicans only need a net gain of five seats to win the chamber this year.\n\nA reminder: A net gain of five seats is not the same thing as winning five seats. A party needs at least 218 seats to win control of the House. While Republicans are trying to flip seats this year, so are the Democrats -- so any GOP wins will have to be offset by any losses they incur.\n\nThat said, losses are not a huge concern for Republicans right now. Given the historical trends working in their favor and the fact that President Joe Biden 's approval rating is 40% in the latest CNN average of national polls, the national environment seems to be working in their favor. And the uptick in retirement announcements by several longtime Democratic incumbents in recent months is a telling sign they weren't looking forward to serving in the minority.\n\nBut it's not all bad news for Democrats. The House map is not as favorable to Republicans as the majority party feared it could have been. The once-a-decade redistricting process is nearly complete (except for a handful of states), which has resulted in new congressional lines that Democrats think give them a shot at holding their majority.\n\nOverall, the biggest takeaway from redistricting is that the number of competitive House seats has shrunk, which means that in most states, primaries -- rather than general election contests -- will be the main event.\n\nSeveral states are hosting member-on-member primaries, in which two incumbents are running in the same district, either because their state lost a seat in redistricting or they were drawn into the same seat for partisan reasons. While those races can provide plenty of intraparty drama -- and in some cases, a test of Trump's enduring influence over the GOP -- they're mostly not expected to have any effect on the general election. In West Virginia , for example, two Republican incumbents -- one who objected to certifying the 2020 presidential election and one who did not -- are facing off in a heavily Republican district. Regardless of who wins the May primary, the seat is highly unlikely to fall into Democratic hands in November.\n\nSome states hold open primaries -- in which candidates from all parties run on the same primary ballot with the top two or four candidates advancing to the general election. One of those states is Alaska, where former governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin is running in a special election for the state's at-large seat left vacant by the death last month of Republican Rep. Don Young. Barring any primary surprises, Republicans are expected to hold this seat.\n\nJust 61 House races (out of 435) are currently rated as competitive by Inside Elections . Of those, only 16 are rated as Toss-up races -- seven seats held by Republicans, eight held by Democrats and one new seat in Colorado.\n\nA smaller landscape of competitive races means Republicans will be reaching deeper into Democratic territory to look for pickup opportunities. On Wednesday, for example, the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of the House GOP, expanded its list of targets to 72 Democratic-held or newly created seats, including districts that now-President Joe Biden carried by double digits in 2020. Of course, these target lists evolve over time and don't necessarily reflect where money ends up getting spent.\n\nOn the same day as the NRCC announcement, House Majority PAC -- the leading Democratic super PAC focused on House races -- publicized TV and digital advertising reservations of more than $100 million across 50 media markets. That's nearly double the amount the group made in initial reservations in 2020.\n\nRepublican opportunities\n\nA top focus for Republicans is sure to be the Democratic-held seats that Trump won in 2020. That includes districts represented by Reps. Jared Golden of Maine, Cindy Axne of Iowa and Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania, all of whom are in for tough races this fall.\n\nBut the majority of the NRCC's targets are seats that Biden won. That goes to show just how few \"crossover\" districts -- those that voted one way for president but backed a US House representative of a different party -- are left for Republicans to try to flip.\n\nIncreasingly nationalized and partisan elections have done away with the likes of former Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson, a Democrat whose district voted for Trump by the biggest margin -- 30 points -- in 2016. But after narrowly holding on to his sprawling, rural district in 2018, the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee went down in 2020.\n\nRepublicans were encouraged by their gains with Hispanic voters in 2020 and hope that trend continues this year, especially in places such as Texas' Rio Grande Valley, where several House seats are in play.\n\nThey're also hoping they may be able to make a play for some of the traditionally GOP-leaning suburban districts that moved away from them during the Trump era.\n\nDemocratic retirements have also set up a few enticing pickup opportunities for Republicans. Retiring Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos, the former chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has often touted her success in a Trump-voting district. Pennsylvania Rep. Conor Lamb, who is running for Senate, talks up his record of winning in Trump country. But both are leaving behind seats that will see competitive races, according to Inside Elections.\n\nDemocrats on defense\n\nDemocrats hoping to maintain their House majority need to defend the seats they have, while also looking to pick up a few more to help offset the inevitable losses they're likely to incur in a midterm year with their party holding full control of Washington (the White House, Senate and House).\n\nHouse Democrats' top defensive holds are incumbents the DCCC calls \"Frontline\" members. Many of these incumbents have had tough races before, and some of their districts became more favorable in redistricting, although perhaps not enough to ensure a comfortable reelection in a difficult national environment.\n\nGolden, a two-term incumbent from Maine, for example, has a history of overperforming the top of the ticket. His district's White working-class voters twice backed Trump, while Golden won reelection in 2020 by 6 points. But even if he's bucked the national Democratic Party on certain major votes in Washington, he's still in for a tough race, potentially facing off against a better-funded and more organized opponent than he did two years ago. Former GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin, whom Golden unseated in 2018 under Maine's ranked-choice voting system , is running again. Inside Elections rates the race a Toss-up.\n\nMany of the DCCC's Frontliners who won in 2018 -- when Democrats flipped the House during Trump's presidency -- are used to raising huge sums of money. They set new quarterly records for hauls in the millions that put even some Senate candidates to shame. But not all Democrats who potentially face competitive races this year after redistricting are accustomed to that level of campaigning. Two longtime incumbents, Reps. Sanford Bishop of Georgia and Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, haven't faced competitive elections in years.\n\nDemocrats believe they can remain competitive in the suburbs, which soured on Republicans under Trump. Still, Trump is not in office or on the ballot, which will be a test of whether Democrats can sustain base voter enthusiasm without him.\n\nDemocrats are also eyeing pickup opportunities, especially in GOP-held seats that Biden won. That includes a handful of districts in California and New York, although there's new uncertainty over the district lines in the Empire State after a judge blocked the Democratic-drawn map on Thursday.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/04/senate-midterm-elections-races-updates/7864012001/", "title": "Control of the Senate is now a coin flip: These are the 7 midterm ...", "text": "Now that the midterm elections are a little more than two months away, Democratic and Republican nominees have been decided for almost every race going into November.\n\nAnalysts originally projected November to be a blowout victory for Republicans across the board in the face of low approval ratings for President Joe Biden and high inflation.

Republicans want the Senate majority to stifle Biden and congressional Democrats’ agenda.\n\nHere are important Senate races to keep an eye on (* denotes incumbent):\n\nArizona: Mark Kelly* (D) vs. Blake Masters (R)\n\nSen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., is one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents Republicans have their eye on unseating. Kelly, who has served only two years after winning a special election, has to face Arizona voters again to serve a full six-year term.\n\nKelly is up against Trump-backed venture capitalist Blake Masters. Masters earned Donald Trump’s backing partly because he has supported the former president's baseless claims of election fraud. In an interview with NBC News, Masters said he would have objected to the certification of the 2020 election had he been a senator at the time.\n\nMaster’s nomination could be precarious for Republicans who are set on reclaiming the Senate majority. Though GOP voters outnumber Democratic voters in Arizona, Kelly leads Masters by 6 percentage points, 45%-39%, according to a poll released Thursday by KSAZ-TV and InsiderAdvantage.\n\nGeorgia: Raphael Warnock* (D) vs. Herschel Walker (R)\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., is in the same boat as Kelly. After winning a special election in 2020, he's running again in November to serve a full six-year term.\n\nGeorgia GOP voters have nominated former NFL running back Herschel Walker to take on Warnock. Once a Republican stronghold, Georgia has become a competitive battleground after Biden won the Peach State in 2020 – the first time a Democratic presidential candidate won here in 28 years.\n\nWalker, Trump’s pick, is running a tight race against Warnock. Despite Republican concerns over his competency as a candidate because he is a political novice, Walker boasts name recognition that could be enough to propel him over the finish line in November.\n\nWalker is narrowly leading Warnock by 46%-44%, a thin margin of two points, according to poll conducted by Emerson College.\n\nNevada: Cortez Masto* (D) vs. Laxalt (R)\n\nSen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., will be facing off against her Republican opponent, former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, in a race national Republicans have identified as their best chance to flip.\n\nCortez Masto has enjoyed a boost in polling numbers, according to a poll by Suffolk University and the Reno Gazette Journal. Previously behind by 3 percentage points, Cortez Masto now leads Laxalt by 7 points.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade – which had established a constitutional right to an abortion – appears to have swung voters in Cortez Masto’s favor. Among likely voters who say abortion is the most important issue to them, Cortez Masto leads Laxalt 79%-11%.\n\nPennsylvania: Fetterman (D) vs. Oz (R)\n\nPennsylvania’s Senate race is open after Pat Toomey, R-Pa., announced his retirement. Democrats saw a chance to flip Toomey’s seat blue in one of the most consequential swing states. Democratic nominee Lt. Gov. John Fetterman leads his Republican opponent, Dr. Mehmet Oz, by several percentage points in recent polls.\n\nFetterman has recently returned to the campaign trail after a three-month hiatus after a stroke. Dr. Oz has been defending himself from his ties to New Jersey (he has reportedly lived in the Garden State for decades) and accusations of carpetbagging.\n\nOz has insisted on a broadcasted debate between him and Fetterman in September, to which Fetterman declined, citing concerns over his stroke. The Oz campaign seized upon his health conditions and has attacked him for it.\n\n\"We will pay for any additional medical personnel he might need to have on standby,\" the campaign said, alluding to Fetterman's health.\n\nFetterman however, has vowed to debate Oz, but not as early as he would like. \"We're absolutely going to debate Dr. Oz and that was really always our intent to do that,\" he told Politico, saying he would commit to a debate sometime in October.\n\nNew Hampshire: Hassan* (D) vs. yet-to-be-chosen Republican\n\nIn New Hampshire, Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., faces an uphill battle after a poll by Saint Anselm College found voters have a low approval rating of her at 44%.\n\nHassan’s opponent has yet to be decided; the Granite State's primary is being held much later than others, on Sep. 13. The Saint Anselm poll found that her most likely opponent will be Don Bolduc, a candidate who lost a 2020 Senate primary and who has also espoused Trump’s claims of election fraud.\n\n\"Bolduc is the candidate who worries Republicans the most, and they'd probably be fine with any other of the hopefuls,\" Taylor wrote about the race, noting that the state's popular GOP Gov. Chris Sununu \"blasted Bolduc as a 'conspiracy-theorist-type candidate' and said that 'if he were the GOP nominee I have no doubt we'd have a much harder time'.\"\n\nOutside money has flooded New Hampshire over concerns about Bolduc's electability if he becomes the nominee. White Mountain PAC, a Republican affiliated PAC, has poured $4.6 million into advertisements supporting New Hampshire state Senate President Chuck Morse, Bolduc's more moderate opponent.\n\nWisconsin: Johnson* (R) vs. Barnes (D)\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., is the most vulnerable GOP incumbent on this list. After reneging on a self-imposed limit of 12 years in office, Johnson announced he would be running for a third term, saying in an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal that the country “is in too much peril.”\n\nJohnson is running against Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, the state's first Black lieutenant governor, who would be the state's first Black senator if he unseats Johnson.\n\nBiden won Wisconsin by less than 1 percentage point in 2020 – as did Trump in 2016 – making this year's Senate race anyone's game.\n\nOn Labor Day, Biden stopped by Milwaukee to deliver a speech celebrating union members and continuing his attacks on \"extreme-minded Republicans.\" Barnes was absent from the event and cited \"a pretty packed schedule,\" to WISN 12 News.\n\nBut while Biden's approval rating has been unfavorable, Wisconsin voters have been cool on Johnson as well. Johnson had a 38% approval rating among registered voters, according to a poll released last week from the Marquette Law School.\n\nThat same poll found Barnes leads Johnson by 7 percentage points at 51%-44%. But the race in November is expected to be much closer; Republicans will focus on Barnes’ previous support of left-wing movements such as defunding the police and abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\n\nNorth Carolina: Beasley (D) vs. Budd (R)\n\nIn North Carolina, Rep. Ted Budd, R-N.C., and former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley will be battling for GOP Sen. Richard Burr's seat after he announced he would not be seeking a fourth term.\n\nBeasley has significantly outraised Budd – by more than double – as of June 30. But North Carolina has not sent a Democratic senator to Washington since 2008. A poll by Cygnal and sponsored by the John Locke Foundation – both conservative organizations – found the candidates are neck-and-neck, both polling at 42%.\n\n\"The state does have a sizable unaffiliated voter bloc, and the key for Beasley is to win over those voters, particularly in suburban Charlotte and Raleigh, while also picking off moderate Republicans who Budd turns off,\" Taylor wrote. \"The fundamentals of the race still slightly favor Budd, but if this turns out to be a nontraditional year, that may not hold.\"\n\nStay updated on these races and other important Senate races:Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/16/politics/senate-house-2022-first-quarter-fundraising/index.html", "title": "First quarter fundraising report takeaways: Warnock, Kelly continue ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSenate Democrats face strong political headwinds in this year’s midterm elections, but they have maintained – and in some cases, super-charged – their fundraising in pivotal states, new campaign finance reports show.\n\nThe filings, which cover the first three months of 2022, further exemplify a campaign cycle awash in money – with energized small donors, billionaires and a cadre of self-financed candidates already powering mammoth spending.\n\nThe stakes are high: Control of the US Senate and House of Representatives is up for grabs this fall, along with the ability to shape President Joe Biden’s legislative agenda for the remainder of his first term.\n\nHere’s a look at key takeaways from reports that candidates and political action committees filed late Friday with the Federal Election Commission:\n\nWarnock, Kelly continue to outpace GOP fields\n\nTwo of the most vulnerable Democratic senators on the ballot this year – Georgia’s Raphael Warnock and Arizona’s Mark Kelly – have amassed some of the biggest campaign war chests of the cycle.\n\nWarnock raised nearly $13.6 million in the January-March fundraising window – which his campaign touted as a new high for a Senate candidate in the first quarter of an election year.\n\nThe Georgia senator, who is running for a full six-year term this fall after winning a special election last year, entered April with nearly $25.6 million stockpiled in his campaign account. That was more than triple the amount banked by Herschel Walker, considered the front-runner for the Republican nomination. Former President Donald Trump encouraged Walker to enter the race, and the former football star has also consolidated support from the GOP’s establishment wing, often at odds with the ex-President.\n\nIn Arizona, Kelly reported raising $11.4 million in the first quarter and had $23.3 million in cash on hand on March 31 – far outpacing the field of Republicans vying to challenge him.\n\nTwo other vulnerable Democratic senators – Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire – also outraised their leading Republican challengers this quarter and ended March with bigger cash reserves.\n\nDemocratic challengers raise big sums\n\nEven in less competitive Senate fights, Democratic challengers are pulling in big sums.\n\nIn Florida, donors continue to flood US Rep. Val Demings’ campaign with money in her challenge to Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, whose seat independent political handicappers view as likely to remain in the GOP column.\n\nDemings brought in $10 million in the first quarter, while Rubio collected nearly $5.8 million in the same period. They each had roughly $13 million in the bank at the quarter’s end.\n\nDemings, whose national profile soared when she served as a House manager at Trump’s first impeachment trial, took in about half her contributions from individuals in small-dollar increments. Contributions from small-dollar donors represented a little more than a third of Rubio’s quarterly haul.\n\nAnd in North Carolina, where Democrats are trying to pick up an open GOP-held seat in a state that twice backed Trump, Democrat Cheri Beasley outraised the top Republican candidates in the first quarter.\n\nThe former state Supreme Court chief justice took in more than $3.6 million and ended March with $5.1 million in unspent cash.\n\nTrump’s endorsement of US Rep. Ted Budd has so far failed to clear the Republican field to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Richard Burr, with former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory remaining in the primary.\n\nBudd and McCrory each raised about $1.1 million and ended the quarter with roughly $2 million apiece in available cash.\n\nRecent political history underscores that financial firepower alone doesn’t win races. In reliably red South Carolina, for instance, Democratic Senate nominee Jaime Harrison repeatedly shattered fundraising records in the 2020 election, only to lose by double digits to GOP incumbent Lindsey Graham.\n\nSelf-funders seek edge in crowded GOP primaries\n\nIn Pennsylvania – where the brawl for an open Senate seat has fueled massive spending on the airwaves – Republican candidates have opened their own wallets, seeking an edge in the crowded primary.\n\nDavid McCormick, a former hedge fund executive, loaned his campaign nearly $7 million in the first quarter – more than any other candidate.\n\nOne of his chief rivals in the Republican primary, former TV personality Mehmet Oz, plowed nearly $6 million into his campaign over the same period, filings show.\n\nTrump recently endorsed Oz – bypassing McCormick, who had hired several former Trump aides and courted the former President’s support.\n\nDeep-pocketed Republican candidates in other states also are making big bets on their candidacies. In Ohio, for instance, millionaire investment banker Mike Gibbons loaned his campaign $5 million in the first quarter.\n\nOn Friday, Trump backed a Gibbons rival, venture capitalist and “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance, in the crowded GOP primary to fill the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Rob Portman.\n\nVance loaned his campaign $600,000 in late March, according to his FEC report.\n\nIncumbents face off in West Virginia\n\nIn a bitter all-incumbent Republican primary in West Virginia’s new 2nd Congressional District, US Rep. David McKinley pulled in more than $481,000 during the first quarter – edging out US Rep. Alex Mooney, his Trump-endorsed rival, who raised $465,000.\n\nBut Mooney started April with more campaign cash stockpiled, $1.4 million to McKinley’s $1 million.\n\nThe May 10 primary is the first election this year that pits two sitting lawmakers against one another, following the once-in-a-decade redrawing of congressional boundaries.\n\nWest Virginia lost one of its seats after the 2020 census.\n\nDuring the first quarter, McKinley scored endorsements and donations from the state’s Republican governor, Jim Justice, who with his wife, Cathy, contributed $5,800.\n\nBillionaire GOP donor Ken Langone and his wife, Elaine, donated a combined $11,600 to McKinley’s reelection, filings show.\n\nThe conservative powerhouse Club for Growth and the House Freedom Fund funneled donations to Mooney’s campaign in the first quarter.\n\nCheney bests Hageman, again\n\nWyoming Republican Harriet Hageman, the attorney and activist seeking to oust US Rep. Liz Cheney in the August primary, saw her fundraising jump to $1.3 million during the first three months of the year. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and dozens of other House Republicans held a fundraiser for the challenger in March.\n\nTrump, who called for ousting Cheney after she voted to impeach him last year, backs Hagerman.\n\nBut Cheney, one of the GOP’s most prominent Trump critics, set a new personal record during the first quarter, raising nearly $2.9 million. The third-term congresswoman had stockpiled $6.8 million in available cash to Hageman’s $1 million as of March 31, the filings show.\n\nIn another contest that pits the Trump wing of the GOP against an established Republican incumbent, Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski continued to outpace her Trump-backed primary challenger, Kelly Tshibaka.\n\nMurkowski, who is seeking a fourth full term, raised nearly $1.6 million to Tshibaka’s roughly $670,000 in the first quarter.

Facebook must also maintain a data security program, which includes protections of information such as users' phone numbers.\n\nFacebook-FTC deal:Settlement means a $5B fine for social network, but not much on face for users\n\nGoodbye to Apple's iPhone 6:So now what smartphone should I buy as a budget option?\n\nThe company separately agreed to pay $100 million to settle data misuse charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\"Public companies must accurately describe the material risks to their business,\" Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC's Enforcement Division said in a statement. \"As alleged in our complaint, Facebook presented the risk of misuse of users data as hypothetical when they knew user data had in fact been misused.\"\n\nFacebook's privacy practices have long been in the government crosshairs and under the scrutiny of consumer watchdog groups, not all of which are satisfied with the terms of Wednesday's agreement.\n\nZuckerberg has appeared in congressional hearings after the Cambridge Analytica scandal surfaced. Facebook suspended the data analysis and political consulting firm in March 2018 for improper access to user data. That move came after The New York Times and U.K.'s The Observer said Cambridge Analytica had access to 50 million profiles and used them to target ads during the 2016 presidential election campaign. At the time, Facebook said it knew the firm had violated its policies by obtaining and secretly passing on the data, which users had agreed to share with a personality prediction app.\n\nThe separate SEC complaint also dates back to Facebook's response to Cambridge Analytica. The allegation, which Facebook while agreeing to the final $100 million judgment neither admits nor denies, is that in 2014 and 2015, Cambridge Analytica paid an academic researcher to \"collect and transfer data from Facebook to create personality scores for approximately 30 million Americans\" and that Facebook discovered this misuse in 2015 but failed to correctly disclose it for more than two years.\n\nThe $5-billion FTC fine is nearly 20 times greater than the largest privacy or data security penalty that has ever been assessed worldwide and is one of the largest imposed by the U.S. government for any violation.\n\nAs part of the settlement, the FTC's order also curbs Zuckerberg's oversight in privacy and security matters, with the requirement Facebook create a new privacy committee with independent board members who cannot be removed without a two-thirds shareholder vote. Zuckerberg and designated compliance officers each must submit individual quarterly compliance reports to the FTC.\n\nBig tech:Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter likely facing review from Justice Department\n\nEquifax-FTC settlement:What does Equifax's $700M settlement over its data breach mean for you?\n\nAdditionally, a third-party assessor will monitor Facebook's privacy-related decisions going forward.\n\nThe commission approved the settlement with a 3-2 vote, with the dissenting commissioners wanting tougher action taken against Zuckerberg.\n\nBut the order achieves more than the FTC could have achieved by going to court, says chairman Joe Simons and the commissioners Noah Joshua Phillips and Christine Wilson, who approved the settlement in their lengthy statement.\n\n\"The Order significantly diminishes Mr. Zuckerberg’s power – something no government agency, anywhere in the world, has thus far accomplished,\" the statement says.\n\n\"The provisions of this Order extinguish the ability of Mr. Zuckerberg to make privacy decisions unilaterally by also vesting responsibility and accountability for those decisions within business units, DCOs (digital compliance officers), and the privacy committee.\"\n\nThe settlement hasn't placated Facebook's harshest critics.\n\n\"A penalty that doesn’t require real structural changes, that financially is a drop in the bucket, and that appears to absolve Facebook of any liability over additional abuses like tricking kids into in-app purchases, is a get out jail free card for Facebook and sends a signal to the rest of the industry that business as usual is acceptable,\" said Common Sense CEO James Steyer in a statement. \"This punishment simply does not fit the crime and we strongly encourage policymakers to consider this just the very beginning of a long way we have to go to hold Facebook and the tech industry accountable for protecting the privacy of users, especially young people.\"\n\nConsumer Reports President and CEO Marta Tellado, added, “As expected, the size of the settlement is historic, but these attempts to hold Facebook accountable are not enough to make a real difference. With a weak and under-resourced FTC, and a glaring need for far more comprehensive privacy laws, Congress must raise the standards for consumers and hold Big Tech accountable.\"\n\nSimilarly, earlier this week, the FTC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and 50 states and territories reached a settlement with credit-reporting company Equifax over allegations that it did not implement sufficient security measures to prevent a massive data breach. Equifax must pay at least $575 million and potentially as much as $700 million.\n\nPreviously, the FTC’s highest fines were to Google, which paid $22.5 million in 2012 and Upromise, which paid $500,000 in 2017.\n\nFacebook agreed to the settlement with the agency over allegations it broke a previous agreement over privacy protections.\n\nThe changes the company agreed to will likely make it take longer to bring new features to Facebook and its other products, Zuckerberg said.\n\nBut, it is the company's \"responsibility to protect people's privacy. We already work hard to live up to this responsibility, but now we're going to set a completely new standard for our industry,\" Zuckerberg said. \"Overall, these changes go beyond anything required under US law today. The reason I support them is that I believe they will reduce the number of mistakes we make and help us deliver stronger privacy protections for everyone.\"\n\nFacebook (FB) shares were down more than 1% in early trading to $199.94; the ended the trading day up $2.30 to close at $204.66. Shares have risen 47% so far this year. The company is expected to release its second-quarter results after the market closes Wednesday.\n\nThe FTC also announced separate settlements with Cambridge Analytica, its former CEO Alexander Nix, and Aleksandr Kogan, an app developer who worked with the company. The actions allege Cambridge \"used false and deceptive tactics to harvest personal information from millions of Facebook users\" and all face restrictions on future business.\n\nTimeline:Facebook becomes the Uber of 2018\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/01/28/not-reading-the-small-print-is-privacy-policy-fail/4565274002/", "title": "Data Privacy Day: Not reading the small print can hurt you", "text": "We’ve all done it. We're updating the operating system on our mobile phone or installing an app, and we lazily skim through the privacy policy or we don't bother to read it at all before blindly clicking \"I agree.\"\n\nNever mind that we are handing out our sensitive personal information to anyone who asks. A Deloitte survey of 2,000 U.S. consumers in 2017 found that 91% of people consent to terms of service without reading them. For younger people, ages 18-34, that rate was even higher: 97% did so.\n\nProPrivacy.com says the figure is even higher. The digital privacy group recently asked internet users to take a survey as part of a market research study for a $1 reward. The survey asked participants to agree to the terms and conditions, then tracked how many users clicked through to read them.\n\nThose who clicked through were met with a lengthy user agreement. Buried in that agreement were mischievous clauses such as one that gives your mom permission to review your internet browsing history and another that hands over naming rights to your firstborn child.\n\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act of 2020:What the new privacy law means to you\n\nUsing a period tracker app? This is what happens to your personal information\n\nOut of 100 people, 19 clicked through to the terms and conditions page, but only one person read it thoroughly enough to realize they’d be agreeing to grant drones access to the airspace over their home.\n\nThis isn't the first time researchers have used trickery to drive the point home that few people read all the terms of service, privacy policies and other agreements that regularly pop up on their screens.\n\nIn 2016, two communication professors – Jonathan Obar of York University in Toronto and Anne Oeldorf-Hirsch of the University of Connecticut – asked unsuspecting college students to join nonexistent social network NameDrop and agree to the terms of service. Those who did unwittingly gave NameDrop their firstborn children and agreed to have anything they shared on the service passed on to the National Security Agency.\n\nSome companies reward customers who scour the small print. Last year, Georgia high school teacher Donelan Andrews won $10,000 for poring through the terms of the travel insurance policy she purchased for a trip to England. The Florida insurer, Squaremouth, offered the prize to the first person who emailed the company.\n\nOther companies ding consumers to draw attention to the risks. In 2017, 22,000 people signing up for free public Wi-Fi agreed to perform 1,000 hours of community service – cleaning toilets, scraping gum off the sidewalk and \"relieving sewer blockages\" – to highlight \"the lack of consumer awareness of what they are signing up to when they access free wifi.\" The company, Purple, offered a prize for anyone who read the terms and conditions and found the clause. One person claimed it.\n\nWhat you don't know can hurt you\n\nThe problem? We needlessly put ourselves at risk by signing away all kinds of rights over what personal data an app or website collects, how they use it, with whom they share it and how long they keep it, says ProPrivacy.com, which decided to draw attention to the problem Tuesday when the world observes Data Privacy Day.\n\nShady individuals and outfits and snooping corporations constantly extract and exploit our personal information for financial gain, spying on us with the kind of sophisticated monitoring tools that would make James Bond drool.\n\nIt's not just ad targeting. Some of that information can end up in the hands of health insurers, life insurance companies, even employers, all of which make critical decisions about our lives.\n\nYet we mostly just shrug our shoulders when asked. At first, more than two-thirds of the ProPrivacy.com survey participants claimed they read the agreement and 33 claimed to have read it top to bottom. When the jig was up, they offered up the same old excuses: It took too much time to read through it all. They trusted the organization had their best interests at heart. Or they simply didn't care.\n\nThat \"que será será\" attitude is understandable. There are few laws or regulations protecting online privacy, so shielding our personal information from prying eyes can seem like an exercise in futility. But we can all take steps to thwart 24/7 corporate surveillance. That starts with reading the small print.\n\nWhat are you signing?\n\nThe terms of service is a legal document that protects the company and explains to consumers what the rules are when using the service, says Ray Walsh, data privacy advocate at ProPrivacy.com. A privacy policy, on the other hand, is a legal document that explains to users how their data will be collected and used by the company and any third parties or affiliates. Remember, when you click \"I agree\" on these documents, your approval is legally binding.\n\nMuch of what's included in these documents is boilerplate or relatively innocuous. But there are some areas to pay attention to, such as granting a company the right to sell your personal information to third parties, trace your movements using GPS and other tracking capabilities, harvest your device identifiers or track your device's IP address and other digital identifiers, Walsh says. Beware of companies that demand a \"perpetual license\" to your \"likeness\" or to your personal data.\n\n\"These kinds of invasive stipulations can be extremely harmful, and consumers must ensure that they never agree to them or other privacy agreements that denote not how the user will gain privacy but rather how they will have it stripped from them,\" Walsh says.\n\nSearch for keywords\n\nWho has the time to wade through page after page of dense legal jargon to spot the worrisome bits?\n\nAlex Hern, a journalist with The Guardian, spent one week in 2015 reading the terms and conditions the rest of us don't. The result: It took him eight hours to skim 146,000 words in 33 documents. A study by two law professors in 2019 found that 99% of the 500 most popular U.S. websites had terms of service written as complexly as academic journals, making them inaccessible to most people.\n\nIf your eyes are glazing over, there are some shortcuts. Search for keywords or phrases in the document that will tell you what information the app or website collects, how long it keeps it and with whom it shares it. Watch out for sections that say you must “accept,” “agree” or “authorize” something, Walsh says.\n\n\"Third parties” is a key phrase, as are “advertising partners” and “affiliates.” “Retain” or “retention” can indicate how long the company keeps your personal information. “Opt out” may indicate how to turn off the sale or collection of your personal information.\n\n\"The do’s and don’ts can alter radically from one service to another, and it is essential for consumers to understand how they can use each individual service they sign up for,\" Walsh says.\n\nDon’t have time? Here's a shortcut\n\nThe motto of the ToS;DR user rights initiative (short for “Terms of Service; Didn't Read,” inspired by internet acronym TL;DR \"Too Long; Didn't Read\"): “I have read and agree to the terms” is “the biggest lie on the web.”\n\nThe project offers a free browser extension that labels and rates these agreements from very good (Class A) to very bad (Class E) on the websites you visit.

COPPA aims to safeguard online privacy for those 13 and under.\n\nYouTube a haven for young viewers\n\nYouTube's press team said in a statement that it will look at the complaint to determine if it can improve on how it protects kids and families. \"Because YouTube is not for children, we’ve invested significantly in the creation of the YouTube Kids app to offer an alternative specifically designed for children,” the statement read.\n\nChild advocates say YouTube is being disingenuous when it comes to acknowledging just how much influence the site has over shaping the worldview of younger views, many of whom have come to regard the platform as a replacement for television. YouTube says you have to be 13 years or older to use the site, but critics say it is tacitly allowing violations of this restriction when it enables content aimed at young children to flourish.\n\n\"For years, Google has abdicated its responsibility to kids and families by disingenuously claiming YouTube, a site rife with popular cartoons, nursery rhymes and toy ads, is not for children under 13,\" Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, said in a statement. \"It's time for the FTC to hold Google accountable.\"\n\nGolin's organization is among more than a dozen signing on to the complaint, including Common Sense Media, Consumer Watchdog and the Parent Coalition for Student Privacy.\n\nThe groups argue in their complaint to the FTC that YouTube is well aware of its popularity among children considering that it hosts channels such as ChuChuTV Nursery Rhymes and created the YouTube Kids app.\n\n\"YouTube's privacy policy discloses that it collects many types of personal information, including geolocation, unique device signifiers, mobile telephone numbers ... from children under the age of 13,\" the complaint summary reads.

Meanwhile, more tough questions arise about a site that started in 2005 as a way to share homemade videos but has grown into an entertainment force.\n\nFor all the positive aspects of YouTube — it's not only a repository of obscure how-to videos but essentially acts as a video log of history — the site continues to draw negative attention thanks to some of its users.\n\nRecently, YouTube courted controversy for everything from dangerous stunts gone tragically wrong (as in the recent jailing of a woman for accidentally shooting her boyfriend on camera) to dumb pranks gone horribly viral (cue the eating of Tide Pods laundry detergent).\n\nWhen it comes to minors in particular, YouTube has come under pressure for allowing users to upload videos aimed at children that sometimes feature violent and sexual themes.\n\nMore:How YouTube creators get paid for ads and why some have been angry\n\nMore:YouTube not ready to kick out provocateur Logan Paul, CEO says\n\nMore:Woman jailed for fatally shooting boyfriend in botched YouTube stunt\n\nLast summer, the company took steps to address the issue, including no longer allowing creators to make money from videos that featured the inappropriate use of family friendly characters.\n\nIn November, YouTube announced that it would age-restrict such content in the main YouTube site — when flagged. But for the most part, algorithms — not humans — do most of the video policing on the site.\n\nThe often ineffectual nature of that machine-learning approach to gatekeeping was addressed in December by YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, who announced that in 2018 it would increase the number of people working to oversee content to more than 10,000.\n\n\"Human reviewers remain essential to both removing content and training machine-learning systems because human judgment is critical to making contextualized decisions on content,\" Wojcicki said.\n\nBut just a month later, YouTube and its coterie of often millionaire stars were caught in an unflattering spotlight as Logan Paul blasted out a video to his fans of a dead body hanging from a tree in a Japanese forest known for attracting those intent on committing suicide. The public backlash was intense and Paul apologized, and YouTube later dropped Paul from its Google Preferred ad program.\n\nChild advocacy groups have not been swayed by YouTube's efforts to use algorithms, human curators and community whistleblowers to improve the policing of its content for minors.\n\n\"It’s not until something tragic is shown via a video, and viewers react, that the content is removed or dealt with by the platform,\" Jill Murphy, editor in chief of Common Sense Media, said after the Logan Paul video incident.\n\nNow Murphy's group and many others want the FTC — which recently launched an investigation into Facebook's role in the Cambridge Analytica consumer data scandal — to turn off the ad-dollar tap if YouTube doesn't stop targeting children with ads.\n\nSays Angela Campbell, attorney for two of the groups filing the complaint: \"The FTC needs to impose large civil penalties to show it is serious about protecting children's privacy online.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY tech writer Marco della Cava on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/allthemoms/2018/07/10/australia-fines-parents-not-vaccinating-kids/769183002/", "title": "Australia fines parents for not vaccinating kids", "text": "Australia's vaccination laws have been tough for the past two years, but this month they got more unforgiving.\n\nParents who fail to vaccinate their kids could be fined.\n\nAnti-vaxxer parents will be docked 28 Australian dollars ($20 USD) from their family tax benefits every two weeks, announced Dan Tehan, the country’s Minister for Social Services.\n\n\"Immunization is the safest way to protect children from vaccine-preventable diseases,\" Tehan said. \"Parents who don’t immunize their children are putting their own kids at risk as well as the children of other people.\"\n\n'A constant reminder' for parents\n\nBefore the new penalty was instituted, parents whose children were not vaccinated lost their Family Tax Benefit Part A end-of-the-year supplement, which was up to 737 Australian dollars or $545.\n\nTehan said the new measures under Australia's No Jab, No Pay policy provide a \"constant reminder for parents to keep their children’s immunization up to date.\"\n\nThe federal parliament passed the policy two years ago, and it eliminated a parent's right to \"conscientiously object\" to vaccination, except for children with certain medical issues or natural immunity.\n\nThe tougher vaccination laws were implemented in 2016 after Australian children under the age of 7 not vaccinated due to a “conscientious objection” grew from 0.23 percent in December 1999 to 1.77 percent in December 2014, the Independent reported.\n\nEven more penalties for parents\n\nParents could lose up to 15,000 Australian dollars in government benefits and welfare rebates, according to the New York Times.\n\nSome Australian states bar children who have not been vaccinated from child care centers, either permanently or during disease outbreaks.

The N95 masks were the most effective in blocking respiratory droplets – 99% to be exact. Second-best? Surgical masks.\n\nLeana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, said surgical masks are a great, more affordable option.\n\n\"We need to be wearing at least a three-ply surgical mask. You can wear a cloth mask on top of that, but do not just wear a cloth mask alone,\" Wen told CNN.\n\nOmicron surges in the US:US focuses on testing and booster shots as omicron variant sweeps across nation\n\nWhy aren't cloth face masks effective as omicron spikes?\n\nWhile cloth masks can filter large droplets, N95s can filter both large droplets and the smaller aerosols that may contain the airborne virus. N95s are also especially efficient, filtering out about 95% of airborne particles.\n\nInfectious disease expert Steven Gordon told Cleveland Clinic that all studies show omicron is the most easily transmissible coronavirus variant, and that's why health experts urge a change in masks. Gordon added that while cloth masks help prevent the exhale of particles, it doesn't do much to prevent inhaling particles, which is a problem with omicron.\n\nShould N95 masks still be reserved for health care staff?\n\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urges the public to save N95 masks for health care workers. However, it was only in the first several months of the pandemic when hospitals saw a shortage in N95 masks. Now it has \"been many months since the supply of N95s (has been) an issue,\" Wen said.\n\nShould you be wearing an N95 mask? What to know and where to buy them online\n\nDr. Sabrina Assoumou, an infectious disease physician at Boston Medical Center, is among experts who recommend upgraded masks: \"If you're in an indoor public setting, that's where we recommend that you wear a well-fitted, high-quality mask. With omicron and how transmissible it is, I feel that we should all be moving to wearing a higher-quality, better mask.\"\n\nWhat are the best face masks for children? Are there N95 masks for kids?\n\nSt. Jude Children's Research Hospital recommends children wear the white, duck-bill N95 masks because cloth masks \"do not provide the same level of protection and should not be used.\"\n\nThe white duck-bill N-95 mask comes in two sizes, small and regular, and is shaped outwardly like a duck's mouth. The design was created to offer more breathability.\n\nHow to spot fake N95 or KN95 masks\n\nThe first step is to turn to the CDC and analyze its charts of N95 and KN95 masks that the agency has tested, including the make, model number and filtration efficiency. Websites such as Fakespot help consumers weed out authentic products from counterfeits, including real and fake N95 masks.\n\nIf you're purchasing a mask from Amazon, be wary of reviews in which people say they received the mask free, because that could persuade them to leave a positive review, The New York Times cautions.

Within 30 days of his 18th birthday, every male citizen and legal resident is required to register for Selective Service, either by filling out a postcard-size form or going online.\n\nWhat's less well known is what happens on a man's 26th birthday.\n\nMen who fail to register for the draft by then can no longer do so – forever closing the door to government benefits like student aid, a government job or even U.S. citizenship.\n\nMen under 26 can get those benefits by taking advantage of what has effectively become an eight-year grace period, signing up for Selective Service on the spot.\n\nAfter that, an appeal can be costly and time-consuming. Selective Service statistics suggest that more than 1 million men have been denied some government benefit because they weren't registered for the draft.\n\nWith the current male-only draft requirement declared unconstitutional, Congress will have to decide whether to eliminate Selective Service registration or expand it to women.\n\nHistoric ruling:With women in combat roles, a federal court declares male-only draft unconstitutional\n\nUnable to decide that question for decades, Congress created the National Commission on Military, National and Public Service in 2016. It's studying the future of the draft with a report due next year.\n\nAmong the issues it's examining: Should draft registration be mandatory? If so, what's fairest way to enforce it? Should the same consequences that have followed men for nearly four decades also apply to women?\n\n\"We're taking a look at all of these questions,\" says Vice Chairwoman Debra Wada, a former assistant secretary of the Army. \"And that means looking at whether the current system is both fair and equitable – but also transparent.\"\n\nMen who have been caught in the over-26 trap say the system is anything but.\n\nSince 1993, more than 1 million American men have requested a formal copy of their draft status from the Selective Service System, according to data obtained by USA TODAY under the Freedom of Information Act. Those status-information letters are the first step in trying to appeal the denial of benefits, and are the best indication of how many men have been impacted by legal consequences of failing to register.\n\nMore:Should women be required to register for the military draft?\n\nOn paper, it's a crime to \"knowingly fail or neglect or refuse\" to register for the draft. The penalty is up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\nLast year, Selective Service referred 112,051 names and addresses of suspected violators to the Justice Department for possible prosecution.\n\nStill, only 20 men have been criminally charged with refusing to register for the draft since President Jimmy Carter reinstated it in 1980 in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Only 14 were convicted. The last indictment, in 1986, was dismissed before it went to trial.\n\nSo now the system relies largely on voluntary compliance, a patchwork of state laws, and the risk of losing federal benefits.\n\nCongress passed two provisions to tighten enforcement in the 1980s. The Solomon amendment in 1982 made Selective Service registration a requirement for federal student aid. The Thurmond Amendment in 1985 did the same for federal employment.\n\nFederal student aid is the most common problem for men who haven't registered for the draft, according Selective Service data obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nForty states and the District of Columbia link Selective Service to a driver's license. But some of those allow men to opt out of registration, and about a quarter of Americans in their early 20s don't have a driver's license.\n\nThirty-one states have legislation mirroring federal laws on student aid and employment, applying those bans to state-funded student aid programs and state employment.\n\nSome states go even further:\n\n► In eight states, men are not allowed men to register at a state college or university – even without financial aid – if they aren't registered for Selective Service. Those states are Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Louisiana, New Hampshire, South Dakota and Tennessee.\n\n► In Ohio, men who live in the state but don't register for Selective Service must pay out-of-state tuition rates.\n\n► In Alaska, men who fail to register for the draft can't receive an annual dividend from the Alaska Permanent Fund, which gave Alaska residents $1,600 from state oil revenue in 2018.\n\nAs a result, registration rates vary from 100 percent in New Hampshire to 63 percent in North Dakota – and just 51 percent in the District of Columbia, according to Selective Service data.\n\n\"It's very uneven across the country,\" said Shawn Skelly, a former Navy commander and member of the 11-member commission studying the draft.\n\n\"How people register is predominately passively. Most men who register, register though secondary means when they apply for student aid or get a driver's license. There isn't a real deliberate education of people about the law.\"\n\nLike the Vietnam War draft that helped fuel the social upheaval of the 1960s and '70s, today's draft registration requirement puts a disproportionate burden on lower-class Americans. They're more likely to put off college until later in life – and to need student aid when they do go to school.\n\nIn comments to the national service commission, critics of the policy called that policy \"exceptionally cruel.\"\n\n'It was an honest mistake'\n\nDepending on how you look at it, Brandon Prudhomme either had a very good or very bad reason for failing to register for the draft: He was in prison for most of the time between the ages of 18 and 25.\n\nHis arrest record includes assault, drug possession and resisting arrest.\n\n\"It was an honest mistake,\" he said. \"I was on my own since I was 14 years old. I got involved in gang-type stuff.\"\n\nBut now he's 39 and trying to turn his life around. While living in a homeless shelter, he started his own landscaping company \"with two rakes and four lawn bags,\" he said.\n\nHe'd like to go back to school for business. But since Prudhomme didn't register for Selective Service, he can't get student loans. \"The financial aid people called me and said, 'Sir, do yo know anything about Selective Service?' I said no. They said my application had been red-flagged,\" he said.\n\n\"If it was mandatory, how was there not the opportunity for me to sign those papers?\" Prudhomme asked. \"He said that was my responsibility.\"\n\nThe law has also snagged federal information technology workers, Forest Service firefighters, Veterans Administration doctors and even federal contractors.\n\nRichard Henry, a contractor for the Internal Revenue Service, lost his access to IRS facilities because he failed to register for Selective Service. They found out because Henry told them, repeatedly, beginning in 2001. But in 2011, the IRS changed the rules to make Selective Service a requirement. He was over 26, so he couldn't register.\n\nSo he sued, and lost in 2017.\n\n\"If they're going to enforce this law, you should know about the law and you should know about the consequences,\" said Henry's lawyer, Rachel L.T. Rodriguez. \"The problem here is, you don't know the consequences that follow you forever like this.\"\n\nBut officials say that for draft registration to work, the law has to have teeth.\n\n\"If there were no penalties for failing to register, the rates would plummet, and fairness and equity would go out the window,\" said Matthew Tittman, a spokesman for the Selective Service System, a civilian agency that administers draft registration.\n\nMen who are over 26 and denied benefits can appeal the decision if they can prove that their failure to register was not \"knowing and willful.\"\n\nIt's unclear how many men succeed. The Office of Personnel Management says it got 160 requests for waivers in the last fiscal year. The Department of Education would not release data or discuss its process on the record.\n\nAnd proving that someone didn't intentionally evade the draft can be costly and time consuming, taking as long as 18 months to decide.\n\nMarc J. Smith, a Rockville, Maryland, federal employment lawyer who handles such cases, says the process can cost $3,500 to $4,000 in legal fees.\n\nAn appeal can involve researching when and where the Selective Service sent reminder letters, and gathering sworn statements from parents, childhood friends and school officials.\n\nThe cases rarely make it to court. The Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the courts didn't have jurisdiction over federal employment cases because there was an administrative process to handle those claims.\n\nEven if Congress eliminates the draft, Smith said, it's unclear whether those old penalties will go away.\n\n\"People will still have this issue,\" he said. \"And I guess that means a much larger pool of potential clients for me.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/17/tech/meta-facebook-regulation/index.html", "title": "Here's how US lawmakers could finally rein in Facebook - CNN", "text": "\"We are serious about taking action.\"\n\n\"Here's my message for Mark Zuckerberg: Your time of invading our privacy, promoting toxic content, and preying on children and teens is over. Congress will be taking action.\"\n\nFacebook, now known as, has faced scrutiny on Capitol Hill for years, with executives — including Zuckerberg — repeatedly grilled in Congressional hearings. But if these and other comments from lawmakers during hearings in recent months are any indication, 2022 could shape up to be a make-or-break year in the long-running effort to regulate Facebook.\n\nCongress is currently considering around a dozen proposed bills targeting Big Tech, some of which could force Meta to change how it handles algorithmic recommendations and collecting user data, as well as its ability to make acquisitions. A bipartisan group of 10 state attorneys general launched an investigation late last year into Meta, focused on the potential harms of its Instagram platform on young users.\n\nAnd last week, a federal judge said the Federal Trade Commission could move forward with a lawsuit seeking to break up Meta, after the company had argued the complaint should be dismissed. (The case could drag on for years.) The FTC and several state attorneys general are also reportedly investigating Meta's Oculus virtual reality unit over antitrust concerns, according to a Bloomberg report Friday citing people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nSome industry watchers have pointed to recently appointed federal officials such as FTC Chair Lina Khan , a vocal tech industry critic, and the sharper focus of lawmakers as cause for optimism that something may happen on the regulatory front.\n\n\"You're seeing a lot less of the politicized commentary and a lot more focus and coordination on these issues, the underlying technology behind them and the business model,\" said Katie Paul, director at the tech advocacy group Tech Transparency Project. \"It's clear that a lot of these members of Congress have done their homework and they understand what they're looking at.\"\n\nStill, after years of talk and glimmers of progress, it remains unclear if or when US lawmakers and regulators might take successful action — as their EU and UK counterparts have — that would limit Meta's power, as well as that of Big Tech more broadly. And the window of opportunity may be limited as preparations for the US midterm elections could divert attention from advancing new legislation.\n\nRecent revelations from former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen and the hundreds of internal documents she leaked have galvanized bipartisan support for new legislation related to protecting children online. But the likelihood of success for the many other Meta-related proposals is murkier, and not just because of the company's immense lobbying power.\n\nDespite their agreement that something should be done to address Big Tech's dominance -— and to crack down on Meta in particular — Democrats and Republicans are divided on what the core problem really is. Republicans accuse Facebook of anti-conservative bias, despite a lack of evidence, while Democrats are concerned that the company doesn't do enough to protect against hate speech, misinformation and other problematic content.\n\nThe stakes for action, or inaction, are only growing. The \" Facebook Papers \" revealed a wide range of potential real-world harms and consequences from Meta's platforms. Yet, lawmakers are largely still playing catch up in understanding and regulating the company's older platforms, even as Meta pushes to transition into a \"metaverse company\" and perhaps shape a whole new generation of user experiences.\n\n\"Congress must seize this historic moment — a pivotal turning point for reining in Big Tech,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat who chairs the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, told CNN Business. \"Having seen Big Tech's harms and abuses, in our hearings and their own lives, Americans are ready for action — and results.\"\n\nHere are a few of the approaches lawmakers could take.\n\nSection 230\n\nOne of the first places lawmakers and experts often look when considering new rules for tech companies like Meta is a piece of federal legislation called Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act\n\nThe 25-year-old law prevents tech companies from being held liable for the content that users post on their platforms. For years, big tech companies have leaned on the law to avoid being held responsible for some of the most controversial content on their platforms, using it to dismiss lawsuits over messages, videos and other content created by users.\n\nMomentum has grown on Capitol Hill around the idea of scrapping or updating Section 230, which could expose tech platforms to more lawsuits over hate speech and misinformation. Proposed changes include making platforms liable for hosting child abuse content. President Biden has also suggested platforms should be held responsible for hosting misinformation related to vaccines. (Social media companies and industry organizations have lobbied hard against changes to Section 230.)\n\nBut there's one big hurdle to this approach, experts say: the First Amendment. Even if lawmakers got rid of Section 230 and, for example, Meta faced lawsuits over misinformation on its platforms, that speech is protected by the First Amendment. That means the company would probably still win out in the end, according to Jeff Kosseff, cybersecurity law professor at the US Naval Academy and author of a book about Section 230 called \"The Twenty-Six Words that Created the Internet.\"\n\n\"Where Section 230 really makes a difference is in things like defamation lawsuits,\" Kosseff said. \"But that's not really what's driving the debate around Facebook and other social media sites — it's more of this lawful but awful types of content.\"\n\nKosseff also raised the concern that trying to hold tech platforms responsible for certain types of speech — such as health misinformation — could give the government significant leeway in determining what content falls into those categories.\n\n\"There have been some countries that have passed fake news laws, and they've misused them just as you would expect that you would,\" he said.\n\nAlgorithms\n\nHaugen, meanwhile, has encouraged reforming Section 230 to hold platforms accountable for how their algorithms promote content. In that scenario, Meta and other tech companies still would not be responsible for user-generated content, but could be held liable for the way their algorithms promote and cause that content to go viral.\n\nBipartisan legislation introduced in the House in November would take a slightly different tack by forcing large tech companies to allow users to access a version of their platforms where what they see isn't shaped by algorithms at all.\n\nPerhaps anticipating such a law, Meta-owned Instagram has said it will bring back the option for users to access a reverse chronological version of their feed (one not manipulated by its algorithm) later this year. Facebook already offers this option but it can be frustrating to use — rather than being an option in settings, where users might expect, it's toggled using a button in a long menu on the left side of the NewsFeed screen, and it resets every time you close the site.\n\nPrivacy\n\nLawmakers have also used recent hearings about Meta to rail for updated privacy laws.\n\n\"We have not done anything to update our privacy laws in this country, our federal privacy laws. Nothing. Zilch,\" Minnesota Democrat Sen. Amy Klobuchar said during Haugen's hearing.\n\nCurrently, progress on this front is coming more at the state level than the federal level.\n\nCalifornia's Consumer Privacy Act , which went into effect last year, gives consumers the right to demand that large companies disclose what data they have collected on them. Under the law, consumers can also ask companies to delete their data and, in some cases, sue companies for data breaches. Meanwhile, Virginia's Consumer Data Protection Act (set to take effect in 2023) also gives consumers more control of their online data, but it includes more exceptions than the California law and doesn't give consumers the option to sue companies. A federal bill could help provide consistent, nationwide standards for how data can be collected and sold online.\n\nCongress is considering the KIDS Act, which aims to protect internet users under 16 in various ways, including by prohibiting the use of age verification data for commercial purposes, as well as the SAFE DATA Act, which would give consumers more choice in how their data is collected and used.\n\nA new tech regulatory body\n\nIn his testimony before a Senate subcommittee earlier this month, Instagram head Adam Mosseri proposed the creation of an industry body that would set standards for \"how to verify age, how to build age-appropriate experiences, how to build parental controls,\" and other social media best practices.\n\nBut lawmakers didn't seem enthusiastic about the idea of leaving standards-setting and oversight to industry players. \"Self-policing depends on trust and the trust is gone,\" Blumenthal said during Mosseri's hearing.\n\nInstead, lawmakers and advocates are pushing for the creation of a new federal regulatory body responsible for overseeing Big Tech. The group could be tasked with developing the framework and structures needed to regulate the tech industry, similar to the mechanisms within the government that help oversee the banking industry, TTP's Paul said. It could also, as Haugen testified , serve as \"a regulatory home where someone like me could do a tour of duty.\"\n\nSuch a group would help supplement the limited existing accountability structures surrounding Meta. The Facebook Oversight Board — which says it acts independently, although its members are appointed and paid by the company — is only responsible for weighing in on content moderation decisions. Even then, the group has recently focused on smaller, one-off flubs, rather than the many broader, structural problems the company faces (although it has made larger calls for transparency).\n\nThe role of the FTC\n\nIf Congress does pass any Big Tech laws, the FTC will play a key role in enforcing them. And even if we don't see new legislation in the next year, Meta won't necessarily be off the hook.\n\nThe judge's Tuesday ruling in the FTC case opens the door to perhaps the most existential threat yet to Meta: the FTC is looking to unwind Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. (Meta previously said it was confident \"the evidence will reveal the fundamental weakness of the [FTC's] claims.\")\n\nThe case will give Khan, the FTC chair, a chance to make her mark in her first turn as a federal regulator — and there is some reason to believe Meta is nervous. Last July, company officials wrote to the FTC asking Khan to recuse herself from all matters related to the social media giant (she has not done so). Meta also argued that the FTC's suit should be dismissed on the grounds that Khan should not have been able to vote to approve the updated complaint; however, the judge sided with the FTC.\n\nIn addition to the agency's lawsuit, Khan said last month that the FTC is considering drafting new rules that would more strongly regulate how US businesses can use data and algorithms. The effort could lead to \"market-wide requirements\" targeting \"harms that can result from commercial surveillance and other data practices,\" Khan said in a letter to Blumenthal. That could deal another potential blow to Meta's business model.\n\nAnd Friday's report that the FTC is also working with state attorneys general to investigate potential anticompetitive practices by Meta's Oculus — a key unit in its plans for the metaverse — indicate that its future ambitions are risk of regulatory crackdown, too.\n\n--CNN's Brian Fung contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/16/tech/instagram-parent-controls/index.html", "title": "Instagram is rolling out new parental supervision tools - CNN", "text": "(CNN Business) Instagram is rolling out new tools that parents can use to help monitor and limit their kids' usage of the photo-sharing app, months after disclosures from a Facebook whistleblower raised concerns about the platform's impact on younger users.\n\nThe tools, released Wednesday, offer parents the ability to see how much time their kids spend on Instagram and to set limits on their use as well as visibility into the accounts they follow or are followed by.

It was less effective, but because it requires only a single shot for full protection and is easier to distribute, it was a top choice for many people.\n\nSince then, the J&J vaccine has been given far less often than the other two authorized vaccines, accounting for one-tenth as many shots as Moderna's vaccine, which is given less often than Pfizer-BioNTech's.\n\nRecently, three pieces of information have come to light making people who got the J&J vaccine wonder whether their shot might be a distant third in other ways, too.\n\nStudies suggest the J&J vaccine may provide somewhat less protection, particularly against the delta variant, which now accounts for more than 80% of COVID-19 cases across the United States. The J&J vaccine has been associated with very rare cases of dangerous blood clots in the brain. And it may be linked to about 100 cases of a neurological condition called Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n\n\"Johnson & Johnson is not a bad vaccine – it’s way better than getting nothing,\" said Dr. Otto Yang, an infectious disease specialist at UCLA Health. \"But it’s not as good as other options.\"\n\nAll things considered, it's a lucky position to be in.\n\nThe J&J vaccine looks second-class only because the other two vaccines are so good, experts say.\n\nJ&J's pivotal large-scale trial showed it was effective against COVID-19, preventing more than 70% of symptomatic infections and about 86% of serious ones. New data the company presented Thursday to a federal advisory committee shows the protection lasts against all variants now circulating for at least eight months.\n\nPfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which are based on a technology called mRNA, showed even higher efficacy in their trials, preventing more than 94% of symptomatic cases and nearly all cases of severe COVID-19.\n\nIn a meeting Thursday, members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices agreed that all three vaccines' benefits vastly outweigh their risks. The J&J shot, though it has more potential for serious side effects and may be less effective than the others, should continue to be an option for people who would rather have a single-dose vaccine and are aware of those risks, several committee members said.\n\n\"We want to maximize our ability to prevent as much disease as we can, while at the same time maximizing the safety of these vaccines,\" Dr. Matthew Daley, a senior investigator at Kaiser Permanente Colorado in Aurora, said at the meeting.\n\nAll the COVID-19 vaccines carry a small risk of an allergic reaction – two to five people per million – and the mRNA vaccines bring a slight risk of myocarditis, a swelling of the heart, particularly in younger men and adolescents, though most of those cases have been mild.\n\nIn the real world, all three shots have proven extremely effective. Only 3% of those hospitalized in the United States with COVID-19 have been vaccinated; 97% have not, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nDoes the J&J vaccine result in more breakthrough infections?\n\nIt's not clear, however, whether any of the vaccines account for more breakthrough cases than the others, said Dr. Paul Offit. who directs the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nOffit said he's more concerned about the CDC not producing or releasing that information than he is about the J&J vaccine itself. \"The CDC should know that,\" he said.\n\nWithout that information, people who got the J&J vaccine are left wondering whether they are safe.\n\nBreakthrough infections:Those fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can be infected, but serious illness is rare: 'Nothing in this world is 100%'\n\n\"I’m wanting to do more things besides all of my outdoor activities but I'm too scared!\" said Jill Oliver, a J&J recipient from Boulder, Colorado.\n\nEveryone else in her family received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine and feels safe, but because Oliver worries she is less protected, she has continued to wear a mask, even at home.\n\n\"Comparing vaccines is tricky,\" Hannah Sally, senior epidemiologist with Informa Pharma Intelligence, a business information provider, said via email. Trials are conducted at different times when different variants predominate.\n\nAccording to the CDC, nearly 340 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered across the country since December: 187 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTecn, 137 million doses of Moderna and 13 million doses of J&J.\n\nDoes the J&J vaccine bring more side effects and less variant protection?\n\nSeveral side effects have turned up with the J&J vaccine that don't seem to occur with the other two.\n\nAs of July 19, there have been 39 reports of people getting a rare blood clotting condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS, most of them within one to two weeks of receiving the J&J vaccine. The condition involves serious blood clots, often in the brain, as well as low levels of platelets, which help blood to clot and can lead to internal bleeding. Most of the cases have been in women in their 30s and 40s.\n\nAlso, about 100 people, most of them men over 50, have been diagnosed with Guillain-Barré Syndrome within 42 days after receiving the J&J shot, although a cause-effect relationship has not been proven. Guillain-Barré also has occurred after other vaccines and – at higher rates – in connection with viral infections such as COVID-19. With the condition, the immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. Most people fully recover, though cases can be fatal.\n\nAlthough J&J studies show their vaccine offers continued protection against most of the known variants, a study posted online this week but not yet peer-reviewed suggested it was less effective against the delta variant. Researchers from New York University, who declined to be interviewed, found that blood samples from people who had received the J&J vaccine were less able to neutralize the delta variant than blood from people who received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna shots.\n\nThis form of lab testing offers hints of protection but is not as reliable as showing whether the vaccine works in people, experts said.\n\nPlus, although there are fewer antibodies with the J&J vaccine than the others, it's not clear how many is enough to keep people safe from infection, said Dr. Timothy Brewer, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nIn the real world, \"as far as I know, J&J still affords protection from serious disease,\" said Theodora Hatziioannou, a virologist who was not involved in the study but does similar research at The Rockefeller University in New York. \"As it stands, the vast majority of hospital admissions due to COVID-19 are due to infections in the unvaccinated population. So (the J&J vaccine) is still worth taking.\"\n\nPerhaps, she said, the difference in performance is due to the different numbers of shots required.\n\nTwo doses are necessary to be fully vaccinated with either Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech. Research has shown that a single dose of either is not very protective against variants, such as delta.\n\nSo far, only one dose of the J&J shot has been recommended, though the company is studying a two-dose regimen as well.\n\n\"It is possible that this difference in performance is due to the fact that it is a single shot and that a booster will improve it,\" Hatziioannou said.\n\nShould people who got the J&J shot get a booster?\n\nAli Ellebedy, an immunologist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said that if he had gotten the J&J vaccine, he would want a second shot.\n\n\"I would get booster immunization if I had had received only one dose of J&J, preferably one of the RNA vaccines,\" he said. \"That booster might not be absolutely needed to protect me from severe disease but basically an extra insurance.\"\n\nOthers are warier of the J&J shots.\n\nDr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and former Baltimore health commissioner, said she has encouraged a few of her high-risk patients to follow up their J&J shot with a single dose of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna.\n\nBut there is no research to confirm that mixing shots is safe, Wen said. In some people, the risk of serious infection may outweigh any risk of mixing vaccines, she said.\n\nIn those who are younger and healthier, Wen recommends measures like social distancing and mask-wearing. She got the J&J vaccine herself and now avoids crowds and wears a mask in public indoor spaces.\n\nSome believe boosters aren't advisable at all until there's more data.\n\nData published in Europe suggest that side effects such as fever, sore arm and fatigue are higher when people mix vaccines. \"There’s no data to say that it would be better to do a booster with an mRNA vaccine,\" UCLA's Brewer said.\n\nThe U.S. government does not recommend booster shots for anyone at the moment.\n\nOffit said he wouldn't suggest a booster yet for J&J recipients because of a lack of information about safety and need. \"I'd like to see those data,\" he said.\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com and Elizabeth Weise at eweise@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Those numbers do not include flights on their regional affiliates, which operate as American Eagle and Delta Connection.\n\n\"The vast majority of that is weather-related,\" said Curtis Blessing, spokesman for American Airlines. He noted that weather in the Miami area was also contributing to delays for the carrier on Friday morning.\n\nAirlines kicked off the busy summer travel season by canceling about 2,800 flights in a five-day stretch around the Memorial Day holiday weekend, marking the start of what's likely to be a tough summer for the nation's air passengers.\n\nThursday and Friday's issues come in the wake of a virtual meeting between airline CEOs and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg – a sign of the Biden administration's concern about the prospect of snarled airports and unhappy travelers this summer.\n\n“I let them know that this is a moment when we are really counting on them to deliver reliably for the traveling public,” Buttigieg told NBC News.\n\nIs travel insurance worth it?:What to know before you book your next trip\n\nWhat travelers need to know\n\nIf your flight is canceled, the U.S. Department of Transportation requires airlines to rebook you on their next available service with space. If that will not work for you, the carrier is required to offer you a refund, even if you bought a nonrefundable ticket.\n\nIn the event of a delay, an airline's responsibility is a little less clear. DOT does require compensation for \"significant delays\" but has no official definition for what counts as \"significant.\"\n\nMany airlines updated their policies during the pandemic to give travelers more flexibility in rebooking or altering plans. Delta, for example, automatically rebooks passengers whose flights were canceled and sends them their new itineraries via email, text and the Fly Delta App. Customers are free to change their rebooked flight online or via Delta's digital messaging platform if the new itinerary doesn't work.\n\nSo far, airlines are not issuing preemptive change fee waivers in response to Friday's cancellations, but affected passengers will still have options to rebook.\n\nArriving at the airport two hours early?:You might need 3, in some cases\n\nWhy this summer is tough for travel\n\nAs COVID-19 restrictions continue to loosen, more Americans are planning to venture away from home this summer, but airlines have struggled to keep up with with the surge.\n\n“I think every single part of the travel industry from the airlines to airport employees to security agents, they all just got caught flatfooted by this explosion in demand,\" said Kyle Potter, editor of the website Thrifty Traveler, which aims to familiarize people with the inner workings of the airline industry and find travel deals.\"It’s really easy to have 20/20 vision in hindsight and tell airlines and airports ‘You went way too far when travel collapsed in cutting back to the bone to stop losing money,'\" but earlier in the pandemic, no one really knew how long the slump would last.\n\nAround 50 Delta pilots protested in New York on Thursday, saying that by this fall they expect to have worked more overtime in 2022 than they did in 2018 and 2019 combined.\n\nAnd Delta is not alone in staffing woes. JetBlue recently announced a plan to cut 10% of its schedule this summer in response to expected shortages in its ranks.\n\nTravelers planning to fly this summer should make sure to check flight status with their airlines before heading to the airport and know their rights if something goes wrong.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2022/06/19/why-us-flights-canceled-delayed-sunday/7677552001/", "title": "Why are US flights delayed, canceled? Weather, staffing, demand ...", "text": "Travel issues continued piling up for fliers as flight delays and cancellations topped 10,000 — a tumultuous weekend for holiday travel blamed on staffing shortages, packed planes and the ripple effects from previous bad weather.\n\nOn Monday, more than 3,000 flights within, into, or out of the U.S. were delayed and about 370 flights canceled, as of 5 p.m. ET, according to FlightAware. TSA projected on Twitter that Monday could be Seattle-Tacoma International Airport's busiest day since the start of the pandemic.\n\n\"This has been another travel Armageddon weekend,\" James Ferrara, co-founder and president of global host travel agency InteleTravel, told USA TODAY. \"But it's not isolated, or really a surprise.\"\n\nFriday was the busiest day for air travel this year with over 2.4 million people passing through security at U.S. airports, according to the Transportation Security Administration. On Saturday, there were 2.1 million travelers.\n\nThe U.S. has dominated global flight issues, but it isn't the only country having airline issues; worldwide, an additional 3,500 flights have been canceled and over 23,000 have been delayed this weekend.\n\nCurrently, passenger volumes nationwide for this month are 87.7% of 2019 volumes, according to TSA spokesperson Lorie Dankers. The average number of people screened per day is 2.24 million compared to 2.56 million in June 2019.\n\n\"This is the highest sustained level we have seen since travel began to recover from the pandemic,\" Dankers told USA TODAY on Monday.\n\nNationwide, Delta and United have the highest number of cancellations, with 7% and 3% of flights canceled, respectively, not including flights on their regional affiliates. Airports that are seeing the most issues include Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in the New York City area.\n\nSATURDAY: US flight cancellations, delays continue Saturday: More than 4,000 flights affected so far\n\nFRIDAY AND THURSDAY: 6,000+ US flights canceled or delayed Friday after one of worst summer air travel days yet\n\nWhy are flights being canceled and delayed?\n\nThere are several factors contributing to the ongoing situation at the nation's airports, notably the severe storms that hit much of the country the past week, the increased number of travelers during the Father's Day and Juneteenth weekend and staff shortages.\n\n\"A variety of factors continue to impact our operations, including challenges with air traffic control, weather and unscheduled absences in some work groups. Canceling a flight is always our last resort, and we sincerely apologize to our customers for the inconvenience to their travel plans,\" Delta spokesperson Emily Cashdan said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nFerrara said the loss of skilled positions, such as pilots and aircrew, is \"really what's driving\" all of the airline issues. Pilot unions at Delta, American and Southwest have said airlines haven't been quick enough to replace pilots who retired or took leaves of absences when the pandemic began.\n\n\"We're in a boom time for travel. We're blowing away all records all previous years. So you've got this surge in demand, and you've got limitations on staffing,\" Ferrara said.\n\nOn Thursday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg met with airline CEOs virtually to discuss how airlines can effectively handle the growing number of travelers through the summer. The meeting came weeks after airlines struggled with the Memorial Day holiday weekend, when around 2,800 flights were canceled during the five-day stretch.\n\n\"That is happening to a lot of people, and that is exactly why we are paying close attention here to what can be done and how to make sure that the airlines are delivering,\" Buttigieg told The Associated Press on Saturday, one day after his own flight from Washington, D.C. to New York City was canceled.\n\nHow long will flight cancellations and delays continue to happen?\n\n\"I'm not a betting man. But I would absolutely bet that this will continue through the summer,\" Ferrara said.\n\nJosh Verde, former pilot and aviation expert with airline consultation group Aerovise, said he wouldn't be surprised if travel woes continue throughout the rest of the year. Summer is expected to be the busiest time of the year, but holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas might bring similar issues for travelers.\n\n\"I think we're probably going to be dealing with headaches for the rest of this year. Hopefully, they'll get a handle on things,\" Verde said.\n\nWhat should travelers do?\n\nIf your flight is canceled, the U.S. Department of Transportation requires airlines rebook you on the next available flight with space. You are not obligated to accept it, and if so, the airline is required to give a refund, which can be given as your money back, travel credit or voucher.\n\nIf your flight is delayed, the length of the delay matters. The DOT says passengers are eligible for a refund regardless of cause as long as it is a \"significant delay.\" However, the definition of a \"significant delay\" depends on the airline.\n\n\"Learning that your flight is canceled, kind of unexpectedly, really just causes chaos,\" Verde said.\n\nVerde recommends travelers try to keep a flexible schedule so if flight plans change, vacation plans and other scheduled activities aren't heavily affected. He also advises people bring essential items, like water, medication and toiletries, in their carry-on bag, so they are available at any moment if people are unavailable to get to their checked bag.\n\nContributing: Zach Wichter, USA TODAY; The Associated Press\n\nFollow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter: @jordan_mendoza5.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/09/us/five-things-september-9-trnd/index.html/", "title": "5 things to know for Sept. 9: The Queen, Weather, Immigration, Mar ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Her death marks the end of an era for the United Kingdom, with most Brits having known no other monarch in their lifetimes. The Queen’s oldest son Charles – now King Charles III – has ascended to the throne and is expected to address the nation today. The coming hours and days will see a series of carefully choreographed events to honor the Queen’s life and guide the transition ahead, but her passing leaves a void for the UK at a time of steep change in political leadership and a looming economic recession.\n\n2. Extreme weather\n\nTwo tropical storms are moving toward the East and West Coasts of the US today, with each packing forceful winds that could create a slew of different challenges for millions of people. In California, residents are bracing for Tropical Storm Kay, which could bring a year’s worth of rain in the coming hours. This has triggered flood concerns in parts of southern California, where damaging winds are already threatening to extend a brutal heat wave that’s fueled raging wildfires. Kay is weakening, but the storm is not expected to turn away from the West Coast until Saturday night. On the East Coast, dangerous rip currents are expected at beaches this weekend as Hurricane Earl churns in the Atlantic near Bermuda. Forecasts from the National Hurricane Center show Earl has already whipped up sustained winds close to 90 mph with even higher gusts.\n\n3. Immigration\n\nThe mayor of Washington, DC, declared a public health emergency on Thursday in response to the thousands of migrants arriving in the nation’s capital by bus from Texas and Arizona. Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott started busing migrants to Washington in April to protest the Biden administration’s immigration policies. Abbott and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, another Republican, so far have sent hundreds of buses to DC, and neither has expressed any intention of stopping. Texas has sent more than 7,900 migrants to DC and more than 2,200 migrants to New York City. Arizona, which is only sending buses to DC, has sent 1,677 migrants.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 03:11 - Source: CNN Why Democratic mayor is using Texas governor's controversial border strategy\n\n4. Mar-a-Lago\n\nThe Justice Department has appealed a court-ordered special master review of the materials seized by the FBI during its search of Mar-a-Lago. The DOJ has argued the order for a special master – or third party attorney – has put US national security at risk by halting access to the classified documents seized during the search of former President Donald Trump’s Florida residence. They also argue the order impedes them from conducting “an effective national security risk assessment,” the DOJ wrote in its appeal. Now, the judge ordered Trump’s lawyers to confer with the Justice Department and prepare a joint filing explaining their views on who should serve as the special master. The deadline for this court filing is later tonight.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 02:40 - Source: CNN Judge handling Mar a Lago case profiled\n\n5. Ukraine\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claims his country’s military retook a key city from Russia and has liberated at least 20 settlements in its ongoing counteroffensive. As the Ukrainian military continues to press on, officials say Russian forces in the Kharkiv region have suffered significant losses – leading some soldiers to desert and abandon their uniforms, hoping to blend in while wearing civilian clothing. Separately, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made an unannounced trip to Ukraine Thursday. He said the effort to regain control of Russian-held areas of the country was “proving effective” and also announced the US intends to provide an additional $2.2 billion in investments to bolster the security of Ukraine and other countries in the region.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 02:31 - Source: CNN CNN military analyst says what happens in Ukraine over the next few weeks could define the next few years.

Biden\n\nPresident Joe Biden delivered his sharpest rebuke yet of Republicans during a speech in Philadelphia on Thursday, warning that former President Donald Trump and his closest followers are trying to undermine American democracy . \"As I stand here tonight, equality and democracy are under assault,\" Biden said in his address -- just months ahead of midterm elections that will determine control of Congress. Biden attempted to separate Trump's most loyal MAGA followers from the Republican Party as a whole and also sought to conclude on a more upbeat note, urging it is still within voters' power to rein in Trump's staunchest supporters. This comes as Biden's recent aggressive rhetoric has drawn the ire of Republicans, particularly after he accused Trump loyalists of \" semi-fascism \" at a fundraiser last week.\n\n2. Hurricanes\n\nFor the first time in 25 years, the month of August did not have a named storm. But now that September has arrived, things appear to have changed quickly in the tropical Atlantic. On Thursday, the National Hurricane Center announced that Tropical Storm Danielle, currently in the North Atlantic, is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday . Danielle is not a threat to any land at this time, forecasts show, and it is expected to remain fairly stationary through the weekend. Still, current indications show the early stages of the Atlantic hurricane season have been above average and could begin to pick up.\n\n3. January 6\n\nFormer President Trump said he will \"very, very seriously\" consider full pardons for the rioters who breached the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, if he runs for reelection and wins. \"If I decide to run and if I win, I will be looking very, very strongly about pardons. Full pardons,\" Trump said on Wendy Bell Radio Thursday. Trump had made a similar promise during his final days in office when some of the January 6 rioters were already in jail. None, however, were pardoned before he left office. Trump's comments come amid intense speculation about a potential 2024 presidential run, and his continued invocation of the Capitol attack could preview a central part of his future political messaging.\n\nJUST WATCHED Some January 6 rioters cashing in on insurrection merchandise Replay More Videos ...

Gavin Newsom, who has been supportive of abortion rights, for his signature. Meanwhile, nearly one-third of all US states have banned or severely restricted abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. At least seven states, including Alabama, Kentucky and Missouri, have banned abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest. Health care providers and abortion activists have continued to file legal challenges to stop bans in several states from being enacted.\n\n5.

The plant and the area around it, including the adjacent city of Enerhodar, have endured persistent shelling that has raised fears of a meltdown through the interruption of the power supply to the facility. Each side accuses the other of acts of nuclear terrorism.

Welcome to the summer of travel hell.\n\nAirlines had said they were prepared to avoid the service problems that plagued much of the industry last year. But between Friday and Monday, US airlines canceled 2,653 flights, or nearly 3% of their collective schedules, according to tracking service FlightAware. That's more than they had canceled for the same holiday weekend the previous three years combined.\n\nIn 2019, the year before the pandemic, US airlines canceled just 1.2% of their scheduled flights, despite having 6,600 more flights on the schedule.\n\nExperts said passengers are right to be nervous that they'll see more of the same for the rest of the summer\n\n\"This does not bode well for the summer travel season as we expect a repeat through the summer months as more people fly,\" Helane Becker, airline analyst with Cowen, said in a note to clients Tuesday. \"This was a chance for airlines to show that last summer's delays would not be repeated this summer, and yet, it was not to be.\"\n\nThe airlines have significantly fewer employees, especially pilots, than they did before the pandemic. They received $54 billion in taxpayer assistance during the height of the health crisis to prevent involuntary layoffs, but most airlines offered buyouts and early retirement packages to trim staff and save cash while air traffic ground to a near halt. But it takes years to get certification for pilots and some other airline employees.\n\nSo airlines are operating with little room for error when they're hit with bad weather, air traffic control problems or employees calling out sick, which is what they said happened this weekend.\n\n\"More than any time in our history, the various factors currently impacting our operation — weather and air traffic control, vendor staffing, increased Covid case rates contributing to higher-than-planned unscheduled absences in some work groups — are resulting in an operation that isn't consistently up to the standards Delta has set for the industry in recent years,\" said Delta Chief Customer Experience Officer Allison Ausband in an online post.\n\nBut airline critics say management should not have been caught by surprise: They knew they didn't have the margin for error they needed. After service problems throughout 2021, including during the end-of-year holidays , airlines should have anticipated these issues, said Capt. Dennis Tajer, spokesperson for the Allied Pilots Association, the pilots union at American Airlines.\n\n\"When you stress test the airline operation model, that's when you see the same results,\" said Tajer. With flights already booked to capacity, \"one flight being canceled doesn't just cause a cascading effect, it causes a tidal wave of problems. It's déjà vu all over again,\" Tajer added.\n\nWith planes as full as they've ever been, it can take more time for airlines to find passengers booked on canceled flights another seat to get to their destination, Tajer said. Call centers are also short staffed and overwhelmed by demand, especially when things go wrong as they did this weekend.\n\n\"You can wait for more hours on the phone to rebook a flight than the time the flight will take you,\" he said.\n\nStaff shortages also mean higher fares\n\nThe staffing shortage means US airlines are still not able to offer all the flights needed to meet demand. The capacity of domestic US flights in June, July and August this year is 5% below where it was in those months in 2019, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm.\n\nBut passengers, especially vacationers, are eager to travel again this summer. Numerous airlines reported record numbers of customers booking flights earlier for the summer this year.\n\n\"There's a mismatch of supply and demand,\" said Scott Keyes, founder of Scott's Cheap Flight, a travel booking site. \"Your hopes of getting cheap flights for the summer are slim to none.\"\n\nThat combination of record demand and limited supply of seats means much higher fares. The Consumer Price Index, the government's reading of inflation, shows fares in April were \\up 33% from a year ago and up 10.6% from where they stood in April 2019.\n\nThe situation is probably worse for leisure travelers than those numbers suggest because business and international travel is not back to pre-pandemic levels. Since those passengers pay higher fares than more price-sensitive domestic travelers, going on vacation is a lot more pricey than it used to be.\n\nAnd it's not just airfares that are more expensive.\n\nA shortage of available vehicles pushed April rental car prices up 70% compared to April 2019. Hotels and other lodging was up 20% in April from a year ago and up 10.6% from where it stood in April 2019. All those price hikes are likely to accelerate even more during the busy summer travel months.\n\nAnd, of course, gasoline prices are at a record high, which could be pushing more travelers to fly rather than drive on some trips.\n\nExperts do believe the price pressures will start to retreat come fall — but not before then.\n\n\"The huge surge in demand, I think we'll probably exhaust that this summer,\" said Hayley Berg, lead economist at Hopper, another travel booking site. \"That and the normal slump in demand we see in September and October will probably mean lower fares.\"\n\nBut she said it's a good idea to book travel for the end-of-the-year holiday season if you already know your plans.

Her death marks the end of an era for the United Kingdom, with most Brits having known no other monarch in their lifetimes. The Queen’s oldest son Charles – now King Charles III – has ascended to the throne and is expected to address the nation today. The coming hours and days will see a series of carefully choreographed events to honor the Queen’s life and guide the transition ahead, but her passing leaves a void for the UK at a time of steep change in political leadership and a looming economic recession.\n\n2. Extreme weather\n\nTwo tropical storms are moving toward the East and West Coasts of the US today, with each packing forceful winds that could create a slew of different challenges for millions of people. In California, residents are bracing for Tropical Storm Kay, which could bring a year’s worth of rain in the coming hours. This has triggered flood concerns in parts of southern California, where damaging winds are already threatening to extend a brutal heat wave that’s fueled raging wildfires. Kay is weakening, but the storm is not expected to turn away from the West Coast until Saturday night. On the East Coast, dangerous rip currents are expected at beaches this weekend as Hurricane Earl churns in the Atlantic near Bermuda. Forecasts from the National Hurricane Center show Earl has already whipped up sustained winds close to 90 mph with even higher gusts.\n\n3. Immigration\n\nThe mayor of Washington, DC, declared a public health emergency on Thursday in response to the thousands of migrants arriving in the nation’s capital by bus from Texas and Arizona. Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott started busing migrants to Washington in April to protest the Biden administration’s immigration policies. Abbott and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, another Republican, so far have sent hundreds of buses to DC, and neither has expressed any intention of stopping. Texas has sent more than 7,900 migrants to DC and more than 2,200 migrants to New York City. Arizona, which is only sending buses to DC, has sent 1,677 migrants.\n\n4. Mar-a-Lago\n\nThe Justice Department has appealed a court-ordered special master review of the materials seized by the FBI during its search of Mar-a-Lago. The DOJ has argued the order for a special master – or third party attorney – has put US national security at risk by halting access to the classified documents seized during the search of former President Donald Trump’s Florida residence. They also argue the order impedes them from conducting “an effective national security risk assessment,” the DOJ wrote in its appeal. Now, the judge ordered Trump’s lawyers to confer with the Justice Department and prepare a joint filing explaining their views on who should serve as the special master.

California’s minimum will reach $15 for the first time on Jan. 1 for large employers. New York state – already at $15 in New York City and for fast-food workers statewide – will extend that benchmark to Long Island and Westchester County on New Year’s Eve.\n\nFour of the localities lifting their pay floors Jan. 1 will hit the $15 threshold for the first time: Denver, which is leaping from $14.77 to $15.87, and the California cities of San Diego, Oakland and West Hollywood.\n\nAn additional 27 cities and towns already at $15 will climb even higher in a couple of weeks, as California’s Mountain View and Sunnyvale both reach $17.10 and Seattle edges up to $17.27 for most employers.\n\nMinimum wage in Oakland\n\nIn Oakland, Evelia Domingo, 23, works full time at a local Jack in the Box, earning the city’s $14.36 hourly minimum. She lives in a two-bedroom apartment with her father and two sisters, splitting the $3,000 monthly household expenses with her father, a construction worker.\n\nAlthough they can pay the bills, Domingo says she has no money for discretionary spending such as dining out.\n\n“I would like to go out and take my family out but I can’t because I don’t have enough money for anything that isn’t household expenses,” she said through a translator. “I don’t like to go shopping because I see things I want but can’t afford.”\n\nOn New Year’s Day, Oakland’s base wage will rise to $15.06, netting Domingo an extra $112 a month. She plans to give the money to her father to cover the electric and water bills so he can send more cash to Domingo’s mother, who is ill and lives in Guatemala. The slightly larger paycheck also could help the family put away some money to eventually move to a bigger apartment.\n\n“I want to be able to help if I can,” she said.\n\nBut there will be no frills. Domingo says she would need an additional $5 an hour bump in pay to afford other things she’d like to do, such as saving up for a car, helping pay for her sister to attend college, going out and buying clothes. “Everything just feels impossible,” she said.\n\nYannet Lathrop, a researcher and policy analyst at NELP, says $15 provides just a living wage in much of the country.\n\n\"It's becoming the default minimum,\" she says\n\nThat may not be the case across the U.S. but it is in many higher-cost regions.\n\nWhere are $15 minimum wages?\n\nBesides California and New York, nine states are headed to a $15 pay base over the next four years – Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Virginia. They’ll join 50 localities at or on the way to $15, including Chicago, Minneapolis and Washington, D.C.\n\nAll told, by 2026, about 40% of the U.S. workforce will be covered by $15 minimum wage mandates, NELP figures show.\n\nSeparately, at least 100 or so mostly large companies already have raised their pay floors to $15 or higher, including Best Buy, Costco, Wayfair, The Container Store and Southwest Airlines, according to the NELP study.\n\nLathrop traces the $15 movement to Fight for $15, an alliance of fast-food and other low-paid workers that has staged walkouts across the country since 2012 and is backed by the Service Employees International Union.\n\n“This is the result of that organizing,” she said.\n\nPower shifts to workers\n\nThen there are the ripple effects of COVID-19.\n\nPandemic-related labor shortages have handed U.S. workers unprecedented leverage. Several million Americans remain on the sidelines because they can’t find or afford child care, they’re afraid of contracting COVID or they’re still living off enhanced unemployment benefits or government stimulus checks. And many older people retired early.\n\nEmployers, in turn, are sharply boosting pay to attract and hold onto workers amid a reopening economy and strong consumer demand. In October, there were 11 million job openings and 4.2 million people quit, typically to take other positions that pay more, Labor Department figures show. Both totals are near records.\n\nIn November, wages overall rose 3.7% from a year earlier, the most since 2009, and pay for the bottom quartile of employees jumped 5.1%, the biggest gain in nearly two decades, according to the Atlanta Fed’s wage growth tracker. Average hourly earnings for employees at restaurants and bars surged 12.1% in October, the most on record, to $17.66, according to the Labor Department.\n\nWorkers’ newfound bargaining power has emboldened many to play hardball. The nation has seen a rise in strikes this fall at companies such as John Deere, Kellogg and Kaiser Permanente, with many employees winning higher pay and benefits.\n\nThe worker-friendly landscape has lessened the impact of the minimum wage hikes since most employees’ earnings already are close to or above the new pay floors, says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics.\n\nFederal minimum wage remains $7.25\n\nLathrop, however, says the government-mandated increases are still critical to helping low-income households meet expenses, especially with inflation hitting a 39-year high last month.\n\n“At some point, we’ll go back to an economy where workers don’t have the leverage and we’ll need to rely on laws,” she says. “It would not be good policy to leave wage floors to the discretion of the private sector.”\n\nThe federal minimum wage, however, has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009, with Senate Republicans repeatedly blocking efforts to increase it.\n\nAlthough 30 states with more than 60% of the U.S. workforce now have higher pay floors than the federal government’s, 20 states – mostly in the South and Midwest – rely on the federal minimum and are unlikely to set a higher base, Lathrop says. That has intensified the need for federal action, she says.\n\nMany employers, though, say the minimum wage hikes will add to the cost pressures triggered by the worker shortages and supply-chain bottlenecks that have delayed product deliveries.\n\n“In the current environment, where employers are trying to reduce costs by pulling labor out of the restaurant, the last thing you want to do is give them another incentive to do so,” says Michael Saltsman, managing director of the Employment Policies Institute, which is backed by the restaurant industry.\n\nThe wage increases, he says, will accelerate a trend toward more automation and fewer workers.\n\nA Congressional Budget Office study in 2019 found that a $15 federal minimum wage would increase pay for 17 million workers who earn less than that and possibly another 10 million who earn slightly more. It would cause 1.3 million other workers to lose their jobs, according to the study’s median estimate.\n\nNot all of the base pay hikes taking effect next month will be large. A handful of states and 27 localities will enact small, annual cost-of-living increases.

Meanwhile, elected officials are leading the charge in Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe action at the state level comes as organized labor and liberal groups have backed a wave of strikes by fast-food workers in cities across the country to put a spotlight on hourly wages. Advocates are pressing for a national $15 hourly wage, more than twice the $7.25 federal minimum wage.\n\nStates cannot set a minimum wage that is lower than the federal standard, but they are free to establish a higher one. Washington state currently has the highest state minimum wage at $9.19; followed by Oregon ($8.95) and Vermont ($8.60). Connecticut, the District of Columbia and Illinois all have a state minimum of $8.25. In addition, some 120 cities have enacted \"living wages\" that set a minimum standard for businesses that receive city contracts. City minimums range from $9 to $16 an hour.\n\nUnder California's plan, the state minimum wage would rise from $8 an hour to $9 an hour on July 1, 2014, and then jump again to $10 an hour on Jan. 1, 2016. Less than 2 percent of California workers who receive an hourly wage make the federal minimum of $7.25 or less (some seasonal employees and other workers are can be paid less than the minimum wage). The state with the highest proportion of minimum wage workers is Idaho, with nearly 8 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau\n\nof Labor Statistics.\n\nWill $10 be model for other states?\n\nCalifornia's passage of a $10 minimum wage \"will set the bar for what other states will aim for,\" said Paul Sonn, legal co-director of the National Employment Law Project (NELP), an organization that spearheads a Raise the Minimum Wage campaign.\n\n\n\nMomentum at the state level is increasing as efforts to increase the federal hourly wage have gone nowhere. Congress last raised the minimum wage in 2007. Democrats in Congress have called for raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour by 2015, higher than President Barack Obama's call for a $9 hourly wage, but it's unlikely the GOP-controlled House will approve it.\n\n\"Once again, California is leading the effort to rebuild our middle class,\" California Assemblyman Luis Alejo, a Democrat, said after the Assembly approved his bill to increase the minimum wage.\n\nRaising the minimum wage is a politically polarizing issue. President Obama and other proponents of a higher federal minimum wage say that while companies are making record profits, the lowest-paid workers have seen their purchasing power plummet because the federal wage floor hasn't kept pace with inflation. If it had, the hourly rate would be $10.74. They say raising the minimum wage will give the economy a boost by putting more money into the pockets of people who are likely to spend it.\n\nBut opponents, including Republican House Speaker John Boehner and many business groups, argue that employers won't be able to afford the higher hourly wage and will have to lay off workers. Most businesses that hire minimum wage workers are not big corporations, they say, but rather independently-owned franchises and small businesses that operate on narrow profit margins.\n\n\"Many entrepreneurs in our state are just now starting to see signs of recovery by hiring and expanding their businesses, and this bill will cause many to halt those plans immediately,\" said John Kabateck, executive director of the National Federation of Independent Business/California. The group estimated that raising the state minimum wage to $9.25 would lead to the loss of 68,000 California jobs over a 10-year period.\n\nPopular at ballot box\n\nMinimum wage hikes have been popular with voters: Since 1998, proposed increases have been on statewide ballots 10 times in nine states, and all of them were successful. That's one of the reasons Democrats are expected to keep the issue alive for the 2014 midterm elections, when 36 governorships and legislative seats in 46 statehouses will be contested along with U.S. congressional races.\n\n\"From an electoral perspective, Democrats want the minimum wage to hang around for a while,\" said Mike Saltsman, a research director at the Employment Policies Institute, a conservative nonprofit think tank. Saltsman has written op-eds to dispute what his group calls myths about the minimum wage, including that higher wages will reduce poverty and stimulate the economy.\n\nThe group also recently ran full-page newspapers ads during the fast food strike, warning that higher wages could prompt more automation. \"Why Robots Could Soon Replace Fast Food Workers Demanding a Higher Minimum Wage,\" the headline in an ad in the Wall Street Journal said. The full-page ad in USA Today showed a touch-screen device replacing a worker.\n\nSaltsman said that protestors' call for a $15 hourly rate is \"a bargaining tactic\" so that a $10 hourly rate will seem reasonable to voters and policymakers. But increasing the rate from $7.25 to $10 is still a 40 percent bump, he said.\n\nWhile the institute and national employer groups, like the National Restaurant Association, have been outspoken opponents of a minimum wage hike, some businesses, large and small, have come out in support of higher hourly rates, arguing if workers earn more, they can spend more, namely on their products.\n\nTop officials at Costco and Starbucks both have called for a higher minimum wage. Meanwhile, a poll earlier this spring showed nearly 70 percent of small business owners support raising the minimum wage as a way to help the economy.\n\nNortheast Sees Most 2013 Action\n\nNearly a dozen states this year considered setting a state minimum wage above the federal rate, but besides California, only three did so:\n\n• New York raised its minimum hourly rate to $9 from $7.25. The rate will rise to $8 by the end of 2013, $8.75 by the end of 2014, and $9 by the end of 2015.\n\n• Connecticut's minimum wage will go to $9 an hour from $8.25, starting with a bump to $8.70 Jan. 1, followed by a second increase on Jan. 1, 2015.\n\n• Rhode Island increased its minimum hourly rate to $8 per hour, from $7.75, beginning Jan. 1.\n\nWhen these laws take effect, 20 states and the District of Columbia will have hourly rates that are higher than the federal minimum.\n\nState lawmakers in New Jersey approved raising the minimum wage to $8.50, but the increase was vetoed by Republican Gov. Chris Christie and then put on this November's ballot for voters to consider. Christie said he supported a higher wage, but opposed including automatic annual adjustments for inflation, known as \"indexing.\"\n\nTen other states already use indexing: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington. In all of them except Vermont, voters approved the measure with the automatic hike.\n\nChristie's Democratic challenger Barbara Buono has criticized him for vetoing the minimum wage increase. \"For a working parent making $7.25 an hour, life isn't about living. It's about surviving,\" Buono, a state senator from Middlesex County, said as part of her economic plan.\n\nNew Jersey is one of two states this November that will elect a governor and state lawmakers (Virginia is the other) and the only one with a statewide minimum wage question.\n\nStateline is a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Charitable Trusts that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/12/29/new-business-laws-including-minimum-wage-increase-take-effect-jan-1/897882001/", "title": "New business laws, including minimum-wage increase, take effect ...", "text": "A host of new laws, including a minimum-wage increase, will go into effect Jan. 1 and impact businesses throughout Ventura County.\n\nFor California companies with 25 or fewer employees, the minimum wage will increase to $10.50 from $10.

For example, Senate Bill 396 requires all employers to use updated posters about transgender rights.\n\nAlthough Ventura County’s chambers of commerce typically work with local businesses to help them navigate new laws, some business owners are nonetheless concerned about the upcoming changes.\n\nThe increase in the minimum wage can be particularly difficult for locally owned restaurants, said J.R. Ford, owner of Winchester’s Grill & Saloon in downtown Ventura. Ford warned that restaurants may raise their prices to compensate for increased employee pay.\n\n“Forcing wages up affects our bottom line and pricing,” Ford said. “It affects the whole food chain: My cooks demand more money when the dishwasher below them gets pushed up. I’ve been saying for a while that when minimum wage gets up to $15, the public better be ready to pay for a $12 Budweiser.”\n\nFord said California restaurants that are near state borders could be particularly impacted by increases in the minimum wage, as higher menu prices could make them less appealing than nearby competitors across the state line.\n\nState Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson, D-Santa Barbara, argued that a “wait and see” approach would work best for the ongoing minimum-wage increases, but added that it would likely improve local economies and improve the livelihood of California workers.\n\n“People get anxious when you increase the minimum wage, but historically, it’s always been a boon to the economy,” Jackson said. “When you increase the minimum wage, it stimulates business. People have more money in their pockets, and they put that money right back into the community.”\n\nJackson authored several bills that will go into effect Monday with the start of 2018, and noted that the New Parent Leave Act she wrote will provide 12 weeks of unpaid job-protected maternity and paternity leave for California parents who work for companies with 20 to 49 employees. Previously, job-protected leave was only offered to those who worked for an employer with 50 or more employees. Laws such as the New Parent Leave Act can help improve work-life balance for Californians, according to Jackson.\n\nThe New Parent Leave Act “guarantees that parents’ jobs will be there for them after taking up to 12 weeks to bond with their newborns, which is very important,” Jackson said. “They need to be able to do that without fear of losing their jobs.”\n\nJackson estimated the law would provide job protection for 2.7 million to 2.8 million Californians.\n\nOthers, such as Gary Cushing, CEO of the Camarillo Chamber of Commerce, expressed concerns that many of the impending laws would make it difficult for local businesses to continue operating in California.\n\n“The expansion of leave can be tough if you have 20 employees and you have one or two go on leave and can’t hire to replace them,” Cushing said. “As for the minimum-wage increase, it’s negative for businesses in the area, and we’ve heard that restaurants have raised prices and cut employee hours. It makes it another cost of doing business in California.”\n\nCushing added that some fast-food restaurants have cut back on employees in favor of using tablet computers and other mobile devices to let customers place orders.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/09/11/ny-raises-minimum-wage-fast-food-workers/72049896/", "title": "New York OKs $15 minimum wage for fast-food workers", "text": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — New York state will gradually raise the minimum wage for fast-food workers to $15 an hour — the first time any state has set the minimum that high.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo's administration formally approved the increase Thursday, a move the Democratic governor announced at a labor rally with Vice President Joe Biden. Cuomo said he would work to pass legislation setting a $15 minimum for all industries, a promise that comes as more and more cities around the country move toward a $15 minimum wage.\n\n\"Every working man and woman in the state of New York deserves $15 an hour,\" the governor told the enthusiastic crowd of union members. \"We're not going to stop until we get it done.\"\n\nBiden predicted the $15 wage for fast-food workers would galvanize efforts across the country.\n\n\"You're going to make every single governor in every single state in America look at themselves,\" he said at the rally in New York City. \"It's going to have a profound impact.\"\n\nHe said he and President Barack Obama remain committed to raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour.\n\nThe wage increase for fast-food workers in New York will be phased in over three years in New York City and over six years elsewhere in the state. It will apply to some 200,000 employees at large chain restaurants.\n\nSo far, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco and the California cities of Oakland and Berkeley have approved phased-in increases that eventually will take their minimum wage to $15 an hour, or about $31,200 a year.\n\nNew York's increase was recommended by an unelected Wage Board created by Cuomo — a tactic that allowed the governor to circumvent the Legislature, where the Republican-led Senate has blocked big increases in recent years. The current $8.75 minimum is already set to rise to $9 at year's end under a law passed by lawmakers in 2013.\n\nRepublicans held a hearing Thursday into the process behind the fast-food wage increase, which some restaurant owners have said they may challenge in court.\n\nFast-food workers had pushed for the increase, noting their industry employs more low-wage workers than any other sector of the workforce. They say that unlike landscaping companies or child care services, the fast-food business is dominated by multinational companies with billion-dollar profits.\n\nFranchise owners, however, say the increase singles them out and gives an unfair advantage to mom-and-pop competitors that won't have to raise wages.\n\nPat Pipino, owner of a Ben & Jerry's ice cream shop in Saratoga Springs, said some franchise owners could be forced out of business by the increase. He predicted that others may be forced to raise prices or cut positions to absorb the higher labor costs.\n\n\"By executive fiat, with the stroke of a pen, our financial model goes to pot,\" he said.\n\nOpposition by business groups and Senate Republicans will pose a significant hurdle for Cuomo's proposed $15 minimum for all workers.\n\n\"Raising the wage floor in New York that far that fast could lead to unintended consequences such as severe job losses and negatively impact many businesses who are already struggling just to keep their heads above water,\" said Republican Senate Leader John Flanagan of Long Island.\n\nDemocrats in the state Assembly and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio have long supported a $15 minimum. On Thursday, de Blasio welcomed Cuomo's call for a higher minimum wage and said he would \"urge Albany to act quickly.\"\n\n___\n\nKlepper reported from Albany, N.Y.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/12/19/minimum-wage-hikes-18-states-20-cities-lift-pay-floors-jan-1/961213001/", "title": "Minimum wage hikes: 18 states, 20 cities to lift pay floors Jan. 1", "text": "The movement to lift earnings of low-paid workers will gather force in 2018, with a growing number of states and cities raising their minimum wages as high as $15 an hour.\n\nProponents say the initiatives can help narrow a widening income gap between the wealthy and poor. Business advocates say they’re already leading to restaurant closings and layoffs.\n\nOn or about Jan. 1, 18 states and 20 cities, including many in California, will hike their base pay because of laws or ballot initiatives that mandate gradual raises over several years or automatic cost-of-living increases. Later in the year, another three states and 18 cities and counties will boost their pay floors, according to the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group.\n\nTwelve of the states and many cities are set for relatively large increases as part of a multiyear phase-in, while nine states are rolling out smaller cost-of-living bumps.\n\nThe pay hikes have been linked, at least in part, to nationwide fast-food worker demonstrations and demands for a $15 wage since 2012. Those pleas were initially deemed far-fetched. But now California, New York and more than a dozen cities are moving toward that standard by 2022 in a wave that will cover one in five U.S. workers.\n\nFor example, the pay floor is set to rise from $9 to $10 in Maine and from $11 to $13 for large employers in New York City. In Florida, by contrast, an inflation-indexed rise will nudge base pay from $8.10 to $8.25.

She says a $15 wage would allow her to begin socking away some money.\n\nSome cities are pushing the envelope. In Silicon Valley, both Mountain View and Sunnyvale will lift their pay floors from $13 to $15 an hour Jan. 1, joining Seattle (for large employers who don’t provide benefits) at that benchmark. San Francisco and New York City (for firms with more than 11 employees) will join the $15 club later in the year.\n\nThat full-time minimum wage worker in New York now earning $22,000 a year would see his or her salary leap to $30,000, assuming two weeks of vacation.\n\nMeanwhile, four states — Colorado, Hawaii, Maine and Rhode Island — will boost their minimums to $10 or slightly more on New Year’s Day, with Maryland taking that step July 1. They’ll join eight states already at or above that level — Arizona, California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington\n\n“The raises that workers have been fighting for the last five years are finally arriving in paychecks,” says Paul Sonn, NELP’s general counsel. “They’re starting to get to a more meaningful level.”\n\nStates and localities have acted as Republicans in Congress have blocked efforts to raise the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour in recent years. As a result, 29 states, with 60% of the U.S. workforce, now have pay floors that are above the federal government’s.\n\nMeanwhile, 14 states plan campaigns in 2018 to lift base pay even higher through legislation or the ballot. There are proposals for $15 an hour in 10 states, including Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Jersey. And among the 21 states still stuck at the federal minimum, Pennsylvania is expected to consider a bill that would more than double that floor to $15.\n\nThe raises are broadly juicing the paychecks of Americans on the lowest rungs of the income ladder. Workers in the bottom 10th percentile of hourly wages received an average 5% pay hike in the first half of 2017 compared with a year earlier, significantly more than any other group, according to an analysis by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.\n\n\"I'm so excited ... that I don't have to constantly choose between paying my bills or doctor's visits,\" Shantel Walker, 36, a Papa John's worker in Brooklyn, N.Y., said of her imminent raise from $12 to $13.50 an hour.\n\nBut Michael Saltsman, research director for the Employment Policies Institute, which is partly funded by the restaurant industry, says the hikes have increased business costs, especially for restaurants. In San Francisco, he says, dozens of eateries have shuttered as a result of the increases.\n\n“You’re seeing restaurants closing, you’re seeing employees lose hours of work and their jobs and a slowdown in employment growth” as some outlets replace workers with ordering kiosks.\n\nA University of Washington study in June found the second step of the minimum wage rise in Seattle, from $10.50 to $13 in January 2016, increased hourly pay in low-wage jobs by 3% but reduced the number of hours worked in such jobs by 9%.\n\nTotal earnings for those workers were cut by an average $125 a month in 2016, according to the study.

They’ll join cities such as New York, Seattle and San Francisco that are already members of the $15 club.\n\nMore broadly, 24 states and 48 cities and counties will raise their minimum wages in 2020 – a record 72 jurisdictions, the worker advocacy group’s study says.

Here's why.\n\nWill stocks be naughty or nice?Could a Santa Claus rally happen this week?\n\n“They’re feeling they can’t rely on the federal government to raise wages, so they’re doing it on their own,” says Yanett Lathrop, a researcher and policy analyst for NELP.\n\nIn Kansas City, Missouri, Milly Hobbs, 28, earns $9 an hour working full-time at McDonald’s, an amount she says forces her to share a three-bedroom apartment with five relatives and friends, including her mother. She says she spends about $20 a week on groceries, allowing her just one meal a day, and makes do with one pair of socks and two pairs of tattered pants. Her cellphone was recently turned off for nonpayment. And she doesn’t have the money to replace her one-armed eyeglass frames.\n\n“It’s been very difficult,” she says. “And this time of year it’s even more stressful.”\n\nA relatively small 45-cent increase in her hourly pay to $9.45 starting Jan. 1 should help her buy new frames, pay her phone bill and start saving toward a car purchase.\n\n“Every little bit helps,” she says. “It’s a start, but it’s not enough to live on.”\n\nThe federal minimum has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009. In July, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation to raise it to $15 by 2025, but the Republican majority Senate has refused to debate the bill, the latest chapter in a years-long standoff between the parties over the issue.\n\nTwenty-nine states, with 61% of the U.S. workforce, now have pay floors above the federal government’s, according to NELP.\n\nOn or about Jan. 1, 21 states and 26 cities and counties will lift their base pay, including California, New York, Illinois, Maine, Michigan and Massachusetts. Most will be relatively large increases as part of significant hikes that are being phased in over several years following legislation or ballot initiatives.\n\nEven some states with low pay floors are taking action. New Mexico’s wage base will rise from $7.50 to $9 and Illinois’ from $8.25 to $9.25 as both states raise their thresholds for the first time in a decade. Missouri is raising its minimum from $8.60 to $9.45 in a second step toward reaching $12 by 2023.\n\nThere will also be small, annual cost-of-living increases in seven states, such as bumps from $8.46 to $8.56 in Florida and from $8.55 to $8.70 in Ohio. Twenty-six cities and counties, many of them in California, also will raise their minimums, including 14 cost-of-living increases.\n\nLook ma, no cash:Will 2020 mark the start of a decade when Americans finally ditch cash and use digital wallets, credit cards?\n\nLater in 2020, another three states – Connecticut, Nevada and Oregon – and 22 localities will raise their minimum wages, the NELP report shows.\n\nBut the most striking development is the growth in the number of jurisdictions headed to a $15 pay floor. A couple of years ago, it was just California and New York. Now, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Connecticut are also on their way to $15. Nearly a third of the U.S. workforce lives in states climbing to $15 over the next few years, says David Cooper, senior economic analyst for the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.\n\nAnd along with many cities in California, Chicago, Denver and St. Paul, Minnesota, are moving to that benchmark. Lathrop credits the awareness generated by Fight for $15, an alliance of fast-food and other low-paid workers that has staged walkouts across the country since 2012 and are backed by the Service Employees International Union.\n\n“The Fight for $15 has really been making inroads,” Lathrop says.\n\nAt the same time, 21 states still have minimum wages at the federal government’s $7.25 or are subject to the U.S. standard. In several of those states, localities such as Madison, Wisconsin; Louisville, Kentucky; and Polk County, Iowa, have adopted their own higher minimums only to be blocked by state legislatures, according to the NELP report. Some cities in states with higher pay bases, such as Miami and Denver, similarly have seen their efforts to rise above the thresholds preempted by the states.\n\nBut Colorado lawmakers repealed the state’s wage preemption law last May, allowing Denver to pass legislation that will bring its minimum to $15.87 by 2022. Similar repeal efforts are underway in 12 other states, including Kentucky, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas, all of whose pay floors are mired at $7.25.\n\nCan you spare a part?

Noting that companies such as Target, Walmart and Amazon have raised their own pay bases, Saltsman says the state laws, and an increase in the federal minimum, are unnecessary.\n\nA Congressional Budget Office study published in July found that a $15 federal minimum wage would increase pay for 17 million workers who earn less than that and possibly another 10 million who earn slightly more.

Canada stabbing\n\nA manhunt is underway for one of two brothers suspected in a mass stabbing in Canada that left 10 dead and 18 injured. The attacks occurred Sunday across multiple locations in the province of Saskatchewan and spanned 13 crime scenes, authorities said. A few hours after the first attack was reported, authorities identified the suspects as two brothers aged 31 and 30. One of the brothers has since been found dead with injuries that were not believed to be self-inflicted. His 30-year-old brother with a \"lengthy criminal record\" is still at large and considered \"armed and dangerous,\" police said.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Blades, not bullets': Timeline of mass stabbing in Canada Replay More Videos ...

Dr Tim Maloney/Griffith University\n\nIn a remote cave on Borneo, Indonesia, archaeologists have made a discovery that upends our understanding of the Stone Age: an amputee who lived 31,000 years ago.\n\nThe young individual’s skeleton was missing its lower left leg, which Australian and Indonesian researchers believe was carefully severed just above the ankle by a surprisingly skilled prehistoric surgeon, likely using stone tools.\n\nOnly a century ago, most people who underwent amputation would have died – either from blood loss and shock or from subsequent infection.\n\nNot only was this Stone Age surgery successful, but the amputee lived for another six to nine years, ultimately dying of natural causes before being delicately buried by caregivers, according to research.\n\nTrailblazers\n\nScientists at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom have created synthetic mouse embryos in a lab dish – an exciting advance that ultimately could lead to new fertility treatments.\n\nWithout using sperm or egg, the researchers produced an embryo that developed a beating heart and a brain from the stem cells of mice.\n\nBy observing the embryos at this stage of life in a lab instead of a uterus, the scientists got a better view into the mystifying process to learn why a pregnancy might fail and how to prevent this loss.\n\nThey hope to move from mouse embryos to creating models of natural human pregnancies – many of which fail in the early stages.\n\nFantastic creatures\n\nShrew-like Brasilodon quadrangularis lived 225 million years ago. 2022 Anatomical Society/Wiley\n\nThe earliest mammal known to science, Brasilodon quadrangularis, was a shrew-like creature. It skittered at the feet of the first dinosaurs 225 million years ago.\n\nIn a case of mistaken identity, researchers previously thought the small animal was a reptile.\n\nNow, a new study has revealed it was “definitively” a mammal, thanks to clues provided by three fossilized jawbones that belonged to the long extinct creature.\n\nThe discovery will help paleontologists better understand the evolution of modern mammals.\n\nDefying gravity\n\nWhat’s going on with NASA’s Artemis I mission after two failed attempts to launch its mega moon rocket?\n\nThe space agency has delayed a third try until September 23 or September 27 – or perhaps even longer still as engineers find a way to fix a hydrogen fuel leak.\n\nComplicating matters is the changeable Florida weather, with hurricane season in full swing, and existing commitments: NASA expects to launch the Crew-5 mission, which will carry a fresh team of astronauts to the International Space Station aboard a SpaceX rocket, on October 3.\n\nFor now, the moon rocket remains on the launchpad while engineers replace the seal on an interface between the liquid hydrogen feed line and the launcher.\n\nThe colossal rocket, however, may still need to roll back to Kennedy Space Center’s Vehicle Assembly Building.\n\nMission critical\n\nThe US Antarctic Program research vessel Nathaniel B.

The team had been studying a thriving underwater ecosystem near the continent for years, but thanks to new modeling and powerful instrumentation they were able to navigate through a crumbling landscape of ice to their destination.\n\n\"We saw a lot of icebergs and they were impressive -- the size of buildings,\" Patricia Yager, a professor at the Department of Marine Sciences at the University of Georgia, told CNN. \"Some are as tall as the Statue of Liberty, up to 300 feet above the waterline.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of melting going on,\" Yager said. \"Lots more than I expected. There was more meltwater and more heat in that ocean than I imagined.\"\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica, roughly the size of Florida, is melting at a rapid rate. In fact, most of the ice in western Antarctica is melting. But the Thwaites Glacier -- also known as Doomsday Glacier -- is one of the most unstable in Antarctica. This is very worrisome because of the sea level rise it could cause.\n\nBut it's more than that.\n\n\"What we realized as biologists and chemists and ecosystems scientists was, our ecosystem was also being impacted,\" Yager said.\n\nScientists believe this ecosystem is pivotal to climate research, and years of extraordinary warming has allowed them to finally see it with their own eyes. Everything in this ecosystem -- from the small phytoplankton to the larger seals and penguins -- is being impacted.\n\nYager and her fellow researchers want to know what will happen to the surrounding ocean salt water if the glaciers melt, particularly what happens to the ecosystems that live in it -- or under it.\n\nNathaniel B. Palmer ship among icebergs. Credit: Dr. Patricia Yager\n\nThe entire food chain is being impacted\n\nWhile Yager and her team were in Antarctica, they found an elephant seal in the polynya -- an oasis of open water where sea ice would normally exist -- that they were studying.\n\n\"Nobody's reported seeing an elephant seal there before,\" she said. \"What we see is if there's a shift in the ecosystem, the animals respond. The problem is they're not just responding to the food. They're also responding to change in habitat and ocean currents.\"\n\nBut how did that elephant seal get there? Well, that is where these important microorganisms called phytoplankton come in.\n\nA seal resting on a piece of sea ice with the Nathaniel B. Palmer ship in the background. Credit: Ms. Li Ling PhD student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology\n\nPhytoplankton are vital to the Antarctic food chain. Krill eat the phytoplankton, and animals like seals, fish, and penguins eat the krill.\n\nCertain coastal regions of Antarctica have the highest abundances of phytoplankton in the world.\n\n\"The Amundsen Sea Polynya is about half the size of the state of Georgia,\" Yager said. \"So it's a big feature. On a per meter squared basis, it is more productive [than other polynyas] for reasons we think that are related to this melting glacier.\"\n\nIt was discovered about a decade ago that this meltwater was providing iron-rich water to the polynya. So much iron that it was providing beneficial fertilizer to the local ecosystem.\n\nHowever, high amounts of iron are not usually found in the coastal Antarctic because there is so little exposed rock there.\n\n\"The Southern Ocean is famously known for being a high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll zone,\" Yager said. \"We figured out that this ocean, for the most part, has plenty of nitrogen but it is missing another important fertilizer, which is iron.\"\n\nWhere there's iron, there are phytoplankton blooms.\n\nA branched sessile invertebrate, seen through a dissecting microscope, was found in a sediment core. The branched structure is approximately 1 cm in size. Credit: Dr. Lisa C. Herbert, Postdoctoral Fellow at Rutgers University\n\nThis ecosystem may have adapted to climate change in some ways, but it will need to change in many more ways to survive rising temperatures.\n\n\"We knew from the satellites that there was a big phytoplankton bloom in this area. It's why we went to first explore this region back in 2007. Rob Sherrell, a trace metal geochemist from Rutgers University, pointed out that if there are algae blooming, then there must be iron. The question was, where was the iron coming from?\"\n\nWhat the researchers didn't understand was why meltwater was coming out from where it was, and why it was so rich in iron, Yager said.\n\n\"So we went down there thinking, okay, well, the glacier has iron in it, and the melting glacier is dribbling iron into the ocean, which is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis. That's what's happening in parts of Greenland,\" Yager said. \"However, turns out, that's not what's happening. It's more interesting than that.\"\n\nBack home, the science team set out to build a computer model to explore how the iron delivery worked.\n\n\"That's what we went down to test this year,\" Yager said. \"The model suggested that the iron is actually coming mostly from the deep ocean water responsible for melting the glacier, but the delivery of iron to the surface is because of the added buoyancy from the melt.\"\n\nThat upwelling of iron is fueling thriving ecosystem communities with species of algae, icefish, seals and jellyfish.\n\nA small Antarctic jellyfish. Credit: Daisy Pickup, PhD Student at University of East Anglia\n\nIt may seem hard to believe that organisms could thrive in such cold environments, but there is life down there. And when you change that environment, it can have dire consequences.\n\n\"That life loves being down there,\" Yager said. \"If you take them away from that cold environment, they don't survive. If you take the bacteria or the organisms that live down there and you put them in warm water, they often die.\"\n\nSo while on the surface it may seem like a good thing that parts of these ecosystems are thriving -- such as the phytoplankton, zooplankton -- other aspects of the ecosystem can't adapt as easily.\n\n\"For example, the Adelie penguins really depend on sea ice, and as the sea ice has disappeared from the peninsula in western Antarctica, the Adelies have declined dramatically because their habitat is gone,\" Yager said. \"What we're seeing is an ecosystem shift. Adelie penguins are moving to new areas where there is more sea ice, and other penguins that don't need the sea ice are moving in.\"\n\nColony of penguins near Bear Peninsula in Antarctica. Credit: Ms. Li Ling PhD student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology\n\nBut when the ecosystem shifts, so too does the food web.\n\nIf the varieties of phytoplankton and krill shift, for example, then the fish, seals and penguins must shift, too, out of necessity.\n\n\"There's going to be winners and losers with climate change,\" Yager said. \"Life will find a way and somebody will come in and take advantage of whatever food is available. It just might not be the thing that used to live there.\"\n\nWhy this location is so unique\n\nYager has been traveling to Antarctica for research since 2007 , but thanks to a very high-resolution model created by Pierre St-Laurent, a research scientist at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, the crew think they found the ideal spot.\n\n\"It's an interesting experience to be quietly sitting at your desk in the US and suddenly receive an email request from a colleague in Antarctica who is on the field and who would need guidance,\" St-Laurent told CNN.\n\nHe worked out codes to predict the ocean currents using basic ingredients like water temperature, salinity, winds, the depth of the ocean and sea ice arrangements along coastlines of the Amundsen Sea. These predictions help the team -- funded by the National Science Foundation and the UK Natural Environment Research Council -- understand what's going on below the surface.\n\nThe science and logistics team for the NBP22-02 Expedition.

The researchers wanted to verify what the models had predicted for a coastal current delivering meltwater and iron from the Thwaites.\n\n\"So this part of Antarctica, according to satellites, is one of the most productive in terms of biology,\" Yager said. \"It's the greenest place in Antarctica and has the densest chlorophyll per meter squared. But it's very hard to get there as you might notice. It's pretty far away from everywhere.\"\n\nLarge crack in iceberg from Dotson outflow site. Credit: Dr. Patricia Yager\n\nWhether you travel from New Zealand or the southern tip of Chile, it's a two-week trip by ship -- about as far away from anywhere as you can get.\n\n\"We know that the sea ice is integral to the ecosystem in this area -- they're called marginal ice zones,\" Yager said. \"In the wintertime, the sea ice in these zones covers up the ecosystem. But then in the spring and summer, when it melts to make a polynya, it provides some layering of the ocean, and tend to be quite productive.\"\n\nThe ocean has three primary layers -- the surface layer (sometimes referred to as the mixed layer), the thermocline layer and the deep ocean.\n\nThe surface layer is the top layer of the water, and is well stirred from the wind and other forces. This top ocean layer also tends to be the warmest layer due to heating from the sun. And the phytoplankton also live in the surface layer.\n\n\"Because it's not just the iron -- it's the iron and light together that the phytoplankton need,\" Yager said.\n\nShe collaborated with a group called TARSAN , a ship-based project studying how atmospheric and oceanic processes are influencing the behavior of the Thwaites and Dotson Ice Shelves. Their research helps identify how variations in atmospheric or oceanic conditions may influence the behavior and stability of ice shelves in the region in the future.\n\nHigh-tech Autosub Long Range vehicle \"Boaty McBoatface\" is used to examine ice shelf conditions.

Credit: Ms. Hannah Wyles, PhD student at University of St. Andrews\n\n\"If you bring iron up from below, disappearing sea ice and stronger winds could take away some of the stratification of the ocean, and now you've got less light for the phytoplankton,\" Yager said.\n\nThis is why having multiple teams working together is so important, because each group can see something from a different angle.\n\nIf we catch it early, can we fix it?\n\nThe concern is that eventually, when the sea ice goes away and the polynyas disappear, this ecosystem will be destroyed.\n\n\"That has actually happened off the northeast coast of Greenland, there is no longer a polynya there, it's gone completely,\" Yager said.\n\n\"There's two things happening in Antarctica,\" she said. \"The sea ice melts seasonally to make a polynya and the glaciers are melting and adding iron. So in this immediate time period, it's all working together pretty well. We have this wonderful bloom.\"\n\nBut too much of a good thing can be a bad thing in the long term.\n\nLandscape view from Eastern Notch region of Antarctica. Credit: Dr. Patricia Yager\n\nYager says it's just like the food pyramid -- it's all about balance. As humans we need protein, grains, vegetables and fruit. If you eat a diet focused highly on fruits, your balance is off.\n\nIf this area becomes too high in iron, the balance will eventually tip.\n\n\"If we keep pushing in the same direction, and the sea ice goes away, the whole setup may collapse. And then we're just pumping high carbon and high iron deep water into the surface of the Southern Ocean, and we don't really know what the effect of that is going to be,\" Yager said.\n\n\"That's why we're testing and improving this model to help us predict forward,\" she said. \"It's giving us a clue of what might happen in the future, before it actually happens.\"\n\nIceberg seen from above and below the water line. Credit: Dr. Patricia Yager\n\nSt-Laurent also had a chance to travel to Antarctica , though in a different region called the Ross Sea.\n\n\"The remoteness of Antarctica is what struck me the most; in many ways the research expedition felt like taking a trip to the moon,\" St-Laurent said.\n\n\"And yet, we know that this remote part of Earth has the potential to impact all coastal communities greatly as the Antarctic ice sheet continues to lose mass over the next decades and contributes to global sea level rise. Despite the scale of the planet, we're in many ways interconnected, for better or for worse.\"", "authors": ["Allison Chinchar", "Cnn Meteorologist"], "publish_date": "2022/05/07"}]}

But less well-known is a looming high-stakes clash between one of America’s oldest unions and the world’s biggest package courier.\n\nContract negotiations are set to begin in the spring between UPS and the Teamsters Union ahead of their current contract’s expiration at the end of July, 2023. Already, before the talks have even started, labor experts are predicting that the drivers and package handlers will go on strike.\n\n“The question is how long it will be,” said Todd Vachon, professor of Labor Relations at Rutgers. “The union’s president ran and won on taking a more militant approach. Even if they’re very close [to a deal], the rank and file will be hungry to take on the company.”\n\nIf that happens, a strike at UPS would affect nearly every household in the country. An estimated 6% of the nation’s gross domestic product is moved in UPS trucks every year. The explosive growth of online retail has made the company and its drivers more crucial than ever to the nation’s struggling supply chain. Beyond the company’s home deliveries, it also delivers many of the goods found in stores, factories and offices.\n\nAbout 350,000 Teamsters work at UPS as drivers and package sorters out of a global workforce of 534,000 permanent employees. And that’s growing fast — the company has added some 72,000 Teamster-represented jobs since the start of the pandemic.\n\nWhile there are competing services at FedEx (FDX), the US Postal Service and Amazon’s own delivery service, none of them have the capacity to handle more than a small fraction of the 21.5 million US packages that UPS moves daily.\n\n“We want a contract that provides wins for our employees and that provides UPS the flexibility to stay competitive in a rapidly changing industry,” the company said in a statement this month. “UPS and the Teamsters have worked cooperatively for almost 100 years to meet the needs of UPS employees, customers, and the communities where we live and work. We believe we’ll continue to find common ground with the Teamsters and reach an agreement that’s good for everyone involved.”\n\nThe union has not gone on strike against UPS since a nearly two-week protest in 1997. If the union does go on strike, it would be the largest strike against a single business in nation’s history.\n\nAnger over current contract\n\nThere are certainly signs of strain in relations between the company and the union — both its leadership and its rank-and-file members.\n\nA majority of members voted against ratifying the current contract in 2018, only to see the previous Teamster leadership, led by then-President James Hoffa, put it in place because not enough of the membership participated in the ratification vote to trigger a strike.\n\nThe union’s new president, Sean O’Brien, won his office earlier this year by making the UPS contract a central focus of his campaign. He has vowed to make UPS pay Teamster members far more this time and he often talks about a $300 million strike fund the union has accumulated to pay members in case they go on strike.\n\n“Do our members wake up every day wanting a strike. I’d say no. But are they fed up? Yes they’re fed up,” O’Brien told CNN Business last week. “Whether or not there is a strike, that’s totally up to the company. We’re going to utilize as much leverage as we can to get our members the contract they deserve.”\n\nUPS said the average pay for its delivery drivers is $95,000 a year, with benefits such as a traditional pension plan, worth an additional $50,000 a year. UPS’ semi-tractor drivers are paid even more. That’s far higher than most wages at FedEx and Amazon, where many drivers work for small independent contractors.\n\nThe current contract expires at 12:01 am August 1. O’Brien vows the union will not grant any kind of contract extension past that deadline.\n\nAnd he added that on top of improved pay and benefits, the union will demand better working conditions, including adding air conditioning in the panel trucks used for UPS deliveries which the union says poses a health risk for drivers.\n\n“It’s not a heavy lift for the company to install air conditioning,” he said. “There’s a lot of heat stroke going on.”\n\nRecord profits at UPS\n\nThe company often speaks about how much it values its Teamster-represented workforce.\n\nAnd in one important way – employment numbers – UPS is one of the best friends labor has in the ranks of US corporate management, despite the obvious tensions. UPS is one of the few unionized employers that is significantly adding payrolls, and to union membership. At other businesses, union membership numbers have been steadily declining or decades.\n\nThe increase in Teamsters jobs at UPS has come from the steady growth in online purchases, especially during the pandemic-era surge. Last year, it took only nine months to report what was already a record profit for a full year. UPS ended 2021 with operating income up 50% to $13.1 billion. In the first half of this year, earnings rose another 10% compared with a year ago.\n\n“Everyone keeps getting richer except for our members,” said O’Brien.\n\nUPS CEO Carol Tome, who started that job just as the pandemic began, says that the company’s union contract is a competitive advantage at a time of worker shortages.\n\nShe also is trying to assure both investors and UPS customers that the company will be prepared in case the union does go on strike. She declined to comment on what those preparations are.\n\n“Our goal with the Teamsters is win-win-win,” she told investors in July.

So if you watched Thursday night's hearing by the House's 1/6 committee, shown live by most of the major TV networks in the United States, let me tell you what I watched on right-wing TV at the same time.\n\nThe prime-time hearing began at 8 p.m. Eastern time. When Rep. Bennie Thompson gaveled the hearing to order, Fox News host Tucker Carlson ignored him. Carlson declared that the \"ruling class\" was giving \"yet another lecture about January 6.\" He called the hearing \"propaganda\" and reveled in his refusal to air it. \"They are lying,\" he said, \"and we are not going to help them do it.\"\n\nCarlson then lied himself: He said \"if something noteworthy happens\" at the hearing, \"obviously we will bring it to you immediately.\" But his show did not do that.\n\nWhen Thompson said January 6 was \"the culmination of an attempted coup,\" Carlson asked why the news media cared at all. He barely mentioned Donald Trump, even though the former president's plot to undermine American democracy was the focal point of the hearing. Instead, he talked a lot about Democrats and questioned why other networks were committing \"collusion\" with the House by televising the hearing. \"Because the Democrats and the left are desperate,\" his guest Jason Whitlock said.\n\nWhen Rep. Liz Cheney revealed many of the committee's findings for the first time, Carlson said everyone knows that America \"could face some real problems real soon;\" implied that Congress shouldn't be wasting its time on the 1/6 investigation; and called Thompson and Cheney \"lunatics.\"\n\nCarlson sounded like an amateur magician who tries to distract kids when a performance falls apart: \"Look over here, not over there.\" He said, \"Gas is over five bucks. Inflation is higher than it's been in the lifetime of most Americans. Violent crime is making cities impossible to live in, and more than one hundred thousand Americans ODed on drugs last year. Why isn't there a prime time hearing about any of that?\"\n\nFox ignored its own role\n\nAll evening long, Fox downplayed the violence of January 6 and dismissed the revelations about Trump's conduct. The network also ignored its own role in promoting false claims about the election before the riot and the committee's publication of private messages between some of its hosts.\n\nWhen Cheney read a text exchange between Fox stars Sean Hannity and Kayleigh McEnany from the day after the riot, with Hannity urging \"no more crazy people\" and \"no more stolen election talk,\" Carlson showed the live coverage on other networks and made fun of those networks. He did not mention anything about the texts.\n\nNewsmax, Fox's right-wing rival, actually showed most of Cheney's remarks, but cut away for analysis from pro-Trump commentators. The network's banners also promoted Trump's talking points and, at times, Newsmax's own app.\n\nBack on Fox, when the committee showed a never-before-seen video of the Capitol being attacked, with terrifying images from surveillance cameras and other sources, Carlson's producers showed sterile live shots of the hearing room, but not the video. One of his banners said \"TODAY'S HEARING IS POLITICAL THEATER.\"\n\nWhen the video concluded, Newsmax's Rob Schmitt said, \"we saw a lot worse in the summer of 2020, spurred on by comments from the other side of the aisle, that burned major cities in this country down. Where's the hearing on that? Well they don't have that hearing, because they don't care about your life, where you live.\"\n\nWhen Sean Hannity began his Fox program at 9 p.m., he did the same thing Carlson did: He showed silent live video of the hearing and talked over it the entire time. Hannity said the hearing -- still in progress -- was \"the dullest, the most boring\" Democratic \"fund-raiser.\" He didn't play a word of what Cheney said. He focused instead on security lapses and laid the blame directly at House speaker Nancy Pelosi's feet.\n\nWhen the committee swore in its witnesses, Fox's banners called the hearing a \"SHAM\" and an \"ANTI-TRUMP SHOW TRIAL.\"\n\nWhen injured police officer Caroline Edwards described how she was tear gassed outside the Capitol, The Federalist editor in chief MZ Hemingway tweeted , \"Is the Soviet-style show trial still going on?\"\n\nWhen Edwards described \"carnage\" and said she was \"slipping in peoples' blood\" outside the Capitol, Hannity said the hearing was a failure: \"They overpromised, they underdelivered.\" Somehow he claimed to know that already, even though he was on live TV during part two of the hearing. And no, he never acknowledged his own texts or his own role as an adviser to Trump.\n\nWhen the hearing concluded, and analysts on the other networks absorbed the enormity of what was presented, the pro-Trump media narrative was already baked. On Newsmax, Schmitt dismissed it as a \"completely one-sided hearing about something that happened a year and a half ago.\" On Fox, the banner on Laura Ingraham's 10pm show said \"JAN 6TH COMMITTEE FLOPS IN PRIMETIME.\"\n\n\"Don't get me wrong...\"\n\nWhy does the right-wing media opposition matter? Because it ensures that the country stays on two wildly different tracks of information.\n\n\"Don't get me wrong: These hearings are crucial and every American should be watching them,\" The Atlantic contributing writer Tom Nichols wrote Thursday. \"But the alternate reality that about forty percent of us live in will never be breached by actual facts.\" The Dispatch senior editor David French estimated that \"tens of millions\" of people still don't understand \"the reality of January 6 in large part because the news outlets and personalities they trust are deliberately lying and/or withholding the plain truth about Trump and that dreadful day.\"\n\nOf course, Fox News said days in advance that it would not show the prime time hearing on its flagship network, but it was still extraordinary to see the network follow through on its ignore-the-news plan. Mediaite's editor in chief Aidan McLaughlin did not hold back: \"The footage of horrific violence being aired right now is why this hearing isn't airing on Fox News. So they can lie about it,\" he tweeted\n\nFox's actual hearing coverage was relegated to the Fox Business Network, which has a tiny fraction of the main channel's viewership. The coverage also streamed on Fox Nation and was available to Fox broadcast stations. Notably, however, Carlson and Hannity's shows did not point to those outlets or promote those options. They did not put a box in the corner of the screen pushing to the news. Instead, Bret Baier tweeted a reminder that he was on Fox Business, and critical replies piled up.\n\nMade for TV?\n\n\"We all heard that this was going to be a made-for-TV hearing, a presentation designed to capture the attention of the public in a way that normal Capitol Hill events simply do not,\" Oliver Darcy wrote. \"Specifically, we heard that the 1/6 committee was consulting with former ABC News president James Goldston to help with the production. The New York Times teased that Goldston had been hired 'to produce the hearings as if they were a docudrama or a must-watch mini-series.'\"\n\n\"But in reality, the hearing did not feel like a 'docudrama' or 'must-watch mini-series.' Not even close,\" Darcy wrote. \"Instead, it mostly employed the style of a standard, run-of-the mill Capitol Hill hearing. Yes, there was also a haunting video package showing the raw violence of that day. But that video, the only real detour from the typical hearing format, only comprised a sliver of the two-hour affair.\"\n\nThe hearing \"was not the shock and awe it needed to be,\" Deadline senior editor Dominic Patten wrote right afterward. \"Despite the praise from TV talking heads, this was NPR when it should have been UFC.\"\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter critic Frank Scheck disagreed : \"It remains to be seen whether what's to follow in the coming weeks will do anything to move the needle among a citizenry that seems to have settled into their respective stances. But judging from the opening installment, there will be plenty of powerful material for those with open minds to digest.\"\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter.

Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor died Thursday at Balmoral Castle, her estate in Scotland. She was 96.\n\nHer eldest son and heir, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, 73, immediately became King Charles III upon her death. His wife became Queen Consort Camilla.\n\nAfter reigning over the United Kingdom for 70 years and having been royal all her life, Queen Elizabeth has lived through some remarkable times. From her first personal crisis as queen in 1953 to Princess Diana's death in 1997 to the death of her husband Prince Philip last year, here's a look at some of the most important dates from her life.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II dies at 96:Prince Charles takes the throne as king\n\nThe reign of King Charles III begins:What kind of sovereign will he be? Not like his mother\n\n1926: A princess is born\n\nPrincess Elizabeth, as she was known before ascending the throne at 25, was born in Mayfair, London, to Prince Albert, Duke of York, and his Scottish aristocrat wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York.\n\nHer sister, Princess Margaret Rose, was born Aug. 21, 1930, at Glamis Castle, the Scottish ancestral home of her mother's family, the earls of Strathmore. The sisters were close to each other and to their parents, often called \"We four\" by their father.\n\nWho succeeded Queen Elizabeth II, more questions answered\n\n1936: The Abdication Crisis\n\nKing Edward VIII, Elizabeth's uncle, abdicated – gave up his throne – on Dec. 10 to be free to marry a twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson, after his ministers and the Church of England refused to accept a divorced queen.\n\nAs a result, his next oldest brother, Prince Albert, Elizabeth's father, became King George VI and her mother became his consort, Queen Elizabeth (later known as the Queen Mother). Their older daughter, Elizabeth, became the heir to the throne, at the age of 10.\n\nThe trauma from the abdication and its existential threat to the British monarchy has never been forgotten in the royal family. Elizabeth's mother blamed the stress for her husband's early death at age 56, though he had lung cancer and died of coronary thrombosis. Her daughter had always vowed never to abdicate.\n\n► Stay up to date with the latest on King Charles III and the royal succession with our newsletter Keep Calm and Carry On.

The two first met in 1934 at the wedding of their relatives, Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark and Prince George, Duke of Kent.\n\nThey met again in 1939, when she was 13 and he was 18, and she was forever smitten. Elizabeth and Philip were distant cousins, both great-great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria.\n\nMore:Prince Philip's will ordered sealed for 90 years to protect royal 'dignity'\n\n1952: Elizabeth II ascends the throne\n\nElizabeth was a young mother of just 25 and vacationing with Philip in Kenya when her father George VI died on Feb. 6, 1952 at Sandringham, the royal country retreat in Norfolk. She became queen instantly on his death but didn't know it because international communication at the time was less developed. Philip broke the terrible news to her, both aware their lives would now change utterly. She flew to London immediately to be officially proclaimed queen.\n\nHer coronation took place more than a year later, on June 2, 1953, in Westminster Abbey and marked the first time a coronation was televised.\n\n1953: Queen's first personal crisis\n\nThe queen faced her first crisis when her sister Princess Margaret wanted to marry Group Capt. Peter Townsend, a divorced World War II hero flyer and her father's equerry. Ministers and church leaders, as with the 1936 abdication crisis, opposed the princess marrying a divorced man. In 1955, under pressure from the church and a threat to her royal status, and after a forced separation and years of headlines, Margaret and Townsend decided not to marry.\n\n'None of it had to be this way':Duchess Meghan opens up on 'bittersweet' UK departure\n\n1957: First televised Christmas speech\n\nLike her father before her, the queen delivered a speech to the nation every Christmas, one of the only times she spoke her own words without government scrutiny. Her first televised Christmas speech was in 1957. (Before that, her speeches were broadcast on the radio.)\n\n\"I very much hope that this new medium will make my Christmas message more personal and direct,\" she told her audience.\n\n1957: Queen meets President Eisenhower\n\nThough Princess Elizabeth met President Harry S. Truman in 1951, President Dwight D. Eisenhower was the first American leader she met as queen. She welcomed Eisenhower and his wife, Mamie Eisenhower, for a dinner in their honor at the British Embassy in Washington.\n\nThe queen went on to meet 12 more U.S. presidents, including John F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and, most recently, Joe Biden.\n\nThe world reacts:King Charles III expresses 'greatest sadness' over mother Queen Elizabeth II's death\n\n1973: Queen's only daughter gets married\n\nThe first of the queen's children to marry was her only daughter, Princess Anne, who married her first husband, Capt. Mark Phillips, on Nov. 14, 1973, at Westminster Abbey. The couple had two children, Zara Tindall and Peter Phillips. They divorced in 1992. Princess Anne, now Princess Royal, who remarried in 1992 to Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, now is grandmother to five children.\n\n1981: The wedding of the century\n\nIt was the wedding everyone waited for – the marriage of Elizabeth's son and heir, Prince Charles, to Lady Diana Spencer in St Paul's Cathedral on July 29. A year later, on June 21, 1982, a new heir to the throne, Prince William, was born. His brother, Prince Harry, was born on Sept. 15, 1984.\n\nAfter years of scandals and recriminations, Charles and Diana divorced in August 1996, under orders from the queen. In 2005, Charles married his longtime mistress, Camilla Parker Bowles, now the Queen Consort.\n\n'Indescribable sadness':Prince William, Prince Harry blister BBC over inquiry on 1995 Diana interview\n\n1992: The 'annus horribilis'\n\nIn a woebegone speech (while suffering from a cold), the queen quoted one of her correspondents as saying 1992 was her \"annus horribilis,\" the most painful year of her life. First, three of her children's marriages collapsed, accompanied by tabloid headlines.\n\nOn Nov. 20, 1992, the queen's beloved Windsor Castle burned for 15 hours, and 100 rooms were damaged or destroyed. It led to two major changes: The queen and Prince Charles announced they would begin paying taxes, and Elizabeth opened parts of Buckingham Palace to the public the following year to help defray some of the taxpayers' costs to repair Windsor Castle.\n\n1997: Princess Diana dies\n\nDiana and her beau, Dodi Fayed, died in a car crash in a tunnel in Paris while racing to evade paparazzi. Later inquiries found the driver was drunk and no one in the car was wearing a seat belt except the sole survivor, a security guard.\n\nThe queen rarely addressed the nation outside of her annual Christmas speech, but Diana's death was one of the few times she did so, under tremendous pressure from the public and the press to show more feeling publicly about the tragedy. A few days before Diana's moving funeral in Westminster Abbey, Elizabeth gave a five-minute televised tribute to the late princess, with whom she had a fraught relationship.\n\n2002: Princess Margaret and the Queen Mother die\n\nQueen Elizabeth's only sibling, Princess Margaret, died in her sleep at age 71 in February 2002 after suffering a stroke the day before. Divorced from her husband, Lord Snowdon, she was the mother of two children, David Viscount Linley and Lady Sarah Chatto, both of whom were close to their aunt the queen.\n\nContrary to usual royal custom, Princess Margaret was cremated and interred with her father in the King George VI Memorial Chapel in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nA month after her sister's death, Buckingham Palace announced the death of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother at age 101. The palace released a statement on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II that read: \"The Queen, with the greatest sadness, has asked for the following announcement to be made immediately. Her beloved mother, Queen Elizabeth, died peacefully in her sleep this afternoon, at Royal Lodge, Windsor.\" She, too, was laid to rest in the memorial chapel named for her husband.\n\n2015: Longest-reigning British monarch\n\nOn Sept. 9, 2015, Queen Elizabeth II became the longest-reigning British monarch. As 41st monarch since 1066, she surpassed her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria for the longest run in the country's history – just over 63 years and six months. Elizabeth marked the day by carrying on with her daily royal duties – business as usual.\n\n2019: Prince Andrew steps back from royal duties\n\nAfter the fallout from Prince Andrew's past friendship with American sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the Duke of York, the queen's second son, announced he was stepping away from his royal duties.\n\nTwo years later, Andrew was sued in federal court in New York and accused of sex crimes, including being a knowing beneficiary of the alleged sex trafficking of a teen girl by Epstein. Andrew, 62, has vehemently denied all the accusations, and Buckingham Palace has backed him up in emphatic statements.\n\nMore:Prince Andrew could face U.S. trial next fall for sexual assault civil suit, judge rules\n\n2020: Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan quit royal duties\n\nIn a shocking, unprecedented move, Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan of Sussex announced they were stepping down from their senior royal roles and moving to North America. Later, they cited the “toxic” British media as a reason for doing so.\n\nBitter recriminations followed. Harry and Meghan ended up moving to California, where they began their new lives in Santa Barbara County. The couple have since signed production deals with Netflix and Spotify and welcomed a second child.\n\nThen, in an interview in March 2021 with Oprah Winfrey, Harry and Meghan shocked again with more details about why they left, suggesting racism in the royal family and indifference to Meghan's pleas for mental health support.\n\nMore recriminations and counterallegations followed as relations between the Sussexes and the rest of Harry's family, including his father and brother, deteriorated.\n\n2020: Queen addresses nation on COVID-19\n\nAmid shutdowns and anxiety over the spread of the coronavirus in Britain and around the world, Elizabeth addressed the nation in a \"rare and historic\" move, calling on the U.K. to rise to the challenge of the pandemic. The queen acknowledged the daunting trials brought by the crisis, seeking to lift spirits and offer hope to the country in its hour of need.\n\n2021: Prince Philip dies\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh, Queen Elizabeth's husband and Britain's oldest and longest-serving royal spouse in 10 centuries, died April 9 at 99 years old, just short of his 100th birthday. Married to the queen for more than 70 years, Philip was a steady presence behind her at thousands of public events, as familiar to the British people as the queen, if not always as beloved.\n\nMore:Queen Elizabeth II speaks publicly about late husband Prince Philip at Scottish Parliament\n\nHis death was a personal loss to the monarch and to his family, and a substantial one: Most British historians and commentators believe Philip was one of the keys to the queen's enduring success as a monarch. The queen herself famously described him as her \"strength and stay.\"\n\n2022: Queen Elizabeth II dies 'peacefully'\n\n\"The Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon,\" the palace tweeted. \"The King and The Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow.\"\n\nQueen Elizabeth II died with her family by her side.\n\nA fleet of cars carrying Prince William, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and his wife, Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, arrived at Balmoral Castle about an hour after their plane landed in Aberdeen, Scotland.\n\nKing Charles, along with his wife, Queen Consort Camilla, and sister, Princess Anne, arrived earlier that day.\n\nPrince Harry, who was due to appear at a charity awards ceremony in London later Thursday, canceled that appearance and was making his way to Scotland separately.\n\nContributing: Maria Puente, Hannah Yasharoff, USA TODAY; Christine Rushton, Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/world/royal-family-line-of-succession/index.html", "title": "The British royal family line of succession explained | CNN", "text": "(CNN) Charles has become Britain's new King following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II , at the age of 96.\n\nThe Queen became the sixth female to ascend to the British throne in February 1952, after the death of her father, King George VI.

And the ascension of King Charles to the British throne promises to have a seismic effect on the roles of other royals orbiting the crown.\n\nSuccession isn't the issue. That’s a simple matter of everyone in line moving up one step as Charles becomes King Charles III. Next up, of course, is his firstborn son, Prince William, and then William’s firstborn son, Prince George. And so on.\n\nInstead, the looming question is what roles and duties will be taken on by royal relatives under a king who has been vocal about scaling back the British monarchy to placate those pushing to reduce taxpayer support for the extended royal family.\n\nBut in scaling back his team to a core group, the king will be walking a tightrope, experts say. While having fewer working royals on the payroll may appeal to republicans, such a skeleton crew may inherently detract from the pomp and circumstance that gives this centuries-old institution its magical appeal.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II dies at 96: Prince Charles takes the throne as king\n\n“We’ll likely be seeing a smaller group representing the crown, and there will be pros and cons to that,” says Carolyn Harris, historian at the University of Toronto and author of “Raising Royalty: 1,000 Years of Royal Parenting.”\n\nOn the con side, Harris foresees less frequent and shorter visits to the 54 Commonwealth countries, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which could lead to those nations debating whether to remove the British monarch as head of state. The Caribbean nation of Barbados already has.\n\nOn the pro side: “There will be a stronger line between who is representing the country and who is simply related to the royal family,” says Harris. “That’s in contrast to Queen Elizabeth, who brought in many cousins to help with tours and events as she oversaw a transition from empire to commonwealth.”\n\n►Royal news right in your inbox:Subscribe to Keep Calm and Carry On, a newsletter answering all of your questions about the royal family following Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nSo who’s in and who’s out?\n\nRoyal watchers agree Charles is not likely to corral extended relatives into the crown’s affairs as his mother did with her cousin the Duke of Kent, most famous for his role handing out trophies to the victors at Wimbledon.\n\nRather, his tapered vision of the monarchy certainly will center on himself and his wife Camilla, who the queen decreed on the 70th anniversary of the accession in February is to be called Queen Consort.\n\nThe world reacts:King Charles III expresses 'greatest sadness' over mother Queen Elizabeth II's death\n\nThe elevation in stature of Camilla – who when she wed Charles in 2005 it was announced she would be Princess Consort – is an acknowledgment of the way she has exercised her duties alongside her husband over the decades. That decorum included taking the title of Duchess of Cornwall, a purposeful avoidance of repeating the Princess of Wales title that had become so associated with the late Princess Diana.\n\nThe other key figures in Charles' tight circle are likely to include Charles’ son William and his wife Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge; and Charles’ sister Princess Anne and his brother Prince Edward, along with his wife Sophie, Countess of Wessex. As for William and Kate’s three children, Prince George, 9, Princess Charlotte, 7, and Prince Louis, 4, they also are likely to play active roles as they get older.\n\nA royal love story: Look back at Prince Philip's 73-year marriage to Queen Elizabeth II\n\nThose not likely to represent the crown include Prince Andrew, Charles’ scandal-ridden brother, and Charles’ son Prince Harry, who famously pulled back from royal duties and lives in California with his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex and their two children.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen if Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, Andrew’s daughters with ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, get called upon, the list isn’t likely to extend much beyond immediate family, says Nicoletta Gullace, associate professor of history at the University of New Hampshire.\n\n“Metaphorically, heads may roll under the new king,” says Gullace, who specializes in British history. She says royals such as Prince Michael of Kent, another of the queen’s cousins on her father’s side, who lives on royal grounds and recently was in the news after being accused of selling access to the Kremlin, “could be out in the cold.”\n\nBut the downside of having just a few royals available for events is “there’s less fairy dust, less majesty,” Gullace adds.\n\nBritish royal family tree:A look at the family tree, spanning four generations\n\nThere’s also the sheer impossibility of a small cadre of trusted royals handling all that is traditionally required of the monarchy. Charles himself will be fully occupied with meetings with foreign leaders and his own prime minister, leaving Camilla and William to take up the slack.\n\nHow to maintain an 'air of majesty'\n\n“Everyone is going to be working hard and walking a fine line in any slimmed-down monarchy,” says Victoria Arbiter, longtime royal watcher and daughter of Elizabeth’s one-time press liaison, Dickie Arbiter.\n\nArbiter says a looming concern is “maintaining an air of majesty” while at the same time addressing issues ranging from politics to climate change. “And if there are only a few people doing all that, it’ll be easy for constituents and nations to feel slighted,” she says.\n\nAnother factor is age. Charles is 73, and his wife is 75. Although Elizabeth and her mother were vibrant into their 90s, it is unknown how active the new monarchy is apt to be. That will place more pressure on younger members of the royal family to be included, says Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine.\n\n“Maybe in the end what the royal family can even be expected to do needs to be streamlined,” he says. “There are only 24 hours in their days.”\n\n'I remain committed to serving you':Queen Elizabeth II's most memorable, poignant quotes\n\nLittle says another critical factor is the difference between when Elizabeth assumed the throne and when her son did: In 1952, the world looked on in awe as a 25-year-old mother of young children suddenly became the sovereign. Charles' rite of passage has been decades in the waiting and happened at a time when the institution itself is being scrutinized like never before.\n\n\"The problem for the monarchy is Charles can never be his mother, and besides this is a much more challenging job for him in these fraught political times,\" says Anna Pasternak, veteran royal observer and author of \"The American Duchess: The Real Wallis Simpson.\"\n\nCharles' ascension plays into the hands of \"today's woke culture that sees him as an older white man of privilege.\" Adding to the troubles facing his reign, she says, is the possibility of more broadsides from Harry and his wife, who leveled charges of racism against royal family members during their TV interview with Oprah Winfrey.\n\nElizabeth was my father's 4th monarch:After Queen Elizabeth II's death, Britain is now facing the unthinkable\n\nThe ideal situation, says Pasternak, would be Charles deciding to abdicate in order for his more popular son and daughter-in-law to take over at a time when the monarchy needs stability and not more controversy. \"He knows he has a limited window in which to prove to a modern world that he has credentials to take the country forward,\" she says.\n\nBut abdication is unlikely, considering Charles' apparent eagerness for the role after waiting so long. There is also the specter of that very traumatic event back in 1936, when the newly crowned King Edward decided mere months into his reign that he wanted to marry divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson and renounced the throne, paving the way for Elizabeth's father to become king.\n\nCharles will have his challenges. The sense that he will be ruling in a potentially crippling time for the House of Windsor is shared by royal watchers.\n\n“There’s still some relevance, but the age of deference is long gone,” says Little. “There was some thought a while ago that the king could rely on his children to help him. But with Harry and Meghan pulling back and moving away, clearly, a rethinking is in order.”\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nIn keeping with a smaller monarchy, royal experts do not expect Charles to dispense titles with abandon. He may choose to bestow some of the late Prince Philip’s titles on his brother Edward to bolster his status when executing royal duties.\n\nBut he is unlikely to offer titles to Harry and Meghan’s young children, given the rift between father and son. “I think it’s doubtful Charles will automatically make any of (Harry and Meghan’s) children princes or princesses,” says Christopher Andersen, author of several royal biographies including \"The Day Diana Died\" and \"William and Kate: A Royal Love Story.\" There is \"simply too much bad blood on both sides.”\n\nAnd even if the gesture were made, Harry and Meghan could well choose to reject it.\n\n“Princess Anne said no thank you when titles were offered to her two children by the queen,” says Arbiter. “Similarly, Harry and Meghan could say ‘No thank you, we’re doing our own thing.’ ”\n\nAnd there's always the Diana factor\n\nCharles’ reign may well last a while, given his family’s good genes. But royal experts say some of the problems he is facing as he assumes the throne would likely have been skirted altogether if – and ultimately when – William became king.\n\nWilliam and his wife are relatively popular and seem to have “more of that majesty about them,” says Gullace. “And they already seem to be grooming their son George to be a future leader.”\n\nAnd then there is the once and future king’s connection to the late Princess Diana, who continues to hold powerful sway over public consciousness, as evidenced by her story’s retelling in both Netflix's “The Crown” and the film “Spencer.”\n\n“Diana respected her mother-in-law and the institution of the monarchy,” says Arbiter, who knew Diana. The Princess of Wales' family had served monarchs for years and she was proud her son would one day be king. \"She was angry with Charles, for sure, but she wouldn’t have wanted to see the monarchy destroyed.”\n\nThat seems to be the challenge looming for the less-than-adored Charles III: keep a storied global institution going so that his popular son can one day ascend the throne. It may prove to be as deft a political feat as any monarch has been asked to pull off.\n\nContributing: Maria Puente", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2022/09/09/sports-world-pays-tribute-queen-elizabeth-ii-after-her-death/8027406001/", "title": "Sports world pays tribute to Queen Elizabeth II after her death", "text": "She wasn't an athlete, coach or owner.

Why?", "text": "By definition, Accession Day – the anniversary of when Queen Elizabeth II became the monarch – is as much a day of mourning as a celebration, because it's also the 70th anniversary of the death of her beloved father, King George VI.\n\nThus, Feb. 6 has traditionally been a low-key affair, one the queen marks by somber reflection in private, usually at Sandringham, her Norfolk estate where the king died in 1952 at age 56 following surgery for lung cancer.\n\nBut this is simultaneously the 70th anniversary of the queen's accession, the longest-ever reign for a British or English monarch, exceeded by only two other European monarchs in history (including Louis XIV of France, who was king for 72 years). It's an important milestone and will be marked with royal hoopla during a four-day Platinum Jubilee beginning June 2, when the weather is (usually) better.\n\n'Queen Camilla' is happening: Queen Elizabeth II says Camilla should be called 'Queen Consort' when Charles becomes king\n\nThe celebrations will include parties, parades, pageants, plantings and puddings – lots of puddings.\n\n\"We will be commemorating an anniversary which is unique in over 1,000 years of monarchy and rarely seen anywhere,\" says British royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams, who says the queen is already at Sandringham and expected to remain there until Feb. 7, as per her custom for more than 30 years. She is staying at Wood Farm, one of the smaller, unpretentious residences on the vast estate, according to the BBC and other British media reports.\n\n\"It isn't palatial; there's no liveried staff,\" says Joe Little, managing editor of Britain's Majesty magazine, a leading expert on all things royal. \"It's a much more relaxed environment, and intimate by royal standards.\"\n\nThe queen, who as sovereign is supreme head of the Church of England, is an authentically devout woman, so it makes sense she would want to mark her official accession in private, leaving most of the ruffles and flourishes for the summer.\n\nDuchess Kate turns 40 with dazzling new birthday photos:A look back at her year\n\nBut the weekend also brought new glimpses of the queen as she hosted a reception at Sandringham and the palace released a new picture of her to mark Accession Day.\n\nSmiling broadly and wearing a pale green dress, she is shown in the Saloon at Sandringham sitting with one of her red despatch boxes full of government papers, a picture of her father by her side. The photo seemed designed to convey her delight at reaching this milestone and her firm promise to keep at her job.\n\n\"As Head of State for seven decades, The Queen has received thousands of red boxes, which contain documents updating Her Majesty on matters of Parliament, the Commonwealth and events around the world, as well as State papers requiring The Queen’s signature and Royal assent,\" the palace said in a statement accompanying the picture.\n\n'The Princess':New Princess Diana documentary aims to 'explore our complicity' in her tragic life, death\n\nOn Saturday, the queen hosted a low-key reception for Norfolk locals and volunteer groups in the ballroom at Sandringham House, where she cut a cake featuring the Platinum Jubilee emblem, Buckingham Palace announced. The pictures show her sticking the knife in the white-frosted confection while holding a walking cane, her ever-present black purse over her arm.\n\nThe invited guests included her fellow members of the Sandringham branch of the Women's Institute (she's been a member since 1943 and president since 2003), Sandringham Estate pensioners and their families and representatives from local charities, the palace said.\n\nThe queen met a former cooking student, Angela Wood, who helped create the original recipe for \"Coronation chicken\" in honor of her coronation in June 1953. A Platinum Jubilee mosaic created by school children from West Norfolk was presented to the queen, along with a posy bouquet that included some of the same flowers that were part of her coronation bouquet.\n\nPhotos and video of her at the reception show her smiling, joking and unmasked, wearing a pale blue dress embroidered with daisies at the waist, pearls and what appeared to be a platinum double flower brooch. When she left, she was bundled up against the cold and carried her cane.\n\nElizabeth climbed into a tree a princess, then climbed down the next day a queen\n\nThere are relatively few Brits alive today who carry her memories of where Elizabeth was and what she was doing when she unknowingly became queen. At the moment of accession, the then-Princess Elizabeth, just 25 and a mother of two young children, was in a remote treetop lodge hotel in Kenya on a brief holiday with Prince Philip before they embarked on a royal tour, standing in for her ailing father.\n\n\"For the first time in the history of the world, a young girl climbed into a tree one day a Princess and after having what she described as her most thrilling experience she climbed down from the tree next day a Queen,\" wrote British hunter Jim Corbett, who was also staying at Treetops at the time and signed the visitors' book, according to the BBC.\n\nCommunications technology in 1952 was primitive by today's standards, but eventually word reached the royal party by circuitous route. Philip took her for a walk at a Kenyan lodge, given to them by the Kenyan government as a wedding present, where he broke the news. Both were shocked, both knew their lives would change utterly, and sooner than they had expected, but she was stoic, according to her biographers and those who were with them at the time.\n\nThey swiftly organized to return to London, she wrote letters of apology to her tour hosts, decided on her reign name – \"My own name, of course, what else?\" she told an inquiring aide – and donned the black mourning dress royals now never go anywhere without.\n\nThe black-and-white photos and films of her arrival at London Airport show her walking down the plane stairs to the tarmac, followed by Philip, to be met by a line of ministers in black, including her father's great friend, Prime Minister Winston Churchill.\n\nTwo days after her father's death, she read her official proclamation as Queen Elizabeth II at St. James's Palace: \"My heart is too full for me to say more to you today than I shall always work, as my father did throughout his reign, to advance the happiness and prosperity of my peoples, spread as they are all the world over.\"\n\nRoyal scandal:Queen removes Prince Andrew's military titles, patronages amid sex abuse lawsuit\n\nAmid royal family drama, the queen's Platinum Jubilee carries on\n\nBut as the British tabloids never tire of reminding, this is a jubilee year, with its share of royal crises and reasons for the queen to grieve. Will all the sound and fury of recent years overshadow the celebrations?\n\n\"Since late 2019, there has been ceaseless bad news,\" Fitzwilliams says. \"The newspapers are, as they always have been, obsessed by royal matters. Add to that the online era, social media and the 24-hour news cycle.\"\n\nBut Fitzwilliams is certain the Platinum Jubilee will be a success.\n\n\"When the spring turns to summer, the celebrations planned are something the country will look forward to and millions will celebrate here, in the Commonwealth and also worldwide,\" he says.\n\nPrevious jubilees were preceded by crises, but usually not ones that distracted from the celebration.\n\nStart with the death last April of Prince Philip, the queen's husband of 73 years, which makes this her first Accession Day without him. Wood Farm is where he spent his last years after retiring from public life in 2017.\n\nMove on to the 95-year-old queen's recent health worries (she will turn 96 in April), the last-minute cancelations of appearances at major engagements, and the fact she's been little seen in public since her Christmas broadcast and during the coronavirus pandemic in general. She's lived mostly at Windsor Castle, forgoing even her annual Christmas holiday at Sandringham in 2021.\n\nThat she was strong enough to travel to Norfolk and spend a few weeks at Wood Farm was seen as a positive sign, Little says.\n\nThen there are the scandals surrounding her nearest and dearest.\n\nPrince Andrew has been benched as a senior royal, stripped of his military and patronage affiliations and ordered not to use the \"His Royal Highness\" style he was born to. It was long-predicted fallout from his former friendship with convicted American sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and a recent civil lawsuit in New York accusing him of participating in Epstein's alleged sex-trafficking of a teen girl.\n\nQueen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee: How the UK will celebrate her unprecedented anniversary\n\nMeanwhile, the queen's grandson Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, gave up their senior royal roles and moved to California, where they have produced another great-grandchild (whom the queen has yet to meet) amid a continuing swirl of recriminations and accusations of racism and bad treatment by the royal family.\n\nMoreover, Harry is preparing to release a royal memoir of his life so far by the end of 2022, which some tabloids warn, with no hard evidence, will be full of more contentious or embarrassing revelations.\n\nPay no attention to doomsayers clutching their pearls, Little advises.\n\n\"Andrew and Harry, they are distractions, but they won’t detract from the importance of the Platinum Jubilee,\" Little says. \"They are blips. Royal life goes in cycles, there are highs and lows, and of late there have been more lows than highs.\"\n\nThe Andrew situation has been ameliorated somewhat by putting \"distance\" between him and the royal family, Little says.\n\n\"The institution of the monarchy has been tarnished,\" Little says. But \"it won’t detract from the star player, although on a personal level it's very distressing for the queen.\" (Andrew has long been seen as the monarch's favorite of her four children.)\n\nCan the monarchy survive Harry and Meghan? Here's how the queen's royal crisis could end\n\nWill the end of Queen Elizabeth's reign be the end of the British monarchy?\n\nNevertheless, Republic, the leading anti-monarchist group, announced in January that it would step up its so-far futile campaign to end the monarchy once the queen dies. This despite polls that continue to show a comfortable majority believe the monarchy should continue, according to the latest YouGov survey in December.\n\n\"Once we're past the end of the queen's reign, all bets are off as to where public opinion is going to go,\" predicted Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, in an interview with Reuters.\n\nLittle quips he doesn't expect to be editor of a magazine renamed \"Republic\" anytime soon. It might be that King Charles III will be king of fewer realms (Barbados just switched to an elected head-of-state), but the monarchy will prevail, certainly in the U.K.\n\n\"I'm not troubled too much by pronouncements by Republic,\" Little says. \"I’m pretty sure the end of (the queen's) reign won’t see the end of the British monarchy.\"\n\n'Christmas can be hard':Queen Elizabeth II gives tribute to Prince Philip in first Christmas without him\n\nThat is the position of Buckingham Palace in planning for the Platinum Jubilee. It will feature many of the same elements of the queen's previous jubilee celebrations, the most recent being the Diamond Jubilee in 2012. It was widely hailed as a huge success, despite Prince Philip's hospitalization during the celebrations.\n\nThat forced the queen to attend the service of thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral without him, giving the nation an early glimpse of what her royal life would look as a widow.\n\nThe Platinum Jubilee bank holiday weekend will feature the annual queen's birthday Trooping the Colour parade; the lighting of jubilee beacons, planting of jubilee trees and hosting of jubilee lunches; a concert and pageant of performers on The Mall; and the service of thanksgiving at St. Paul's.\n\nAlso on the agenda: The 2022 Epsom Derby, which the queen will attend on June 4. It will be the 242rd running of the U.K.'s most prestigious horse race and the only major contest the queen has not yet won. Already, racing fans are expecting one of her horses could win, which would surely be a thrill for the horse fan-in-chief.\n\nBut the tastiest celebration being served up: The Platinum Pudding competition, a nationwide bake-off to find a new creation dedicated to Her Majesty. The queen of British baking, Mary Berry, formerly of \"The Great British Bake Off,\" will be one of the judges of the competition, open to anyone over age 8.\n\nChristmas during COVID: Queen Elizabeth II to skip holiday at Sandringham amid omicron surge", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/09/uk/king-charles-iii-first-national-address-intl/index.html", "title": "King Charles III vows to serve 'with loyalty, respect, and love' in first ...", "text": "(CNN) On the first full day of his reign, King Charles III demonstrated his seriousness in dedicating the rest of his life to public service.\n\nDespite losing his mother Queen Elizabeth II the day before, the King leapt into his new duties; he personally greeted many dozens of members of the public, held an audience with the Prime Minister, and delivered a televised address to the nation.\n\nThe longest-serving heir apparent in British history, Charles was heard telling Prime Minister Liz Truss on Friday that the death of his mother was the moment he had been \"dreading.\"\n\nHis first address as king on Friday -- perhaps the most important of his life so far -- began with a tribute to the Queen.\n\nWearing a black suit and a black tie, Charles said Queen Elizabeth \"made sacrifices for duty, dedication and devotion.\"\n\n\"I pay tribute to my Mother's memory and I honor her life of service,\" the King said. \"I know that her death brings great sadness to so many of you and I share that sense of loss, beyond measure, with you all,\" he added.\n\nSitting behind a desk, with a picture of his mother displayed prominently to his left, Charles promised he would continue in her footsteps and serve his people.\n\nHe gave the speech from the blue drawing room at room at the Buckingham Palace, the same room the Queen Elizabeth used to record some of her many annual Christmas messages over the years. In a nod to her famous love of dogs, a vase on with images of three corgis was placed in the background.\n\nBritain's King Charles III delivers his address to the nation and the Commonwealth from Buckingham Palace, London, Friday, September 9, 2022.\n\n\"As the Queen herself did with such unswerving devotion, I too now solemnly pledge myself, throughout the remaining time God grants me, to uphold the Constitutional principles at the heart of our nation,\" the King said.\n\n\"And wherever you may live in the United Kingdom, or in the Realms and territories across the world, and whatever may be your background or beliefs, I shall endeavor to serve you with loyalty, respect and love, as I have throughout my life,\" he added.\n\nCharles' speech was pre-recorded at Buckingham Palace earlier in the day, after he arrived at the famous London residence from Balmoral Castle in Scotland.\n\nBefore filming the address, Charles and his wife Camilla, now the Queen Consort, took some time to greet members of public who came to the Buckingham Palace to pay their respect to Queen Elizabeth.\n\nAfter shaking hands and accepting words of sympathy ( as well as one kiss ), the King spent some time viewing some of the floral tributes and cards left at the gates of the Palace.\n\nBritain's King Charles III, back to camera, greets well-wishers at Buckingham Palace.\n\nKing Charles III during his first audience with Prime Minister Liz Truss.\n\nWhen he walked inside the palace as King for the first time, the British flag, which was flying half-mast in mourning for the the Queen, was replaced with the Royal Standard, signifying the King was now in residence.\n\nShortly after that, he held his first in-person audience with Truss. British monarchs traditionally hold a weekly audience with Prime Ministers. In a historic moment on Friday, the audience was the first such meetings for both the King and the PM.\n\nThe Queen's last public engagement had been the appointing of Truss on Tuesday. She held weekly meetings with all of the 15 Prime Ministers she appointed during her more than 70 years on the throne.\n\nIn his interactions with the members of public as well as in his speech, Charles revealed some emotion and took time to speak about his family, saying he would rely on them as he takes up the role he spent more than 70 years preparing for.\n\n\"I count on the loving help of my darling wife, Camilla,\" Charles said during the speech, adding that \"in recognition of her own loyal public service since our marriage 17 years ago, she becomes my Queen Consort.\"\n\nThe King also made a significant announcement during his first address, naming his son William to be the Prince of Wales, the title he held before the Queen's death on Thursday.\n\nWhile William was expected to become the new Prince of Wales eventually, it wasn't clear when Charles would decide to grant him the title, which is not automatic. Charles himself was made Prince of Wales in 1958, six years after he became heir apparent. An official investiture ceremony wasn't held until 11 years later.\n\n\"With Catherine beside him, our new Prince and Princess of Wales will, I know, continue to inspire and lead our national conversations, helping to bring the marginal to the center ground where vital help can be given,\" Charles said.\n\nHe also said he wanted to \"express my love for Harry and Meghan as they continue to build their lives overseas.\"\n\nThe fact that the new King took time to mention his younger son and his wife will be seen as significant, given their decision to step away from their royal roles in 2020.\n\nHe ended the speech on a personal note, with another message to the late Queen.\n\n\"To my darling mama, as you begin your last great journey, I want simply to say this: Thank you,\" he said.\n\n\"Thank you for your love and devotion to our family and to the family of nations you have served so diligently all these years.\"", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/10/queen-elizabeths-visits-presidents-often-didnt-go-planned/8027012001/", "title": "Queen Elizabeth's visits with presidents often didn't go as planned", "text": "Queen Elizabeth II met with more U.S. presidents than any other head of state.\n\nThose meetings often got the most attention for their unscripted moments.\n\nThe queen’s sense of humor enabled her to dispense with protocol and overlook presidential faux pas.\n\nWASHINGTON – At the start of her reign, Britain's 25-year-old Queen Elizabeth II got some crucial advice from Winston Churchill: Stay close to the Americans.\n\n“And that’s exactly what she did,” said Anita McBride, a board member of the White House Historical Association and former chief of staff to First Lady Laura Bush.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/10"}]}

But it was the 19-year-old and world No. 4 from Spain who pulled through, 6-7(6), 6-3, 6-1, 6-7(5), 6-3 in four hours, 19 minutes.\n\nAlcaraz will face Norway’s Casper Ruud, the No. 5 seed, in Sunday’s final, and the stakes are high: The winner will rise to No. 1 in the world for the first time.\n\nThe No. 22 seed Tiafoe, 24, was seeking to become the first American grand slam men’s finalist since Andy Roddick at Wimbledon in 2009. Roddick was the last American man to reach the final at the US Open, in 2006, and is the last American man to win a major, which came at the US Open in 2003.\n\n“Too good from Carlos tonight,” Tiafoe told ESPN in front of the crowd. “I gave everything I had. I gave everything I had the last two weeks. Honestly, I came here and wanted to win the US Open. I feel like I let you guys down. This one really hurts. This one really, really hurts.”\n\nAlcaraz is “going to win a lot of grand slams,” Tiafoe told the teen phenom. “You’re a hell of a player, a hell of a person. I’m happy I got to share the court on such a big stage with you. I’m going to come back and I will win this thing one day. I’m sorry, guys.”\n\nAlcaraz celebrates after winning the semifinal match against Tiafoe. Corey Sipkin/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIf Alcaraz wins the final, he will become the youngest world No. 1. Should he ascend to the top, he would tie Carlos Moya, Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras for the biggest jumps to world No. 1 (from No. 4).\n\n“It’s amazing to be able to fight for big things,” Alcaraz said to ESPN in an on-court interview. “First time in a final of a grand slam. I can see the No. 1 in the world, but at the same time, it’s so far away, you know? I have one more to go against a player who plays unbelievable. … I’m going to give everything that I have.”\n\nShould Ruud, 23, win the title, he would make biggest jump to world No. 1 in men’s tennis history. He entered the US Open ranked seventh. He defeated Russian Karen Khachanov, the No. 27 seed, 7-6(5), 6-2, 5-7, 6-2 in the earlier Friday semifinal.\n\n“I think what’s most fair is if we both reach the final and whoever wins the final reaches the world No. 1,” Ruud told reporters as Alcaraz was playing in his semifinal. “That would be I think the ideal situation.”\n\nThis will be Ruud’s second grand slam final appearance, having lost in the French Open final earlier this year to Rafael Nadal. Nadal, who lost to Tiafoe in the round of 16, would have risen to No. 1 in the world if Ruud and Alcaraz had both lost in the US Open semifinals.\n\nThis will be Alcaraz’s first grand slam final.\n\nThis year there were four first-time US Open men’s semifinalists for the first time since the inaugural US Championships in 1881 (William Glyn, Robert Gould Shaw, Edward Gray, Richard Sears). Sears went on to win that title.\n\nTiafoe, here celebrating after defeating Russia's Andrey Rublev in the quarterfinals, had his best grand slam tournament of his career.

Last month, Tiafoe reached a career-high of No. 24 in the world – he’s currently 26th – and this year has shown flashes of the quality that many predicted would take him to the top.\n\nBut make no mistake, given Tiafoe’s disappointing form coming into the US Open, there was no indication that he would make a deep run in New York. However, the big-hitting Washington, D.C. native has mentioned on more than one occasion how the home support on Arthur Ashe has spurred him on to new heights.\n\nIn winning his quarterfinal, Tiafoe became the first Black American man to reach a US Open semifinal since Ashe in 1972.\n\nHis father, Constant Tiafoe, started working at the Junior Tennis Champions Center in Washington back in 1999 and eventually moved into one of its vacant storage rooms while working around the clock.\n\nREAD: How Frances Tiafoe went from sleeping at a tennis center to the US Open semifinals\n\nFrances Tiafoe is appearing in his first grand slam semifinal.

This is crazy. Had the biggest win of my life 24 hours ago. ... That’s huge growth. it’s tough to turn the page,” said Tiafoe, who is seeded 22nd at Flushing Meadows.\n\nThen, looking ahead, and making sure everyone knows this big milestone is not enough to satisfy him, Tiafoe said: “Let’s enjoy this one. We've got two more, guys. We've got two more.”\n\nAndy Roddick was the last U.S. man to get to the semifinals in New York, when he lost to Roger Fededer in the title match 16 years ago.

Tiafoe won 31 of 41 points when he went to the net; Rublev only ventured forward 11 times.\n\nSPORTS NEWSLETTER:Sign up now to get top sports headlines delivered daily\n\nRain drops began falling just before the start of Tiafoe vs. Rublev, so they stood around waiting for the retractable roof to be shut. That resulted in both a cool, wind-free environment and a louder setting, with applause and yells from fans reverberating in what became an indoor arena — circumstances that favored Tiafoe.\n\nThe match featured dominant serving by both — the only break of serve came more than two hours in, when Tiafoe went ahead 4-3 in the third set, then stood mostly motionless on court, enjoying the reaction from the stadium — and the most vital moments were the two tiebreakers.\n\nTiafoe is now 6-0 in tiebreakers at this U.S. Open. He excelled at that stage against Rublev, playing to the spectators and enjoying the crescendos of cheers that mirrored the way he lifted his performance.\n\nRublev actually had the first chance to nose ahead, with a set point at 6-5 in the first, but Tiafoe erased it with a risky forehand to a corner that drew a netted reply.\n\nSeveral minutes later, it was Tiafoe who took the set, sealing it with a 130 mph ace, then strutting to the changeover, nodding and motioning with his racket for more noise. The audience obliged, included Tiafoe’s pal, Washington Wizards All-Star guard Bradley Beal, from his front-row seat.\n\nA similar scene played out in the second tiebreaker after a drop volley by Tiafoe forced a mistake by Rublev to make it 6-0.\n\nWhen Tiafoe produced a backhand return winner to seal a two-set lead, he sprinted to the sideline, sat down near his messy collection of towels, shirts and socks spread out around the ground — call it “college dorm room chic” — and shook his fist amid the delirium of a standing ovation.\n\nTiafoe is definitely a showman. He demonstrated that against Nadal, then again against Rublev, who never tried to hide his anger at the way things were going.\n\nRublev would hit himself in the leg with his racket or punched his strings. Over and over, he gesticulated and yelled toward his guest box, where only four of the 15 seats were occupied, quite a contrast to Tiafoe’s packed section.\n\n“I feel so at home on courts like this,” Tiafoe told the crowd. “You guys get behind me, I want to play my best.”\n\nJessica Pegula eliminated by No. 1 Iga Swiatek\n\nTop-ranked Iga Swiatek has beaten Jessica Pegula 6-3, 7-6 (4) in a women’s quarterfinal match in which both players struggled to hold serve.\n\nThe players combined for 10 breaks, five by each, in 12 games in the second set before the tiebreaker.

We got two more.\"\n\nTiafoe's route into tennis has been in no ways traditional.\n\nTheir father, Constant Tiafoe, started working at the Junior Tennis Champions Center in Washington, D.C. back in 1999 and eventually moved into one of its vacant storage rooms while working around the clock.\n\nHis two boys would sometimes stay with him, sleeping on a massage table, while their mother worked night shifts as a nurse.\n\nThe unusual gateway into the sport gave Tiafoe an opportunity to start developing his skills and, after beginning to train at the facility, he didn't look back.\n\n\"Obviously, I wasn't the wealthy kid or wasn't having all the new stuff or whatever. But I was just living life. I could play tennis for free, the sport I loved,\" he told CNN Sport back in 2015, adding that he wouldn't change his upbringing for the world.\n\nHe was asked Wednesday what message people should draw from his story.\n\n\"I mean, anybody can do it, honestly. Obviously that's a cliché, but I think if you are really passionate about something... Everybody's got a gift,\" he said, adding that his passion and obsession is tennis.\n\nTiafoe and his twin brother Franklin play in a fundraiser tournament in 2014.\n\nDriven by the work ethic of his parents, he won the prestigious Orange Bowl -- one of tennis' most prized junior tournaments -- at 15, becoming the youngest boys' singles champion in the tournament's history.\n\nHe joined a list of previous champions which included Roger Federer, Andy Roddick, Ivan Lendl, Jim Courier, John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg.\n\nIt was a sign of things to come.\n\nMaturing on tour\n\nTiafoe turned professional in 2015 and started getting familiar with the rigors of the senior tour.\n\nHe broke into the world's top 100 and began to assert himself at grand slams -- reaching his first quarterfinal at the Australian Open in 2019 before losing to Nadal.\n\nThree years on and he found himself Wednesday at another quarterfinal as the world No. 26, only this time he felt more ready to grasp the opportunity.\n\n\"Honestly, when I first came on the scene, I wasn't ready for it mentally and mature enough,\" he said on court after beating Nadal. \"I've been able to develop and I have a great team around me.\n\n\"I'm happy I won in front of my mom, my dad, my girlfriend and my team and to have them see what I did.\"\n\nTiafoe reached the Australian Open quarterfinal in 2019 but was beaten by Nadal.\n\nWhile he cements himself as a contender on the court, Tiafoe is also pursuing social justice off it.\n\nIn 2022, he told CNN Sport that the lack of diversity in the sport had made him feel like an \"outsider,\" and he vowed to continue fighting for equality while he still had the platform to do so.\n\nHe created a protest video in 2022 to raise awareness of racial injustices after the death of George Floyd sparked protests across the world.\n\nIn collaboration with a host of Black players and coaches -- such as Serena Williams and Coco Gauff -- he posted the \"Racquets down, hands up\" video to his social media channels.\n\n\"Are we going to help everyone? Of course not, but I'm definitely going to help as many people as I can. That's my duty,\" he told CNN Sport at the time.\n\nJUST WATCHED Frances Tiafoe on racism and protests in the US Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Frances Tiafoe on racism and protests in the US 03:25\n\nOn Wednesday, his coach, Wayne Ferreira, said Tiafoe's story is movie material but he needs to win the US Open or another grand slam event first.\n\n\"You only get movies if you do well,\" he said. \"But his story is very unique, and it's a great story. And he's very humbled. He's a very, very, very nice individual. Very great heart and kind. You've got to love him. He's truly special.\"\n\nMake no mistake, though, this is no overnight success story. It's a product of thousands of hours of work and a mentality that won't take no for an answer.\n\nHowever, while the weight of a nation rests on his shoulders, Tiafoe has always just focused on making his parents proud.\n\n\"With them trying so hard, I felt like I didn't want to let them down,\" he told CNN Sport in 2015. \"I felt like I didn't want to let the opportunities go for granted.\"\n\nTiafoe will now play Carlos Alcaraz for a place in the final after the Spaniard fought through a marathon match against Jannik Sinner, with the encounter finishing just before 3 a.m. local time.\n\nWith Alcaraz expending so much energy, it presents a golden opportunity for the American to continue his run and he will certainly have the support of the home crowd.\n\n\"That stuff gets me emotional, for sure. Seeing people screaming your name, just loving what you're doing. That's awesome. That's what it's all about,\" Tiafoe told reporters after the match.\n\n\"You know, everyone loves a Cinderella story. [I'm] just trying to make one.\"", "authors": ["Ben Church"], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/open/2022/09/09/us-open-semifinals-frances-tiafoe-carlos-alcaraz/8038487001/", "title": "Frances Tiafoe's US Open run may be turning point for American ...", "text": "Frances Tiafoe apologized to the crowd, but he had nothing to apologize for.\n\nHe had just lost a heartbreaking semifinal at the U.S. Open, but he had won the admiration of millions who had never paid much attention or gone out of their way to watch him play tennis.\n\nIn the aftermath of a five-set loss to 19-year-old phenom Carlos Alcaraz after 4 hours, 19 minutes on Friday, Tiafoe vowed to win this tournament one day.\n\nBut maybe that’s beside the point.\n\nIf these last two weeks represent who the 24-year old American can be, the next decade of men’s tennis is going to be really, really fun to watch.\n\nThere shouldn’t be even an ounce of shame for Tiafoe losing an epic (6-7, 6-3, 6-1, 6-7, 6-3) to Alcaraz, who is the best teenage prospect to emerge since Rafael Nadal burst onto the scene in 2005 as an 18-year-old winning the French Open. Tiafoe battled, played with tremendous heart, came up with otherworldly shots and pushed Alcaraz to the brink. It just wasn’t quite enough.\n\nBut the high quality of the match, the entertainment value of these two brilliant players going back and forth under the lights at Arthur Ashe Stadium and the charisma they both displayed made Friday’s semifinal a special event that should give both old tennis fans and recent ones a lot of hope for what the sport can be.\n\n“Obviously I would have loved to win tonight,” Tiafoe said. “But I think tennis won tonight.”\n\nFor the all the concern about what it’s going to look like when Roger Federer, Nadal and Novak Djokovic fade away for good, the beautiful thing about this sport is that there’s always someone else coming and raising the bar for what’s possible. If this is what Grand Slam tennis looks like in the post-Big Three era, the sport is going to be more than fine.\n\nThere is little doubt that Alcaraz, who will play his first Grand Slam final on Sunday against Norway’s Casper Ruud, is going to have a lot of these moments. He is such an overwhelming talent, with an almost unprecedented package of power, touch, fitness and nerve, that Grand Slam titles could very well come in bunches.\n\nThe question is whether this U.S. Open was a moment in time for Tiafoe or the start of something big. Let’s hope it’s the latter, because when Tiafoe is as sharp and dialed in as he was during this tournament, he makes the entire tour more interesting, more relatable and a whole lot more fun.\n\nThis is a guy who brought NBA players like Bradley Beal to their first tennis match and inspired tweets from LeBron James and Patrick Mahomes. He brought former first lady Michelle Obama to the semifinals. His story, picking up the game at a tennis facility where his immigrant father was a custodian, is an inspiration and an example of what’s possible for American tennis if some of this country’s great athletes get the opportunity to play this sport.\n\nThese are all things that tennis needs badly as it transitions away from a two-decade era dominated by Federer, Nadal and Djokovic in the men’s game and Serena Williams on the women’s side. Having an exciting Black American male in the mix for big titles would be a tremendous gift to a sport that sometimes struggles to break through to the masses outside of the four Grand Slams.\n\nBut it will be up to Tiafoe to make that happen. And hopefully he can use this U.S. Open run as inspiration for greater achievements rather than a one-off run that will be hard to replicate in the future.\n\nTruthfully, it’s hard to know which path his career will take. As close as Tiafoe came to playing for a Grand Slam title, the reality is that he’s never come close to a result like this before. As Chris Fowler pointed out on ESPN, the biggest semifinal he had ever played in before Friday was last fall in the Vienna Erste Bank Open.\n\nThat isn’t at all an indictment of Tiafoe’s career. On Monday, he will be a career-high 19th in the world rankings, which is a pretty amazing achievement in any context. But in basketball, football or baseball, being the 19th-best player in the world makes you tens of millions of dollars annually and earns worldwide fame and respect. In tennis, it earns you a nice living without a lot of cultural relevance.\n\nIt is clear from the way he played at this U.S. Open that Tiafoe is capable of more than what he’s shown so far in his career, which had previously seen him make just one Grand Slam quarterfinal (2019 Australian Open) and win one ATP title (2018 Delray Beach). Too often, he's been plagued by inconsistency, lapses of concentration or inability to close out matches he should win. But if Tiafoe can process what happened Friday the right way, a result like this one should be jet fuel for his career.\n\n“I just proved that honestly, I mean, I can play with the best obviously, and I'm capable of winning Grand Slams,” he said.. \"I think everyone knew when I play my best what I could do. But you know how close I can actually be to be one of those guys and to do this consistently. Obviously through my career I've been pretty sporadic of playing well, veering off for a while. I've always backed myself against the best players in the world. I'm doing it on a consistent basis, starting to beat guys more readily. Ready to take the next step.”\n\nThe next step, though, may not necessarily be a Grand Slam title. Tennis is a sport that captures the general public’s imagination four times a year, but the real work is done through the week-in, week-out grind on the tour.\n\nTiafoe showed that his high-end level is good enough to beat Nadal and nearly good enough to be in the U.S. Open final, but the key is building enough winning muscle memory so that a run like this doesn’t seem like a Cinderella story.\n\nWith Alcaraz surviving three consecutive five-set matches and Tiafoe breaking through to his first Slam semifinal, this U.S. Open felt like the first time tennis went mainstream outside of the Big Three. If he can capitalize on this remarkable run and continue to produce that high level play, Tiafoe has a big role in making sure it stays that way.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2019/01/21/the-latest-li-closely-follows-osakas-progress-in-australia/38935115/", "title": "The Latest: Tiafoe jokes about Laver, 'Don't fall asleep!'", "text": "AP\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — The Latest on Tuesday at the Australian Open (all times local):\n\n12:15 a.m.\n\nFrances Tiafoe's first Grand Slam quarterfinal did not go as well as he would have hoped, but one of the highlights was the chance to play in Rod Laver Arena — with Laver himself sitting in the stands.\n\nTiafoe said he looked over at the only man to twice complete a calendar-year Grand Slam and \"saw the eyes close at one point.\" And so this, then, is what went through the 21-year-old American's mind: \"Don't fall asleep on me!\"\n\n\"I was about ready to say something,\" Tiafoe joked after his loss to Rafael Nadal. \"You know what I'm saying?\"\n\nStill, Tiafoe continued, \"It was cool that (Laver) was out there.

That's what I appreciate and admire about him.\"\n\n___\n\n6:45 p.m.\n\nDanielle Collins is into a Grand Slam semifinal for the first time after coming back to overpower Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 2-6, 7-5, 6-1 at the Australian Open.\n\nThe 25-year-old American had been 0-5 in Grand Slam matches before coming to this tournament, and now is on a five-match winning streak, including victories over three seeded players.\n\nShe reached the quarterfinals by upsetting three-time major winner and No. 2-seeded Angelique Kerber, the 2016 Australian titlist, 6-0, 6-2.\n\nPavlyuchenkova's experience of reaching the quarters at all four majors helped her early as she broke in the second game of the match, which lasted more than 15 minutes and went deuce 11 times.\n\nBut the longer the match went, the more settled Collins became.\n\nAfter breaking Pavlyuchenkova's serve to take the second set, she conceded just three points in the third as she raced to a 5-0 lead.\n\nThe Russian held serve and then saved two match points in the last game before hitting a forehand service return long.\n\nCollins will next play either two-time Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova or Australia's Ash Barty.\n\n___\n\n4 p.m.\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas is the youngest man to reach a Grand Slam semifinal since 2007 after beating Roberto Bautista Agut 7-5, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (2) at the Australian Open to follow up on his stunning upset of Roger Federer.\n\nTsitsipas is the first player from Greece to reach the semifinals of a Grand Slam, and at 20 years, 168 days, is the youngest man to make the semifinals at a major since Novak Djokovic at the 2007 U.S. Open. He's the youngest man to do so in Australia since Andy Roddick in 2003.\n\nThe No. 14-seeded Tsitsipas will play either 17-time major winner Rafael Nadal or first-time quarterfinalist Frances Tiafoe.\n\n\"I'm just living the dream,\" said Tsitsipas, who had beaten six-time Australian Open winner Federer in the fourth round.\n\nThe No. 22-seeded Bautista Agut advanced the hard way, spending more than 14 hours on court through his first four rounds.

She also won the Australian Open in 2014 after losing two previous finals here.\n\n\"When I first saw Naomi Osaka play, I thought she was really calm, very mature on court.

Tsitsipas can take all the long bathroom breaks he wants from home. The controversial Greek tennis player faced an unfriendly crowd again in large part because of his lengthy breaks in the bathroom.\n\nAlcaraz easily pulled off the biggest win of his career and is in the fourth round at Flushing Meadows for the first time in his career. He was down 5-2 in the third set but kept pushing in a match that stretched past four hours.\n\nAlcaraz thanked the crowd, absent last year because of the pandemic, for “pushing me up in the fifth set.” He became the breakout start of the U.S. Open and had fans chanting “Carlos!

He liked America so much on his maiden trip, van de Zandschulp was in no rush to head back to the Netherlands.\n\nHe's found a home in Flushing Meadows.\n\nVan de Zandschulp has emerged as the surprise of the U.S. Open, and the qualifier continued his out-of-nowhere run, beating No. 11 Diego Schwartzman 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 5-7, 6-1 on Sunday at Louis Armstrong Stadium.\n\nVan de Zandschulp was part of a trio of U.S. Open qualifiers that reached the fourth round for the first time since the tournament began keeping qualifying records in 1982. He joined Nicolas Escude (1999) and Gilles Muller (2008) as just the third men’s qualifier to reach the quarterfinals since the Open era began in 1968.\n\n“It’s amazing that I beat No. 11 here, especially in a match like this,” he said. “For me, it was the first time in the big stadium. The crowd was amazing here.”\n\nBefore the U.S. Open, the ninth-year pro had only five tour-level wins, was never ranked higher than 117 in the world and had never advanced past the second round in a Grand Slam tournament.\n\nLook at him now, his U.S. Open streak an unqualified success for the little-known qualifier.\n\nVan de Zandschulp should enjoy the run while he can. His next match is against No. 2 Daniil Medvedev, who cruised into the U.S. Open quarterfinals with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 win over Daniel Evans on Sunday.\n\n“A lot of, I would say surprises, maybe even more than in other slams,” Medvedev said.\n\nThe 25-year-old van de Zandschulp had already knocked out No. 8 seed Casper Ruud in the second round. He also dropped the first set in each of his first three U.S. Open matches before reversing the trend against Schwartzman.\n\n“I think in the end, I deserved to win,” van de Zandschulp said.\n\n____\n\nFAN FAVORITES\n\nFrances Tiafoe ripped off his shirt after a victory last week that ended just shy of 2:15 a.m. and said credit went not to his 69 winners, but to the late night/early morning fans that went wild on every set won.\n\n“You guys stuck with me all the way through,” he said. “You all did it.”\n\nThe American repeated a familiar refrain uttered by every underdog -- and there have been a handful of upset winners -- headed into the second week of the U.S. Open.\n\nThe biggest assist this Open is from the fans.\n\nA year after fans were banned because of the pandemic, the familiar roars have risen from Arthur Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium, from the opening sets of the day to the ones that stretch past a reasonable bedtime.\n\nAmerican wild-card entry Jenson Brooksby, after upsetting 21st-seeded Aslan Karatsev in five sets, knew how to play to the crowd.\n\n“Crowd played a big role, definitely. Them chanting, cheering me on, it gave me a lot of energy to come back, down two sets to one,” he said. “It was a rough couple sets. Whether it was just my group, even friends I had here, the whole crowd in general with the full stadium, it was great to see them behind me. I really enjoyed that. Definitely helped get some energy in me to come back.”\n\nPerhaps fueled by the joy of being allowed back in the grandstands after a year’s absence, or maybe two or three $20 Honey Deuce cocktails, Flushing Meadows was full of energy again.\n\nUrged on by a raucous crowd, Shelby Rogers said fans were “probably the reason I won tonight” in her three-set win Saturday night over top-seeded Ash Barty.\n\n“I just think the energy that they brought and sheer will and passion that they were providing there in the stadium last night was truly incredible,” Rogers said Sunday. “I think sometimes when you’re in an empty stadium or on the back court, you know, midnight, it’s tough to kind of muster up some of this courage yourself, so it’s always helpful to have other people cheer you on and encourage you.”\n\nSpectators must show proof of at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine to attend matches. The U.S. Open topped 60,000 fans in total attendance on Friday and Saturday. The night session had 25,465 fans on Friday and 25,360 fans on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2019/01/22/australian-open-rafael-nadal-ends-american-frances-tiafoes-run/2642543002/", "title": "Australian Open: Rafael Nadal ends American Frances Tiafoe's run", "text": "Sandra Harwitt\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nMELBOURNE — The Australian Open has been a career-builder for Frances Tiafoe, who celebrated his 21st birthday on the same day he became a Grand Slam quarterfinalist.\n\nTwo days later, Tiafoe’s fabulous Australian Open story came to a conclusion with his continued inability to conquer a top five-ranked player.\n\nNevertheless, considering the talent and desire he showed throughout his stay in Melbourne, it seems safe to expect it’s only a matter of time before he will be challenging for his own top spot in the rankings.\n\nSecond seed Rafael Nadal was Tiafoe’s fifth shot at upsetting this level of player, but he couldn’t prevent the Spanish sensation from taking his place in the semifinals with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 win.\n\nNadal will be competing in his 30th Grand Slam semifinal when he faces 14th-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas, a 20-year-old in his first Grand Slam semifinal after defeating Nadal’s countryman, 22nd-ranked Roberto Bautista Agut 7-5, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (2) earlier Tuesday.\n\n“A few days ago I said they can wait a little bit,” said Nadal, laughing, about these young upstarts trying to infiltrate the top of the game. “But it looks today like they don’t want to wait; Frances in the quarterfinals, Stefanos now in the semifinals.”\n\nMore:Surprising American former college player reaches Australian Open semis\n\nThe men’s ATP is making a conscientious effort to highlight the younger talent on the tour, referring to them as the Next Gen players. The tour has had a separate Next Gen year-end final the past two years with Tsitsipas winning the trophy over Australian Alex De Minaur, while Tiafoe didn’t advance out of the round-robin stage.\n\n“It's just nice to be a part of this group,” Tiafoe said of his Next Gen distinction. “We're definitely paying attention to each other. We don't want to do worse than the other person. Kind of pissed that Tsitsipas is in and I'm not. It is kind of what it is.\n\n“I think the game's definitely heading that way (in the Next Gen direction). Rafa and these cats ain't getting any younger, you know what I'm saying?”\n\nTiafoe's biggest mistake in the match was giving the 17-time Grand Slam champion an immediate advantage in all three sets. Tiafoe surrendered his first service game in each set and could never recover.\n\n“When you're playing a guy that good, you can't even get some holding pressure on him, it's tough,” Tiafoe said. “Again, it was tough. My body was definitely hurting. I'm more or less happy to be done.”\n\nNadal extended his winning streak against American opponents at the Grand Slams to a 21 matches. He last fell to an American at the 2005 US Open, where James Blake won their third-round encounter. Overall, Nadal has a 25-2 record when playing an American at one of the four majors.\n\nNadal closed down his 2018 season when he abandoned his semifinal match against Juan Martin del Potro in the second set at the US Open with a right knee injury. In November, he had minor surgery on his right ankle. And as recently as this month Nadal withdrew from the Brisbane tournament to nurse a thigh strain.\n\nBut Nadal is playing top-flight tennis at this Australian Open, where has moved through to the semifinals without dropping a set.\n\nThis marks the 16th time in Nadal’s career that he reached a major quarterfinal without the loss of a set, and sixth time at the Australian Open. He’s now reached a Grand Slam semifinal in straight sets on 11 occasions, including in 2008 annd ’09 here at Melbourne Park.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2017/07/04/the-latest-finally-gulbis-gets-1st-win-in-more-than-a-year/103408340/", "title": "The Latest: 19-year-old Tiafoe loving it at Wimbledon"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2021/09/05/the-latest-fernandez-aims-for-2nd-straight-open-upset/118563444/", "title": "The Latest: No. 2 Medvedev cruises into US Open quarters", "text": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — The Latest on the U.S. Open tennis tournament (all times local):\n\n__\n\n3:50 p.m\n\nNo. 2 seed Daniil Medvedev cruised into the U.S. Open quarterfinals with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 win over Daniel Evans at Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nMedvedev next plays Botic van de Zandschulp, the third unseeded player he would face at Flushing Meadows.

Granted it's still there, but it looks more like a capsule.\n\nThis capsule can change shapes in a feature called the Dynamic Island.

The Apple Watch Ultra starts at $799.

In dense conditions such as areas with high skyscrapers or tall trees, the watch has special technology to maintain accurate GPS results. The watch's action button allows for more precise workouts, and a new feature will automatically detect when you hit a running track.\n\nApple said it's built for extreme temperatures. There's also a redesigned Compass app with better views of your locations and ways to mark key points. Plus there's an 86-decibel siren built into the watch in case of emergency.\n\nApple Watch Ultra unveiled\n\nOne of the first big rumors confirmed: the Apple Watch Ultra.

It will be available in silver, midnight and starlight colors. It boasts most of the safety features of the main Apple Watch. The display is 30% larger of the Series 3 watch, and it's 20$ faster than the previous SE model. It will also support crash detection.\n\nApple clearly is pitching this as a great model for kids. It starts at $249 or $299 or a cellular model. Preorders open Sept. 9, and the watch launches Sept. 16.\n\nApple Watch Series 8 starts at $399, or $499 with cellular\n\nThe watch will launch in multiple colors and styles, including midnight, starlight and product red for the aluminum models, and silver, gold or graphite for stainless steel models.

It's available to preorder Sept. 9, and launches Sept. 16.\n\nApple Watch adds low power mode\n\nThe Apple Watch will get a low power mode to minimize battery-intensive features and add up to 36 hours of battery life. It's available for the Watch Series 4 or later through the WatchOS 9 update.\n\nApple Watch Series 8 Crash Detection\n\nThe new watch will add a feature that detects when you're in a severe car crash. Once detected, the watch automatically contacts emergency responders, sends off your location, then reaches out to emergency contacts. New tech can sense the force and timing of an impact to determine whether you've been involved in a front- or side-impact crash, a rear-end crash or a rollover.\n\nApple Watch Series 8 confirmed\n\nThe new Apple Watch Series 8 announced by COO Jeff Williams features a brighter, always-on display. It's also swim-proof and crack-resistant. Health sensors in the watch still include the ability to read blood oxygen levels and ECGs.\n\nThere's a new temperature sensor as part of advanced cycle tracking features for women's health. The sensor will provide an estimate of ovulation, as well as check nighttime wrist temperature to detect changes as small as 0.1 degrees Celsius. Apple notes all health data is encrypted end to end, controlled only by users.\n\nApple Watch as lifesaver\n\nBefore detailing changes to Apple Watch, the company plays a montage featuring users of the Watch and how it has impacted their lives. Most discuss the various health scenarios including falls and rapid heartbeats. In some cases, users dialed 911 to contact rescuers or family to seek help to save their lives.\n\nAll iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook begins the event, saying it will focus on three products: iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch. \"Together, they provide a magical experience,\" said Cook.\n\nSubscribe to your iPhone?\n\nOne hot rumor that could clear up after Wednesday's event: does Apple have plans to introduce a subscription option for iPhone? Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported Apple was working on a subscription service for the iPhone and other products, so much like Netflix, Apple TV+ or other monthly services, you would subscribe to your iPhone for a monthly fee.\n\nHow excited are iPhone owners for a new model?\n\nAbout 14% of iPhone owners plan to upgrade to the latest iPhone when it releases, says a survey from website Savings.com. By comparison, only 10% of iPhone owners had planned to switch to iPhone 13 when it launched last year.\n\nAmong participants who said they planned to upgrade, the feature they're most excited about is improved, faster processors, followed by better storage and an upgraded camera.\n\nThe online survey conducted last month is based on 1,504 iPhone users in the U.S. ages 18 and older.\n\niOS 16 release: When can we expect it?\n\nEven if you don't buy an iPhone 14, you can enjoy the illusion of getting a new phone with the arrival of iOS 16.\n\nThis year's iOS offers some pretty key features, including the ability to unsend messages or edit them after they're sent. Once someone has sent a message in the Messages app, they have 15 minutes to edit or unsend it. Important caveat: Both the sender and receiver of the messages must have iOS 16 installed to take advantage of the feature.\n\niPhone owners also can customize their lock screens with new fonts and smaller widgets similar to what's available on Apple Watch.\n\nApple confirmed following its event iOS 16 will launch on Sept. 12.\n\nHow will iPhone 14 affect older phone prices?\n\nWhile the arrival of a new iPhone and its features is a big deal, just as important is how will the new device affect how Apple prices all its older models.\n\nThe price of the iPhone should go up, especially for Pro models that will have better chip performance, said Thomas Husson, principal analyst at Forrester. With inflation rising and supply chain issues lingering, the pricing of older iPhones will be critical.\n\n\"The key point to look at is how Apple will evolve the pricing of the iPhone 13 and older ranges to maintain growth in a declining smartphone market and to keep the momentum in faster growing markets like India or Indonesia,\" said Husson.\n\nApple store: 'Be right back'\n\nAs is tradition ahead of an Apple event, the company's online store is down. \"Be right back,\" reads the message. \"We're making updates to the Apple store. Check back soon.\" Of course, you didn't want to buy an iPhone today any way.\n\nWhat time is Apple event?\n\nThe event starts at 1 p.m. ET, or 10 a.m. PT if you're on the West Coast.\n\nHow to watch Apple event live\n\nIf you want to watch it yourself, Apple will stream both on its website and through the Apple TV app. It will also stream on Apple's official YouTube channel.\n\nWhat products can we expect from Apple event?\n\niPhone 14. Obviously. Reports suggest the new phone will receive a big camera upgrade and an always-on display. No more waking your phone to check the time. The question is how many models? Last year, consumers chose between iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max.\n\nApple Watch Pro. The new smartwatch will have a bigger display and titanium casing, reports Bloomberg. It will also have a larger battery, said the report.\n\nAirPods Pro 2. An updated version of Apple's high-end earbuds are also anticipated, reports Bloomberg.\n\nWho is keynote speaker of Apple event?\n\nThink of Apple CEO Tim Cook as a ringmaster of the Apple event circus.\n\nCook guides viewers through the myriad of device updates across its portfolio, as other Apple executives and employees break down how these new gadgets will change your life.\n\nAnd don't be surprised if Cook thinks iPhone 14 is the best iPhone ever.\n\nWhen will the iPhone 14 go for sale?\n\nApple will reveal this Wednesday. But if history offers any clues, last year Apple launched iPhone preorders the Friday after the event, with phones officially going for sale the week after. If Apple follows this pattern, expect preorders to open Sept. 9 with the new iPhones going on sale Sept. 16.\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/09/14/apple-event-iphone-13-apple-watch/8320963002/", "title": "iPhone 13 Pro: Apple unveils new phone, iPad, iPad Mini and Watch 7", "text": "Apple fans finally got their first look at iPhone 13.\n\nOn Tuesday, Apple introduced the next version of its popular smartphone, one of several device announcements made during a virtual event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California.\n\nAmong the other devices unveiled Tuesday: a revamped budget iPad, an updated version of its iPad Mini, and the new Apple Watch Series 7 with a bigger display.\n\nThe iPhone 13 will arrive in four models: a standard version with a 6.1-inch display, a Mini model, plus Pro and Pro Max models with larger screens and better battery life.\n\nAll four devices will be available to preorder on Friday and launch in stores on Sept. 24. The iPhone 13 will start at $699 for the Mini model, all the way up to the iPhone 13 Pro Max at $1,099.\n\n►Don't miss a moment:Huge innovations to how-tos, follow the latest tech news with the Talking Tech newsletter\n\n\"Our customers rely on iPhone every day, which is why we’ve made iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini more powerful, more capable, and more fun to use,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, in a statement.\n\nThis year's release features several subtle upgrades to the iPhone, which will remain popular due to \"pent up demand\" for a new Apple phone, said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives.\n\nAbout 250 million of the 975 million iPhones already sold have not been upgraded in more than 3.5 years, said Ives.\n\n►Do you own an iPhone or iPad? Update your Apple devices right now.\n\n►History of the iPhone:How Apple's signature smartphone has changed over the years\n\niPhone 13 features\n\nThe iPhone 13 will be available in five colors: red, starlight (a whiteish shade), midnight (a blackish shade), blue and pink. The two camera lenses on the back of the smartphone have been placed diagonally.\n\nAlong with the typical upgrades to processing speed, display and battery life, the iPhone 13 adds a Cinematic Mode, which uses an automatic focus to shift between subjects in a video, similar to Portrait Mode for photos.\n\nThe new phone also means the arrival of iOS 15, which will launch as a free software update on Sept. 20. It will include updates to FaceTime, a Live Text feature where users can search text within images, and a Focus mode to manage your notifications.\n\nA new Apple Watch\n\nIt wasn't just the iPhone enjoying the attention at Apple's event. The tech giant also unveiled Apple Watch Series 7, with a larger display and redesigned look to provide more of a wraparound effect.\n\nDigital buttons on the watch face appear bigger to make them easier to tap, such as trying to find snooze on an alarm. The watch will also include new faces to leverage the size of the display.\n\nThe Apple Watch uses the extra screen area to add a predictive text keyboard, so users can quickly type messages by dragging their fingers across the appropriate letters or they can do it the old-fashioned way letter by letter.\n\nApple says the updated watch boasts an 18-hour battery life and charges 33% faster than the Series 6. It's available in multiple colors including midnight, starlight, green and red.\n\nThe Series 7 will start at $399 and launches later this fall.\n\nTwo new iPads, including a revamped Mini\n\nApple also rolled out updates to its iPad line, with new versions of its entry-level model starting at $329 and an overhauled iPad Mini starting at $499.\n\nApple says the new iPad Mini, which will feature an 8.3-inch touchscreen, will perform 80% faster than the previous model. The tablet, available Sept. 24, will include an upgrade to its cameras, support for the second-generation Apple Pencil, and support for 5G wireless networks.\n\nThe entry-level iPad will retain the same design and price but feature more storage starting at 64GB, and add a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with support for Center Stage, a feature on iPad Pro models which can automatically detect and follow who's on screen. It's available on Sept. 24.\n\nScroll down for live updates of Tuesday's Apple event:\n\nWhich iPhone to choose?\n\nHere's a quick rundown of all the iPhones Apple will have available, with iPhone 13 on the list, and its starting price:\n\niPhone SE: $399\n\niPhone 11: $499\n\niPhone 12: $599\n\niPhone 13: $699\n\niPhone 13 Pro: $999\n\nThe iPhone 13 Pro is not cheap\n\nBigger phone, bigger screens, bigger battery life and a bigger price tag. The iPhone 13 Pro starts at $999, and the Pro Max starts at $1,099. There's also a storage option for the Pro at 1 terabyte. You can preorder all four new iPhones starting Friday. They reach stores Sept. 24.\n\nA big camera update for iPhone 13 Pro\n\nThe camera features a brand new telephoto lens, Ultra-wide and wide lenses. Low light photos will look brighter and sharper, optical zoom will get a boost, while the system will allow for macro photography to get detailed closeups on objects. The smartphones will also feature Night Mode for taking pictures without proper lighting conditions.\n\nUsers can also personalize their cameras with photographic styles. You can use default templates like rich contrast or vibrant warm, altering the tone and warmth on a photo to create the specific style you want.\n\nApple showcased how the cameras work by putting them in the hands of directors including Kathryn Bigelow. And here I am wasting all this on my dog (but still worth it).\n\nAs for battery life, the 13 Pros last 1.5 hours longer than the iPhone 12 Pro and 2.5 hours longer than the iPhone 12 Pro Max.\n\nThere's an iPhone 13 Pro model, too\n\nAnd of course, here comes the info on the Pro model of iPhone 13.\n\nThe Pro comes in four finishes: graphite, gold, silver and sierra blue. They seem to feature a more metallic look compared to the standard models. There's still the three-camera system on the back of the phone as well.\n\nThere's also going to be an iPhone 13 Pro Max, for the Apple fans who love their big screens. Apple said it has the fastest graphics processing of any smartphone, ideal if you enjoy games on your phone.\n\nThe Pro models will have a new Super Retina XDR display, as well as ProMotion, which offers really high refresh rates and adapts depending on the activity. Translation: Scrolling and swiping through your phone will feel more fluid.\n\nThe Pro will have a 6.1-inch screen and Pro Max will have a 6.7-inch screen.\n\nThe iPhone 13 will start at $799\n\nThe iPhone 13 Mini will start at $699 while the iPhone 13 will start at $799. The tech giant is also increasing the storage capability, starting with 128 GB of storage, which is pretty impressive. Both phones top off at 512 GB.\n\nAlso interesting to note Apple hasn't said anything about a Pro or Plus model with a larger screen.\n\nHow's iPhone 13 battery life?\n\nThe big question I have, as well as every other curious smartphone owner, is how long will the battery run? It runs between 1.5-2 hours longer than last year's phones.\n\nThere's a smart data mode that will automatically shift your phone from 5G to LTE to help conserve battery life.\n\nWhat is Cinematic Mode?\n\nAs expected, the iPhone 13 is adding a new mode called Cinematic Mode, which is essentially a version of Portrait Mode for use in videos.\n\nThe feature is capable of highlighting and framing the key elements in a video clip, from people or objects in the background to those who are closer to the camera.\n\nThe mode will anticipate when the focus of the clip changes. Apple said they studied cinematography used in filmmaking to help design the mode. The mode will shoot in Dolby Vision HDR as well.\n\nThe iPhone 13 has arrived\n\nTime for the star of the show, the next iPhone. Cook just unveiled the iPhone 13.\n\nIt has a flat-edged design just like the iPhone 12, and a diagonal arrangement for the dual-camera system in the back. It will be available in five colors.\n\nApple is also bringing back the iPhone Mini model. The display is 28% brighter than last year's phones. The display also boasts improved power efficiency. The standard iPhone 13 has a 6.1-inch screen, while the Mini has a 5.4-inch screen.\n\nThe next iPhone has a brand new chip (shocker) called A15. So, big surprise, it's going to run faster and better than your old iPhone.\n\nApple says the new chip has 50% faster processing than its competition and 30% faster graphics processing.\n\nApple Fitness+ gets an update, too\n\nThe fitness app available for Apple Watch will launch in 15 more countries and include additional types of experiences such as pilates and guided meditation. There are also workouts to help users get ready for snow season activities such as skiing or snowboarding.\n\nThe Fitness+ app will also add Group Workouts using the upcoming SharePlay feature for FaceTime launching on iOS 15. It can support up to 32 people at the same time.\n\nApple Watch Series 7 is here at $399\n\nNext up is the Apple Watch, the company's popular wearable. It will add new features specific to biking, including support for e-bikes and fall detection.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 7 will boast a new display with 20% more screen area than last year's model. The shape has also been tweaked to feature softer, more rounded corners to create a more seamless wraparound effect. It's also 70% brighter indoors.\n\nButtons of the watch have been made larger to make them easier to find (especially if you're half asleep trying to hit snooze on an alarm). There's also a keyboard on the Apple Watch. Finally. It also has several watch faces aimed at leveraging the additional screen space.\n\nThe Apple Watch is water-resistant and is the first model with dust resistance. It also boasts an 18-hour battery life and charges 33% faster than the Series 6.\n\nIt's available in multiple colors including midnight, starlight, green and product red. Watchbands also feature a fresh variety of colors, too.\n\nThe Series 7 will start at $399. It's available later this fall. Meanwhile, the budget Series 3 will stay at $199, while the Apple Watch SE starts at $279.\n\nThe iPad Mini returns at $499\n\nCook said \"its littlest iPad\" is getting its biggest upgrade ever. It's available in four colors: purple, pink, starlight and space grey. It also boasts an 8.3-inch liquid retina display.\n\nThe top button will also double as a way to use Touch ID option as well. It's 40% faster and 80% faster with graphics processing. So, yeah, it's going to be really fast.\n\nThe iPad Mini features a USB-C port, similar to iPad Air, which they say will result in 10 times faster data transfers, and support third-party devices that also use USB-C. It will also feature 5G.\n\nThe new mini-tablet will also record in 4K and the same camera as the upgraded entry-level iPad, which means it will also support Center Stage.\n\nIt will support the second-generation Apple Pencil, and will have its own line of super -hin Smart Folio cases.\n\nThe iPad Mini starts at $499, available in both Wi-Fi and cellular models. It's available for preorder Tuesday, and launches next week.\n\nApple unveils new iPad at $329\n\nApple plans to roll out a new version of its low-cost iPad model. Apple says the new model will provide 20% faster computer and graphics processing, as well as a stronger neural engine to make services such as Live Text operate more quickly.\n\nThe front-facing camera is now a 12MP Ultra Wide camera and features Center Stage, which makes video calls more engaging by automatically detecting people. It's currently available on Pro models of iPad.\n\nIt maintains a similar design, which allows it to support most third-party peripherals such as the first-generation Apple Pencil and keyboards.\n\nThe iPad will also stick with the same price at $329 but will add 64GB of storage to start, a major upgrade. It will launch next week.\n\nNew shows on Apple TV\n\nCook introduces the audience to new series coming this fall to the tech giant's streaming TV service. Several big names popping up, including Jon Stewart, a new season of The Morning Show starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston coming this month, and the science-fiction show called \"Invasion,\" a show called \"The Shrink Next Door\" starring Paul Rudd and Will Ferrell.\n\nThe Apple event has started\n\nWe've officially begun with a musical interlude that appears to take place across different parts of California, performing the song \"California Soul.\"\n\nTim Cook now jumps on stage to sing the praises of California. \"We're proud to call California our home,\" he said.\n\nWhere can I watch the Apple event?\n\nAlong with streaming the event on Apple's website, you can also watch it through YouTube.\n\nRemember, you can also stay on this page and follow the latest news once the event begins at 1 p.m. EDT.\n\nApple Store: 'Be right back'\n\nAs expected prior to any Apple event, the company's online store is down since we're going to see new products later Tuesday.\n\n\"Be right back,\" reads the message on Apple's store. \"We're making updates to the Apple store. Check back soon.\"\n\nA new Apple Watch and AirPods, too?\n\nApple typically doesn't only talk iPhone when it hosts (physically or virtually) its September events. We're likely going to see a new version of the Apple Watch as well. According to Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman, the upgraded Apple Watch Series 7 will sport a new design, larger screens and a faster processor.\n\nMeanwhile, 9to5Mac reports Apple could also introduce a fresh version of its AirPods. The last time Apple rolled out new AirPods was in 2019, said the report.\n\nBeware the iPhone 13 scams\n\nAs buzz rises over the likely unveiling of the iPhone 13, so too are the number of scams linked to Apple's event. Research firm Kaspersky said they have seen intensified scamming activity ahead of the event.\n\nThe schemes often involve fake offers such as snagging the next iPhone before release or getting other deals on products like AirPods. People who sign up never get the device, and hackers get a hold of their personal information.\n\n“Apple presentations have always been a popular lure for scammers to roll out malicious activity,” said Tatyana Shcherbakova, security expert at Kaspersky, in a statement. “For several years now, we’ve seen how fraudsters use the buzz around new iPhone release and start spreading malicious features.\"\n\nAmong tips Kaspersky offers to protect yourself: Verify messages are from reliable sources, don't click on links in suspicious emails, and be skeptical about offers that appear too good to be true.\n\nEpic ruling: Changes for the App Store?\n\nIt's likely Apple will address the recent decision in Epic Game's lawsuit filed against the iPhone maker. On Friday, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ordered Apple to let developers use payment options beyond the App Store, which would circumvent Apple's 30% commission on most app transactions.\n\nEpic Games has said it is appealing the judge's decision rejecting Epic's allegations that Apple ran a monopoly.\n\nBy mid-December, Apple must build a framework that would allow developers to steer payments outside of the App Store and Apple's iOS, said Gene Munster, a managing partner with Loup Ventures.\n\nBut \"it won't be until next year that developers can do steering A/B testing,\" Munster said on Twitter. \" Apple will probably make further changes in the next 5 years, which will collectively yield an App Store that is a favorable asset from an investor's standpoint.\"\n\n– Mike Snider\n\n'Pent up demand' for a new iPhone\n\nIn advance of today's event, Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives laid out a synopsis of Apple's position, noting that the company \"remains in the midst of its strongest overall product cycle in roughly a decade.\"\n\nThe new line of iPhones, expected to be called the iPhone 13, will be the second model to include 5G wireless connectivity. Apple appears to be boosting production of the new phones beyond that of the iPhone 12, Ives said. His analysis suggests Apple's initial production of about 90 million units surpasses that of the initial iPhone 12 production of 80 million.\n\nThe reasoning? \"This 5G driven product cycle will extend into 2022 and should also benefit from a post-vaccine consumer 'reopening environment,' Ives said.\n\nBeyond that, there is \"pent up demand\" for new iPhones among current customers because about 250 million of the 975 million iPhones already sold have not been upgraded in more than 3.5 years, he said.\n\nThe new wave of iPhones is expected to include \"an eye-popping 1 terabyte storage option,\" twice the highest storage capacity in the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max, Ives expects.\n\n– Mike Snider\n\n►iOS 15 is arriving soon:Here's what we know about the iPhone's upcoming update\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/tech/apple-event-iphones/index.html", "title": "Apple expected to unveil new iPhones at 'far out' event on ...", "text": "(CNN) Apple customers could soon get a look at the next generation of iPhones.\n\nApple sent out press invites on Wednesday for an event on September 7, where the company is widely expected to unveil the new iPhone 14 lineup.\n\nThe company's invite, which is always closely scrutinized for hidden meanings, features the night sky in the shape of the Apple logo and the tag line: \"Far out.\"\n\nThe event is set to be broadcast on Apple's website from Apple Park, the company's headquarters in Cupertino, California.

Essentially, it's a leaderless, mainly online phenomenon, driven by a heavy emphasis on specific memes, iconography and in-jokes. Central to the movement is an anti-federal government ideology, an anticipation of a second civil war and an obsession with firearms. And despite Facebook's vow to remove references to the group more than two years ago, accounts, pages and groups connected to the \"Boogaloo Bois\" are resurfacing.

One man described how he was skating on a frozen river when the ice gave out. Another survived a plane crash in a remote area in the middle of winter. And a high school student escaped a bear encounter.\n\nAnother example from the event focused on a 27-year old high school teacher went to the emergency room after her Apple Watch detected an abnormally high heart rate. According to the teacher, \"My doctor said, 'It was your watch that saved your life.\"\n\nApple has long presented its products as tools for creativity, productivity and a positive, if aspirational, lifestyle filled with friends and family, healthy habits and outdoor activities.

The company positioned many of its products and features as safety nets in a shaky world.\n\nApple announced new car-crash detection technology on both the Apple Watch and iPhone which it says can determine the \"precise moment of impact\" using the device's barometer, GPS and microphone. \"We truly hope you never need it, but feel a little bit safer every time you get into a car,\" said Ron Huang, Apple's vice president of sensing and connectivity, during the announcement.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Analysis Samantha Murphy Kelly", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/08/29/apples-sent-out-invitations-its-big-iphone-launch-event/2151982001/", "title": "Apple confirms the date of its next big iPhone event: Sept. 10", "text": "After months of speculation surrounding the official date, Apple sent out an invitation to its annual iPhone event on Thursday, confirming that the product unveiling ceremony will take place on Sept. 10 at the company’s headquarters in Cupertino, California.\n\nThe tech giant's invitation didn't explicitly detail which products will debut; however, Apple is likely to unveil its next-generation smartphone, possibly dubbed iPhone 11, at the event which starts at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time.\n\n\"Please join us for an Apple special event,\" the invitation reads.

Donors were told all of the money raised would go toward the construction project – but the federal indictment in that case alleged that Bannon and his co-defendants secretly siphoned off donations.

The Korean electronics giant is expected to unveil a new Galaxy smartphone on Sept. 4 in Berlin. The source was not authorized to disclose the event prematurely.\n\nSamsung had no comment.\n\nSince its first iPhone made its debut in 2007, Apple has faced an endless parade of smartphones running Google's Android software intended for consumers. Wall Street and Apple enthusiasts have been waiting for the company to wow them with a completely new gizmo such as a rumored iWatch smartwatch or iPhones in different sizes and colors.\n\nAll Things D first reported on the Apple event. USA TODAY confirmed the report.\n\n\"We don't comment on rumors,\" Apple spokeswoman Natalie Kerris said.\n\nApple's next iPhone release is expected to touch off a wave of buying that could serve as a catalyst for the stock ahead of the holiday season. That's something Apple could use to improve its stature after store sales came in flat in Apple's most recent earnings period.\n\n\"With a new iPhone and revamped iOS coming out later this year, Apple is well-positioned to recapture market share,\" IDC analyst Ramon Llamas says.\n\nStill, Samsung's attack of smartphones in varying sizes and features is hard to keep pace with, and Samsung is expected to steal Apple's iPhone thunder by beating it to the punch with a new Galaxy smartphone in early September, said a source familiar with its plans.\n\nSamsung took 30.4% of the worldwide smartphone market compared with Apple's 13.1% position in the second quarter, according to researcher IDC. Apple held 16.6% of the market a year ago.\n\nAt the same time, smartphones from LG, Lenovo and ZTE have made market inroads, especially in the Asia Pacific region, where Apple is seen as less price competitive. Apple CEO Tim Cook has made repeated visits to China Mobile's headquarters in a bid for that market.\n\nGoogle, meanwhile, stepped up its smartphone attack with the Moto X this month.\n\nApple will likely come out with processor and camera advances for its next iPhone. Numerous unconfirmed press reports say it may come up with a fingerprint sensor. That latter move would put to work its acquisition of biometric specialist AuthenTec and allow a one-touch log-in by way of fingerprint-scanning technology.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether Apple will move to a larger screen size and offer a cheaper version of the iPhone.\n\nThe radical changes underscore what lengths Apple will go to in order to head off a pack of competitors.\n\nBrett Molina contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/08/22/apple-event-pro-iphones-and-new-ipads-expected-report-says/2082513001/", "title": "Apple event: Pro iPhones and new iPads expected, report says", "text": "Apple is reportedly planning to introduce three new iPhones, as well as updated iPads and MacBook Pros at its annual event next month.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, citing \"people familiar with the situation,\" Apple will unveil two \"Pro\" models to succeed the iPhone XS and XS Max, released last year.

The cameras will also boast improvements in resolution and in snapping pics in low-light environments, Bloomberg reports.\n\nOther features expected in the new iPhones are improved water resistance, updated screens, and a charging system allowing users to power up their wireless AirPods by leaving them on top of the phone while inside the case, the report said.\n\niPhone 11:Here's what we know about new phones, expected release date\n\nBut that's not all: Apple is also planning to unveil new iPads as well as an updated MacBook Pro with a screen measuring more than 16 inches diagonally, Bloomberg reports.\n\nApple has yet to reveal when it plans to host its September event, where it typically reveals details on its next iPhone and other products.

He then shifted to launch his new food company, Eat the Change, with chef Spike Mendelsohn.\n\nHonest Tea founder introduces new brand: Just Ice Tea\n\nWhile the almost 24 years of Honest Tea may be coming to an end, Goldman says, the brand's mission will live on in his next tea venture: Just Ice Tea, which comes from much of the same team that was behind Honest Tea.\n\nEat the Change decided to start Just Ice Tea on June 6, two weeks after Coca-Cola said it would discontinue Honest Tea.

Goldman said every ingredient in the new brand will be Fair Trade-certified, for example.\n\nThe name \"Just Ice Tea\" also sounds like \"justice,\" Goldman notes – following the \"honesty\"-inspired Honest Tea.\n\n\"Just Ice Tea is really picking up where Honest Tea left off. ...

Sauter, Evan Comen, Thomas C. Frohlich and Samuel Stebbins\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nSome product launches can be spectacular failures, and Google Glass, an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted device with smartphone capabilities, failed in such a manner several years ago. It was meant to be the first piece of technology to connect the typical consumer to augmented reality.\n\nGoogle continues to attempt to find a place for the product, but its original launch was a definitive failure. In 2017, the internet giant announced the relaunch of the device to target to businesses rather than the general public, but whatever happens, it will be adopted by a meaningfully narrower audience.\n\nJust like success, failure is part of doing business. Entrepreneurs and large companies often take big risks, hoping for success but not always achieving it.\n\nThese failures take many different forms. When a product doesn’t sell, when it is recalled or discontinued, or when it otherwise does not come close to meeting a company’s expectations or plans, it can be marked as a failure. While failures are expected, some can be so catastrophic they can lead to permanent damage to a company’s reputation, layoffs, and even complete financial ruin.\n\nSometimes, it can take years, or even decades for a product flop to disappear from the market. This was the case with Betamax a video format which Sony introduced, expecting it to replace VHS. Despite being technologically superior to VHS, Betamax lost market share until it eventually vanished.\n\n24/7 Wall Street reviewed some of the greatest product launch blunders throughout history. Today, these product flops exist as case studies companies use to avoid future failure. They range from Ford’s Edsel in 1958 to 2016’s Galaxy Note 7. Many of these products led to losses in the hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions. In tech, film, the internet, the pharmaceutical industry, and more, these are the biggest product flops of all time.\n\nMore: Population migration patterns: US cities Americans are abandoning\n\n1. Google Glass\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Wearable technology\n\nGoogle first announced Google Glass -- an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted display with smartphone capabilities -- to the public in 2012. The announcement began with a statement of principle: “We think technology should work for you -- to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don’t.” After two years of disappointing sales, it was clear consumers did not need Google Glass. Google stuck to its principle, and in 2015 discontinued the product’s development. Privacy concerns, reported bugs, low battery life, bans from public spaces, and an inability to live up to the hype all stymied public adoption of the technology.\n\n2. The Newton\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1993\n\n1993 What it was: Personal digital assistant\n\nWhile the personal digital assistant would become a popular consumer electronics product in the late 1990s, the first PDA was one of the biggest product flops of all time. One year after Apple CEO John Sculley coined the term “PDA” in 1992, the company released the Newton MessagePad. While the device incorporated innovative technology such as a pen-based touch screen and the ability to sync with software on a personal computer, Apple sold only 50,000 units of the product in its first four months on the market. The Newton product line was discontinued in 1998.\n\nMore: Budweiser, Coors Light, Bud Light top list of best-selling beers in America\n\n3. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\nCompany: Atari\n\nAtari Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Video game\n\nSeveral video games have failed over the years, but arguably none as spectacularly as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The video game was created/developed shortly after the release of Steven Spielberg’s classic film. With only five weeks spent in development -- games typically take months, if not years, to program -- the game was notoriously difficult and sold miserably. Atari spent $21 million to purchase the rights to the franchise and $5 million on promotion of the game. The company made 4 million copies of the game, but sold only 1.5 million. Atari buried the leftover copies in a landfill.\n\n4. Satisfries\n\nCompany: Burger King\n\nBurger King Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: French fries\n\nIn 2013, Burger King introduced a new menu item advertised as a healthy alternative to their traditional french fries. Satisfries used a less porous batter, which caused the fry to absorb less oil than regular fries during cooking. While Satisfries were made with a healthier recipe, Burger King failed to convey the difference to customers. The fries were also more expensive than Burger King’s regular french fries, and failed to gain traction with consumers. The company discontinued the fries in 2014, less than a year after they were introduced.\n\n5. Premier smokeless cigarettes\n\nCompany: RJ Reynolds\n\nRJ Reynolds Year introduced: 1988\n\n1988 What it was: Cigarette\n\nR.J. Reynolds, the second largest U.S. tobacco company, began marketing in 1988 a smokeless tobacco product that was intended to be a safer way to use a cigarette. In addition to concerns over the product's actual safety, smokers missed the familiar elements of traditional cigarettes -- the smoke, the burn, and the flick. Another issue was the widely-reported unpleasant chemical taste, which one user described as resembling “burning plastic.” Reynolds sunk close to $1 billion into the product before pulling it off the market within a year.\n\n6. Cheetos Lip Balm\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 2005\n\n2005 What it was: Lip balm\n\nPopular lip balm brands such as Chapstick, Blistex, and Burt’s Bees, have successfully sold their products to Americans for decades. Many prefer such flavored varieties as cherry, mint, and vanilla bean. Not every popular flavor can be successfully turned into a lip balm, however, a lesson PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay learned the hard way in 2005. While Cheetos has been a popular snack for more than six decades, Cheetos-flavored lip balm failed to catch on with consumers.\n\n7. Terra Nova\n\nCompany: Fox\n\nFox Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: TV show\n\nEvery year, TV shows are cancelled before the end of their first season. While Terra Nova, which aired for one 13-episode season, is not unusual in this regard, it may go down as the most costly cancelled television show of all time. Documenting the time-traveling adventures of a 22nd century family fleeing a dystopian society for a prehistoric past, the pilot of the show alone cost Fox between $16 and $20 million to make. Terra Nova encountered numerous production mishaps while filming in Australia, including a flood that nearly killed a crew member. Ratings failed to meet expectations, and the show was not renewed for a second season. Fox is estimated to have spent more than $50 million on the failed show, not including marketing costs.\n\n8. Touch of Yogurt shampoo\n\nCompany: Clairol\n\nClairol Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: Shampoo\n\nIn keeping with the 1970s trend of incorporating natural food ingredients like lemon, herbs, and honey into beauty and hygiene products, Clairol -- at the time a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb -- thought a yogurt shampoo was just what the American consumer wanted. It turned out the company had grossly miscalculated. Many consumers were apparently confused as to what they had bought, as there were reported cases of people eating the shampoo.\n\nMore: Jeep, Disney, Coca-Cola top survey list of America’s most patriotic brands\n\n9. New Coke\n\nCompany: Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola Year introduced: 1985\n\n1985 What it was: Soft drink\n\nOver the 15 years leading up to 1985, Coca-Cola’s flagship cola drink had been losing market share to Pepsi Cola. To compete, the company changed the drink’s formula for the first time in 99 years -- but the move today is considered one of the greatest flops of all time. New Coke was met with public outrage and lasted only a few months. The company reintroduced its older formula, rebranded as Coca-Cola Classic.\n\n10. Windows Vista\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2007\n\n2007 What it was: Operating system\n\nIntroduced in 2007 as a follow-up to Windows XP, the Windows Vista operating system was everything its popular predecessor was not -- in all the wrong ways. Panned by customers and IT professionals alike, Vista reduced PC performance and caused a number of internet problems for users. As a result, Dell began offering Windows XP again on new laptops a few short months after Vista was introduced. Windows announced this month that it would no longer provide support for Vista, driving the final nail into the operating system’s coffin.\n\n11. Kitchen Entrees\n\nCompany: Colgate\n\nColgate Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Frozen meal\n\nMany of the worst product flops in recent memory were caused by otherwise popular brands wandering too far outside of their area of expertise. Colgate Kitchen Entrees may be the best example of such a product failure. When it came to pre-prepared frozen meals, Americans had plenty of options in the 1980s. Perhaps because consumers naturally associated the Colgate name with toothpaste, there was never much of an appetite for pre-made meals bearing the Colgate logo.\n\n12. Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water\n\nCompany: Coors\n\nCoors Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Sparkling water\n\nCoors and Coors Light are two of the most popular beers in the United States. Introducing Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water to the public in 1990, the Coors Brewing Company also sought to capitalize on the fast-growing bottled water segment in the United States. The water was Coors' first non-alcoholic product since Prohibition. The Coors brand name did not help to sell the product, however, as the beer-name branding may have confused or even frightened consumers. Coors let its trademark of Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water expire in 1997.\n\n13. Harley Davidson perfume\n\nCompany: Harley Davidson\n\nHarley Davidson Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Perfume\n\nHarley Davidson is one of the most iconic and valuable brands in the world. It is also one of the most masculine brands. The company has not deviated considerably from this manly personality, although it has tried. The company released Legendary Harley-Davidson, a cologne for men, among several other varieties, starting in 1994. Another perfume, Black Fire, hit the market as recently as 2005. All are now discontinued. In the 1990s, the company released a number of other products, including wine coolers and aftershave, which after failing miserably have also become classic cases of brand overextension.\n\n14. Persil Power\n\nHolding company: Unilever\n\nUnilever Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Stain remover\n\nUnilever introduced Persil Power detergent to the market in 1994. The product utilized a newly patented stain removal formula called Accelerator. The company was so confident in the Accelerator catalyst that it carried out its $300 million introduction of Persil Power without any formal test marketing. Over time, it became clear the detergent was damaging clothes at high temperatures. After nine months on the shelves, the company replaced Persil Power with Persil New Generation, a detergent without the Accelerator compound.\n\n15. Cosmopolitan yogurt\n\nCompany: Cosmopolitan\n\nCosmopolitan Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Yogurt\n\nCosmopolitan is a popular women’s magazine, full of fashion advice, dating tips, celebrity gossip, and horoscopes. What the magazine’s leadership was thinking when they expanded the brand’s reach from the magazine aisle to the dairy aisle remains a mystery. Few will likely remember the 1999 debut of Cosmopolitan’s yogurt line, as the short-lived product was only available for 18 months. Like many other products on this list, Cosmopolitan yogurt was a case of a brand reaching too far beyond its area of expertise.\n\n16. DH 106 Comet\n\nCompany: De Havilland\n\nDe Havilland Year introduced: 1949\n\n1949 What it was: Airplane\n\nWe now take jet travel for granted, but the development of a commercially viable jetliner involved a great deal of trial, error, and some utter failures. De Havilland, a British aircraft manufacturer, developed the Comet, the first commercial jet airliner. Unfortunately, within a few years of its 1949 debut, the Comet encountered several unexplained fatal crashes, including planes overrunning the runway and one exploding in midair. The Comet's reputation plummeted, and while De Havilland scrambled to redesign the plane, American companies Douglas and Boeing took over the industry.\n\nMore: Which manufacturers are bringing the most jobs back to America?\n\n17. DeLorean DMC-12\n\nCompany: Delorean Motor Company\n\nDelorean Motor Company Year introduced: 1981\n\n1981 What it was: Sports car\n\nIn 1973, auto executive John DeLorean left General Motors to form the DeLorean Motor Company. After years of production delays, the DeLorean DMC-12 was released in January 1981. The car’s unique design was poorly received, however, and by 1982 less than half of the 7,000 DeLorean units produced had been sold. The DeLorean is widely recognized due to its use as a converted time machine in the “Back to the Future” series. However, the first of these films was released in 1985, far too late to save the ill-fated brand. DeLorean filed for bankruptcy in 1982.\n\n18. EZ Squirt\n\nCompany: Heinz\n\nHeinz Year released: 2000\n\n2000 Company revenue when released: Ketchup\n\nBefore EZ Squirt, ketchup was always varying shades of red. To cater to kids, who were -- and still are -- among ketchup’s largest groups of consumers, Heinz began producing purple, green, and blue EZ Squirt ketchup in matching, vibrantly colored squeeze bottles. At first, the colorful ketchup was a huge success. The novelty wore off quickly, however, and not long after its introduction, sales of EZ Squirt began to decline. In January 2006, less than six years after its debut, Heinz halted production of the product.\n\n19. United States Football League\n\nCompany: USFL\n\nUSFL Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Sports league\n\nConceived as a way to satiate America's appetite for football in the spring and summer months, the United States Football League was introduced in 1982. The league originally consisted of 12 teams, one of which, the New Jersey Generals, was owned by President Donald Trump. The league was beset with problems, not the least of which was finding stadiums to play in. Ultimately, over half a dozen teams folded when the league’s brain trust decided to compete directly with the NFL by scheduling games in the fall. By 1985, the league was finished.\n\n20. Home\n\nCompany: Facebook\n\nFacebook Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Mobile phone app\n\nWith rising mobile phone use and social media engagement, Facebook in 2013 decided to launch a family of apps that combine these trends. Facebook Home converts the home screen of a smartphone into the Facebook news feed. While most of Facebook’s over 1 billion users log in to their accounts on a smartphone, the social media giant’s new product never caught on. Early users cited clunky operation, the inability to toggle between Facebook Home and the original phone interface, and lack of options for customization, among other snags.\n\n21. Edsel\n\nCompany: Ford\n\nFord Year introduced: 1957\n\n1957 What it was: Car\n\nFord spent a year aggressively marketing the Edsel -- named after Henry Ford’s son -- ahead of its 1957 release. It was to be the “car of the future,” made available on dealership lots on what Ford dubbed “E-Day.\" Despite the hype, the car was a commercial disaster. It was considerably overpriced, disappointingly not futuristic, and generally ugly. Ford ceased the car's production after only two years, losing an estimated $350 million.\n\n22. Friendster\n\nCompany: Friendster\n\nFriendster Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Social media site\n\nSocial media site Facebook is one of the biggest corporate success stories in recent memory. Unfortunately, when it comes to social media, for every success story there is at least one flop -- as in the case of Friendster. The site’s users suffered through slow page loading times and the company’s developers failed to scale up when the number of subscribers spiked. Ultimately, competitors such as Facebook provided a much better user experience. Introduced in 2002, Friendster discontinued its services in mid-2015.\n\n23. WOW! Chips\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Snack\n\nPepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay introduced its line of WOW! Chips in 1998. The chips, which were made with the fat substitute olestra, were marketed as a healthy snacking alternative. While WOW! Chips were an initial success with $347 million in sales in their first year -- the most of any new product in 1998 -- sales slowed when the unpleasant side effects of olestra, such as diarrhea and cramps, became better known. To add to the product’s problems, the Food and Drug Administration instituted labeling requirements for all products containing olestra to carry warnings of “abdominal cramping and loose stools,\" and by 2000, sales of WOW! Chips were roughly 60% of what they were in the year of their release.\n\nMore: Per capita government spending: How much does your state spend on you?\n\n24. Zune\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: MP3 player\n\nIn an attempt to compete with Apple's dominant iPod MP3 player, Microsoft released the Zune in 2006. As of November 15, 2015, Microsoft discontinued all streaming, downloading, and other music services for the Zune. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Microsoft recorded a 42% decline in revenue in its non-gaming devices segment -- a decline largely attributable to the Zune’s poor performance. While the device might have been a reasonable choice for consumers, a number of reported bugs did not help sales. On December 31, 2008, most if not all 30GB Zunes stopped functioning simply because the underlying code had failed to account for the extra day in leap years.\n\n25. Relenza\n\nCompany: GlaxoSmithKline\n\nGlaxoSmithKline Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Influenza pandemic drug\n\nIn 1999, a flu pandemic fear caused by the spread of avian flu created demand for antiviral medications. The FDA approved two flu drugs during the pandemic -- Tamiflu and Relenza. The former went on to report massive sales, while the latter became one of the worst product flops in the pharmaceutical industry. The powder form of the drug caused respiratory problems in some patients and was only approved as a treatment for influenza rather than a preventative measure. GlaxoSmithKline sold just $13 million worth of the drug in the first quarter of 2006. By comparison, Roche reported $770 million in Tamiflu sales in the first half of the year.\n\n26. Google+\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Social media site\n\nNo all product flops are necessarily discontinued. Sometimes, despite failing to live up to company expectations, they linger. Such is the case with Google+, the social media platform the Silicon Valley giant launched in 2011 to compete with Facebook. However, even with a monumental marketing campaign, Google+ failed to distinguish itself from Facebook and never took off in the same manner. While the site experienced an initial surge in subscribers, by April 2015, Google+ had experienced a 98% decline in user engagement. Today, Google+ has some active user groups and is often used to share photos.\n\n27. HP Touchpad\n\nCompany: Hewlett-Packard\n\nHewlett-Packard Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Tablet computer\n\nThe TouchPad was Hewlett Packard’s attempt to compete with Apple’s wildly successful iPad. Hewlett Packard unveiled the device in the middle of 2011 with an extremely costly advertising campaign. The rollout incorporated numerous celebrity contracts. By late summer, however, box stores such as Best Buy were sitting on excess inventory, and HP began offering steep discounts. Many discounted TouchPads were sold at a loss, and it is estimated the company lost hundreds of millions on the product in all.\n\n28. Kellogg's Breakfast Mates\n\nCompany: Kellogg's\n\nKellogg's Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Breakfast food\n\nIn 1998, Kellogg’s introduced Breakfast Mates, an all-in-one package containing a serving of cereal, a small carton of milk, and a plastic spoon. The product was designed as a time saver that would appeal busy families with two working parents. The stated convenience of the all-in-one packaging did little to save time, largely because traditional cereal is already relatively convenient to consume. In a controlled test reported by The New York Times, preparing a bowl of cereal the traditional way took only one second longer than preparing a bowl of Breakfast Mates. To make matters worse, the product’s $30 million ad campaign sent a mixed message, depicting a family eating the supposedly portable cereal around the kitchen table. In August 1999, Kellogg’s announced Breakfast Mates would be discontinued due to low sales.\n\n29. Maxwell House Brewed Coffee\n\nCompany: Maxwell House\n\nMaxwell House Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Coffee\n\nMaxwell House Brewed Coffee was pre-brewed coffee sold in a carton with a picture of a hot mug of coffee on the packaging, a misleading visual cue for a product meant to be stored in the refrigerator. Adding to the product’s issues, the carton was lined with foil and could not be microwaved. For a product marketed for its convenience, this was an especially problematic feature for consumers. The product was discontinued shortly after it was released.\n\n30. Arch Deluxe\n\nCompany: McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's Year introduced: 1996\n\n1996 What it was: Hamburger\n\nMcDonald’s introduced several failed products throughout its 60-year history, but none so monumental as the Arch Deluxe. Introduced in 1996, the Arch Deluxe was marketed as a more gastronomic hamburger with “a grown-up taste.\" One commercial featured a child unable to enjoy the sophisticated burger, stripping its toppings to satisfy his unrefined palate. The Arch Deluxe’s advertising budget was an estimated $200 million, the most of any fast food product at the time. However, the approach failed and sales of the Arch Deluxe missed the $1 billion expectation set for its first year. The Arch Deluxe was eventually discontinued.\n\nMore: Wage potential: Highest paying jobs you can get without a college degree\n\n31. HD DVD\n\nCompany: Toshiba\n\nToshiba Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nBlu-ray’s succession of the DVD was not preordained. Before Blu-ray was the dominant medium for video playback, it was competing with Toshiba’s HD DVD. Essentially the same product, HD DVD was effectively taken out to pasture when in January 2008, Warner Bros. announced it would only support Sony’s Blu-ray format. Toshiba was not the only loser in the battle against Blu-ray. Millions of Americans found themselves stuck with HD DVD players and laptops after the dust settled.\n\n32. Microsoft Bob\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: User interface\n\nMicrosoft released Microsoft Bob in March 1995. Intended as a simple, easy-to-use OS interface at the time, Bob presented the desktop as a house, with familiar objects corresponding with different computer applications. Clicking on the stationary lying on a desk, for example, opened the word processor. Despite its simple appearance, Bob required more processing power than most home computers had in 1995. Bob was also considered too expensive and poorly designed, and was overshadowed by the release of Windows 95 later that year. Bob was discontinued roughly a year after its release.\n\n33. 47 Ronin\n\nCompany: Universal Pictures\n\nUniversal Pictures Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Movie\n\nThe 2013 fantasy action film “47 Ronin”, starring Keanu Reeves, is now notorious as one of the biggest box office flops of all time. The movie lost nearly $150 million on a $225 million budget and left Universal Pictures in the red for the fiscal year. Insiders point to multiple rewrites of the screenplay as well as several post-production changes that were made as filmmakers and studio executives attempted to find creative balance while appeasing moviegoers. In the end, the film failed to strike a chord with audiences and critics alike.\n\n34. Qwikster\n\nCompany: Netflix\n\nNetflix Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: DVD rental service\n\nBefore Netflix became the media streaming giant we know today, it was exclusively a deliver-by-mail DVD rental service. In an ill conceived of strategy, CEO Reed Hastings announced in September 2011 the company's plan to spin off its DVD rental service into a separate company, known as Qwikster. The move, which was meant to allow Netflix to focus more on its streaming services, would have cost consumers about 60% more if they wished to continue to have access to both services. Unpopular with customers and widely criticized, Hastings scrapped the plan less than a month after it was announced.\n\n35. Virtual Boy\n\nCompany: Nintendo\n\nNintendo Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Portable game console\n\nVirtual Boy was game console maker Nintendo’s early foray into virtual reality technology. However, the company discontinued the portable console less than a year after its 1995 release, selling just 770,000 units globally. It is known as one of the company’s worst failures. To cut costs and reduce battery drain, Nintendo used only black and red shades in Virtual Boy games, which bothered some users. Using the Virtual Boy also caused eye strain in some users, which led Nintendo to include an automatic shutoff mechanism.\n\n36. MeeGo\n\nCompany: Nokia/Intel\n\nNokia/Intel Year introduced: 2010\n\n2010 What it was: Operating system\n\nUnlike Windows Vista, another operating system on this list, smartphone OS MeeGo was not necessarily a flawed product. By most accounts, the MeeGo operating system just came at the wrong time. Not long after its introduction, the operating system was dropped by then Nokia CEO Stephen Elop in favor of Windows Phone 7 operating system. Though it has not been used in years, MeeGo may find a second life as a tablet operating system.\n\n37. Crystal Pepsi\n\nCompany: Pepsi\n\nPepsi Year introduced: 1992\n\n1992 What it was: Soda\n\nCrystal Pepsi was introduced to soda lovers across the United States in 1992. The product tasted like regular cola but was clear and caffeine free in an attempt to convey purity and heath. Crystal Pepsi was heavily promoted, with the company even buying an ad slot during Super Bowl XXVII. Despite strong initial sales, the public’s interest quickly waned and the soda was discontinued less than two years after its release.\n\n38. Hot Wheels and Barbie computers\n\nCompany: Mattel / Patriot Computers\n\nMattel / Patriot Computers Year released: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Toy computer\n\nIn 1999, Mattel announced that it had entered a licensing agreement to sell Barbie and Hot Wheels computers. The computers would be manufactured and sold by the Patriot Computer Corporation, a privately held company based in Toronto. The move was part of an attempt to reconcile the declining sales of Barbie dolls and growing sales of software and CD-ROMs.\n\nThe computers, however, had many manufacturing flaws, and the resources Patriot devoted to fixing and replacing broken computers drove it out of business. By December the following year, the company had fired its 200 employees and filed for bankruptcy.\n\nMore: How much did a personal computer cost the year you were born?\n\n39. LaserDisc\n\nCompany: Phillips\n\nPhillips Year introduced: 1978\n\n1978 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nLaserDisc was effectively a precursor to the DVD, offering consumers a higher quality picture and sound than VHS tapes. The product’s numerous drawbacks, however, outweighed any benefits. Unlike VHS players, LaserDisc players could not record television shows -- an important feature before the days of TiVo. LaserDisc players, as well as LaserDiscs themselves, were also relatively expensive. Introduced in the 1970s, LaserDisc made a brief comeback in the 90s, but ultimately failed to gain traction.\n\n40. Dreamcast\n\nCompany: Sega\n\nSega Year introduced: 1999 (North America)\n\n1999 (North America) What it was: Game console\n\nIn the 1990s, Sega was a dominant player in the consoles and games business. Sega had such success with its Sonic the Hedgehog games and Genesis console, that at one point the company held 60% of the North American market. The Dreamcast launched in 1999 in North America, within a few years of successful predecessors like the Nintendo 64 and Sony Playstation. Many consider the Dreamcast to have been ahead of its time -- it was the first console to introduce worldwide network compatibility -- but the system just never caught on. Dreamcast sold miserably and was discontinued after just over two years, in part due to the success of the PS2, which launched in 2000. While it was not Sega’s only failure, it may have been its most colossal, marking the end of the company’s attempts at game consoles.\n\n41. S&W Mountain Bikes\n\nCompany: Smith & Wesson\n\nSmith & Wesson Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Mountain bike\n\nGun manufacturer Smith & Wesson has been making police bicycles for about 20 years. The company also attempted to sell mountain bikes to the general public in 2002. Like many other products on this list, the company’s consumer bike segment likely failed because bicycles were too far beyond the scope of the Smith & Wesson brand and what most Americans associate with it.\n\n42. Lisa\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1983\n\n1983 What it was: Personal computer\n\nBefore Apple hit its stride in the 2000s and became the most profitable corporation in history, the company was responsible for some of the worst product flops of all time. Designed as a high-end personal computer with a graphical user interface for business customers, the Apple Lisa took three years and $50 million to develop before its release in 1983. However, the computer’s $9,995 price tag, which is equivalent to roughly $25,000 today, was too high for many consumers. After selling just 100,000 units in two years Apple discontinued the Lisa in 1985.\n\n43. Betamax\n\nCompany: Sony\n\nSony Year introduced: 1975\n\n1975 What it was: Video cassette format\n\nIn the early 1970s, videotapes were still a novel technology, and the VHS tape had yet to become the standard video cassette format. Sony introduced the Betamax format in 1975, one year before JVC introduced the VHS tape. While Betamax tapes had superior resolution and sound quality, Sony refrained from licensing its technology to other manufacturers, in turn limiting the variety of movies available on the format. Meanwhile, JVC licensed its VHS technology to any interested manufacturer. The Betamax’s share of the VCR market fell from 100% in 1975 to 10% in 1988, and continued to dwindle in the following years.\n\n44. Too Human\n\nCompany: Silicon Knights\n\nSilicon Knights Year introduced: 2008\n\n2008 What it was: Video game\n\nReleased in 2008 after years of costly development delays, “Too Human” failed to live up to expectation and became one of the worst flops in video game history. A legal ruling eventually removed the game from the marketplace and pushed Silicon Knights, the game’s developer, into bankruptcy. The game’s production budget skyrocketed to an estimated $100 million after the game engine developer, Epic Games, failed to deliver the engine on time, forcing Silicon Knights to build it own game engine. When Silicon Knights sued Epic Games for missing the deadline, the latter counter-sued, which resulted in a court order forcing the developer to destroy all unsold copies of the game.\n\nMore: Are these the worst cities to live in?

Mobile ESPN\n\nCompany: ESPN\n\nESPN Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Mobile phone service\n\nIn 2006, ESPN attempted to capitalize on the desire of sports fan to have access to sports stats, scores, and video on the go. Mobile ESPN required users to buy a specific phone, which would include access to ESPN content as part of the subscription. However, the only phone Mobile ESPN offered, a Sanyo, cost $400, and the service was $40 per month, too rich for many sports fans. The service shut down within a year. Disney, ESPN’s parent company, spent $150 million on the failed venture.\n\n46. Life Savers soda\n\nCompany: Life Savers\n\nLife Savers Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Soft drink\n\nThough Life Savers soda tested well in focus groups, it failed to gain traction with the broader consumer market. Many attribute the soft drink’s failure to the prevailing perception that it was liquid candy. The soda was available in some of the candy’s popular fruit flavors, including pineapple, orange punch, grape punch, and lime punch. Life Savers did not release a mint flavored soda, however.\n\n47. Mars Needs Moms\n\nCompany: Walt Disney Motion\n\nWalt Disney Motion Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Studio film\n\nReleased in March 2011, Disney’s “Mars Needs Moms” grossed just $6.9 million in its opening weekend. Produced with a $150 million budget, “Mars Needs Moms” was one of the worst flops in cinema history. Film critics partially blame animation studio ImageMovers Digital for the film’s box office failure. The movie was animated using an expensive motion-capture process, a technology still in its infancy. According to one viewer, “The movie looked downright creepy.” ImageMovers Digital was closed after the studio wrapped production on the film.\n\n48. EONS\n\nCompany: Eons.com\n\nEons.com Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Social media site\n\nIn July 2006, Monster.com founder Jeff Taylor launched Eons.com -- a social network for baby boomers and other internet users over the age of 50. According to surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, an estimated 32% of seniors over the age of 65 used the internet at the time of the website’s launch compared to 86% of young adults aged 18 to 29. While the share of seniors on the internet has doubled over the past decade, Eons failed to gain traction and was sold to Crew Media in 2011.\n\n49. Supertrain\n\nCompany: NBC\n\nNBC Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: TV show\n\nWhen NBC’s “Supertrain” premiered in 1979, it was the most expensive TV series ever aired. Set aboard a nuclear-powered train that travels between New York City and Los Angeles at speeds nearing 200 miles an hour, the show’s production required a model train set that cost around $3 million in today’s dollars. The model crashed during its first demonstration, and the show as a whole soon followed. Debuting to poor ratings and negative reviews, “Supertrain” was cancelled after just nine episodes.\n\n50. Galaxy Note 7\n\nCompany: Samsung\n\nSamsung Year introduced: 2016\n\n2016 What it was: Tablet phone\n\nSamsung, which has overtaken Apple in the smartphone market last year, also had one of (the larger and--optional) more recent product flops. The Note S7, a phablet that launched in August 2016, was initially well received. However, it had a serious flaw. A problem with the battery software resulted in the phones catching fire on several occasions, including once on a SouthWest Airlines flight, which had to be evacuated. Soon, the Department of Transportation made it illegal to bring a Note 7 on a commercial flight. By October, after an extremely expensive recall, Samsung suspended worldwide production of the Note 7. The company lost what is estimated to be over $3 billion due to the debacle, and Apple once again took the lead in the global smartphone market earlier this year.\n\nMore: Can you afford that new vehicle? 25 most expensive car models to insure\n\nDetailed findings and methodology\n\nHindsight is 20/20, and while many of these gaffes might not have been predictable at the time, the reasons for their failure are often much clearer today. The reasons for the failures often fall into one of a several categories: overpricing, timing, bad advertising, product flaws, and reaching beyond what consumers of a brand are willing to accept.\n\nSometimes products are sold at a premium because they offer features competitors do not, either perceived or actual. When customers do not feel a product is superior to another -- rightly so or not -- they will not pay the premium price. While Apple is able to sell computers at a premium today because of its brand perception, the Lisa, introduced in 1983, failed largely as a result of its nearly $10,000 price tag.\n\nMany of the products on this list could have been perfectly viable, possibly even a hit, if they had been introduced at a different time. Sega’s Dreamcast was the first major console to introduce global network connectivity, but this was before every home had a stable connection fast enough to make the Dreamcast viable at the time.\n\nFor some flops on this list, it appears poor market research doomed these products. McDonald’s Arch Deluxe was marketed as a burger for those with refined palates, turning away kids, as well as many adults, from the ill-fated item. Coca-Cola completely misjudged the desire of its customers when it changed its classic flavor and introduced New Coke.\n\nSometimes, brands overextend their reach, introducing products that clash with their image and target demographics. One does not need to dig too deep to understand why Colgate, a brand associated with toothpaste, failed to make its line of frozen dinner products a success. The same can be said for Cosmopolitan’s brand of yogurt, Smith & Wesson’s mountain bike line, or Harley Davidson’s perfume.\n\nOf course, many of the products on this list were simply poorly designed or faulty -- at times downright dangerous. Such was the case with Mattel’s line of seriously flawed Hot Wheels and Barbie computers, or the Galaxy Note 7, plagued by battery fires that caused the phone to be banned on airplanes, recalled, and eventually discontinued.\n\nDespite their disappointing launches, some of these products still exist today. Google’s Glass and Google+ each became the butt of jokes after failing to live up to lofty promises. One day, we may see one of these flops become the product it was meant to be.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Starlight is the first beverage from Coca-Cola Creations, a new innovation platform.\n\nUnlike \"cherry\" or \"vanilla,\" it's not immediately clear how \"starlight\" is supposed to taste. So Redditors who spotted images of the new product online a few months ago shared some theories about the new drink's flavor. Some say they spotted the mysterious new product on retailer websites ahead of the official launch, slated for next week.\n\nOne guessed raspberry , because \"a quick Google search says that space tastes like raspberries.\" (Astronomers do think that the center of the galaxy may taste like raspberries and smell like rum, according to a 2009 Guardian article . Delicious! And not a bad idea for Coca-Cola, which is launching spiked versions of its drinks left and right.) More recently, a YouTuber who tried the product noted after-tastes of \"chocolate [and] graham cracker.\" That led another Redditor to guess that the flavor is \" s'mores .\"\n\nCoca-Cola Starlight is a new limited-time product.\n\nOn Thursday, Coca-Cola finally cleared up the mystery. Sort of. The company's explanation is ... well, see for yourself: Starlight is \"inspired by space\" has \"notes reminiscent of stargazing around a campfire, as well as a cooling sensation that evokes the feeling of a cold journey to space,\" the company said in a release.\n\nSo yeah, maybe s'mores?\n\nAlso, it's red. Or in the company's words, \"Coca-Cola Starlight combines great Coca-Cola taste with a dash of the unexpected, including a reddish hue.\"\n\nTo this reporter, after tasting a sample of the zero-sugar version provided by the company, that last sentence just about sums it up. The beverage did not taste like space travel or sitting around a campfire. It did, however, taste like a sweeter version of Coca-Cola. And it is definitely red.\n\nStarlight is getting the full Coca-Cola Creations promotional treatment, which includes a digital marketing campaign featuring pop singer Ava Max.\n\nCoke's new marketing strategy\n\nLast year, Coca-Cola launched a new brand platform called \"Real Magic.\" The idea is to take a slightly different approach to marketing Coke — one that tries to reach new consumers by focusing on gaming and music, among other things. Coca-Cola Creations, which will introduce new limited-time \"products and experiences across physical and digital worlds,\" is part of that platform.\n\n\"When we launched 'Real Magic,' we wanted to connect with and celebrate the experiences that bring joy to young people today, and that has taken us to an exciting new territory,\" Oana Vlad, senior director of global brand strategy at Coca-Cola, said in a statement Thursday.\n\nFor Coca-Cola, reaching young consumers is essential because interest in soft drinks has been declining for years. Exciting new campaigns and mysterious products could be a way to get potential new customers to pay attention.\n\nSo what does that entail? In the case of Starlight, it means a holographic concert by Ava Max, who has also performed in the gaming platform Roblox. The concert can be accessed via a QR code on the Starlight label. Plus, the sparkly packaging and that reddish hue.\n\nBut not everything about Starlight is new. It's also a nod to when Coca-Cola actually sent a can of Coke to space in the 1980s.

It’s part of the company’s renewed focus on its Coke brand, as it dumps niche products and tries to drum up excitement for its core beverages.\n\nIn the United States, new versions of Cherry Coke cans and bottles are magenta, with the white Coca-Cola logo emblazoned on the regular version and a black Coca-Cola logo on the Zero Sugar version. The new Vanilla Coke cans and bottles are cream-colored, and the Cherry Vanilla flavor’s new packaging is a mix of the two (heavy on the magenta).\n\nCoke with zero caffeine as well as Coke with zero caffeine and no sugar also have new looks, keeping with these designs.\n\nThe company decided in 2020 to cut its portfolio in half, dropping its underperforming brands and focusing on its most powerful ones, like Coke. Now, Coca-Cola (KO) is working on refreshing Coke’s look and enticing new customers with new products.\n\nThe new packages will start to hit shelves in late January.\n\nCoca-Cola is updating Coke's look and launching a new Coke with Coffee flavor. Coca-Cola\n\nUpdates to the flavored Coke packages are designed to “modernize and simplify the look … [and] help consumers find the flavor they’re looking for on the shelf,” said Natalia Suarez, senior brand manager of Coke Choice Portfolio, the company’s North America operating unit.\n\nStanding out on the shelf\n\nThe updated cans are supposed to “quickly communicate flavors and clearly distinguish between full-sugar and zero-sugar/calorie-free options,” she added.\n\nThe company started overhauling its packaging last year, she noted, when it changed the packaging of Coke, Diet Coke and Coke Zero Sugar. The company also tweaked the recipe for Coke Zero Sugar in an effort to make the drink taste more like regular Coke.\n\nGrabbing customers’ attention as they walk down the grocery aisle is essential to brands like Coke, which have to make the most out of their shelf space.\n\n“It’s a Darwinian struggle for space in the supermarket or in the convenience store,” Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey told CNN Business last year.\n\nAnother way to get people excited about Coke is to expand beyond traditional flavors. So the company is launching a new variety of Coke with Coffee.\n\nCoke with Coffee\n\nAbout a year ago, the company brought Coke with Coffee — Coke made with coffee powder — to the United States.\n\n“Coca-Cola with Coffee was met with a widespread, enthusiastic consumer response,” when it first started selling in North America, said Brandan Strickland, brand director of Coca-Cola Trademark.\n\nThe product already comes in Dark Blend, Vanilla and Caramel. And now a new Mocha flavor will reach US shelves on February 7.\n\nMocha is the logical next flavor, said Strickland, noting the move was “a no-brainer.”\n\nCoca-Cola also tried to expand beyond cola with its Coke Energy product, which hit North American shelves in early 2020 and was discontinued in the region in the spring. Coca-Cola pulled the product because it wasn’t performing well.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2021/12/13/coca-cola-minute-maid-recall/6488217001/", "title": "Coca-Cola recalls Minute Maid products in 8 states", "text": "The Coca-Cola Company recalled Minute Maid products due to the potential presence of foreign matter, specifically metal bolts or washers, according to Food Safety News.\n\nThe recall was voluntary, says Coca-Cola spokesperson Ann L.

Sauter, Evan Comen, Thomas C. Frohlich and Samuel Stebbins\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nGoogle+ finally ceased operations in April after eight years of efforts to boost interest in the struggling social network. The long-anticipated shutdown represents just the latest major Google product to fail to live up to its promise.\n\nGoogle has gained notoriety for scuttling dozens of projects, but just like success, failure is part of doing business. Entrepreneurs and large companies often take on big risks, hoping for success but not always finding it.\n\nThese failures can take many different forms. Often, a product simply does not connect with consumers and does not sell. In other cases, it may not come close to meeting a company’s expectations or plans, or it is recalled or discontinued for some flaws. These can all be marked as failures. While failures are expected, some can be so catastrophic they can lead to permanent damage to a company’s reputation, layoffs, and even complete financial ruin.\n\nThe real cost of cutting the cord:What streaming companies don’t want you to know\n\nDollar store games:Bargain shopping for video games, gaming accessories can pay off at dollar stores\n\nSometimes, it can take years or even decades for a product flop to disappear from the market. This was the case with Betamax, a video format that Sony introduced with the expectation it would replace VHS. Despite being technologically superior to VHS, Betamax lost market share until it eventually vanished.\n\nSome of the products on this list were among the most highly anticipated products of the year, and when released, they were the biggest product launches of the year – that is, before failing.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed some of the greatest product launch blunders throughout history. Today, these product flops exist as case studies companies use to avoid future failure. They range from Ford’s Edsel in 1958 to 2016’s Galaxy Note 7. Many of these products led to losses in the hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions, of dollars. In tech, film, the internet, the pharmaceutical industry, and more, these are the biggest product flops of all time.\n\n1. Google Glass\n\n• Company: Google\n\n• Year introduced: 2013\n\n• What it was: Wearable technology\n\nGoogle first announced Google Glass – an eyeglasses-shaped head-mounted display with smartphone capabilities – to the public in 2012. The announcement began with a statement of principle: “We think technology should work for you – to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don’t.” After two years of disappointing sales, it was clear consumers did not need Google Glass. Google stuck to its principle, and in 2015 discontinued the product’s development. Privacy concerns, reported bugs, low battery life, bans from public spaces, and an inability to live up to the hype all stymied public adoption of the technology.\n\n2. The Newton\n\n• Company: Apple\n\n• Year introduced: 1993\n\n• What it was: Personal digital assistant\n\nWhile the personal digital assistant would become a popular consumer electronics product in the late 1990s, the first PDA was one of the biggest product flops of all time. One year after Apple CEO John Sculley coined the term “PDA” in 1992, the company released the Newton MessagePad. While the device incorporated innovative technology such as a pen-based touch screen and the ability to sync with software on a personal computer, Apple sold only 50,000 units of the product in its first four months on the market. The Newton product line was discontinued in 1998.\n\n3. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\n• Company: Atari\n\n• Year introduced: 1982\n\n• What it was: Video game\n\nSeveral video games have failed over the years, but arguably none as spectacularly as \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.\" The video game was developed shortly after the release of Steven Spielberg’s classic film. With only five weeks spent in development – games typically take months, if not years, to program – the game was notoriously difficult and sold miserably. Atari spent $21 million to purchase the rights to the franchise and $5 million on promotion of the game. The company made 4 million copies of the game, but sold only 1.5 million. Atari buried the leftover copies in a landfill.\n\n4. Satisfries\n\n• Company: Burger King\n\n• Year introduced: 2013\n\n• What it was: French fries\n\nIn 2013, Burger King introduced a new menu item advertised as a healthy alternative to their traditional french fries. Satisfries used a less porous batter, which caused the fry to absorb less oil than regular fries during cooking. While Satisfries were made with a healthier recipe, Burger King failed to convey the difference to customers. The fries were also more expensive than Burger King’s regular french fries, and failed to gain traction with consumers. The company discontinued the fries in 2014, less than a year after they were introduced.\n\n5. Premier smokeless cigarettes\n\n• Company: RJ Reynolds\n\n• Year introduced: 1988\n\n• What it was: Cigarette\n\nR.J. Reynolds, the second largest U.S. tobacco company, began marketing in 1988 a smokeless tobacco product that was intended to be a safer way to use a cigarette. In addition to concerns over the product's actual safety, smokers missed the familiar elements of traditional cigarettes – the smoke, the burn, and the flick. Another issue was the widely-reported unpleasant chemical taste, which one user described as resembling “burning plastic.” Reynolds sunk close to $1 billion into the product before pulling it off the market within a year.\n\n6. Cheetos Lip Balm\n\n• Company: Frito-Lay\n\n• Year introduced: 2005\n\n• What it was: Lip balm\n\nPopular lip balm brands such as Chapstick, Blistex, and Burt’s Bees, have successfully sold their products to Americans for decades. Many prefer such flavored varieties as cherry, mint, and vanilla bean. Not every popular flavor can be successfully turned into a lip balm, however, a lesson PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay learned the hard way in 2005. While Cheetos has been a popular snack for more than six decades, Cheetos-flavored lip balm failed to catch on with consumers.\n\n7. Terra Nova\n\n• Company: Fox\n\n• Year introduced: 2011\n\n• What it was: TV show\n\nEvery year, TV shows are cancelled before the end of their first season. While Terra Nova, which aired for one 13-episode season, is not unusual in this regard, it may go down as the most costly cancelled television show of all time. Documenting the time-traveling adventures of a 22nd century family fleeing a dystopian society for a prehistoric past, the pilot of the show alone cost Fox between $16 and $20 million to make. Terra Nova encountered numerous production mishaps while filming in Australia, including a flood that nearly killed a crew member. Ratings failed to meet expectations, and the show was not renewed for a second season. Fox is estimated to have spent more than $50 million on the failed show, not including marketing costs.\n\n8. Touch of Yogurt shampoo\n\n• Company: Clairol\n\n• Year introduced: 1979\n\n• What it was: Shampoo\n\nIn keeping with the 1970s trend of incorporating natural food ingredients like lemon, herbs, and honey into beauty and hygiene products, Clairol – at the time a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb – thought a yogurt shampoo was just what the American consumer wanted. It turned out the company had grossly miscalculated. Many consumers were apparently confused as to what they had bought, as there were reported cases of people eating the shampoo.\n\n9. New Coke\n\n• Company: Coca-Cola\n\n• Year introduced: 1985\n\n• What it was: Soft drink\n\nOver the 15 years leading up to 1985, Coca-Cola’s flagship cola drink had been losing market share to Pepsi Cola. To compete, the company changed the drink’s formula for the first time in 99 years – but the move today is considered one of the greatest flops of all time. New Coke was met with public outrage and lasted only a few months. The company reintroduced its older formula, rebranded as Coca-Cola Classic.\n\n10. Windows Vista\n\n• Company: Microsoft\n\n• Year introduced: 2007\n\n• What it was: Operating system\n\nIntroduced in 2007 as a follow-up to Windows XP, the Windows Vista operating system was everything its popular predecessor was not – in all the wrong ways. Panned by customers and IT professionals alike, Vista reduced PC performance and caused a number of internet problems for users. As a result, Dell began offering Windows XP again on new laptops a few short months after Vista was introduced. Windows announced this month that it would no longer provide support for Vista, driving the final nail into the operating system’s coffin.\n\n11. Kitchen Entrees\n\n• Company: Colgate\n\n• Year introduced: 1982\n\n• What it was: Frozen meal\n\nMany of the worst product flops in recent memory were caused by otherwise popular brands wandering too far outside of their area of expertise. Colgate Kitchen Entrees may be the best example of such a product failure. When it came to pre-prepared frozen meals, Americans had plenty of options in the 1980s. Perhaps because consumers naturally associated the Colgate name with toothpaste, there was never much of an appetite for pre-made meals bearing the Colgate logo.\n\n12. Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water\n\n• Company: Coors\n\n• Year introduced: 1990\n\n• What it was: Sparkling water\n\nCoors and Coors Light are two of the most popular beers in the United States. Introducing Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water to the public in 1990, the Coors Brewing Company also sought to capitalize on the fast-growing bottled water segment in the United States. The water was Coors' first non-alcoholic product since Prohibition. The Coors brand name did not help to sell the product, however, as the beer-name branding may have confused or even frightened consumers. Coors let its trademark of Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water expire in 1997.\n\n13. Harley-Davidson perfume\n\n• Company: Harley-Davidson\n\n• Year released: 1994\n\n• What it was: Perfume\n\nHarley-Davidson is one of the most iconic and valuable brands in the world. It is also one of the more masculine brands. The company has not deviated considerably from this fact, although it has tried. The company released Legendary Harley-Davidson, a cologne for men, among several other varieties, starting in 1994. Another perfume, Black Fire, hit the market as recently as 2005. All are now discontinued. In the 1990s, the company released a number of other products, including wine coolers and aftershave, which after failing miserably have also become classic cases of brand overextension.\n\n14. Persil Power\n\n• Holding company: Unilever\n\n• Year released: 1994\n\n• What it was: Stain remover\n\nUnilever introduced Persil Power detergent to the market in 1994. The product utilized a newly patented stain removal formula called Accelerator. The company was so confident in the Accelerator catalyst that it carried out its $300 million introduction of Persil Power without any formal test marketing. Over time, it became clear the detergent was damaging clothes at high temperatures. After nine months on the shelves, the company replaced Persil Power with Persil New Generation, a detergent without the Accelerator compound.\n\n15. Cosmopolitan yogurt\n\n• Company: Cosmopolitan\n\n• Year introduced: 1999\n\n• What it was: Yogurt\n\nCosmopolitan is a popular women’s magazine, full of fashion advice, dating tips, celebrity gossip, and horoscopes. What the magazine’s leadership was thinking when they expanded the brand’s reach from the magazine aisle to the dairy aisle remains a mystery. Few will likely remember the 1999 debut of Cosmopolitan’s yogurt line, as the short-lived product was only available for 18 months. Like many other products on this list, Cosmopolitan yogurt was a case of a brand reaching too far beyond its area of expertise.\n\n16. DH 106 Comet\n\n• Company: De Havilland\n\n• Year introduced: 1949\n\n• What it was: Airplane\n\nWe now take jet travel for granted, but the development of a commercially viable jetliner involved a great deal of trial, error, and some utter failures. De Havilland, a British aircraft manufacturer, developed the Comet, the first commercial jet airliner. Unfortunately, within a few years of its 1949 debut, the Comet encountered several unexplained fatal crashes, including planes overrunning the runway and one exploding in midair. The Comet's reputation plummeted, and while De Havilland scrambled to redesign the plane, American companies Douglas and Boeing took over the industry.\n\n17. DeLorean DMC-12\n\n• Company: Delorean Motor Company\n\n• Year introduced: 1981\n\n• What it was: Sports car\n\nIn 1973, auto executive John DeLorean left General Motors to form the DeLorean Motor Company. After years of production delays, the DeLorean DMC-12 was released in January 1981. The car’s unique design was poorly received, however, and by 1982 less than half of the 7,000 DeLorean units produced had been sold. The DeLorean is widely recognized due to its use as a converted time machine in the “Back to the Future” series. However, the first of these films was released in 1985, far too late to save the ill-fated brand. DeLorean filed for bankruptcy in 1982.\n\n18. EZ Squirt\n\n• Company: Heinz\n\n• Year released: 2000\n\n• Company revenue when released: Ketchup\n\nBefore EZ Squirt, ketchup was always varying shades of red. To cater to kids, who were – and still are – among ketchup’s largest groups of consumers, Heinz began producing purple, green, and blue EZ Squirt ketchup in matching, vibrantly colored squeeze bottles. At first, the colorful ketchup was a huge success. The novelty wore off quickly, however, and not long after its introduction, sales of EZ Squirt began to decline. In January 2006, less than six years after its debut, Heinz halted production of the product.\n\n19. United States Football League\n\n• Company: USFL\n\n• Year introduced: 1982\n\n• What it was: Sports league\n\nConceived as a way to satiate America's appetite for football in the spring and summer months, the United States Football League was introduced in 1982. The league originally consisted of 12 teams, one of which, the New Jersey Generals, was owned by President Donald Trump. The league was beset with problems, not the least of which was finding stadiums to play in. Ultimately, over half a dozen teams folded when the league’s brain trust decided to compete directly with the NFL by scheduling games in the fall. By 1985, the league was finished.\n\n20. Home\n\n• Company: Facebook\n\n• Year introduced: 2013\n\n• What it was: Mobile phone app\n\nWith rising mobile phone use and social media engagement, Facebook in 2013 decided to launch a family of apps that combine these trends. Facebook Home converts the home screen of a smartphone into the Facebook news feed. While most of Facebook’s over 1 billion users log in to their accounts on a smartphone, the social media giant’s new product never caught on. Early users cited clunky operation, the inability to toggle between Facebook Home and the original phone interface, and lack of options for customization, among other snags.\n\n21. Edsel\n\n• Company: Ford\n\n• Year introduced: 1957\n\n• What it was: Car\n\nFord spent a year aggressively marketing the Edsel – named after Henry Ford’s son – ahead of its 1957 release. It was to be the “car of the future,” made available on dealership lots on what Ford dubbed “E-Day.\" Despite the hype, the car was a commercial disaster. It was considerably overpriced, disappointingly not futuristic, and generally ugly. Ford ceased the car's production after only two years, losing an estimated $350 million.\n\n22. Friendster\n\n• Company: Friendster\n\n• Year introduced: 2002\n\n• What it was: Social media site\n\nSocial media site Facebook is one of the biggest corporate success stories in recent memory. Unfortunately, when it comes to social media, for every success story there is at least one flop – as in the case of Friendster. The site’s users suffered through slow page loading times and the company’s developers failed to scale up when the number of subscribers spiked. Ultimately, competitors such as Facebook provided a much better user experience. Introduced in 2002, Friendster discontinued its services in mid-2015.\n\n23. WOW! Chips\n\n• Company: Frito-Lay\n\n• Year introduced: 1998\n\n• What it was: Snack\n\nPepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay introduced its line of WOW! Chips in 1998. The chips, which were made with the fat substitute olestra, were marketed as a healthy snacking alternative. While WOW! Chips were an initial success with $347 million in sales in their first year – the most of any new product in 1998 – sales slowed when the unpleasant side effects of olestra, such as diarrhea and cramps, became better known. To add to the product’s problems, the Food and Drug Administration instituted labeling requirements for all products containing olestra to carry warnings of “abdominal cramping and loose stools,\" and by 2000, sales of WOW! Chips were roughly 60% of what they were in the year of their release.\n\n24. Zune\n\n• Company: Microsoft\n\n• Year introduced: 2006\n\n• What it was: MP3 player\n\nIn an attempt to compete with Apple's dominant iPod MP3 player, Microsoft released the Zune in 2006. As of November 15, 2015, Microsoft discontinued all streaming, downloading, and other music services for the Zune. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Microsoft recorded a 42% decline in revenue in its non-gaming devices segment – a decline largely attributable to the Zune’s poor performance. While the device might have been a reasonable choice for consumers, a number of reported bugs did not help sales. On December 31, 2008, most if not all 30GB Zunes stopped functioning simply because the underlying code had failed to account for the extra day in leap years.\n\n25. Relenza\n\n• Company: GlaxoSmithKline\n\n• Year introduced: 1999\n\n• What it was: Influenza pandemic drug\n\nIn 1999, a flu pandemic fear caused by the spread of avian flu created demand for antiviral medications. The FDA approved two flu drugs during the pandemic – Tamiflu and Relenza. The former went on to report massive sales, while the latter became one of the worst product flops in the pharmaceutical industry. The powder form of the drug caused respiratory problems in some patients and was only approved as a treatment for influenza rather than a preventative measure. GlaxoSmithKline sold just $13 million worth of the drug in the first quarter of 2006. By comparison, Roche reported $770 million in Tamiflu sales in the first half of the year.\n\n26. Google+\n\n• Company: Google\n\n• Year introduced: 2011\n\n• What it was: Social media site\n\nNo all product flops are necessarily discontinued. Sometimes, despite failing to live up to company expectations, they linger. Such was the case with Google+, the social media platform the Silicon Valley giant launched in 2011 to compete with Facebook. However, even with a monumental marketing campaign, Google+ failed to distinguish itself from Facebook and never took off in the same manner. While the site experienced an initial surge in subscribers, by April 2015, Google+ had experienced a 98% decline in user engagement. In April 2019 Google+ was shut down for good.\n\n27. HP Touchpad\n\n• Company: Hewlett-Packard\n\n• Year introduced: 2011\n\n• What it was: Tablet computer\n\nThe TouchPad was Hewlett Packard’s attempt to compete with Apple’s wildly successful iPad. Hewlett Packard unveiled the device in the middle of 2011 with an extremely costly advertising campaign. The rollout incorporated numerous celebrity contracts. By late summer, however, box stores such as Best Buy were sitting on excess inventory, and HP began offering steep discounts. Many discounted TouchPads were sold at a loss, and it is estimated the company lost hundreds of millions on the product in all.\n\n28. Kellogg's Breakfast Mates\n\n• Company: Kellogg's\n\n• Year introduced: 1998\n\n• What it was: Breakfast food\n\nIn 1998, Kellogg’s introduced Breakfast Mates, an all-in-one package containing a serving of cereal, a small carton of milk, and a plastic spoon. The product was designed as a time saver that would appeal to busy families with two working parents. The stated convenience of the all-in-one packaging did little to save time, largely because traditional cereal is already relatively convenient to consume. In a controlled test reported by The New York Times, preparing a bowl of cereal the traditional way took only one second longer than preparing a bowl of Breakfast Mates. To make matters worse, the product’s $30 million ad campaign sent a mixed message, depicting a family eating the supposedly portable cereal around the kitchen table. In August 1999, Kellogg’s announced Breakfast Mates would be discontinued due to low sales.\n\n29. Maxwell House Brewed Coffee\n\n• Company: Maxwell House\n\n• Year introduced: 1990\n\n• What it was: Coffee\n\nMaxwell House Brewed Coffee was pre-brewed coffee sold in a carton with a picture of a hot mug of coffee on the packaging, a misleading visual cue for a product meant to be stored in the refrigerator. Adding to the product’s issues, the carton was lined with foil and could not be microwaved. For a product marketed for its convenience, this was an especially problematic feature for consumers. The product was discontinued shortly after it was released.\n\n30. Arch Deluxe\n\n• Company: McDonald's\n\n• Year introduced: 1996\n\n• What it was: Hamburger\n\nMcDonald’s introduced several failed products throughout its 60-year history, but none so monumental as the Arch Deluxe. Introduced in 1996, the Arch Deluxe was marketed as a more gastronomic hamburger with “a grown-up taste.\" One commercial featured a child unable to enjoy the sophisticated burger, stripping its toppings to satisfy his unrefined palate. The Arch Deluxe’s advertising budget was an estimated $200 million, the most of any fast food product at the time. However, the approach failed and sales of the Arch Deluxe missed the $1 billion expectation set for its first year. The Arch Deluxe was eventually discontinued.\n\n31. HD DVD\n\n• Company: Toshiba\n\n• Year introduced: 2006\n\n• What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nThe Blu-ray Disc’s succession of the DVD was not preordained. Before Blu-ray was the dominant medium for video playback, it was competing with Toshiba’s HD DVD. Essentially the same product, HD DVD was effectively taken out to pasture when in January 2008, Warner Bros. announced it would only support Sony’s Blu-ray format. Toshiba was not the only loser in the battle against Blu-ray. Millions of Americans found themselves stuck with HD DVD players and laptops after the dust settled.\n\n32. Microsoft Bob\n\n• Company: Microsoft\n\n• Year introduced: 1995\n\n• What it was: User interface\n\nMicrosoft released Microsoft Bob in March 1995. Intended as a simple, easy-to-use OS interface at the time, Bob presented the desktop as a house, with familiar objects corresponding with different computer applications. Clicking on the stationary lying on a desk, for example, opened the word processor. Despite its simple appearance, Bob required more processing power than most home computers had in 1995. Bob was also considered too expensive and poorly designed, and was overshadowed by the release of Windows 95 later that year. Bob was discontinued roughly a year after its release.\n\n33. 47 Ronin\n\n• Company: Universal Pictures\n\n• Year introduced: 2013\n\n• What it was: Movie\n\nThe 2013 fantasy action film “47 Ronin”, starring Keanu Reeves, is now notorious as one of the biggest box office flops of all time. The movie lost nearly $150 million on a $225 million budget and left Universal Pictures in the red for the fiscal year. Insiders point to multiple rewrites of the screenplay as well as several post-production changes that were made as filmmakers and studio executives attempted to find creative balance while appeasing moviegoers. In the end, the film failed to strike a chord with audiences and critics alike.\n\n34. Qwikster\n\n• Company: Netflix\n\n• Year introduced: 2011\n\n• What it was: DVD rental service\n\nBefore Netflix became the media streaming giant we know today, it was exclusively a deliver-by-mail DVD rental service. In an ill-conceived strategy, CEO Reed Hastings announced in September 2011 the company's plan to spin off its DVD rental service into a separate company, known as Qwikster. The move, which was meant to allow Netflix to focus more on its streaming services, would have cost consumers about 60% more if they wished to continue to have access to both services. Unpopular with customers and widely criticized, Hastings scrapped the plan less than a month after it was announced.\n\n35. Virtual Boy\n\n• Company: Nintendo\n\n• Year introduced: 1995\n\n• What it was: Portable game console\n\nVirtual Boy was game console maker Nintendo’s early foray into virtual reality technology. However, the company discontinued the portable console less than a year after its 1995 release, selling just 770,000 units globally. It is known as one of the company’s worst failures. To cut costs and reduce battery drain, Nintendo used only black and red shades in Virtual Boy games, which bothered some users. Using the Virtual Boy also caused eye strain in some users, which led Nintendo to include an automatic shutoff mechanism.\n\n36. MeeGo\n\n• Company: Nokia/Intel\n\n• Year introduced: 2010\n\n• What it was: Operating system\n\nUnlike Windows Vista, another operating system on this list, smartphone OS MeeGo was not necessarily a flawed product. By most accounts, the MeeGo operating system just came at the wrong time. Not long after its introduction, the operating system was dropped by then Nokia CEO Stephen Elop in favor of Windows Phone 7 operating system. Though it has not been used in years, MeeGo may find a second life as a tablet operating system.\n\n37. Crystal Pepsi\n\n• Company: Pepsi\n\n• Year introduced: 1992\n\n• What it was: Soda\n\nCrystal Pepsi was introduced to soda lovers across the United States in 1992. The product tasted like regular cola but was clear and caffeine free in an attempt to convey purity and heath. Crystal Pepsi was heavily promoted, with the company even buying an ad slot during Super Bowl XXVII. Despite strong initial sales, the public’s interest quickly waned and the soda was discontinued less than two years after its release.\n\n38. Hot Wheels and Barbie computers\n\n• Company: Mattel / Patriot Computers\n\n• Year released: 1999\n\n• What it was: Toy computer\n\nIn 1999, Mattel announced that it had entered a licensing agreement to sell Barbie and Hot Wheels computers. The computers would be manufactured and sold by the Patriot Computer Corporation, a privately held company based in Toronto. The move was part of an attempt to reconcile the declining sales of Barbie dolls and growing sales of software and CD-ROMs.\n\nThe computers, however, had many manufacturing flaws, and the resources Patriot devoted to fixing and replacing broken computers drove it out of business. By December the following year, the company had fired its 200 employees and filed for bankruptcy.\n\n39. LaserDisc\n\n• Company: Phillips\n\n• Year introduced: 1978\n\n• What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nLaserDisc was effectively a precursor to the DVD, offering consumers a higher quality picture and sound than VHS tapes. The product’s numerous drawbacks, however, outweighed any benefits. Unlike VHS players, LaserDisc players could not record television shows – an important feature before the days of TiVo. LaserDisc players, as well as LaserDiscs themselves, were also relatively expensive. Introduced in the 1970s, LaserDisc made a brief comeback in the 90s, but ultimately failed to gain traction.\n\n40. Dreamcast\n\n• Company: Sega\n\n• Year introduced: 1999 (North America)\n\n• What it was: Game console\n\nIn the 1990s, Sega was a dominant player in the consoles and games business. Sega had such success with its Sonic the Hedgehog games and Genesis console, that at one point the company held 60% of the North American market. The Dreamcast launched in 1999 in North America, within a few years of successful predecessors like the Nintendo 64 and Sony Playstation. Many consider the Dreamcast to have been ahead of its time – it was the first console to introduce worldwide network compatibility – but the system just never caught on. Dreamcast sold miserably and was discontinued after just over two years, in part due to the success of the PS2, which launched in 2000. While it was not Sega’s only failure, it may have been its most colossal, marking the end of the company’s attempts at game consoles.\n\n41. S&W Mountain Bikes\n\n• Company: Smith & Wesson\n\n• Year introduced: 2002\n\n• What it was: Mountain bike\n\nGun manufacturer Smith & Wesson has been making police bicycles for about 20 years. The company also attempted to sell mountain bikes to the general public in 2002. Like many other products on this list, the company’s consumer bike segment likely failed because bicycles were too far beyond the scope of the Smith & Wesson brand and what most Americans associate with it.\n\n42. Lisa\n\n• Company: Apple\n\n• Year introduced: 1983\n\n• What it was: Personal computer\n\nBefore Apple hit its stride in the 2000s and became the most profitable corporation in history, the company was responsible for some of the worst product flops of all time. Designed as a high-end personal computer with a graphical user interface for business customers, the Apple Lisa took three years and $50 million to develop before its release in 1983. However, the computer’s $9,995 price tag, which is equivalent to roughly $25,000 today, was too high for many consumers. After selling just 100,000 units in two years Apple discontinued the Lisa in 1985.\n\n43. Betamax\n\n• Company: Sony\n\n• Year introduced: 1975\n\n• What it was: Videocassette format\n\nIn the early 1970s, videotapes were still a novel technology, and the VHS tape had yet to become the standard videocassette format. Sony introduced the Betamax format in 1975, one year before JVC introduced the VHS tape. While Betamax tapes had superior resolution and sound quality, Sony refrained from licensing its technology to other manufacturers, in turn limiting the variety of movies available on the format. Meanwhile, JVC licensed its VHS technology to any interested manufacturer. The Betamax’s share of the VCR market fell from 100% in 1975 to 10% in 1988, and continued to dwindle in the following years.\n\n44. Too Human\n\n• Company: Silicon Knights\n\n• Year introduced: 2008\n\n• What it was: Video game\n\nReleased in 2008 after years of costly development delays, “Too Human” failed to live up to expectations and became one of the worst flops in video game history. A legal ruling eventually removed the game from the marketplace and pushed Silicon Knights, the game’s developer, into bankruptcy. The game’s production budget skyrocketed to an estimated $100 million after the game engine developer, Epic Games, failed to deliver the engine on time, forcing Silicon Knights to build it own game engine. When Silicon Knights sued Epic Games for missing the deadline, the latter counter-sued, which resulted in a court order forcing the developer to destroy all unsold copies of the game.\n\n45. Mobile ESPN\n\n• Company: ESPN\n\n• Year introduced: 2006\n\n• What it was: Mobile phone service\n\nIn 2006, ESPN attempted to capitalize on the desire of sports fan to have access to sports stats, scores, and video on the go. Mobile ESPN required users to buy a specific phone, which would include access to ESPN content as part of the subscription. However, the only phone Mobile ESPN offered, a Sanyo, cost $400, and the service was $40 per month, too rich for many sports fans. The service shut down within a year. Disney, ESPN’s parent company, spent $150 million on the failed venture.\n\n46. Life Savers soda\n\n• Company: Life Savers\n\n• Year introduced: 1995\n\n• What it was: Soft drink\n\nThough Life Savers soda tested well in focus groups, it failed to gain traction with the broader consumer market. Many attribute the soft drink’s failure to the prevailing perception that it was liquid candy. The soda was available in some of the candy’s popular fruit flavors, including pineapple, orange punch, grape punch, and lime punch. Life Savers did not release a mint-flavored soda, however.\n\n47. Mars Needs Moms\n\n• Company: Walt Disney Motion\n\n• Year introduced: 2011\n\n• What it was: Studio film\n\nReleased in March 2011, Disney’s “Mars Needs Moms” grossed just $6.9 million in its opening weekend. Produced with a $150 million budget, “Mars Needs Moms” was one of the worst flops in cinema history. Film critics partially blame animation studio ImageMovers Digital for the film’s box office failure. The movie was animated using an expensive motion-capture process, a technology still in its infancy. According to one viewer, “The movie looked downright creepy.” ImageMovers Digital was closed after the studio wrapped production on the film.\n\n48. EONS\n\n• Company: Eons.com\n\n• Year introduced: 2006\n\n• What it was: Social media site\n\nIn July 2006, Monster.com founder Jeff Taylor launched Eons.com – a social network for baby boomers and other internet users over the age of 50. According to surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, an estimated 32% of seniors over the age of 65 used the internet at the time of the website’s launch compared to 86% of young adults aged 18 to 29. While the share of seniors on the internet has doubled over the past decade, Eons failed to gain traction and was sold to Crew Media in 2011.\n\n49. Supertrain\n\n• Company: NBC\n\n• Year introduced: 1979\n\n• What it was: TV show\n\nWhen NBC’s “Supertrain” premiered in 1979, it was the most expensive TV series ever aired. Set aboard a nuclear-powered train that travels between New York City and Los Angeles at speeds nearing 200 miles an hour, the show’s production required a model train set that cost around $3 million in today’s dollars. The model crashed during its first demonstration, and the show as a whole soon followed. Debuting to poor ratings and negative reviews, “Supertrain” was cancelled after just nine episodes.\n\n50. Galaxy Note 7\n\n• Company: Samsung\n\n• Year introduced: 2016\n\n• What it was: Tablet phone\n\nSamsung, which has overtaken Apple in the smartphone market last year, also had one of more recent product flops. The Note S7, a phablet that launched in August 2016, was initially well-received. However, it had a serious flaw. A problem with the battery software resulted in the phones catching fire on several occasions, including once on a Southwest Airlines flight, which had to be evacuated. Soon, the Department of Transportation made it illegal to bring a Note 7 on a commercial flight. By October, after an extremely expensive recall, Samsung suspended worldwide production of the Note 7. The company lost what is estimated to be over $3 billion due to the debacle, and Apple once again took the lead in the global smartphone market earlier this year.\n\nPrice, timing can cause product failings\n\nHindsight is 20/20, and while many of these gaffes might not have been predictable at the time, the reasons for their failure are often much clearer today. The reasons for the failures often fall into one of a several categories: overpricing, timing, bad advertising, product flaws, and reaching beyond what consumers of a brand are willing to accept.\n\nSometimes products are sold at a premium because they offer features competitors do not, either perceived or actual. When customers do not feel a product is superior to another – rightly so or not – they will not pay the premium price. While Apple is able to sell computers at a premium today because of its brand perception, the Lisa, introduced in 1983, failed largely as a result of its nearly $10,000 price tag.\n\nMany of the products on this list could have been perfectly viable, possibly even a hit, if they had been introduced at a different time. Sega’s Dreamcast was the first major console to introduce global network connectivity, but this was before every home had a stable connection fast enough to make the Dreamcast viable at the time.\n\nFor some flops on this list, it appears poor market research doomed these products. McDonald’s Arch Deluxe was marketed as a burger for those with refined palates, turning away kids, as well as many adults, from the ill-fated item. Coca-Cola completely misjudged the desire of its customers when it changed its classic flavor and introduced New Coke.\n\nSometimes, brands overextend their reach, introducing products that clash with their image and target demographics. One does not need to dig too deep to understand why Colgate, a brand associated with toothpaste, failed to make its line of frozen dinner products a success. The same can be said for Cosmopolitan’s brand of yogurt, Smith & Wesson’s mountain bike line, or Harley Davidson’s perfume.\n\nOf course, many of the products on this list were simply poorly designed or faulty – at times downright dangerous. Such was the case with Mattel’s line of seriously flawed Hot Wheels and Barbie computers, or the Galaxy Note 7, plagued by battery fires that caused the phone to be banned on airplanes, recalled, and eventually discontinued.\n\nDespite their disappointing launches, some of these products still exist today. Google’s Glass and Google+ each became the butt of jokes after failing to live up to lofty promises. One day, we may see one of these flops become the product it was meant to be.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

The 77th edition of the world’s oldest film festival will look nothing like its predecessors.\n\nThe public will be barred from the red carpet, Hollywood stars and films will be largely absent and face masks will be required indoors and out as the festival opens Wednesday.\n\nThose strict measures are evidence of the hard line Venice and the surrounding Veneto region took to contain the virus when it first emerged in the lagoon city in late February. Unlike neighboring Lombardy, which became the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe, Veneto largely kept the virus under control with early local lockdowns and broad testing once the virus was widespread.\n\nLa Biennale chief Robert Cicutto said the decision to hold the festival at all was an important sign of rebirth for Venice and the film industry, and said the experience on the Lido will serve as a “laboratory” for future cultural gatherings.\n\n“It will be an experiment on the ground of how to confront an important event” in the COVID era, he said in presenting this year’s Venice lineup.\n\nThe Sept. 2-12 festival marks Italy’s return to the art world stage after it became the first country in the West to be slammed by COVID. Even Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible 7,” in Venice at the time for three weeks of filming, had to pull out.\n\nItaly’s strict 10-week lockdown largely tamed the virus, but infections are now rebounding after summer vacations. Health authorities are scrambling to test passengers at airports and seaports to try to identify imported cases before they can spread.\n\nGuests to the glamorous film festival are not exempt. If they arrive from outside Europe’s open-border Schengen area, they will be tested upon arrival. Other measures to limit contagion include reserved seats, spaced apart, for all screenings and a requirement to wear masks even during screenings and outdoors.\n\n“Clearly we have to abide by anti-COVID measures,” said Paola Mar, Venice’s culture chief. “Each of us has a personal responsibility. And if all of us do our jobs, we can limit the harm.”\n\nBut she said the show must go on, given the importance of the film festival and the Biennale’s other longer-term cultural contributions to Venice’s economy, which depends almost entirely on tourism.\n\nRestrictions on travel from the U.S. to Europe have meant that Hollywood films, which often use Venice as a springboard for other festivals and ultimately the Oscars, are essentially no-shows this year.\n\nMore:Venice Film Festival will return with face masks, coronavirus tests and other precautions\n\nMore:Venice Film Festival announces September lineup for first major movies event since COVID-19 outbreak\n\nThat means no sightings of Venice regulars George Clooney and Brad Pitt arriving by water taxi, no red carpet photo ops with Lady Gaga, who premiered “A Star is Born” here, or Joaquin Phoenix, whose “Joker” won Venice’s top prize, the Golden Lion, last year before going on to Oscar glory.\n\nIn recent years, films directed by women have been mostly excluded from vying for the coveted Golden Lion. Among the 62 films that competed between 2017 and 2019, only four were made by women.\n\nThings have improved at the just-started 77th edition of the festival, where 44% of the films in competition are directed by women.\n\nThey include Chloé Zhao’s Great Recession drama “Nomadland,” with Frances McDormand, Mona Fastvold’s period romance “The World to Come,” with Vanessa Kirby and Katherine Waterston, Julia von Heinz’s contemporary political film “And Tomorrow the Entire World” and Susanna Nicchiarelli’s “Miss Marx,” about Karl’s youngest daughter.\n\nThis year’s slightly reduced lineup still contains in-competition films from a variety of countries, but will be a mostly European affair. Italian films are well represented, including the first Italian opening-night film in years, the out-of-competition family drama “Lacci” by Daniele Luchetti.\n\nTwo Italian documentaries filmed during lockdown are making their debuts: Andrea Segre’s “Molecules,” a haunting study of an empty, ethereal Venice, premieres as the festival’s pre-opening film Tuesday. And director Luca Guadagnino, whose documentary about Italian shoemaker Salvatore Ferragamo is an official out-of-competition film, offered up a last-minute short “Fiori, Fiori, Fiori!,” about reconnecting with his childhood friends in Sicily during the lockdown.\n\nSpanish director Pedro Almodovar is premiering his first-ever English-language film, “The Human Voice,” which he filmed and edited in the weeks after Spain’s lockdown ended. The short film, an adaptation of the Jean Cocteau play of the same name, stars Tilda Swinton, who will be picking up a Golden Lion Lifetime Achievement award in Venice this year.\n\nCate Blanchett heads the main jury, which added Matt Dillon at the last minute after Romanian director Cristi Puiu pulled out.\n\nWhat you need to know:Johnny Depp's terrifyingly brutal role in 'Waiting for the Barbarians'\n\nBut other A-list celebrities are largely staying away. Venice itself still has a long way to go to recover from the economic devastation of a pandemic, the halt to cruise ship stops and a lockdown on a city beloved by the jet-set.\n\nAll this happened after Venice was already brought to its knees by the historic “acqua alta” floods last November, which raised deep questions about how Italy’s lagoon city will function as climate change and rising sea levels grow to be increasing threats.\n\n“The city hasn’t worked since November,” said gondolier Maurizio Carlotto. “There’s nothing. Absolutely nothing. The hotels that are open are half-empty. You look at the restaurants at night, they’re empty.”\n\n“To relaunch Venice, and tourism in general, we need this virus to end,” he said, looking out at an eerily empty canal. “They have to find the antidote.”\n\nContributing: Lindsey Bahr, The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/10/24/timothee-chalamet-dune-proves-sizable-box-office-draw-big-screen/6169007001/", "title": "'Dune' proves sizable box-office draw on big screen with $40M", "text": "Jake Coyle\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK – Denis Villeneuve's \"Dune\" debuted with $40.1 million in ticket sales in its opening weekend in North America, drawing a large number of moviegoers to see the thundering sci-fi epic on the big screen, despite it also being available to stream in homes.\n\nWarner Bros. launched the film simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max.

Expectations had hovered closer to $30 million to $35 million for \"Dune.\"\n\n\"This was a tremendous result as we're ramping out of the pandemic,\" says Jeff Goldstein, distribution chief for Warner Bros. \"Once we get out of the pandemic, if we have a movie like this, clearly you'd want to go into theaters first. There's no question of that.\"\n\nGoldstein estimates the film would have debuted with approximately 20% more in box office had it not also been streaming simultaneously. (The studio didn't release streaming figures.) Coming into the weekend, \"Dune,\" which premiered at Venice Film Festival in early September, had already grossed $130 million internationally. This weekend, it debuted with $21.6 million in China. Altogether, \"Dune\" added $47.4 million internationally for a global cumulative gross of $220.7 million.\n\n\"Dune\" is the second big-screen attempt to adapt Frank Herbert's 1965 epic, following David Lynch's much derided 1984 version. Villeneuve's \"Dune,\" which adapts only the first half of the book, stars Timothée Chalamet, Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya and Javier Bardem. Warner Bros. has yet to confirm a sequel to \"Dune,\" which chronicles a violent power shift on the desert planet Arrakis, where a valuable mineral called \"spice\" is harvested.\n\nMoviegoers gave \"Dune\" an A-minus on CinemaScore and critics have praised the operatic sweep and visual craft of Villeneuve's film (82% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes). It fared particularly well on large-format screens, with IMAX accounting for about $9 million in ticket sales.\n\n'Suspense is terrible':Timothée Chalamet reveals magical first look as young Willy Wonka\n\n\"What I think Warner's strategy has proven is that movie fans, by and large, will choose the movie theater experience when given the choice – particularly for movies like this,\" says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. \"This should be a very encouraging sign for theater owners. The allure of the movie theater remains whether a piece of content is available at home or not.\"\n\nLast week's top film, the horror sequel \"Halloween Kills,\" also launched well while streaming at home on Peacock. After debuting with $50.4 million, \"Halloween Kills\" slid steeply in its second week with $14.5 million, good for second place. In two weeks, it has grossed $73.1 million domestically.\n\n\"No Time to Die,\" Cary Fukunaga's theater-only James Bond film starring Daniel Craig, came in third with $11.9 million in its third week. Worldwide, the film has brought in more than $525 million.\n\nThe weekend's biggest disappointment, albeit not unexpectedly, was \"Ron's Gone Wrong.\" The lightly marketed Disney animated release, produced by 20th Century Fox before Disney acquired the studio, opened with a modest $7.3 million domestically and about the same internationally. But with good reviews and an A grade from CinemaScore audiences, the film could hold well in the coming weeks, with little family competition. \"Ron's Gone Wrong\" is about a middle-schooler and his walking, talking digital device Ron (voiced by Zach Galifiniakis).\n\nAnother Chalamet film, \"The French Dispatch,\" also debuted strongly. The Wes Anderson film launched with $1.3 million in 52 theaters. That gave \"The French Dispatch\" the best per-theater average of the pandemic. Anderson's ode to The New Yorker, which had been delayed by a year because of the pandemic, opens nationwide on Friday. While \"The French Dispatch\" – a $25 million film with a starry cast including Frances McDormand, Bill Murray, Benicio del Toro, Tilda Swinton and others – isn't a small indie, the film's first-week performance gave arthouses a lift.\n\n\"These figures show that after a year and a half, arthouse and independent theaters have a superhero of their own in Wes Anderson,\" Searchlight Pictures' distribution chief Frank Rodriguez says in a statement.\n\nFinal numbers are expected Monday.\n\nRanked:Every eccentric and quirky Wes Anderson movie (including the new 'French Dispatch')", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/08/27/joker-5-reasons-why-joaquin-phoenix-madman-could-oscar-fave/2096987001/", "title": "'Joker': 5 reasons Joaquin Phoenix's madman could be an Oscar fave", "text": "No kidding, the Joker has become an Oscar good-luck charm.\n\nHeath Ledger famously won a posthumous supporting actor Academy Award for his defining take on the Batman supervillain in 2008’s “Dark Knight.” Tim Burton’s 1989 “Batman,” which featured an over-the-top Jack Nicholson as Gotham City’s Clown Prince of Crime, nabbed an Oscar for production design. Even “Suicide Squad,” the critically maligned flick with Jared Leto’s tattooed, gangster take on the iconic bad guy, scored a trophy for hair and makeup.\n\nFall preview:10 movies you absolutely, positively must see (from 'It 2' to 'Joker')\n\n'Joker':Follow Joaquin Phoenix's complete descent into madness in three new, insane photos\n\nThat all is a good sign for “Joker,” writer/director Todd Phillips’ hotly anticipated dark character drama starring Joaquin Phoenix that premieres at the Venice Film Festival on Saturday. The film, which focuses on the tragic descent into madness for a failed stand-up comedian and clown-for-hire, also touches down at the Toronto International Film Festival in early September before releasing wide on Oct. 4.\n\n“Venice is a biggie,” says Phillips, who earned an Oscar screenwriting nod in 2007 for \"Borat\" and is best known for directing “The Hangover” trilogy. Taking “Joker” on the festival circuit “is kind of trippy but it's exciting. It also helps, in a weird way, send a message about what kind of film it is.\"\n\nHere are five reasons why “Joker” should be taken seriously this awards season.\n\nIt’s officially got the film fest seal of approval\n\nFun fact: The last time a movie that didn't premiere at a film festival won best picture was 2006’s “The Departed.” A project like “Joker” can be highly anticipated by moviegoers, but getting in front of an industry crowd at these high-profile gatherings is “crucial for it to be considered for Oscars,” says Tom O’Neil, founder and editor of awards site GoldDerby.com. “If you want to woo the award voters, you've got to go to Venice and Toronto.”\n\nScreening at these festivals also drives the point home that “Joker” is more like \"Dark Knight\" than “Wonder Woman” or “Aquaman.” It’s taking a comic book character and thinking about it in “different ways,” says Erik Davis, managing editor for Fandango.com.\n\nThe throwback vibe will only help\n\nThe “Joker” trailers so far have teased a retro and gritty 1970s filmmaking style, and that could have an appeal to older Oscar voters who remember days of best picture nominees like “Dog Day Afternoon,” “The Deer Hunter” and “Chinatown” that put an emphasis on complex characters.\n\nIn that vein, Davis sees a definite “Taxi Driver” inspiration in \"Joker,\" with “a slow descent of the character, who starts off a little bit off and then just goes down and down and down. By the end of the film, they've completely lost sense of themselves.”\n\nJoaquin Phoenix is ridiculously overdue for Oscar glory\n\nPlaying the troubled Arthur Fleck, who is cruelly mocked because of his distinctive laugh, Phoenix is “97% of this film,” Phillips reports. Davis compares the star to Daniel Day-Lewis in that Phoenix viscerally embodies roles “that could seem weird or make people feel uncomfortable.”\n\nYet Phoenix has never won an Oscar, though he’s been nominated three times (best actor for 2005’s “Walk the Line” and 2012’s “The Master,” supporting actor for 2000’s “Gladiator”). A Joker role also gave Ledger a “long-overdue” Oscar, O’Neil says, noting a “traffic jam” of big names angling to get into this year’s leading actor race – from “The Irishman” star (and “Joker” supporting player) Robert De Niro to Christian Bale and Matt Damon of “Ford v Ferrari.” But Phoenix is “giving a big bombastic performance and Oscar voters love that.”\n\nThe Joker, in his own way, is a revered Oscar favorite\n\nThe hallowed hall of Hollywood rogues includes antagonists such as Hannibal Lecter, Norman Bates and Darth Vader, but Joker is up there as one of the most beloved. “Ledger really showed people this is a character that you can go a little bit of dark and twisted with, and explore the psyche in ways that make the character blossom onto another level,” Davis says. Mixing Phoenix's talent with this role “is just a recipe for awards consideration.”\n\n‘Joker’ benefits from Oscars’ new populist mindset\n\n“Black Panther” sparked a cultural revolution and also scored a big victory for comic book movies by earning a best picture nomination at this year's Academy Awards ceremony. That gives “Joker” a little more window for opportunity, but also it’s theoretically helped by the “demand for popular movies to be represented at the Oscars,” Davis says.\n\nTrue, one aspect “Joker” lacks is “the artistic pretension that voters love,” O’Neil adds. “It does seem strange to mention ‘Joker’ and Oscar in the same thought, but the Oscars are making a strenuous effort to include these movies and the public wants them in there and they've done it before. So it's in the game.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/oscars/2021/09/08/oscars-2022-awards-tracker-kristen-stewart-princess-diana-oscar-isaac/5748897001/", "title": "Oscars 2022: 'Spencer' star Kristen Stewart leads as Princess Diana", "text": "It’s the most wonderful time of the year.\n\nAwards season is officially underway with the one-two punch of the Venice and Telluride film festivals, which kicked off last week with sold-out screenings and starry red carpets. Sean Baker's \"The Florida Project\" follow-up \"Red Rocket,\" starring Simon Rex, continued to win over critics after its Cannes Film Festival debut in July, while the black-and-white Joaquin Phoenix dramedy \"C’mon C'mon\" and animated \"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On\" proved to be heartwarming escapes for movie lovers amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs the largely in-person Toronto International Film Festival launches Thursday with the premiere of movie musical \"Dear Evan Hansen,\" here's where the state of the race stands on the long road to the Academy Awards next March.\n\nReview:Denis Villeneuve's sci-fi epic 'Dune' is a mixed bag\n\nKristen Stewart vies for the crown with 'Spencer'\n\nLike her \"Twilight\" co-star Robert Pattinson, Stewart has proven to be one of the most fascinating actors working today: deftly juggling haunting independent dramas (\"Personal Shopper,\" \"Clouds of Sils Maria\") with lighter fare (\"Happiest Season,\" \"Charlie's Angels\"). But \"Spencer\" (in theaters Nov. 5) could finally be her ticket to the Oscars: Stewart has been hailed by critics as \"impeccable\" and \"inspired\" for her transformative performance as a luminous Lady Di, tracing three agonizing days in the reluctant royal's life.\n\nStewart gamely rubbed shoulders with journalists and festival-goers at both the Venice and Telluride premieres of \"Spencer\" this past week, with Toronto next on her campaign trail. The academy loves a British royal – just ask past best-actress winners Olivia Colman (\"The Favourite\") and Helen Mirren (\"The Queen\") – and Stewart is long overdue for an Oscar coronation.\n\nFirst 'Spencer' footage:Kristen Stewart stuns as Princess Diana, clashes with Prince Charles\n\n'The Card Counter' could be a tough bet\n\nIf video views counted for Oscar votes, then Oscar Isaac would already be a winner. The \"Star Wars\" actor had Twitter weak in the knees this past weekend with a now-viral red carpet clip that has been watched more than 11 million times, in which he makes eyes at his \"Scenes From a Marriage\" co-star Jessica Chastain and kisses her arm. Onscreen, Isaac's Oscar chances are a little dicier. In the Martin Scorsese-produced “The Card Counter\" (in theaters Friday), he plays a soldier turned compulsive gambler seeking redemption after torturing prisoners in Iraq.\n\nThe unnerving film has received universally strong reviews (97% positive on Rotten Tomatoes), although director/writer Paul Schrader (\"Taxi Driver,\" \"Raging Bull\") hits many of the same beats as his superior \"First Reformed\" in 2017, which starred Ethan Hawke in a career-best performance that was ignored by the academy. Factor in an already competitive best-actor race – led by Will Smith (\"King Richard\"), Peter Dinklage (\"Cyrano\") and Jamie Dornan (\"Belfast\") – and Isaac could very well get lost in the shuffle.\n\nVenice Film Festival:Jessica Chastain replies to that viral moment when Oscar Isaac kissed her arm\n\n'Dune' faces an uphill battle\n\n\"Dune,\" the $165 million sci-fi epic from Denis Villeneuve (\"Arrival\"), was always going to be a gamble. The film is adapted from Frank Herbert's influential 1965 novel, which last hit the big screen in 1984 with David Lynch's critical and commercial misfire. Early reviews have been disappointing, to say the least, with critics such as USA TODAY's Brian Truitt taking issue with the movie's half-baked storytelling and anticlimactic finish, despite eye-popping visuals and committed performances.\n\n\"Dune\" is a guaranteed player in technical Oscar categories such as best production design, costumes and score. But with a still-uncertain box-office performance – \"Dune\" is being released simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max Oct. 22 – the movie may not have the spice to land one of the 10 best-picture slots (let alone a planned-for sequel).\n\nFear and loathing in Las Vegas:Hollywood faces theater owners after streaming new movies during pandemic\n\nNetflix looks to clinch an elusive best-picture win\n\nYou've got to hand it to Netflix: The streaming service has consistently had superb movies nominated for best picture in the past few years, including \"Roma,\" \"Mank\" and \"The Irishman.\" But the Oscars' top prize has always eluded the media giant, whose biggest awards to date have been for best director (Alfonso Cuarón, \"Roma\") and supporting actress (Laura Dern, \"Marriage Story\").\n\nThat could change this year with a slew of new offerings that were rapturously received by most critics at Venice and Telluride: Maggie Gyllenhaal's arresting \"The Lost Daughter,” Paolo Sorrentino's Italian coming-of-age film \"The Hand of God,” and Jane Campion's sexually charged Western \"The Power of the Dog.\" The latter should also be a heavyweight acting contender, with a trio of jaw-dropping performances from Benedict Cumberbatch, Kirsten Dunst and Kodi Smit-McPhee.\n\nWhat's on Netflix in September:The chilling 'Midnight Mass,' 'Lucifer' and 'Money Heist'", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/09/18/tiff-toronto-la-la-land-becomes-oscar-bound-movie-to-beat/90561252/", "title": "'La La Land' becomes the Oscar-bound movie to beat out of Toronto", "text": "Andrea Mandell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe votes are in, and it's La La Land that Toronto audiences couldn't get enough of.\n\nMoviegoers at Toronto International Film Festival bestowed the coveted People's Choice Award on director Damien Chazelle's musical, which features Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling as star-crossed lovers pursuing their dreams in Los Angeles. With the festival's most prestigious prize decided (last year it went to Room, which earned Brie Larson a best actress Oscar) here are five things you should know about the movies that took Toronto by storm:\n\n1. 'La La Land' danced to first position\n\nLa La Land’s magic was evident at the movie's premiere Monday night. The film, which peppers its love story with dance sequences inspired by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, delighted the gathered crowd of film fans and critics. Coupling the response with Stone's best-actress prize bestowed by Venice Film Festival, “La La Land has definitely emerged from this round of festivals as the movie to beat at the Oscars,\" says IMDb correspondent Dave Karger. \"It's got fantastic performances, gorgeous cinematography and an appealing Hollywood story. I'd say Emma Stone could very well win best actress” at the Oscars, \"although she'll face tough competition from past winner Natalie Portman.\"\n\n2. Surprise! ‘Jackie’ is a contender\n\nPortman plays the grief-stricken former first lady in the days following JFK’s assassination, and the actress swiftly entered the Oscar race when Fox Searchlight acquired the Pablo Larraín-directed biopic just days into the festival. The film also scored an awards-friendly Dec. 9 release date. “Jackie got a huge bounce,\" says Scott Feinberg, awards columnist for The Hollywood Reporter. \"The great thing about TIFF is when you feel like you’ve discovered a movie.\"\n\nIn Toronto, Natalie Portman enters Oscar race with 'Jackie'\n\n3. Diversity triumphed with 'Moonlight,' 'Hidden Figures,' 'Loving'\n\nAfter back-to-back years of #OscarsSoWhite, it was heartening to see an array of acclaimed diverse films positioned for success. \"There’s no question that TIFF confirms there will be a lot of legitimate contenders of color this year,” says Feinberg, citing Barry Jenkins' Moonlight, the Taraji P. Henson-led Hidden Figures and Loving, starring Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga.\n\nTIFF: With positive reviews, 'Moonlight' climbs quickly in Toronto\n\nWhile they may not change how Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences members ultimately vote, these movies \"will at least be seen\" by voters, says Feinberg.\n\nTIFF: Taraji P. Henson says 'Hidden Figures' offers hope at a 'scary' time\n\n4. But 'Birth of a Nation' stumbled\n\nAudience reception was strong for TheBirth of a Nation when the film about slave-turned-preacher Nat Turner screened last weekend. Then came Sunday, when director/star/screenwriter Nate Parker faced a news conference and dodged personal questions.\n\nIt was revealed last month that Parker and co-screenwriter Jean Celestin were tried for rape in college. Parker was acquitted; Celestin was convicted, a charge later overturned. The woman, whose name has not been made public, committed suicide in 2012.\n\nTIFF: Nate Parker avoids personal questions at 'Birth' event\n\nWhen asked by a reporter if he would apologize to her family, Parker deflected. \"I don’t want to hijack this with my personal life,” he told journalists. The headlines that followed were not kind.\n\nStill, there's life in Birth yet. \"The rapturous response proves that it’s still in the awards hunt,\" says Tom O'Neil, founder of GoldDerby.com, noting that experts for the awards prediction site give it 14-to-1 odds of winning best picture. \"Pundits believe that Academy voters will keep an open mind.\"\n\nTIFF: 'Colossal' is Anne Hathaway's riskiest post-Oscar move yet\n\n5. Anne Hathaway got wonderfully weird in 'Colossal'\n\nArguably not since 2008's Rachel Getting Married has Hathaway so vividly embraced offbeat filmmaking like she does in Colossal, a wacky monster movie which made its debut to surprise raves. The Oscar winner plays Gloria, an alcoholic, jobless New Yorker forced to move back to her hometown, where she finds work at a bar owned by a high school pal, Owen (Jason Sudeikis). Things hum along nicely — until a reptilian monster cosmically connected to Gloria starts attacking Seoul. Hathaway's risky bet paid off in spades: Vanity Fair's Richard Larson called Colossal \"my favorite performance of hers since, gosh, I don’t know when.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/08/31/venice-film-festival-opens-caution-amid-covid-pandemic/5662942001/", "title": "Venice Film Festival opens with caution amid COVID pandemic"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/10/12/oscars-2022-will-smith-denzel-washington-joaquin-phoenix/6089946001/", "title": "Oscars 2022: It's Will Smith vs. Denzel Washington in best actor race", "text": "With the closing of the New York Film Festival on Oct. 10, the fall festival sprint has finally slowed to a jog.\n\nIn the last month and a half, hundreds of new movies have premiered at the Venice, Telluride, Toronto and New York film festivals, where A-listers including Ben Affleck (\"The Last Duel\"), Frances McDormand (\"The Tragedy of Macbeth\") and Benedict Cumberbatch (\"The Power of the Dog\") launched their Oscar campaigns with a bevy of red carpets, after-parties and in-person Q&As.\n\n\"Belfast,\" Kenneth Branagh's schmaltzy ode to his childhood in volatile Northern Ireland, has emerged as the early best picture front-runner, after taking home the top award at the Toronto International Film Festival (a reliable bellwether for future Oscar glory).

Denzel Washington is vying for his third little gold man playing the titular \"Macbeth,\" after acting wins for 1989's \"Glory\" and 2001's \"Training Day.\" Will Smith, too, has a plum role as Serena and Venus Williams' tennis coach father in crowd-pleaser \"King Richard.\"\n\nAdding further intrigue, Smith lost the best actor award for \"Ali\" to Washington for \"Training Day\" at the Oscars nearly two decades ago. Both stars have phenomenal reviews and \"overdue\" narratives they could push this year: Washington hasn't won an Oscar in 20 years, while Smith hasn't won at all despite two nominations. If he prevails, Washington would become the first Black actor to win three Oscars.\n\nBut we'll give Smith the edge at this point in the season, with a rare profile published in GQ last month that had social media buzzing for days, and a more audience-friendly movie than Joel Coen's stunning but chilly \"Macbeth.\"\n\nWhere to watch: \"King Richard\" is in theaters and streaming on HBO Max Nov. 19; \"The Tragedy of Macbeth\" is in theaters Dec. 25 and streaming on Apple TV+ Jan. 14.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix is the anti-Joker in heartwarming new film\n\nHip distributor A24 has two possible best actor contenders in Simon Rex (“Red Rocket”) and Joaquin Phoenix (“C’mon C’mon”), both of whom star in critically beloved festival films. We imagine that Rex, a former MTV VJ, will be a tougher sell for academy members, given his movie's queasy subject matter of a washed-up porn star who pursues a relationship with an underage girl (Suzanna Son).\n\nThat leaves Phoenix, a four-time Oscar nominee and 2020 winner for “Joker,” who gives one of the most sensitive performances of his career in low-key charmer “C’mon C’mon.” The actor plays a radio journalist who reconnects with his semi-estranged sister (Gaby Hoffmann) and young nephew (Woody Norman). Phoenix is warm and funny in this deeply empathetic film, which beautifully considers how kids' feelings are as complex and real as adults.'\n\nWhere to watch: \"C'mon C'mon\" opens in theaters Nov. 19; \"Red Rocket\" is in theaters Dec. 3.\n\nOlivia Colman, Penélope Cruz are waiting in the wings\n\nKristen Stewart is still squarely in the lead for best actress for her spellbinding turn as Princess Diana in “Spencer.” But three more worthy contenders have emerged from the festival circuit: Olivia Colman, fantastic as a professor weighing personal freedom and maternal responsibility in \"The Lost Daughter;\" Penélope Cruz, heartbreaking in Pedro Almodóvar's \"Parallel Mothers,\" a twisty melodrama about newborns switched at birth; and Renate Reinsve, endlessly watchable in Norwegian relationship dramedy \"The Worst Person in the World.\"\n\nCruz took best actress at the Venice Film Festival in September, while Reinsve won the award at this summer's Cannes Film Festival. The 33-year-old gives the kind of star-making performance that only comes along once in a long while. If enough voters see \"Worst Person,\" Reinsve will be pretty hard to resist.\n\nWhere to watch: \"Spencer\" opens in theaters Nov. 5; \"The Lost Daughter\" is in theaters Dec. 17 and streams on Netflix Dec. 31; \"Parallel Mothers\" is in theaters Dec. 24; \"The Worst Person in the World\" is expected for release later this year.\n\n'Dune' will spice up the race – but how much?\n\nThere are big movies, and then there’s \"Dune.\" Not since 2015’s “Mad Max: Fury Road” has a studio film felt this epic and tactile, with sweeping sets and locations that immerse you in the intergalactic world of Frank Herbert's 1965 sci-fi novel. Like \"Fury Road,\" which picked up six Oscars for technical achievements, \"Dune\" is destined to be a formidable player in categories including best production design and cinematography. Eleven-time nominated composer Hans Zimmer could also earn his second best original score Oscar for his exhilarating work here.\n\nBut what about best picture or director (for Denis Villeneuve)? Many critics' chief complaint about \"Dune\" is that it doesn't feel like a whole movie, with heavy exposition and an abrupt ending meant to tee up a planned sequel. And despite a strong ensemble led by Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson and scene-stealer Charlotte Rampling, Villeneuve favors scope over storytelling, which could prove alienating to some voters, who similarly shunned his \"Blade Runner: 2049\" for top awards.\n\nWhere to watch: \"Dune\" is in theaters and streaming on HBO Max on Oct. 22.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/12"}]}

Her appointment fills a monthslong leadership void that the UK has endured as its worst economic crisis in decades has worsened.\n\nSpeaking on the steps of Downing Street on Tuesday evening, Truss said her priorities were delivering tax cuts to grow the economy, improving Britain's energy security amid soaring prices, and fixing the National Health Service, thoug she did not outline any specific policies.\n\nShe also said she would defend freedom and democracy in the face of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\n\"I will deal hands on with the energy crisis forged by Putin's war.

Experts have warned that people will become destitute and cold-weather deaths will rise unless something is done fast.\n\nThe Bank of England anticipates that inflation in the UK will jump to 13% as the energy crisis intensifies, and that the country will enter recession before the end of the year.

Kwasi Kwarteng and Suella Braverman are tipped for promotions; two Johnson loyalists, Nadine Dorries and Priti Patel, have quit.\n\nTruss will also be expected to outline her plans for dealing with the UK's urgent cost-of-living crisis as soon as possible. Her political opponents, both inside and outside the Conservative Party, will not deem it acceptable if the new leader fails to outline specific policies in the next 48 hours.\n\nTruss will then face the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, for her first Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday afternoon, which will be seen by her team as an important moment to set the tone of her leadership.\n\nParticular attention will be paid to how much Truss deviate's from Johnson's legislative agenda, particularly as she was seen as the Johnson continuity candidate in the leadership race.\n\nJUST WATCHED See how Boris Johnson left Downing Street for final time Replay More Videos ...

Like Thatcher, Truss has come from relatively humble beginnings to dominate a world inhabited largely by men.\n\nTruss ran her leadership campaign on a classic Conservative platform, promising tax cuts for citizens and no new taxes for businesses, including ruling out a windfall tax on energy companies to deal with the UK's cost-of-living crisis.\n\nAnalysts are skeptical that Truss's tax-cutting policies will do much help citizens, especially after a decade of Conservative austerity policies. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research group focusing on public finances, said last month that Truss and leadership rival Rishi Sunak, who were both promising tax cuts and smaller government spending, \"need to recognise this even greater-than-usual uncertainty in the public finances.\"\n\nDespite voting to remain in the European Union back in 2016, in recent years she has emerged as one of the most vocal critics of the European Union and staunchest supporters of Brexit.\n\nBut critics have accused her new-found hardline Brexit stance of being a cynical ploy. They have pointed to the fact that throughout her adult life Truss has evolved, from being an anti-monarchist Liberal Democrat in favor of legalizing drugs in her youth to the embodiment of the Conservative right today.\n\nBefore the Brexit referendum, Truss said that she was \"backing remain as I believe it is in Britain's economic interest and means we can focus on vital economic and social reform at home.\" Cabinet colleagues at the time said she never voiced any opposition to staying in the EU, despite having ample opportunities to do so.\n\nThese days, Truss is more than happy to pick fights with Brussels and to claim that it was the EU all along that held the British economy back.\n\nTruss' victory over Sunak, the former finance secretary, was smaller than expected, which means she may have to accommodate a wider range of views from her party. That could entail embracing more of Sunak's ideas around the cost-of-living crisis, and a less aggressive approach to tax cuts.\n\nMany Conservative MPs are privately worried that Truss' modern-day Thatcherism could cost them the next election, and will be leaping on the surprisingly low margin of victory to encourage her to soften her economic stance.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/09/05/liz-truss-uk-leader-margaret-thatcher-devotee/7957970001/", "title": "Liz Truss to become U.K.'s prime minister: What it means, what to know", "text": "Liz Truss is Britain's third prime minister in three years\n\nTruss won 57% of votes from 172,000 Conservative Party activists - less than 1% of UK population\n\nTruss replaces Boris Johnson, who leaves office Tuesday\n\nLONDON – Liz Truss became Britain's third female prime minister after Monday's announcement by the ruling Conservative Party that she would replace Boris Johnson.\n\nTruss, 47, has portrayed herself as the political heir to Margaret Thatcher, Britain's formidable cheerleader for free markets and low taxes, a strong supporter of the Anglo-American alliance and a dynamo who played a key role in ending the Cold War.

She was born in 1975 into a family that she herself has described as \"to the left of Labour,\" Britain's main left-wingparty. She grew up in parts of the UK that didn't traditionally vote Conservative, moving between Scotland and the north of England.\n\nIn contrast with her privately educated cabinet colleagues, Truss went to a state school in the Yorkshire city of Leeds, and later won a place at Oxford University. There she was an active member of the Liberal Democrats, a centrist opposition party that has long been an effective opponent to the Conservatives in large parts of England.\n\nDuring her time as a Liberal Democrat, Truss supported the legalization of cannabis and the abolition of the royal family -- positions that are at total odds with what most would consider to be mainstream Conservatism in 2022.\n\nTruss says she joined the Conservatives in 1996, just two years after she gave a speech at a Liberal Democrat conference calling for the end of the monarchy.\n\nEven during her time as a Liberal Democrat, her peers questioned her sincerity and spotted traits that they say they still see in her today.\n\n\"I honestly think she was playing to the gallery back then, whether she was talking about decriminalizing drugs or abolishing the monarchy,\" Neil Fawcett, a Liberal Democrat councilor who campaigned with Truss in the 1990s, told CNN. \"I think she is someone who plays to the gallery with whatever audience she is talking to, and I genuinely don't know if she ever believes anything she says, then or now.\"\n\nTruss has certainly continued to capture the attention of her audience. Since joining the Conservatives and becoming a lawmaker, she has fervently supported almost every conceivable ideology. She served loyally under three prime ministers in several different cabinet jobs, most recently as foreign secretary.\n\nMost notably, she supported remaining in the European Union in the UK's referendum in 2016. At the time, Truss tweeted that she was backing those who wanted to remain in the bloc because \"it is in Britain's economic interest and means we can focus on vital economic and social reform at home.\"\n\nTruss now backs Brexit, saying that her fears before the referendum that it could cause \"disruption\" were mistaken.\n\nTruss greets US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at a G7 summit in Liverpool last December.\n\nRecently, the new leader even went so far in burnishing her Brexiteer credentials as to refuse to call French President Emmanuel Macron an ally. When asked if he was friend or foe during a live broadcast, she said the \"jury's out.\"\n\nThere is a debate within the Conservative Party as to how real this support of Euroskepticism is. Some think Truss was reluctantly following government orders, which opposed Brexit, in 2016. Others find that argument inconceivable.\n\nAnna Soubry, a former Conservative cabinet minister and anti-Brexit campaigner, told CNN that Truss \"had the most cover out of any of us to support Brexit. Her brief at the time included the farming community, who supported Brexit on the whole. I sat around the cabinet table and heard everyone's reason for doing what they did and find it hard to believe she's changed her mind quite this much.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Gavin Barwell, who served as former Prime Minister Theresa May's chief-of-staff, said that, after the Brexit vote, \"Truss made a decision very quickly that there wasn't room for a compromise. If you were to do it, it needed to be done fully. And as the stalemate dragged on, she argued that a binary choice was coming between leaving with no deal and Brexit being reversed, and the latter would be catastrophic for the government.\"\n\nTruss has been compared to Margaret Thatcher, who also wore a fur hat on an official visit to Moscow.\n\nThe closer she has edged to power, the more Britons have wondered what a Truss premiership would look like. She has campaigned to lead on the most conservative of agendas. She has pledged to slash taxes from day one, tear up EU regulations and encourage private sector growth with low corporation tax. She has said she will not impose a windfall tax on energy companies despite their posting huge profits during the current cost-of-living and energy crisis.\n\nTruss faces a challenge of forging a path for the Conservative Party, which has been in power for 12 years and has been bitterly divided over Brexit for half that period.\n\nThese sorts of policies were, of course, red meat to the Conservative members who ultimately voted for her. And while some of those who know her question how much she actually believes in them, there is little doubt she will put her full effort into implementing them and making her impact immediately felt.\n\nIt's possible that a Truss government will ultimately look a lot like Johnson's, but with a greater emphasis on cutting taxes, shrinking the state and, potentially, an even harder line on Europe.\n\nCritics have said the tax cuts she's promised would lead to even greater inflation and rises in interest rates amid a forecast recession. Questions were also raised over a pledge Truss made to cut public sector pay, allegedly saving the public $8.8 billion. Her economics were questioned by her critics, and the uproar over perceived callousness toward public sector workers forced Truss to U-turn.\n\nJulian Glover, a journalist and speech writer to former Prime Minister David Cameron, was a university contemporary of Truss and remembers traits in her that are still recognizable today: determined but unfocused.\n\n\"We only passed each other briefly and she was in a different year to me, but despite that, she stands out in my memory as a sort of strange, unfocused force, hugely in favor of action and change,\" Glover told CNN. \"It was always hard to see the aim of it all, or where it might lead, except that she would be at the center of it.\"\n\nRoger Crouch, who succeeded Truss as president of Oxford University Liberal Democrats, told CNN that he remembers a woman who was \"determined, single-minded and willing to challenge orthodox and prevailing, often male, wisdom.\"\n\nUnlike many of those who knew Truss in her younger years, Crouch, who is now a teacher, thinks her opinions haven't changed a huge amount since the 90s. \"Liz was always more of a privatizing, libertarian liberal so there is a consistent thread of thought there. I remember a student discussion group in which she advocated privatization of lamp posts.\"\n\nThose who know Truss say that while her views have changed over the years, she has always been determined and single-minded.\n\nPrime Minister Truss will have a hard time uniting her party, which has been in power for 12 years and has been bitterly divided over Brexit for six of them.\n\nShe will also have to lead the country through its worst cost-of-living crisis in decades. Inflation is at a 40-year high, energy bills are set to increase by hundreds, possibly thousands, of pounds a year, and the UK is forecast to enter a recession before the end of the year.\n\nIn July, inflation rose above 10% for the first time in 40 years, driven largely by the rising cost of energy, food and fuel. According to the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% by the end of the year. The central bank also predicted that the UK will enter a recession before the end of 2022.\n\nAnalysts are skeptical that Truss' tax-cutting policies will do much to help citizens. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research group focusing on public finances, said last month that the leadership contestants, who were both promising tax cuts and lower government spending, \"need to recognise this even greater-than-usual uncertainty in the public finances.\"\n\nThis winter, many families will have to make a grim choice between heating their homes and eating.

Ten Conservatives stood in the contest to replace him, and over five rounds of voting, members of parliament whittled those down to two.\n\nSunak won 137 votes and Truss got 113 votes in the final round, while Penny Mordaunt with 105 votes lost out.\n\nBoth of the final two candidates took to Twitter to comment on the result.\n\n\"Grateful that my colleagues have put their trust in me today. I will work night and day to deliver our message around the country,\" tweeted Sunak.\n\nFor her part, Truss tweeted: \"Thank you for putting your trust in me. I'm ready to hit the ground running from day one.\"\n\nNow about 160,000 rank-and-file members of the party will have their say, and in September the winner -- and next prime minister -- will be announced.\n\nBoth candidates who made it to the final two in the Conservative party leadership contest served in Johnson's government, and could therefore be marred by the scandals that brought Johnson down.\n\nThe first was Johnson whipping his members of parliament to protect a political ally found to have breached lobbying rules, and ended with revelations that Johnson appointed as his deputy chief whip Chris Pincher, a man who'd been accused of sexual assault multiple times.\n\nThe best known scandal was \"Partygate\" in which Johnson and several political allies -- including Sunak -- were fined by police for breaching the government's own Covid-19 restrictions. This made Johnson the first premier in history to be found guilty of having broken the law in office.\n\nThe task facing the final two candidates is enormous enough, with the UK suffering a cost-of-living crisis and the Conservative Party increasingly unpopular after 12 years in power. And as soon as the new leader takes over, the opposition Labour Party will be only too willing to remind whoever succeeds Johnson that they were part of that government.\n\nOn Wednesday, Johnson attended his final Prime Minister's Questions session in the House of Commons. He boasted about his government's response to the pandemic and his support of Ukraine in its defense against Russia.\n\n\"We've helped, I've helped, get this country through a pandemic and help save another country from barbarism.

He served as Johnson's Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) from 2020 to 2022, and gained a largely positive public profile after introducing popular measures during the coronavirus pandemic, such as the furlough scheme and discounts on eating in restaurants.\n\nHe has recently come under pressure over questions regarding the tax status of his wife, Akshata Murthy, a multi-millionaire who is domiciled in India.\n\nSome Conservatives were worried that Sunak found this level of scrutiny hard, and are concerned he would buckle under the pressure of being prime minister.\n\nDespite this, he has consistently led the pack among Conservative MPs in the first rounds of voting.\n\nPolling of Conservative members can be difficult, especially at such tumultuous times, but in those that have taken place Sunak has consistently come second to Truss among party members.\n\nEven if he did make it to power, he would have to overcome criticism from political enemies of all stripes. Opposition leaders would be quick to remind Sunak that he was fined at the same Partygate event as Johnson.\n\nThey will also ask why Sunak remained loyal to Johnson for so long, only resigning after the scandal involving Johnson's chief whip, Chris Pincher.\n\nThings get worse when you factor in Johnson loyalists, who believe that Sunak's resignation was the moment Johnson's premiership began to crumble.\n\nSo, while Sunak might be the frontrunner, he will be surrounded by enemies on all sides.\n\nTruss is currently UK foreign secretary.\n\nLiz Truss\n\nTruss also has a Johnson association problem. She is still serving as Johnson's foreign secretary and will do so until he finally leaves office in September. She has stood by her leader throughout all of his scandals, justifying that fact she didn't resign over the Pincher scandal because she was coordinating the UK's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThat explanation might wash with some, however Truss is also largely thought of by Conservatives as the Johnson continuation candidate. Among her chief endorsers are some of Johnson's most loyal allies, which could make dissociating herself from the current PM tricky.\n\nIt will also be tricky to distance herself from Johnson's policies. Truss, who voted for the UK to remain in the European Union, has become an arch-Brexiteer since the 2016 referendum.\n\nSince Johnson has taken office, she's been his trade secretary and his foreign secretary. As the former, she has tub-thumped as loudly as Johnson over each and every trade deal signed, even ones that were simply rollover deals from the UK's time in the EU.\n\nShe has also been an ardent supporter of Johnson's plan to rewrite a controversial part of the Brexit deal, the Northern Ireland Protocol.\n\nTruss has spent much of her time in high office building a power base and is very popular among both MPs and the Conservative grassroots.\n\nSunak and Truss will now spend the summer campaigning to Conservative grassroot members before the victor is announced by the party on September 5.\n\nAfter that, Johnson will resign to the Queen, whom his successor will then visit and be invited to form a government.", "authors": ["Analysis Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/uk/new-british-prime-minister-announcement-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "UK Tory leadership race: What time will Britain's new prime minister ...", "text": "London (CNN) Britons will find out later Monday who will be their next prime minister as the country faces a looming economic and humanitarian crisis, almost two months after Boris Johnson quit in the wake of a series of scandals.\n\nAt approximately 12:30 p.m. local time (7:30 a.m. ET) the ruling Conservative Party will announce the results of its leadership election, in which the two contenders in the final round, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and former finance minister Rishi Sunak, sharply criticized each other's plans.\n\nTruss, a low-tax evangelist and the poster-child for the British Conservative right, is the strong favorite to beat Sunak, the former chancellor of the exchequer, who voted for Brexit but has now taken a softer tone on how the UK should deal with the EU.\n\nThe winner of the contest will, as leader of the largest party in the House of Commons, take over as prime minister until the next general election, which must be held by December 2024.\n\nWhoever triumphs will likely travel Tuesday to meet Queen Elizabeth II to receive an invitation to form a government.

The list will then be whittled down to two, and the party’s grassroot members will be given the final say.\n\nJohnson announced on Thursday he would step down, after nearly 60 lawmakers and government officials resigned over his handling of a series of scandals, including illegal gatherings held at his Downing Street office in defiance of coronavirus lockdown rules and his failure to act on sexual misconduct allegations against his deputy chief whip.\n\nNow, with the government in tatters, bookmakers and much of Britain are speculating about his likely successor. A slew of contenders have thrown their hat into the ring – from household names to lesser-known Conservative members of parliament.\n\nAmong those to announce their candidacy are an Iraqi Kurdish refugee, the children of Indian and Pakistani immigrants and several women – reflecting efforts by the Conservative Party to field more ethnically diverse candidates for Parliament in recent years.\n\nAny candidates who run for the leadership will go through rounds of voting by Conservative lawmakers until only two remain – at which point Conservative Party members nationwide will vote.

Jessica Taylor/UK Parliament/Reuters\n\nThe former chancellor formally announced he was standing to succeed Johnson in a campaign video on Friday, which began with the story of his Indian parents, who both emigrated to the UK from East Africa. “It was Britain, our country, that gave them and millions like them the chance of a better future,” he said. “I want to lead this country in the right direction.”\n\nSunak was Johnson’s presumed successor for several months after he won praise for overseeing Britain’s initial financial response to the Covid-19 pandemic. But he has suffered several of his own scandals while in government.\n\nHis stock sank earlier this year after revelations that he broke Covid regulations to attend the prime minister’s birthday party on June 19, 2020, for which he later apologized “unreservedly.”\n\nHis financial and legal affairs came under scrutiny this spring following reports his wife had non-domicile status in the UK – meaning she was not liable to pay tax on overseas income – and that he held a US green card while serving as minister.\n\nHis popularity has also taken a beating in recent weeks as Britain has suffered the worst cost-of-living crisis in decades. Sunak has struggled to keep down spiraling inflation and has been criticized by opposition parties for what they call a slow and inadequate series of financial measures. Among the economic woes facing Britons after Sunak’s time as the UK’s chief financial minister: real wages dropping to their lowest levels in more than 21 years and inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in May.\n\nBut he is still among the bookmakers’ odds-on favorites to take Johnson’s job.\n\nSajid Javid\n\nFormer Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nThe former health secretary, whose resignation set off a wave of departures from Johnson’s government, officially announced his candidacy on Sunday.\n\n“Whether it’s the cost of living or it’s low levels of growth, for me, that’s our most immediate challenge… You need someone with an economic plan from day one,” he said, adding that his economic plan would have two prongs: short-term measures to help people meet cost-of-living challenges and a longer-term plan for tax reform.\n\nPosting on Twitter on Sunday, Javid said: “The next Prime Minister needs integrity, experience, and a tax-cutting plan for economic growth. That’s why I’m standing.”\n\nThe statement echoed Javid’s resignation speech in the House of Commons in which he said that something was “fundamentally wrong” with government.\n\nThose who support Javid’s candidacy hope that he will be credited for triggering Johnson’s ultimate ouster, having been the first cabinet minister to resign – though Sunak followed him minutes later.\n\nThe MP has twice run for party leadership in the past – in 2016, after the Brexit referendum, and in 2019, when Johnson was ultimately elected. He served as chancellor from 2019 to 2020.\n\nHis family immigrated from Pakistan to the UK in the 1960s, and his father worked as a bus driver.\n\nLiz Truss\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe foreign secretary made her leadership ambitions known in The Telegraph on Sunday. At the heart of her leadership bid is a pledge to cut taxes “from day one,” to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nLiz Truss became the chief negotiator with the European Union on the UK’s Brexit deal in December 2021 and has held multiple cabinet positions. Since voting Remain in 2016, she has since become one of the loudest Euroskeptic voices in the government, which many have chalked up to her desire for the top job.\n\nShe has a formidable and dedicated team around her – some of whom previously worked in Number 10 – which has been producing slick videos and photos of her looking thoroughly statesmanlike. She has apparently attempted to channel former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, wearing a headscarf while driving a tank, and her role in fronting the response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also heightened her public profile.\n\nIn her comment piece in The Telegraph, she highlighted her foreign policy expertise, writing: “As Foreign Secretary, I have helped to lead the international response to Putin’s war in Ukraine and delivered a tough sanctions package that has led the world, by imposing real pain on Putin and the Kremlin.”\n\nTruss is popular among Conservative members, who would pick the eventual winner of a contest. But Johnson’s downfall could simultaneously tarnish anyone in his cabinet, meaning Conservative voters could turn to a backbencher to take the mantle.\n\nPenny Mordaunt\n\nBritain's Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt. Aaron Chown/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nThe trade minister, one of the bookmakers’ favorites to replace Johnson, announced her bid for the leadership on Sunday. A poll of party members published July 4 by website Conservative Home put her as the second favorite choice, behind the current defense secretary Ben Wallace, who has ruled himself out of the race.\n\nPenny Mordaunt first entered parliament in 2010 and later joined the cabinet under Theresa May, serving as international development and defense secretary.\n\nAfter last month’s confidence vote, Mordaunt declined to comment on whether she backed Johnson, raising eyebrows among Westminster observers when she said: “I didn’t choose this prime minister.”\n\nAnnouncing her interest in the top job, she said the party “leadership needs to become a little less about the leader and a lot more about the ship.”\n\nMordaunt, who in 2019 became the first woman to serve as defense minister, invoked Thatcher in her statement, saying the former Conservative leader “was remarkable for not just what she did but the speed she did it.”\n\n“She had a vision and a plan. So do I,” she added.\n\nTom Tugendhat\n\nCommittee chairman Tom Tugendhat. Niall Carson/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nA former British military officer who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat has been one of Johnson’s most robust critics and has called for the Conservative Party to drop its focus on “divisive politics.”\n\nLaunching his leadership bid on Thursday in The Telegraph newspaper, Tugendhat wrote: “I have served before – in the military, and now in Parliament. Now I hope to answer the call once again as prime minister. It’s time for a clean start. It’s time for renewal.”\n\nHe outlined his vision for tackling the cost of living crisis, reducing taxes and investing in neglected regions of the UK.\n\nDespite not having any cabinet or shadow cabinet experience, Tugendhat has impressed colleagues with his oratory skills and seriousness, most notably when he spoke about the fall of Afghanistan. He entered parliament in 2015 after serving in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\nSome key centrist Conservatives have already been throwing their support behind the relative wildcard, but some worry that his experience is too focused on foreign affairs.\n\nNadhim Zahawi\n\nBritain's newly appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer Nadhim Zahawi. Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLess than two days after he was appointed by Johnson to the role of chancellor, replacing Sunak, Nadhim Zahawi publicly called on the prime minister to resign and later launched his bid to replace him.\n\nUntil his promotion, Zahawi, who joined the cabinet less than a year ago, was considered an unlikely choice as the next leader of the Conservative Party. But his rise under Johnson has been rapid, making his mark with early success as vaccines minister amid the coronavirus pandemic and then as education secretary.\n\nIn his pitch for leadership, previewed in The Spectator magazine, he promised to lower taxes for individuals, families and business, boost defense spending, and continue with education reforms he started in his previous role.\n\nDespite voting to leave the European Union in 2016, Zahawi is widely admired among the moderates in the party. Crucially, as one Conservative source put it, “he’s not been in government long enough to have any obvious defects and, despite supporting Boris even after the confidence vote, is not too tainted by association.”\n\nZahawi was born in Iraq to Kurdish parents and came to the UK as a child, when his family fled Saddam Hussein’s regime. He is believed to be one of the richest politicians in the House of Commons, and helped found the polling company YouGov.\n\n“If a young boy who came here aged 11 without a word of English, can serve at the highest levels of Her Majesty’s Government and run to be the next Prime Minister, anything is possible,” Zahawi is set to say in a speech Monday, an excerpt of which was published by The Spectator.\n\nJeremy Hunt\n\nConservative MP Jeremy Hunt. Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nA former health and foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt lost the 2019 leadership vote to Johnson. He has since styled himself as an antidote to Johnson and is without question the highest profile contender on the moderate, ex-Remain side of the party.\n\nHunt announced his bid to become the next Conservative leader in an interview with British newspaper The Sunday Telegraph, pitching himself as “the only major candidate who has not served in Boris Johnson’s government.”\n\nIn a statement on Twitter ahead of the confidence vote in June, Hunt said: “Anyone who believes our country is stronger, fairer & more prosperous when led by Conservatives should reflect that the consequence of not changing will be to hand the country to others who do not share those values. Today’s decision is change or lose. I will be voting for change.”\n\nTellingly, Hunt’s statement focused mainly on the Conservatives’ chances of electoral success under Johnson, rather than his policies or the partygate scandal – a decision that could be read as a pitch to the Conservative MPs and members who would decide a leadership election. However, he comes with baggage, and sources from the opposition Labour Party have told CNN they are already writing attack lines.\n\n“It can’t be Jeremy. Labour can say he was running healthcare for six years and failed to prepare for a pandemic. They can say when he was culture secretary he chummed up to the Murdochs during the phone hacking scandal. He will get crushed,” a senior Conservative source told CNN.\n\nGrant Shapps\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps. Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nThe transport secretary launched his bid for prime minister this weekend, describing himself as a “problem solver, with a proven record of delivery” in a post on Twitter.\n\nOutlining his vision for the UK in an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper, Grant Shapps said that within his first 100 days in office he would produce an emergency budget to lower tax for “the most vulnerable” and give state support to firms with high levels of energy consumption.\n\n“We have had two-and-a-half years of tactical government by an often distracted centre. This must end. We must be a strategic government, sober in its analysis, and not chasing the next headline,” the paper quoted Shapps as saying.\n\nThe MP for Welwyn Hatfield was elected in 2005 and has held several ministerial posts. He is also a former co-chair of the Conservative party.\n\nKemi Badenoch\n\nConservative MP Kemi Badenoch. Ben Cawthra/Shutterstock\n\nThe former equalities minister launched her leadership bid in an op-ed published by the Times of London newspaper, saying she wants a “strong but limited government focused on the essentials.”\n\nKemi Badenoch resigned from the government on Wednesday citing “issues” that had “come to light” and the way they had been handled.\n\n“I’m putting myself forward in this leadership election because I want to tell the truth. It’s the truth that will set us free,” she wrote Saturday. Badenoch, who voted in favor of Brexit in 2016, added she would run on a “smart and nimble centre-right vision.”\n\nSuella Braverman\n\nAttorney General Suella Braverman. Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nLast week, the attorney general called for Johnson to quit and said that she would join a leadership race to replace him, telling ITV “it would be the greatest honor.”\n\nLaunching her bid a few days later, Suella Braverman wrote in The Daily Telegraph: “I saw Brexit as the most important political decision of my life. My views are not triangulated or calibrated. They are as much a part of me as my DNA. I now realise that I cannot rely on others to take Conservatism forward.”\n\nBraverman was elected as MP for Fareham in 2015.\n\nRehman Chishti\n\nConservative MP Rehman Chishti. rehmanchishti.com\n\nAmong the biggest outsiders in the race, the newly appointed Foreign Office minister threw his hat into the ring on Sunday.\n\nBorn in Pakistan, Rehman Chishti moved to the UK at the age of six, learning English at school in Gillingham, Kent, the area of southeastern England that he has represented as an MP since 2010. He went on to become the first in his family to go to university and received his law degree.\n\n“It’s important to ensure that everyone who works hard, who’s determined, who perseveres, that they have a government that is on their side,” he said in a Facebook video announcing his candidacy, adding that he would ensure lower taxes and fresh ideas to improve people’s lives.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh Luke Mcgee", "Eliza Mackintosh", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/europe/boris-johnson-resignation-intl/index.html", "title": "Boris Johnson: UK Prime Minister resigns after mutiny in his party ...", "text": "London (CNN) Boris Johnson's turbulent tenure as Britain's Prime Minister came to an end Thursday after a historic party revolt over a series of ethics scandals forced him to step down.\n\nIt took the resignation of nearly 60 members of his government -- almost half the payroll -- for Johnson to finally abandon his attempts to cling on to power. Even then, the Prime Minister insisted that he would continue as caretaker leader while the Conservative Party launches the process of choosing a successor\n\nSome senior figures in his party say even that will be unsustainable, given the dwindling number of people willing to work for him.\n\nOthers are already lining up to replace him. Party officials say they will announce the timetable for a leadership election by Monday.\n\nSpeaking in front of the famous 10 Downing Street door, the same place where many of his predecessors delivered their own resignation address, Johnson announced that he would be stepping down -- without actually saying the words out loud.\n\n\"It is clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader of that party and therefore, a new prime minister,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"The process of choosing that new leader should begin now,\" he added, saying the time line will be announced next week.\n\nIn a sign that he is planning to stay in the office for as long as he can, Johnson announced he had appointed a new cabinet \"to serve, as I will, until a new leader is in place.\" Appointing new cabinet ministers means that the government can continue to function as he prepares to depart.\n\nJohnson spoke of his attempts to stay on as leader and how \"painful\" it is for him to step down, but made no mention of the scandals that have proved his political downfall.\n\n\"In the last few days, I've tried to persuade my colleagues that it would be eccentric to change governments when we're delivering so much... and when the economic scene is so difficult domestically and internationally,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"I regret not to have been successful in those arguments, and of course, it's painful, not to be able to see through so many ideas and projects myself,\" he said, adding that he's proud of \"getting Brexit done\" and \"leading the West in standing up to Putin's aggression in Ukraine.\"\n\nJohnson went on to address voters directly, expressing sadness at stepping down after nearly three years.\n\n\"To you, the British public: I know that there will be many people who are relieved and, perhaps, quite a few will also be disappointed,\" he said. \"And I want you to know how sad I am to be giving up the best job in the world, but them's the breaks.\"\n\nJohnson has in recent months been engulfed in a series of scandals that forced even his most stalwart supporters to abandon him. The latest was Downing Street's botched handling of the resignation by Johnson's former deputy chief whip, Chris Pincher, who was accused of groping two men last week.\n\nJohnson initially attempted to ride out the crisis -- despite an unprecedented flight of middle-ranking ministers from the government, a battering at Prime Minister's Questions and a bruising appearance before a committee of senior lawmakers in Parliament. On Wednesday, he still insisted he wasn't going to resign.\n\nHe finally gave in Thursday after some of his most loyal allies told him that the game was up.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Johnson had made the \"right decision\" to resign. \"We need calmness and unity now and to keep governing while a new leader is found,\" she added.\n\nGreg Clark, newly appointed UK Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, said that he had a \"duty to ensure that the country has a functioning government.\"\n\nThe leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, said it was \"good news for the country\" that Johnson had decided to resign, adding that \"it should have happened long ago.\"\n\n\"He was always unfit for office. He has been responsible for lies, scandal and fraud on an industrial scale,\" said Starmer on Twitter.\n\nThe opposition leader also had scathing words for the Conservatives. \"They have been in power for 12 years. The damage they have done is profound. Twelve years of economic stagnation. Twelve years of declining public services. Twelve years of empty promises,\" Starmer said.\n\n\"Enough is enough. We don't need to change the Tory at the top -- we need a proper change of government. We need a fresh start for Britain.\"\n\nTimeline of Boris Johnson's scandals September 9, 2019 Suspends Parliament Two months into his premiership, Boris Johnson prorogues -- or suspends -- Parliament for five weeks ahead of an October 31 deadline to leave the European Union. Opponents say it's an attempt to shut down debate where Parliament can decide the type of Brexit deal with the EU. September 24 The Supreme Court rules Johnson's decision to prorogue Parliament was illegal and he is forced to apologise to the Queen. April 21, 2021 Favors The BBC leaks text messages of Johnson saying he would \"fix\" concerns about a change in tax status for the staff of inventor James Dyson who were in the UK to build ventilators during the Covid-19 pandemic. November 2021 Johnson pressures Conservative MPs to overturn the suspension of Owen Paterson, a fellow Conservative MP accused of breaching lobbying rules. The next day, following a backlash, Johnson made a U-turn and Paterson resigned. December 7 A Foreign Office whistleblower leaked emails suggesting Johnson may have lied about evacuating animals before people desperate to escape the Taliban amidst the withdrawal from Afghanistan. December Partygate Allegations emerge of illegal parties taking place at Downing Street in the midst of lockdown. This was the start of the scandal that became known as \"Partygate.\" Johnson maintains that \"all guidance was followed completely in No. 10.\" December 7 A video is leaked showing a press briefing rehearsal with government adviser Allegra Stratton joking about illegal parties at Downing Street. Johnson denies any lockdown rules had been broken. Allegra Stratton in the leaked video published by ITV News. December 9 Refurbishments The Electoral Commission fines Johnson for failing to declare where the funds came from to refurbish his Downing Street residence. Johnson faced allegations of corruption after Whatsapp messages were leaked that showed Johnson asking a Conservative Party donor for funds. January 12 Johnson admits he attended a party at Downing Street but that he thought it was a \"work event.\" This was considered a farcical excuse, and the British public backlash ensued. January 12, 2022 Contracts for friends London's High Court ruled that it was unlawful for Johnson's government to have awarded contracts, without competition in 2020 to personal protective equipment suppliers with political connections. January 31 Partygate continues First version of Sue Gray's report is released. It provides details of how Johnson broke pandemic rules that he himself set for the public. April 12 Johnson and his chancellor are fined by the police for breaking lockdown rules by having illegal parties in Downing Street. This is the first time a sitting Prime Minister has been fined for breaking the law. May 25 The full Sue Gray report is released with further details of illegal parties such as \"red wine spilled on one wall.\" Gray concludes that senior leadership must \"bear responsibility for this culture\" that allowed such parties to take place.

Raab has deputized for Johnson in the past: When the PM was in intensive care with Covid-19 in April 2020 and then again briefly last month when Johnson underwent \"routine\" operation and was put under general anesthetic.\n\nRaab said he would not stand as next Conservative party leader, according to Britain's PA news agency, which would make him a candidate for a caretaker PM if Johnson was to step down early.\n\n\"I am absolutely determined that we should not prolong this crisis. If it's agreed within government that Boris Johnson should continue as caretaker, then that's fine with me,\" Baker told CNN. \"Because we need to just end the crisis, get into a leadership contest, and start fresh in September.\"\n\nFormer British Prime Minister John Major said it would be \"unwise and may be unsustainable\" for Johnson to remain in the office of prime minister for long while a new Conservative leader is chosen.

But his premiership unraveled in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nIn recent months the prime minister has faced a barrage of criticism from all sides over his conduct and that of some members of his government, including illegal, Covid-19 lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices for which he and others were fined.\n\nNumerous other scandals have also hit his standing in the polls. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and ordering MPs to vote in such a way that would protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nLast month, he survived a confidence vote among members of his own party, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nHe suffered a further blow late last month when his party lost two parliamentary by-elections in a single night, raising new questions about his leadership.\n\nHis reputation was also damaged by the resignation of his second ethics adviser in less than two years.", "authors": ["Jack Guy", "Luke Mcgee", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/investing/liz-truss-economy-pound-crisis/index.html", "title": "The problem that should be keeping Liz Truss awake at night | CNN ...", "text": "London (CNN Business) Liz Truss has a lot on her plate . The United Kingdom is heading for a recession. Workers are going on strike as inflation erodes their living standards. And millions of people and thousands of businesses need immediate relief from soaring energy bills to get through the winter.\n\n\"This is a tough time for the economy,\" former Prime Minister Boris Johnson conceded Tuesday in his farewell speech\n\nSpeaking on her arrival in Downing Street, Truss said she would \"ride out the storm,\" promising help with energy bills as well as tax cuts. But the incoming prime minister is in a bind. If her government borrows a lot of money, it risks further fanning inflation and inflaming burgeoning fears among investors that the country's finances are becoming unsustainable.\n\nThat could send the pound into a tailspin, which would further drive up prices and make it harder to pay for essential imports.\n\nIn other words, the United Kingdom could endure the type of meltdown it suffered in the 1970s, when the combination of an energy shock, rising prices and hefty government spending forced the country to turn to the International Monetary Fund for a big bailout — an alarming prospect for a G7 economy.\n\nNot long ago, this type of scenario would have sounded outlandish as a talking point. But as Truss teases a huge energy relief package and talks of tax cuts, and the pound remains mired near its lowest level in decades — some analysts are warning that a \"balance of payments\" crisis can't be ruled out.\n\n\"Ultimately, whether these risks materialize boils down to the credibility of policy from the new government in coming weeks and months,\" Deutsche Bank strategist Shreyas Gopal said in a note to clients on Monday titled \"Crunch time for sterling.\"\n\nElectricity pylons in East London on Aug. 25. The country's regulator has confirmed energy bills could rise 80% in October.\n\nWhat is a balance-of-payments crisis?\n\nThe former governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, once observed that the United Kingdom depends on the \"kindness of strangers.\" That's because it runs a big current account deficit, meaning it needs foreign investors to keep pumping money into the economy so it can pay for imports and meet other important obligations.\n\nIf they lose confidence, turmoil in the financial system can quickly snowball. As traders dump the country's currency, its value plunges, feeding inflation and compelling the central bank to hike interest rates even higher to try to get the situation under control. That can worsen recessionary conditions, and so the spiral continues.\n\nInvestors typically look for these circumstances to crop up in emerging markets — especially those that hold debt in dollars. When their currency drops, that makes it even costlier to pay back their obligations. The most commonly touted example these days is Argentina, which signed a $44 billion debt deal with the IMF in March\n\nYet there is precedent in the United Kingdom. When the pound quickly lost value against the US dollar in the mid-1970s, the country was forced to ask the IMF for $3.9 billion, Gopal noted. At the time, that was the largest amount ever requested.\n\nThe pound is on the ropes again now. It dropped briefly on Monday to about $1.14, its lowest level since 1985. It's lost nearly 15% of its value against the US dollar so far this year. That's even worse than the euro, which has dropped less than 13%. UK government borrowing costs are also rising at a rapid clip as investors dump the country's bonds.\n\nInvestors are fleeing British assets because of concerns about the economy. UK inflation is the highest in the G7, and could shoot up further next year if the natural gas prices remain elevated. The Bank of England has been hiking interest rates since last December and may be forced to take even more aggressive action.\n\n\"UK assets are very unloved at the moment,\" said Paul O'Connor, head of the UK-based multi-asset team at Janus Henderson. \"The core reason, of course, is the UK is facing a really acute cost-of-living crisis and significant political uncertainty surrounding that.\"\n\nThat's a major problem for the United Kingdom because it has a record current account deficit, according to Gopal, which means it spends more on goods, services and investments abroad than it brings in at home. Years of anemic growth and a hit to trade after Brexit haven't helped.\n\n\"Sterling requires large capital inflows supported by improving investor confidence and falling inflation expectations,\" Gopal wrote. \"However, the opposite is happening.\"\n\nThe United Kingdom isn't Argentina, but ...\n\nThe currency ticked slightly higher on Tuesday as Truss officially began her tenure as prime minister.\n\nInvestors were heartened by early reports about her plans to address the energy crisis, which are expected to be announced this week. She's expected to announce a cap on energy bills by borrowing £100 billion ($115 billion). That would exceed even the €95 billion ($94 billion) the German government has committed to tackle similar problems.\n\n\"Investors do regard this as a fairly decisive way to ease recession risks in the UK,\" O'Connor said.\n\nBut questions could resurface about how she plans to pay for that relief package, and other campaign pledges — such as jacking up defense spending and reversing proposed business and payroll tax increases — and whether investors will become worried that UK borrowing could get out of hand.\n\n\"Having a real financial crisis — and the pound falling, if that accelerates — that is a serious, serious problem for real people, day by day,\" former UK finance minister Ken Clarke told the BBC on Tuesday. He's been critical of Truss' plans to slash taxes, which she claims will help fund spending increases by boosting economic growth.\n\nViraj Patel, global macro strategist at Vanda Research, thinks the fears are overblown. He puts the probability of a balance-of-payments crisis in the United Kingdom at less than 5%.\n\n\"A lot of things have to go wrong to get to this point — and one would imagine the UK government pivots quickly before then on any policies that are driving concerns,\" Patel said, adding that fiscal watchdogs such as the Office for Budget Responsibility are watching the situation closely.\n\nDeutsche Bank's Gopal acknowledged that the United Kingdom is different from countries like Argentina in a key way: It issues debt in its own currency, which means that when the pound drops, it doesn't face additional concerns about repaying liabilities. Still, he continued, it's not a given that investors start to come back onside.\n\n\"With the global macro backdrop so uncertain, investor confidence cannot be taken for granted,\" Gopal said.", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/09/06"}]}

The teams are utilizing more than a dozen helicopters, 281 fire engines and 46 water tenders, which are used to transport large amounts of water, the agency said.\n\nOfficials, Heggie added, are doing their best to work with law enforcement and notify residents when they need to leave.\n\n\"But the reality is, it's moving so quickly, it's not giving people a lot of time, and they are sometimes just going to have to evacuate with the shirts on their back,\" he said. \"But their life, safety is obviously the most important thing.\"\n\nThe fire \"remained active in some areas\" through Sunday night \"due to dry dead and downed fuels,\" Cal Fire's update Monday said.\n\nThe agency also revised down the number of structures destroyed from 10 to seven and the number of structures damaged from five to zero, calling earlier figures \"a preliminary estimate.\"\n\nAmong those who lost their home were Jane and Wes Smith, their son Nick Smith said, telling CNN his parents were left with \"just the clothes on their back and the shoes on their feet.\"\n\n\"It's pretty sad to see the house that I grew up in and was raised in gone,\" he said. \"It hits hard.\"\n\nHis mother only had enough time to load up their horses before escaping the area, Smith said, while his father was busy working on the fire as a Mariposa County sheriff's deputy. Now, the couple is staying with friends and family as they recover from the loss.\n\nSmith started a GoFundMe to support his parents' recovery, writing, \"37 years of memories, generations of family treasures, and countless more sentimental things.

The county fairgrounds and Coursegold Rodeo Grounds are serving as a shelter for large animals, according to the sheriff's office\n\nParts of the Sierra National Forest, which flanks and partially overlaps with Mariposa County, are closed to the public due to the fire, the Forest Service announced Sunday.\n\n\"The Fire's behavior consists of flanking, backing, and creeping through National Forest Systems lands, roads, and recreational areas,\" the agency posted on its website. \"This closure will support public safety by keeping public members out of hazardous burn areas and will allow firefighting resources to combat the Fire without public interference.\"\n\nThe Oak Fire burns through trees Sunday near Jerseydale, California.\n\nThe Oak Fire is the largest of California's actively burning fires, which have been fueled by extended drought conditions in much of the state, leaving behind brittle vegetation and underbrush which is quick to burn.\n\nThe fire is also having an affect on the weather in other states. The National Weather Service in Portland, Oregon, noted in a tweet that high temperatures may be impacted or lowered if the smoke from the Oak Fire reaches their city.\n\nOur high temperatures for Tuesday may be impacted/lowered if the smoke from CA fires (Oak and Washburn) reaches us, as the HRRR Smoke model forecasts.#ORwx #WAwx pic.twitter.com/gWmRvLuaGm — NWS Portland (@NWSPortland) July 25, 2022\n\nHeggie also noted the fire was \"indicative\" of what's been seen more broadly in wildfires throughout the state and the American west in recent years: It was \"burning with just such a velocity and intensity,\" Heggie said, due to prolonged drought and human-caused climate change.\n\n\"What I can tell you is this is a direct result of what is climate change,\" he said. \"You can't have a 10-year drought in California and expect things to be the same. And we are now paying the price for that 10-year drought and that climate change.\"\n\nAs a result of climate change, wildfires are becoming more frequent and severe.

Gavin Newsom’s desk soon.\n\n“This is one of the few times in recent history when so many people will be impacted by a single decision,” said Ryan Vet, an entrepreneur, and gig-economy expert who founded Boon, an on-demand health care platform. He said he sees positives and negatives in the new law, that is \"good for the workers, but will also implode the gig economy as we know it today\" with increased costs.\n\n\"We have been able to get a quick and easy, safe ride from one place to the next,\" he added. \"We have been able to get food delivered to our door, or a package delivered on Sunday. This is not only going to affect the worker but the consumers that are benefiting from these services — it is more than a two-sided equation.\"\n\nThe governor has already voiced his support and is expected to sign it. Other states could soon follow suit.\n\nEven though the bill could soon become law, legislators speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote said negotiations would continue to ensure a smoother implementation.\n\n\"We did not get to evaluate every category of worker,\" Toni Atkins, the Senate president pro tempore said during discussion. Many of us have pledged to continue that conversation. I don't know what kind of comprehensive process we would anticipate doing, because it was found to be way more complex than any of us imagined.\" She added that those conversations are ongoing with stakeholders.\n\nAt the 11th hour, 12 new amendments that sought to add more exemptions or streamline the application of the law were brought to the Senate floor by Republican senators, but all failed to make it into the final legislation.\n\nThe bill, which passed 29-11, already included carveouts for a range of industries — but not for gig-reliant businesses, which are expected to be most impacted by the new law.\n\n\"Today we are determining the future of the California economy,\" said Sen. Maria Elena Durazo, D-Los Angeles, introducing the legislation. Speaking directly about the tech industry, which pioneered the gig model and prides itself on modernizing services and work, she added, \"Let’s be clear, there’s nothing innovative about underpaying someone for their labor and basing an entire business model on misclassifying workers.\"\n\nOrganizers are now hoping that the legislation will open the possibility that drivers can form a union, which they were not able to do as independent contractors.\n\n“AB 5 is only the beginning,” said Edan Alva, a driver with Gig Workers Rising. “I talk daily to other drivers who want a change but they are scared. They don’t want to lose their only source of income. But just because someone really needs to work does not mean that their rights as a worker should be stepped all over. That is why a union is critical. It simply won’t work without it.”\n\nSo what's changing?\n\nMillions of workers are classified as independent contractors and don’t qualify for protections under the Fair Labor Standards Act, Americans with Disabilities Act, or the Civil Rights Act. They also aren’t guaranteed other rights afforded to employees, including minimum wage, overtime pay, or unemployment insurance. Now, for many—especially those working in the tech sector — that will all change.\n\nWhile that could be a big win for workers, enactment of AB 5 could threaten the future of the gig economy that was built on contracted, on-demand labor. Many tech companies, including Uber and Lyft, which have been among the most vocal opponents, will have to rework their core business models. They stand to lose billions in the process and have threatened to pass those costs onto consumers.\n\nMore:What is California's AB 5? The bill could make gig economy workers like Uber drivers employees\n\nAB 5 applies a strict “ABC test” to determine workers’ employment status and puts the burden of proof on employers:\n\n(A) that the worker is free from the control and direction of the hirer in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of such work\n\n(B) that the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business\n\n(C) that the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed for the hiring entity\n\nWith the aim to crack down on misclassification and close loopholes that enable companies to skirt labor protections and lighten their tax loads — which has resulted in an estimated $7 billion in losses of payroll tax revenue — the bill was championed by organizers hoping to secure and broaden benefits for tech workers, and pave the way for unionization.\n\nCritics also warn that workers accustomed to having freedom and flexibility, including those who give rides, deliver food, or perform other app-based services, will now be forced to conform to typical employee expectations, like scheduled hours and stronger oversight.\n\nDrivers against the legislation have raised concerns about whether the workforce will be cut, as the companies face higher costs to come into compliance.\n\nWhen will the changes happen?\n\nIt's unlikely that changes will move quickly. While the legislation provides for retroactive enforcement, used primarily for litigation, the law won't be implemented until next year. Plus, there are still some legal obstacles in the way and a lot of paperwork will need to be filed.\n\n“I think this is too complicated to change things overnight,” said Domenique Camacho Moran, a labor law expert, and partner at the New York-based firm, Farrell Fritz. “It is going to require dramatic changes. All of those [independent contractors] will have to be vetted as employees and onboarded—that’s a process.”\n\nMore:Why some on-demand drivers are fighting for — or against — California's gig economy bill\n\nShe added that the law will likely face immediate legal challenges, which could delay its implementation while the issues are worked out. “The laws as they exist did not envision these gig economy workers,” she said. “You could get a ruling relatively quickly that stays the enactment of the law while the legal battle takes place,” she said.\n\nGig economy players haven't given up\n\nOpponents to the law are already preparing for the next round of battles.\n\nEven before the measure passed, Uber, Lyft, and food delivery company, DoorDash, invested a collective $90 million to bring the issue to voters as a proposition on the next ballot. Their plan preserves independent contractor status of their workers while offering basic protections and benefits, including a minimum earnings floor, access to health care plans not tied to their employment, and representation in the companies to better address issues.\n\nAs Uber put up the financing to fight AB 5 and to fund the proposition, it also cut hundreds of employees in its second large-scale layoff this year. Earlier this year, 400 employees were cut from the marketing department. On the same day of the AB 5 vote, more than 400 engineers and product team employees were let go, and the company said it was reassessing its priorities.\n\n“While certainly painful in the moment, especially for those directly affected, we believe that this will result in a much stronger technical organization, which going forward will continue to hire some of the very best talent around the world,” an Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch.\n\nMeanwhile, the proposed proposition is already getting pushback. California Labor Federation, an organization that represents 1,200 unions, is also ready to take on the tech companies at the ballot box. After the initiative was announced, the organization posted on its website that it will \"meet the gig companies’ absurd political spending with a vigorous worker-led campaign to defeat this measure to ensure working people have the basic job protections and the right to organize a union they deserve under the law.\"\n\nLyft representatives have emphasized that even without the legislation they are intent on changing the status quo and improving their drivers' experiences. But they are committed to fighting the bill to ensure those changes don't include hiring their drivers as employees.\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday night after the bill's passage in the Senate Lyft officials said: “Today, our state’s political leadership missed an important opportunity to support the overwhelming majority of rideshare drivers who want a thoughtful solution that balances flexibility with an earnings standard and benefits. The fact that there were more than 50 industries carved out of AB 5 is very telling. We are fully prepared to take this issue to the voters of California to preserve the freedom and access drivers and riders want and need.”\n\nBy Wednesday morning, when AB 5 made it through the Assembly and was sent to the governor's desk, Uber reps told reporters it didn't plan on reclassifying its drivers once the law is enacted on Jan. 1, 2020.\n\n\"Just because the test is hard, doesn’t mean we will not be able to pass it,\" Uber’s Chief Legal Officer, Tony West said of the ABC test.\n\nThe company is claiming that its primary work is as a tech platform that provides a variety of services, and that drivers fall outside the scope. They are ready to face lawsuits. Meanwhile, they will continue to push for a ballot measure, and promoting the package of benefits they hope to offer drivers if they remain independent.\n\nMore:Why some on-demand drivers are fighting for — or against — California's gig economy bill\n\nIn recent years, workers have voiced concerns about the lack of power they have and how easily the giant companies can change earnings or dismiss their complaints. Many aren’t buying the new promises.\n\n“The ability to make some on-demand extra cash is life-changing and I can see that,” said a driver and pro-AB 5 activist, Jeff Parry, earlier this week. He added that he isn’t worried about the threats to the companies, and how that could affect drivers.\n\n“What’s more likely to happen is [they] find a may to make it work with the flexibility,” he said. “There’s always going to be someone who will not fit into that model. But if it works for the majority? I don’t see that as a bad thing.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/06/politics/solar-energy-china-investigation-climate/index.html", "title": "Solar energy projects are grinding to a halt in the US amid ...", "text": "(CNN) The solar energy industry has been thrown into a panic and projects are grinding to a halt after the Biden administration launched an investigation that some solar CEOs worry could tank the industry.\n\nThe Commerce Department launched the probe in March into whether four countries in Southeast Asia that supply about 80% of US solar panels and parts -- Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam -- are using components from China that should be subject to US tariffs.\n\nHonolulu is leading the way for solar power.

It's so frustrating.\"\n\nThe investigation was launched after one small US-based company, Auxin Solar, filed a complaint in February. Auxin CEO Mamun Rashid told CNN that the complaint \"was existential\" for his company.\n\n\"When prices of finished panels from Southeast Asia come in below our bill of materials cost, American manufacturers cannot compete,\" Rashid said, adding that \"if foreign producers are circumventing U.S. law and causing harm to U.S. producers like Auxin Solar, it needs to be addressed.\"\n\nRashid told CNN it's \"lamentable\" that frustration is aimed at his company, rather than the \"foreign suppliers\" that he says are circumventing US law. Rashid also noted that Auxin is \"here and can quickly scale up to meet needs of utilities within 2 to 3 quarters if we have the purchase order today.\"\n\nSolar industry leaders have been communicating with the Commerce Department and have also communicated their concerns about the probe to Biden's top climate officials -- including McCarthy and US Climate Envoy John Kerry -- a person familiar with the conversations said.\n\n\"The administration has been in touch with and is engaging with all kinds of solar stakeholders including the trade associations but also labor, communities, and NGOs,\" a White House official told CNN.\n\n'The worst moment'\n\nThe Commerce probe comes on the heels of last year's ban on solar panels and parts that were suspected of having links to forced labor in China's Xinjiang Province.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security directed US Customs and Border Protection to issue a Withhold Release Order, which banned imports made by Chinese company Hoshine Silicon Industry Co., after the government alleged the company uses forced Uyghur labor.\n\n\"Obviously, the industry absolutely needed to address any concerns about forced labor, but the implementation of that [order] was far from smooth,\" Solar Energy Industries Association President Abigail Ross Hopper told CNN.\n\nAt ports around the country, CBP agents seized and detained any solar products they suspected had links to Hoshine, unless companies could prove they did not.\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection statistics provided to CNN note the agency detained 734 shipments valued at $246 million, which the agency said is just 1.86% of the total value of all solar imports into the United States. But Hershman said the order ultimately led to a chilling effect across the industry, where companies withheld shipments for fear of being caught in an overly broad net at US ports.\n\n\"If you have materials detained, you don't want to ship more,\" Hershman said.\n\nElectricians with IBEW Local 3 install solar panels on top of the Terminal B garage at LaGuardia Airport in November 2021.\n\nSolar CEOs and industry analysts told CNN that while the CBP order was eventually resolved with a good outcome for the industry, the impact of the Commerce investigation is like whiplash.\n\n\"Solar is a big mess right now,\" said Marcelo Ortega, an analyst for Rystad. \"This seems to be the worst moment for this to happen.\"\n\nThis year was supposed to be a banner year for US solar growth. Independent energy research firm Rystad estimated the US would add another 27 gigawatts of solar energy this year.\n\nNow -- between the Commerce Department probe, the border seizures, the high cost of solar components and no new legislation in Congress to grease the wheels for more renewable energy -- Rystad estimates the US might only add around 10 gigawatts in 2022.\n\nOrtega said the backslide threatens Biden's own climate goal to slash planet-warming emissions in half by 2030. The US would have to install around 50 gigawatts of solar photovoltaic capacity each year from 2022 to 2030 to keep Biden's goal on-track, according to Ortega's analysis.\n\nRoss Hopper told CNN that the industry is looking for certainty from the markets and from governments, but that it's getting none of that right now.\n\n\"There's certainly been this steady cadence of challenges that keep getting thrown our way right at these moments of opportunity,\" Ross Hopper told CNN.\n\nCommerce defends the probe\n\nAt a recent hearing on Capitol Hill , Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo told lawmakers that strict trade laws required her department to initiate and complete an investigation. The department is expected to issue a preliminary finding on the investigation by late August, but a final determination could take as long as January 2023, a Commerce Department official told CNN.\n\n\"My hands are very tied here,\" Raimondo said at the hearing. \"I'm required by statute to investigate a claim that companies operating in other countries are trying to circumvent the duties, and I'm required by statute to have a fulsome investigation.\"\n\nThe 6 megawatt Stanton Solar Farm outside of Orlando, Florida.\n\nThe Commerce official stressed to CNN that circumvention laws are \"completely removed from political considerations.\"\n\n\"We're committed to holding foreign producers accountable to playing by the rules,\" the official told CNN.\n\nNevertheless, Raimondo has been questioned and criticized by politicians in both parties. A bipartisan group of 19 senators wrote to Biden this week asking for an expedited preliminary decision on the investigation.\n\nAnd at a recent hearing, Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat, pressed Raimondo on her \"very serious concerns\" about the investigation.\n\n\"This will jeopardize tens of thousands of good-paying American solar jobs,\" Rosen said. \"If we lose these jobs, they won't come back.\"\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb of Indiana also recently wrote to Raimondo expressing concern that the investigation could impact solar growth and jobs in their states.\n\nAlthough solar CEOs and industry analysts welcome the idea of a domestic solar supply chain, those who spoke with CNN said the Commerce Department investigation won't be the catalyst -- the industry needs Congress to incentivize it.\n\n\"If what we're talking about is incentivizing domestic manufacturing, this is not the way to do it,\" said Ben Catt, CEO of utility-scale solar company Pine Gate Renewables. \"This is going to have not just a months but years-long impact to the solar industry.

That's raising questions about whether these metrics should play a larger role in mitigation decisions nationwide -- more than Covid-19 case counts.\n\nMeanwhile, shifts to phase out state mask mandates conflict with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidance to continue wearing masks in areas with \"high\" or \"substantial\" Covid-19 transmission , which includes about 99% of US counties . And much of the United States still is not boosted against Covid-19: Only about 27% of the US population has received a coronavirus vaccine booster shot, according to CDC data.\n\nThe CDC is working to review and possibly update its guidance on mask-wearing, but for now, states appear to be outpacing the White House in planning for a post-Omicron period.\n\nHigh levels of vaccination, low levels of hospitalization\n\nAlthough many indoor mask mandates are implemented at the city and county level, six states still have mandates in place: California, Hawaii, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington.\n\nMany of these states were early adopters of strict Covid-19 safety measures, and vaccination rates in all but one have climbed above the national average. In the United States as a whole, 64.3% of the population is fully vaccinated, as of Thursday.\n\nThe share of fully vaccinated people in each of those states, according to the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , is:\n\n66.8% in Delaware and Illinois\n\n68.2% in Oregon\n\n69.6% in California\n\n73.5% in New Jersey\n\n74.8% in New York\n\n77% in Massachusetts\n\n77.2% in Connecticut\n\n79.7% in Rhode Island\n\nOnly one state that recently rolled back its mask mandate had a percentage of people fully vaccinated that was less than the national average: Nevada, with 59%.\n\nVermont and Rhode Island are tied for the highest vaccination rates in the country, with 79.7% of their population fully vaccinated against Covid-19 as of Thursday.\n\n\"Vermont has not had any statewide, mandatory mitigation measures in place since June, when we became the first state to vaccinate 80% of our eligible population ,\" Jason Maulucci, press secretary for the Office of Gov. Phil Scott, wrote in an email to CNN on Thursday.\n\n\"Since then, we continue to be the national leader in many vaccination categories, including percentage of the full population vaccinated, percentage of the pediatric population vaccinated (by far), and for booster shots rates,\" Maulucci wrote. \"As a result, even through the Delta and Omicron waves when our cases were elevated, Vermont's hospitalization rate has consistently been one of, if not the lowest, in the nation.\"\n\nIn Rhode Island, where indoor mask mandates and proof of vaccination protocols will be lifted Friday, infection rates declined about 94% since January. \"We're the second most vaccinated state in the country. Right now, we're the third most boosted state in the country,\" Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on Thursday, seeming to put more emphasis on vaccination rates than community transmission.\n\nEven though the state has high levels of community transmission right now, \"we know that the trends are really moving very sharply in the other direction,\" McKee said. \"I think we've done the right thing for Rhode Island.\"\n\nOn the international stage, Denmark was the first European country to eliminate mask mandates, vaccine passports, isolation protocols \"and all the rest,\" but the country is different from the United States \"in a few important ways,\" Andy Slavitt, former senior adviser to the Biden administration's Covid-19 Response Coordinator and former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, wrote in a series of Twitter posts Thursday.\n\nThey have 81% of their population double vaccinated and 61% boosted, as well as universal health coverage, manageable intensive care units and \"a top flight surveillance capability,\" Slavitt tweeted . \"The US doesn't have enough people vaccinated, has full hospitals, has huge access challenges, massive inequality.\"\n\nSocieties like Denmark make these decisions with the legitimate hope that people will take care of each other even if the law doesn't compel them.\n\n\n\nA society with 81% vax rates that is against mandates is one that doesn't need them.\n\n\n\nThe US shouldn't be so confident. 20/ — Andy Slavitt 🇺🇸💉 (@ASlavitt) February 10, 2022\n\nBut on the local level, \"you don't have to look far\" in the US to see state governors following a path similar to Denmark's, Slavitt added.\n\n\"These are responsible governors with states that have done a good job managing the pandemic,\" he tweeted . \"They have higher vax rates than in most of the country and the cultural fights over masks are at a relative minimum.\"\n\nMoving beyond community transmission\n\nIn the CDC's guidance to keep masking in communities with \"high\" or \"substantial\" Covid-19 transmission , the agency defines substantial transmission in a given area as fewer than 50 to 100 new cases per 100,000 people in the past week and at least 8% but less than 10% test positivity during the past week. High transmission is at least 100 new cases per 100,000 people in the past week and 10% or greater percentage of positive tests.\n\nWith the rising use of at-home tests and the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, it might be time to shift Covid-19 measurements from case counts and test positivity to metrics on serious illness and death, Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told CNN on Wednesday.\n\n\"When you think about what the local and county health departments face in local decision-making and the metrics that are in place on current case rates and test positivity, those are community leading indicators that were defined a long time ago,\" Freeman said.\n\n\"What's changing over time is our ongoing ability to keep track of those things with the Omicron surge entering the picture and the expansion of at-home tests, paired with people in various stages of mitigation efforts across the country,\" she said. \"I don't know how much longer the current community indicators may remain useful, and then what we're hearing from the ground is just overall public fatigue with the pandemic and mask-wearing and mitigation strategies.\"\n\nFrom East Coast to West Coast\n\nSome US states never had mask mandates, and a few went so far as to ban mask mandates in schools -- and they continue to face high hospitalization rates and low vaccination uptake\n\nThe approach was different in the states that recently announced mandate changes.\n\nWhen New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy announced Monday that the state's universal mask mandate in schools will lift March 7, he noted that the decision was based on \"significant\" declines in multiple statewide Covid-19 metrics.\n\n\"Our case count, hospitalizations, the spot positivity rate, the rate of transmission are all dropping like a rock,\" Murphy told CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday.\n\n\"We've adhered overwhelmingly with the CDC guidance. The reason why we're making this step today is our reality in New Jersey,\" Murphy said. \"We are now in a dramatically different place than the norm right now across the country, which is why we feel like we can decouple and take this step.\"\n\nIn New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a briefing Wednesday that \"overall cases are down, positivity rates down, hospitalizations are down, cases per 100,000 are down, and new admissions are down,\" and \"vaccines and boosters are up, and our hospital capacity is up,\" leading to lift of the statewide indoor business mask-or-vaccine requirement starting Thursday. She called the data \"a beautiful picture.\"\n\nIn Oregon, the state plans to remove general mask requirements for indoor public places no later than March 31, health officials announced Monday, and mask requirements for schools will lift March 31.\n\nState officials pointed to hospitalization data as the reasoning behind their plan.\n\nBy late March, public health specialists predict that about 400 or fewer Oregonians would be hospitalized with Covid-19 -- the level of hospitalizations the state experienced before the Omicron variant began to spread, according to the Oregon Health Authority.\n\nHowever, state health officials emphasized that people in Oregon need to keep mask requirements in place for now as Covid-19 hospitalizations crest and the health care system strains to treat high numbers of severely ill patients.\n\n\"The evidence from Oregon and around the country is clear: masks save lives by slowing the spread of COVID-19,\" Dr. Dean Sidelinger, health officer and state epidemiologist, said in a news release Monday.\n\n\"We should see COVID-19 hospitalizations drop by the end of March because so many Oregonians are wearing masks and taking other steps to protect themselves and each other, such as getting a booster shot or vaccinating their children. At that point, it will be safer to lift mask requirements.\"\n\nIn California, Gov. Gavin Newsom touted the state's stabilizing hospitalization rates as a contributing factor to planning for lifting mask mandates.\n\nCalifornia's \"case rate has decreased by 65% since our Omicron peak. Our hospitalizations have stabilized across the state,\" Newsom posted to Twitter on Monday. The state now plans to expire its indoor mask requirement on Tuesday.\n\nIn an emailed statement to CNN on Wednesday, the California Department of Public Health also noted that \"COVID-19 cases and the rate of community transmission have steadily decreased statewide since early January, and hospitalizations are either plateauing or declining in most regions of the state.\"\n\nPublic health experts and infectious disease specialists remain split on whether these states are jumping the gun or are smart to set these plans ahead of time.\n\n\"These periods of transition are always the most challenging,\" Dr. Richard Besser, a former acting director of the CDC, told CNN's Jim Sciutto on Wednesday.\n\n\"If you listen to public health experts, to infectious disease experts, you don't see uniformity of opinion. You see quite a number of different opinions there in terms of, is this the right time to try and remove some of the public health measures that are in place?\" Besser said. \"Politicians, our elected officials, have to weigh all of those factors when they're coming forward with their recommendations. It's a messy playing field right now. I think it would be wrong for any governor to ban mandates.\"\n\nWhite House thinking about life after the pandemic\n\nDecisions to lift statewide mask mandates came after some state leaders pressed President Joe Biden and his administration at the White House last week for clearer guidelines on how to transition out of the current pandemic and into an endemic phase with the coronavirus.\n\nEndemic means a disease has a constant presence in a population but is not overwhelming health systems or affecting an alarmingly large number of people, as typically seen in a pandemic.\n\nBiden and his administration's public health team have been canvassing outside health experts and others for weeks on how to best transition to a new phase of the pandemic.\n\nSources told CNN that the administration's top health officials are assessing in real time how to handle federal guidance on mitigation steps like masking, and there is an internal recognition that the US is entering a new phase.\n\nA key component of the discussion has been what metrics will now determine when communities need to implement safety measures, like masking. In previous phases of the pandemic, the focus has been on case numbers, but now, hospital capacity, hospitalization rates and death rates are all considered major factors.\n\nOne administration official described this as a \"significant undertaking,\" given that officials are identifying a new national framework for public health guidance.\n\n\"We want to be deliberate about it and ensure we both implement right decisions but also can communicate it clearly to a diverse country, where one state may look different than another,\" the official said.\n\nThe CDC also has been reviewing its guidance on mitigation measures, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the agency, said in a virtual White House briefing Wednesday.\n\n\"We certainly understand the need and desire to be flexible,\" Walensky said. \"Cases and hospitalizations are falling. This is, of course, encouraging, and that leads us, of course, to look at all of our guidance. At this time, we continue to recommend masking in areas of high and substantial transmission. That's much of the public right now.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWhen pressed by CNN's Kaitlan Collins about whether Americans should follow guidance from the CDC or that of governors, Walensky said that such mitigation decisions would continue to be made \"at the local level.\"\n\n\"They -- as I understand it, in many of these decisions -- are using a phased approach. Not all of these decisions are being made to stop things tomorrow, but they're looking at a phased approach. And so, what I would say is, again, they have to be done at the local level,\" Walensky said, adding that she was \"really encouraged\" by the ongoing decline in US cases and hospitalizations and the CDC continues \"working on our guidance\" with respect to masks.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/02/11"}, {"url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/02/28/coronavirus-arizona-updates-virus-travel-safety-more/4903384002/", "title": "LIVE Arizona coronavirus updates: New cases, closures, advisories", "text": "Arizona Republic\n\nThe spread of a highly contagious coronavirus has had wide-ranging global impacts, including in the financial markets and government travel policies.\n\nTHE LATEST: This blog has moved.

Here are answers to some frequently asked questions: Ask us a new question here.\n\nTop White House advisers predict as many as 240,000 US deaths from coronavirus\n\nMarch 31: Members of President Donald Trump’s administration laid out dire estimates Tuesday to underscore the potential impact of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, a grim prediction they said was at the center of the president’s decision to extend strict social distancing guidelines through the end of April.\n\nFederal public health officials said that between 100,000 and 240,000 could succumb to the virus by the end of the year — making it one of the nation’s worst public health crises — said Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator.\n\nWithout intervention, Birx said, as many 2.2 million could have died.\n\nPresented to the president over the weekend, the data explains why Trump backed down from an earlier notion of “reopening” the country by Easter, or potentially opening parts of the nation that were less hard hit, officials said. Trump announced Sunday he would extend social distancing guidelines through April 30.\n\nAmericans abroad urged to come home\n\nMarch 31: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is making his advice to U.S. citizens still overseas during the coronavirus crisis simple: \"Americans who wish to return home from abroad should so immediately and make arrangements to accomplish that,\" he stressed during a Tuesday briefing.\n\nWhile Pompeo said his repatriation task force remains committed to bringing all Americans home, he said the window to do so is closing.\n\n\"We do not know how long the commercial flights in your countries may continue to operate,\" he said as airlines have already slashed international service. \"We can't guarantee the U.S. government's ability to arrange charter flights indefinitely where commercial options no longer exist.\"\n\nIn the meantime, he urged Americans to register with their nearest embassy or consulate or do so online via STEP, the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program.\n\nAt-home coronavirus tests halted despite progress\n\nMarch 31: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration abruptly shut down sales of at-home coronavirus test kits earlier this month but some companies say they haven’t given up.\n\nThe scarcity of tests in general, coupled with consumers' desire to take control, makes the idea both intriguing and controversial.\n\nCritics say home tests may be unreliable, might delay necessary treatment and could soak up scarce resources. Proponents say at-home test kits could save money and resources – and in the near future could play a critical role in tracking COVID-19.\n\nThe FDA leaped into action on March 20 when several startup companies started selling or preparing to sell at-home kits.\n\nIn strong language, the agency called at-home test kits “fraudulent.”\n\nFeds launch inquiry of 4 lawmakers who sold off stock\n\nMarch 30: Federal authorities are reviewing the stock sales of four lawmakers just before the market slide triggered by the coronavirus outbreak, a person familiar with the matter said Monday.\n\nFinancial disclosure statements indicated that Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C.; Jim Inhofe, R-Okla.; Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga.; and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; their spouses or advisers sold large chunks of stock around the time lawmakers received behind-the-scenes briefings about the severity of the coronavirus, which has claimed more than 2,900 lives in the USA.\n\nThe senators denied any wrongdoing, and Burr asked the Senate Ethics Committee to review his transactions involving up to $1.6 million. The federal inquiry, which was in its early stages, was first reported by CNN.\n\nGov. Ducey issues stay-at-home order\n\nMarch 30:Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday issued a statewide \"stay-at-home\" order to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, preventing Arizonans from leaving their residences except for food, medicine and other \"essential activities.\"\n\nThe directive, which also allows for outdoor exercise, will take effect at the close of business Tuesday and apply through at least April 30.\n\n\"Already, things have shut down to a large degree,\" the Republican leader said at an afternoon press briefing, with Department of Health Services Director Dr. Cara Christ at his side. \"They're going to shut down even further.\"\n\nDucey indicated he did not consider the mandate a \"shelter-in-place\" order, however, saying that phrase is reserved for nuclear attacks or active shooter situations.\n\n\"Our goal here is to protect the lives of those we love most and to ensure the health care system has the capacity to provide them with the care and comfort they deserve,\" he said. \"We want people to stay at home.\"\n\nArizona schools closed for the rest of the school year\n\nMarch 30: Gov. Doug Ducey has extended the closure of all Arizona schools through the end of this school year.\n\nIn a joint statement Monday with Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman, Ducey wrote that the decision was made to align with guidance from the federal government.\n\n\"These efforts are crucial, and we recognize that schools are making every effort possible to continue providing instruction during closures,\" they wrote in the statement.\n\nOn Friday, Ducey signed legislation to allow students to finish the school year from home.\n\nThe plan mandates that schools offer classes in an alternative format, presumably online, so students could finish out the school year from home. It also includes provisions to ensure seniors in high school graduate.\n\nGov. Ducey holds 2 p.m. press conference\n\nSummer Olympics to kick off in July 2021\n\nMarch 30: Less than a week after announcing that the Summer Games in Japan would be postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, organizers have decided on a new start date of July 23, 2021, according to an International Olympic Committee spokesman. The closing ceremony will be held on Aug. 8. The Tokyo Olympics had previously been set to start almost exactly one year earlier, running from July 24 through Aug. 9.\n\nArizona coronavirus cases now surpass 1K, with 20 deaths\n\nMarch 30: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now number more than 1,000, with 20 known deaths, new numbers posted by the Arizona Department of Health Services on Monday show.\n\nThe total identified cases in Arizona is 1,157, according to the latest state figures, with every one of the state's 15 counties now recording at least one case.\n\nThat's an increase of confirmed 238 cases, or 26%, since Sunday.\n\nArizona's new coronavirus cases increase to 912; deaths rise to 16\n\nMarch 29: The number of identified new coronavirus cases in Arizona rose to 912 on Sunday — a roughly 17% increase from the day before, according to data released by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nThe number of reported deaths related to COVID-19 also increased by one to a total of 16 on Sunday.\n\nMore than 2,000 coronavirus patients have died in U.S.\n\nMarch 28: Just one day after the U.S. surpassed 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, the nation witnessed another grim figure: More than 2,000 COVID-19 patients have died.\n\nTesting continues to expand across the nation, and the U.S. is seeing daily spikes in the number of reported cases. Nearly 500 coronavirus-related deaths were reported Saturday, up from 1,544 confirmed deaths 24 hours earlier, according to Johns Hopkins University's data dashboard.\n\nThe death toll was 2,010 Saturday shortly after 6 p.m. ET. That number is expected to rise steadily in the coming days and weeks, and health officials say the number of cases is likely higher due to lack of testing. Nearly 18,000 new cases were reported on both Wednesday and Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nMore than 120,000 cases have been reported in the U.S.\n\nCases have been reported in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. New York has reported the most deaths, followed by Washington, New York and Louisiana, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nFDA authorizes 5-minute coronavirus test the size of a toaster\n\nMarch 28: CHICAGO – A five-minute, point-of-care coronavirus test could be coming to urgent care clinics next week, and experts say it could be \"game-changing.\"\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued Emergency Use Authorization to Illinois-based medical device maker Abbott Labs on Friday for a coronavirus test that delivers positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes, the company said.\n\nThe company expects the tests to be available next week and expects to ramp up manufacturing to deliver 50,000 tests per day.\n\nDays before closing, Caesars Entertainment said 3,200 workers would lose jobs\n\nLAS VEGAS – Four days before closing nine hotel-casinos along the Las Vegas Strip to slow the spread of COVID-19, Caesars Entertainment notified state officials that 3,200 workers would lose their jobs, according to documents obtained by the Reno-Gazette Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nIn a March 14 letter to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation, the company announced the cuts would happen the following day.\n\n\"Given the unknown certainty surrounding COVID-19,\" wrote Servando Lara, Caesars' director of labor relations, \"we are unable to make a determination as to whether the layoff will be temporary or permanent.\"\n\nOne day after the letter arrived, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak ordered that all non-essential businesses across the state shut down to arrest the spread of COVID-19.\n\nArizona COVID-19 deaths up to 15; reported cases rise to 773\n\nMarch 28: Arizona's death toll related to the new coronavirus rose to 15, according to data released by the Arizona Department of Health Services on Saturday morning.\n\nThe number of reported cases around the state also rose to 773.\n\nAs of Friday, there were 13 deaths and 665 reported cases around the state. Cases grew from Friday to Saturday by roughly 16%.\n\nOn Saturday, Pima County announced an additional coronavirus-related death, bringing the county total to five.\n\nThe man was a hospice patient between the age of 18 and 40, the county said.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear whether the Pima County death was one of the two additional deaths announced by the state Saturday morning.\n\nMaricopa County reported a growth of 53 cases, with 96 of the 452 cases in the county requiring hospitalization.\n\nMember of Alhambra school community infected\n\nMarch 28: Alhambra Elementary School District announced Friday that someone who attended the school's non-sponsored trip to Magic Mountain has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe news was shared via an email to parents from Richard Stinnett, the school's principal. The email did not reveal whether the infected person was a student or other party.\n\nStinnett relayed in the email that the trip took place from March 6-8, more than two weeks removed since the person in question received their positive test. School has not been in session since the trip, Stinnett wrote.\n\nStill, the email communicated that the infected person is recovering at home while quarantined and that no other cases have been linked to this case.\n\nDisney World, Disneyland to stay closed indefinitely\n\nMarch 27: Citing an \"increasingly complex crisis,\" Disneyland and Disney World are going to stay closed \"until further notice\" due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Walt Disney Company said Friday.\n\nThe company's decision dashes hopes that the fabled theme parks would reopen by next month, as had been previously announced. Earlier this week, Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Hollywood announced they were extending their closures through April 19.\n\nFor Disney, the concern was about making sure park-goers and employees aren't exposed to the virus.\n\n\"While there is still much uncertainty with respect to the impacts of COVID-19, the safety and well-being of our guests and employees remains the Walt Disney Company’s top priority,\" the company said in an email statement. It said the decision was \"in line with direction provided by health experts and government officials.\"\n\nTrump signs $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus intended to halt economic meltdown\n\nMarch 27: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion bipartisan stimulus package Friday that is intended to address the threat of economic disaster posed by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTrump signed the measure – the largest stimulus in U.S. history – in the Oval Office hours after it was approved by the House of Representatives, an unusually rapid approval that underscored dire warnings of a recession as companies began to lay off workers and U.S. consumers hunkered down in their homes to avoid spreading the virus.\n\n\"I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for coming together and putting America first,\" Trump said at the signing.\n\nWhile the president’s signature ended the legislative effort on Capitol Hill, it marked a beginning to the government’s work managing the crisis. Now the Trump administration must rapidly pump hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy in the form of direct payments, loans and grants to hard-hit industries such as the airlines.\n\nThe stimulus package will provide $1,200 checks to many Americans – and more for families – while making available hundreds of billions of dollars for companies to maintain payroll through the crisis. It significantly expands the nation’s unemployment safety net and it directs a huge infusion of cash to hospitals and other medical facilities on the front line of fighting the pandemic.\n\nMarkets rallied in recent days on the news that Republicans and Democrats had reached a deal on the stimulus, recovering some of the staggering losses of the past several weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average remained down Friday in midday trading.\n\nHouse approves historic coronavirus package, sending $2 trillion bill to Trump’s desk\n\nMarch 27: WASHINGTON – The House voted to pass a $2 trillion coronavirus relief package – the largest emergency aid bill in history – that will offer $1,200 checks to Americans, extensive unemployment benefits for those out of work and financial relief to businesses and the health care industry hard-hit by the worsening crisis.\n\nThe House’s vote allows the bill to head to President Donald Trump’s desk for final approval. Trump has signaled he will sign the bill.\n\nThe vote comes one day after the U.S. reached two grim milestones, becoming the country with the most coronavirus cases in the world and reporting a record 3.28 million workers who applied for unemployment benefits in one week – the highest number in history since the Department of Labor started tracking data in 1967. The massive package aims to offer a financial lifeline to Americans and businesses that are hurting while also offering reassurance to the markets, which have been battered by fears that shutdowns related to the pandemic could throw the economy into a deep recession.\n\nUS neglected its medical stockpile, whistleblowers say\n\nMarch 27: A secretive cache of medical supplies to save Americans from deadly disasters for years lacked the funding to prepare for a pandemic as widespread as the coronavirus, former managers of the stockpile told USA TODAY.\n\nOverseen by a cadre of scientists, disease specialists and others at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Strategic National Stockpile houses roughly $8 billion in inventory for rapid deployment to anywhere in the nation in under 12 hours.\n\nBut its inadequate supply of ventilators, respiratory masks and other personal protective equipment will leave critical shortages for U.S. hospitals scrambling to respond to the mounting coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe stockpile had just 16,600 of the breathing machines and an estimated 12 million N95 masks at the start of the pandemic – not enough for the country, USA TODAY reports.\n\nThe latest: US COVID-19 count\n\nUS passes Italy, China as nation with the most confirmed cases of COVID-19\n\nMarch 26: The U.S. surged past China and Italy to become the planet's most infected nation Thursday, a stark milestone in the coronavirus era - and a reminder of its deadly, culture-changing effects on American life.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins University dashboard showed the U.S. with 82,404 COVID-19 infections as of 6 p.m., ET, moving past Italy (80,589) and China (81,782). More than 1,100 people have died in the U.S.\n\nPart of the reason for the nation's top ranking is cause and effect: The U.S. has drastically ramped up its testing protocols in order to identify infected people and those who may be carriers of the virus. As testing has increased, so has the number of confirmed cases.\n\nWatch: Trump speaks on coronavirus\n\nMarch 26: On a day when jobless claims smashed a record and U.S. deaths surged past 1,100 as the coronavirus tightened its grip on America, the prospect of a stimulus package soon becoming reality helped propel a third consecutive stock market rally Thursday.\n\nThe Labor Department, in announcing the unemployment claims numbers for last week, said what Americans already knew – that layoffs hit the hospitality and food service industries particularly hard. Other industries that struggled included health care and social assistance, arts, entertainment and recreation, transportation and warehousing, and manufacturing industries, Labor said.\n\nCongress was trying to supply a ray of hope. The House is scheduled to take up a Senate-passed, $2 trillion emergency aid proposal Friday. Swift passage was expected – after an initial hangup, the package flew through the Senate on Wednesday night by a vote of 96-0. President Donald Trump has expressed a willingness to sign the measure.\n\nDow posts best 3-day gain since 1931\n\nMarch 26: U.S. stocks notched their first three-day rally in six weeks Thursday on hopes that Congress will quickly approve a coronavirus rescue package for the economy while the outbreak in China shows signs that it has been largely contained.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1,351.62 points, or 6.4%, to close at 22,552.17. The blue-chip average has advanced 21.3% over the past three days, its biggest three-day gain since 1931. Those gains helped push the Dow back into bull market territory after ending its 11-year historic run this month.\n\nThe Standard & Poor’s 500 added 6.2% to finish at 2,630.07. It has gained 17.6% over the past three days, its best percentage gain since 1933.\n\nThe gains came even as data revealed a record number of Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week after a wave of layoffs from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nArizona coronavirus cases top 500, with 8 known deaths\n\nMarch 26: Confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, topped 500 on Thursday, with eight known deaths, state numbers show.\n\nIdentified cases now total 508 across the state. Maricopa County has just shy of 300 cases.\n\nThe level of community spread, as listed on the state health department’s website, went from moderate to “widespread.” Community spread means the patient had no history of traveling to regions of the world affected by new coronavirus, and also had no known contact with anyone infected by it.\n\nHere's the difference between shelter-in-place and quarantine, and what police can enforce\n\nMarch 26: On March 19, California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered all 40 million people in the state to shelter in place as health officials battle the new coronavirus. Two days later, Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker ordered his state's 12.7 million residents to also shelter in place.\n\nSince then, millions of people across at least 20 states have been given orders to shelter in place, restricting them from leaving their homes except to go to work if they can't work from home, get food or see a doctor.\n\nBut Arizona, with a population of seven million, isn't one of them.\n\nCongress on track to add $600 per week to jobless checks\n\nMarch 26:The U.S. Senate approved an additional $600 a week in jobless benefits for laid-off workers on Wednesday as the number of people applying for help nationwide hit an all-time weekly record of 3.28 million because of the economic carnage of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nArizona also set a new one-day record this week for the number of jobless claims filed.\n\nBenefits currently are capped at $240 a week in Arizona, the second-lowest amount in the nation. The change would increase the figure to $840 per week for people laid off because of the outbreak.\n\nJobless claims surge to 3.3M\n\nMarch 26: Layoffs are skyrocketing as the coronavirus upends the U.S. economy.\n\nThe number of Americans filing initial applications for unemployment benefits jumped nearly twelvefold to a record 3.28 million last week, the Labor Department said Thursday, offering the most vivid evidence yet of the outbreak's widespread damage to the economy.\n\nThe total was well above the 1.5 million claims economists had forecast, according to the median estimate of those surveyed by Bloomberg.\n\nIllnesses from coronavirus could peak in April with hospitalizations topping out in May, health officials say\n\nMarch 25: Arizona's governor and top health official on Wednesday shared mixed updates on the state's new coronavirus response, reporting a sizable increase in testing but warning of continued medical supply shortages as the virus spreads.\n\nIf infections continue at their current pace, illnesses would peak in April and hospitalizations would peak in May, state Health Director Dr. Cara Christ said at a Wednesday press briefing.\n\n\"Arizona is still in the opening stages of its COVID-19 outbreak, and the number of cases within the state will increase significantly,\" Christ said.\n\nArizona could be short 13,000 beds in treating coronavirus patients\n\nMarch 25: The new coronavirus pandemic could leave Arizona short 13,000 hospital beds for sick patients, a top health official said Wednesday.\n\nThe state's modeling has shown if there's a big wave of illness here — what state officials emphasize is a worst-case scenario — it would hit in mid- to late April, with a high rate of hospitalizations in May, Dr. Cara Christ, the Arizona Department of Health Services director, told reporters during a news briefing with Gov. Doug Ducey.\n\n\"We must continue to increase our bed capacity. With a potential surge of COVID-19 patients, we expect it to be above and beyond our current capacity of beds,\" she said.\n\nSenate passes historic $2 trillion stimulus package\n\nMarch 25: The Senate approved its largest emergency aid package in modern history that will offer $2 trillion to help Americans, hospitals and businesses weather the effects of the coronavirus. The vote late Wednesday night was 96-0.\n\nThe bill will now go to the House for approval before it’s sent to President Donald Trump for his signature.\n\nHouse Majority Leader, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., announced that the House will vote on the $2 trillion bill Friday, and that they will convene at 9 a.m.\n\n\"We expect the bill to pass by voice vote,\" he said.\n\nAmong the provisions offered in the measure are one-time $1,200 checks to individuals, $367 billion in loans and grants to small businesses, over $130 billion for hospitals and community health centers and financial help to airlines and other industries hit hard by the virus.\n\nU.S. death toll surges past 1,000\n\nMarch 25: The U.S. death toll was at 1,031 late Wednesday afternoon after eclipsing 600 on Tuesday. Globally, more than 21,000 people have been killed by the virus, according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard.\n\nGov. Ducey to hold press conference at 2 p.m. Wednesday\n\nMost Americans to get $1,200 checks\n\nMarch 25: People earning less than $75,000 per year will get $1,200 checks under the stimulus agreement. Married couples earning less than $150,000 will get $2,400 and children will be worth another $500 each under the deal. The final language is still being crafted, but the package includes $367 billion for small businesses, $500 billion for loans to larger industries, $100 billion for hospitals and the health care system and $600 more per week in unemployment benefits for those out of work.\n\nSenate Minority leader Chuck Schumer said the goal is to ensure that every worker who is laid off or furloughed can pay their bills.\n\n\"And because so many of them will be furloughed rather than fired, if they have benefits, they can continue, and – extremely important – they can stay with the company or small business,\" he said.\n\nIdentified cases in Arizona now top 400, with 6 known deaths\n\nMarch 25: Coronavirus cases in Arizona continue to rise, with 401 identified cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, reported by the state Wednesday.\n\nMohave County reported its first identified case, which means the county will start restricting businesses. Maricopa County reported it now has two cases in people under age 18.\n\nIdentified cases have increased by 23% since Tuesday morning's numbers update from the state. The percentage increase was lower Wednesday than it was on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, there were at least 326 identified cases and five known deaths reported by the state in its morning numbers update. The state's database now reflects the sixth death, which was announced by Coconino County late Tuesday.\n\nThree known deaths have occurred in Maricopa County, according to county data, as well as one in Pima County and one in Coconino County. It is unclear in which county one of the deaths happened. Coconino County's first known death related to COVID-19 was announced on Tuesday.\n\nNew symptom of COVID-19?\n\nMarch 24: A loss of a sense of smell or taste may be a symptom of COVID-19, medical groups representing ear, nose and throat specialists have warned.\n\nCiting a growing number of cases around the globe, the American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery and ENT UK each issued warnings about patients who tested positive for the new coronavirus with the only symptom being a lost or altered sense of smell or taste.\n\n\"Anecdotal evidence is rapidly accumulating from sites around the world that anosmia and dysgeusia are significant symptoms associated with the COVID-19 pandemic,\" the American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery wrote in a statement.\n\nAnosmia is the loss of smell while dysgeusia is an altered sense of taste.\n\nTrump sets Easter as possible date to lift restrictions\n\nMarch 24: President Trump said Tuesday that he would like to have the government restrictions on travel and social gatherings eased by Easter, which comes on Sunday, April 12.\n\n“We’re going to be opening relatively soon,” Trump said during a Fox News town hall Tuesday. “I'd love to have it open by Easter ... It's such an important day for other reasons but I'll make an important date for this too. I would love to have the country, opened up and just raring to go by Easter.”\n\nAsked if it’s possible for the country to return to normal by Easter, Trump said, “I think it’s absolutely possible. Now, people are going to have to practice all of the social distancing and things we’re doing now. … But we have to get our country back to work.”\n\nTrump seemed to suggest Americans could both go to work and adhere to social distancing practices but did not specify how that would work.\n\nShortly after Trump’s remarks, three major U.S. health organizations – representing the nation’s doctors, nurses and hospitals – issued a public plea to Americans to stay home.\n\n“Staying at home in this urgent moment is our best defense to turn the tide against COVID-19,” wrote the American Medical Association, American Hospital Association, and American Nurses Association in an open letter.\n\nArizona's known coronavirus deaths increase to 5, total cases to 326\n\nMarch 24: Arizona's COVID-19 cases are accelerating quickly as more testing becomes available, with 326 identified cases and five known deaths reported Tuesday.\n\nThe number of cases increased 39% since Monday.\n\nGov.

The establishments are urged to offer curbside service.\n\nGyms, athletic facilities and hair and nail salon providers also opened \"subject to social-distancing and sanitation rules and guidelines.\" Gyms are forbidden from offering sports that require close contact with others or sharing sporting apparatus and equipment. They must also limit capacity to 50%.\n\nThe order also removed a 10-person restriction on nonwork gatherings. That will allow churches to resume regular services.\n\nPreviously, Ivey loosened some restrictions on retail operations, and said the state would monitor the situation to decide what further steps could be taken.\n\nAlaska\n\nLife went back to the way it was \"prior to the virus\" on May 22, Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced.\n\nAll businesses – including restaurants, bars, retail stores and gyms – will be allowed to open without any capacity restrictions and without needing to provide hand sanitizer or enforcing social distancing guidelines.\n\nPreviously, Dunleavy and state officials had issued a number of health orders as a part of the phased Reopen Alaska Responsibly Plan. The final two phases were carried out simultaneously on May 22.\n\nOn April 24, Alaska began allowing restaurants to resume dine-in service and for retail shops and other businesses to reopen, all with limitations, under an initial phase of the state's reopening plan.\n\nPersonal care services, like barbershops and nail and hair salons, were allowed to reopen April 27.\n\nGatherings have been limited to 20 people, or 25% maximum capacity, whichever number is smaller and can now include guests from other households. Social distancing, however, must be obeyed.\n\nReligious services must also follow the gathering guidelines.\n\nArizona\n\nGyms, spas and community swimming pools were allowed to open May 13, and professional sports leagues were allowed to begin practicing in Arizona after the state's current stay-at-home order expired May 15, Gov. Doug Ducey said.\n\nMovie theaters also opened May 16.\n\nThose activities can resume as long as appropriate health precautions are in place, Ducey said.\n\nAdditionally, The Grand Canyon National Park opened its South Rim entrance on May 15, with some restrictions. It opened despite objections from Navajo officials and others that it could hurt efforts to control the coronavirus.\n\nBarbershops and salons were able to resume hair, nail, waxing and other services by appointment May 8, if they limit occupancy, implement social distancing measures, up sanitation protocols and provide cloth masks to employees, the governor said.\n\nOn May 11, restaurants and coffee shops started offering dine-in service. To do so, they are required to limit occupancy and physically distance diners, in addition to checking employees for COVID-19 symptoms before their shifts.\n\nArkansas\n\nPools and water parks can reopen on May 22 with new capacity limits and other restrictions, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said May 8.\n\nArkansas restaurants were also able to reopen their dining rooms on May 11 with restrictions.\n\nDental services resumed May 11. State Health Secretary Dr. Nate Smith said the original plan was to resume dental services on May 18, but the dental lobby persuaded the state that protective gear supplies were sufficient and that protective protocols were planned by most dentists.\n\nThe state's three casinos reopened on May 18.\n\nLarge outdoor venues may reopen to the public with a limit on the size of crowds, Hutchinson said May 4.

Gavin Newsom said sports would be permitted to return to his state the first week of June, with certain restrictions and without spectators.\n\nThe California State University system that comprises 23 campuses such as Fresno State, San Diego State and San Jose State announced May 12 that it would cancel in-person classes for the fall semester. Online instruction will still be offered, with a few exceptions for courses.\n\nNewsom said more businesses could reopen statewide and approved requests from counties to move ahead more quickly if they have been minimally harmed by the pandemic. Los Angeles County, the most populated in the state, has targeted July 4 for a fuller reopening.\n\nOn May 20, Ventura County, which has been under stay-at-home orders since mid-March, became the first county in Southern California to be approved for accelerated reopening.\n\nLos Angeles County reopened its beaches May 13 for “active recreation,” and similar moves were announced for several beaches along Ventura County's south coast.\n\nNewsom has repeatedly said counties can impose restrictions that are more stringent than state orders. In mid-May, Tesla's car plant reopened, defying orders from the Alameda County Public Health Department, which has deemed the factory a nonessential business that can’t fully open under virus restrictions.\n\nColorado\n\nCamping in state parks resume by reservation only on May 12, Gov. Jared Polis said. Counties can decide independently if they do not want to reopen camping in state parks within their boundaries.\n\nPolis said officials expect to have more data about how the coronavirus is being transmitted on May 25, giving them \"more data to make the call\" on next steps for restaurants, summer camps and spring skiing.\n\nOffices deemed nonessential were allowed to reopen May 4 with reduced staff. Current restrictions allow curbside retail and real estate showings. Getting a haircut and shopping in person at retail stores were allowed again in much of Colorado starting May 1 as the state eased restrictions.\n\nDenver lifted its stay-home restrictions on the weekend of May 9, and Polis said state officials would be paying close attention to potential health impacts.\n\nOne week before the state's stay-at-home order lifted April 27, Polis announced the next phase, called \"safer at home\": The goal is for Coloradans to maintain 60% to 65% social distancing, and vulnerable residents should continue to shelter in place.\n\nSchools will remain closed, and bars and restaurants will not immediately reopen.\n\nColorado hospitals, dental offices, optometrists and other health care providers could start seeing patients for elective procedures again by early May.\n\nConnecticut\n\nThe Constitution State took its first steps toward a return to normalcy on May 20, as offices, retail stores, malls, restaurants (for outdoor dining), outdoor museums and zoos are now open.\n\nBut, Gov. Ned Lamont pushed back the reopening of barbershops and nail salons, originally set for the same day, until June 1.\n\nBeth Bye, the commissioner of the state Office of Early Childhood, said May 11 that summer camps could open on June 29 with strict public health guidelines in place. The governor’s office later clarified that would not include overnight camps.\n\nOn May 5, Lamont canceled in-person classes at all Connecticut K-12 public schools for the rest of this school year, requiring districts to continue distance learning.\n\nDelaware\n\nGov. John Carney announced that all retail establishments in Delaware may operate by appointment only beginning May 20.\n\nGov.

Ron DeSantis announced May 22 that summer camps and youth activities can open without restrictions. He said local organizations and governments can set rules and guidelines. The state won’t preempt those rules, he added.\n\n“I hope that this will be good for folks over the summer,\" he said. \"I really trust parents. I trust the physicians who work with the kids, the local leaders, coaches, camps.\"\n\nGov. DeSantis said May 15 that people who are healthier are less likely to die from the coronavirus, which is part of his rationale to include gyms as the state expands the first phase of its reopening.\n\nBeginning May 18, the state also increased restrictions on restaurant and retail store capacity from 25% to 50%, as well as allowing the reopening of museums, libraries and gyms at 50% capacity. Bars and movie theaters will remain closed.\n\nOn May 20, the state's biggest tourist destination – Walt Disney World – began its reopening by opening its shopping and entertainment complex (but not the park itself.)\n\nOn May 14, DeSantis signed an executive order to move Miami-Dade County and Broward County – both of which are the hardest hit in the state – into Phase One of his reopening plan.\n\nBeaches in the two counties will remain closed. Miami, Miami Beach and Hialeah – Miami-Dade’s bigger cities – will allow retailers to reopen May 20 and restaurants to open, likely, the following week.\n\nThe counties account for almost half of the state's confirmed virus cases.\n\nBoth Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez and Broward County Mayor Dale Holness said that when beaches do open in their counties, they will be at the same time to avoid people flocking to one location. Beaches will not open until at least May 26, Holness said.\n\nDeSantis allowed hair stylists, barbers and nail technicians to reopen, he announced May 8. In mid-May, DeSantis signaled the state's openness to pro sports returning..\n\nGeorgia\n\nGov. Brian Kemp on May 12 announced plans to relax some restaurant restrictions and allow some summer camps to open but extend bar and nightclub closures through May.\n\nKemp allowed businesses such as tattoo parlors, bowling alleys and hair and nail salons to reopen with restrictions in late April, a sweeping move that prompted national criticism. Restaurants and movie theaters have since been able to welcome customers back in on a limited basis, and a statewide shelter-at-home order has expired.\n\nSome malls reopened May 4, though things were far from normal with many businesses inside still shuttered and parking lots sparsely filled.\n\nKemp allowed his statewide shelter-in-place order to expire at midnight April 30 but extended his emergency powers to June 12 and told the elderly and medically fragile to stay at home until then.\n\nIn-person religious services resumed over the April 25-26 weekend, and restaurants and theaters reopened on April 27 with \"specific social distancing and sanitation mandates.\"\n\nHawaii\n\nGov. David Ige has relaxed some restrictions, including allowing shopping malls to reopen. In Maui, they did so May 11; in Oahu they reopened May 15.\n\nBeaches on Oahu opened on May 16.\n\nIge in early May issued an updated proclamation allowing certain establishments to reopen, including astronomical observatories.

Brad Little allowed his five-week stay-at-home order to expire April 30. Idaho residents have been successful at reducing infections and deaths, Little said.\n\nOn May 14, Little gave the go-ahead to begin stage two of reopening Idaho as scheduled on May 16. That meant that dine-in restaurants, nail and hair salons, and gyms began reopening on May 16.\n\nOn May 1, the state entered the first of his four-stage plan to recover from the economic damage caused by the virus. Little said the process will take time, and advancing through the stages to return the state to near normalcy by the end of June will be based on declining infections and strong testing. The readiness of the health care system is another factor.\n\nChild-care centers were able to reopen May 1. Churches also reopened with distancing and sanitation rules. Bars, gyms, salons, movie theaters and sporting venues remain closed. Restaurants can offer curbside and delivery service.\n\nIllinois\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker announced a five-phase reopening plan May 5 called \"Restore Illinois\" and indicated at that time that the state was already in the plan's second phase, with nonessential businesses open for curbside pickup and delivery.\n\nAlso part of the second phase, residents are directed to wear face coverings when outside and can resume outdoor recreational activities such as golf, boating and fishing as long as social distancing is practiced.\n\nPritzker first issued a stay-at-home order in March, which has been extended to the end of May with some restrictions eased, including the reopening of some state parks. The plan says reopening contingent on meeting certain metrics, with the last phase allowed only if there's a vaccine or an effective treatment.\n\nOn May 8, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot released the city's five-step path toward re-opening, which includes some stricter standards than the state plan.\n\nThe next phase of the state plan will see manufacturing, offices, retail, barbershops and salons reopen with capacity limits and social distancing requirements. Health clubs, gyms and fitness studios will be allowed to provide one-on-one personal training in indoor facilities and outdoor fitness classes. Gatherings of 10 or fewer will be allowed, including groups boating and camping, and face coverings and social distancing will also remain standard.\n\nPritzker announced Wednesday that the state was on track to enter the next phase on May 29. Restaurants and bars would also be allowed to reopen for outdoor service starting in the third phase, earlier than expected,Pritzker said.\n\nIndiana\n\nOn May 24, a major reopening of Indiana will occur, with gyms, fitness centers, playgrounds, pools, campgrounds, and movie theatres scheduled to open, all with restrictions. Also, retail stores and malls may move to 75% of capacity while maintaining social distancing, WHTI-TV reports.\n\nAs of May 4, Gov.

Those establishments will continue to be subject to some capacity restrictions and extra health measures.\n\nReynolds said May 6 she will allow dental services to resume and campgrounds, drive-in theaters, tanning facilities and other businesses to reopen statewide beginning May 8 if they meet certain requirements.\n\nReynolds is allowing retail stores in malls to reopen, but the shopping centers must keep common spaces such as play areas and food courts closed. She's also allowing fitness centers to reopen by appointment only, limiting to one person inside at a time.\n\nDentists may resume providing services if they comply with guidelines for safely reopening adopted by the Iowa Dental Board, have adequate personal protective equipment, demonstrate a plan to preserve such equipment and have a supply chain to obtain more equipment if needed.\n\nKansas\n\nGov.

Michelle Lujan Grisham announced April 30 that the state would begin to ease business restrictions, acknowledging that the coronavirus has brought about an \"economic crisis.\"\n\nMany nonessential retailers, pet groomers, state parks and golf courses resumed operations May 1 in a limited way under a new, modified state public health order. The new order is in effect through May 15.\n\nNew Mexico's \"slight reopening\" began May 16, but everyone is required to wear a face mask in public spaces and the stay-at-home order remains in effect, KVIA-TV said.\n\nGrisham announced May 5 that employees of essential businesses operating in New Mexico will be required to wear face coverings.\n\nHere's what's not opening: movie theaters, casinos, barbershops and hair salons, gyms, indoor malls, camping centers and state park visitor centers, and offices or workplaces.\n\nRestaurants and bars can only operate as curbside or delivery. Gatherings of five people or more are still prohibited.\n\nNew York\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo said on May 18 that \"New York State is ready and willing to partner with major sports teams that are interested in playing games safely, without fans.\"\n\nParts of New York were allowed to reopen May 15, Cuomo said.\n\nThe Finger Lakes, Southern Tier, Mohawk Valley and North Country met the required seven metrics to enter Phase 1 of the state's plan to reopen. The metrics include a 14-day decline of hospitalizations, a 14-day decline of hospitalized deaths, new hospitalizations to drop to under two per 100,000 residents and a share of total hospital beds available of at least 30%, among others.\n\nCuomo also announced that New York reopened statewide certain low-risk businesses and recreational activities on May 15, including landscaping and gardening, outdoor low-risk recreational activities like tennis and drive-in movie theaters.\n\nReligious gatherings limited to 10 people were allowed to resume May 21, the New York Times said.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said May 11 that closures of nonessential businesses are likely to extend in the city through May.\n\n“June is when we’re potentially going to be able to make some real changes if we can continue our progress,” de Blasio said.\n\nNew York has extended some executive orders but still hasn't decided on how long it would extend its stay-at-home order, Cuomo's office said.\n\nNew York’s schools and colleges will remain shut through the end of the academic year, Cuomo said.\n\nThe state updated its guidance for golf courses, opening the door for public and private courses to open. Golfers will have to walk the course and carry their own bags without a motorized cart, according to Dani Lever,Cuomo's communications director.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nStarting on May 8, North Carolina began lifting certain restrictions as the state transitions to Phase 1 of a three-phase plan.\n\nGov. Roy Cooper previously said Phase 1 is expected to last two to three weeks, or until at least May 22. On that date, restaurants, personal care businesses and pools reopened, the New York Times said.\n\nIf data trends look promising, the state would move into Phase 2, which includes the lifting of the stay-at-home order and a limited reopening of other businesses and churches with reduced capacity.\n\nUnder Phase 1, people will be allowed to leave their homes for commercial activity and to go to any business that is open – though the governor hasn’t elaborated about which businesses that includes when pressed by journalists in statewide briefings.\n\nThe order removes the distinction between essential and nonessential businesses. Retail businesses are allowed to open at 50% capacity and will be required to see that customers are at least 6 feet apart, the release says. Businesses also will be required to screen workers for COVID-19 symptoms, perform frequent cleanings and provide hand sanitizer when available.\n\nBut many businesses will remain closed. Restaurants may not open for seated customers and may operate only in the capacity of takeout, drive-thru and delivery. Bars, gyms and personal care businesses, such as barber shops and hair salons, also will remain closed. Likewise, entertainment venues will stay closed.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGov. Doug Burgum unveiled guidelines April 28 for reopening certain businesses.\n\nMost businesses reopened May 1. Burgum eased restrictions that included limiting bars and restaurants to half capacity, requiring barbers and cosmetologists to wear masks and prohibiting some high-intensity fitness classes. Burgum said movie theaters could also reopen if they do such things as limit seating and stagger start times.\n\nWhile most businesses may reopen with precautions, other large-scale venues and K-12 schools are closed until further notice, Burgum said.\n\nOhio\n\nGov. Mike DeWine announced that hair salons, barbershops and other personal care businesses will reopen on May 15.

Organized sports and weddings also are allowed to resume.\n\nState health officials had given strict directives for social distancing and disinfection, allowing restaurants to open dining rooms May 15. Movie theaters, churches and concert halls, gyms, salons and other businesses have all reopened.\n\nThunderbird Casinos in Norman and Shawnee did a soft opening May 12 to allow patrons a chance to gamble on select slot machines.\n\nBars are still closed, as are city playgrounds. Social gatherings of 10 or more people are still forbidden.\n\nGov. Kevin Stitt's three-phase plancalled \"Open Up and Recover Safely\" allowed personal care businesses to open April 24 by appointment only.\n\nOregon\n\nOn May 18, a judge said that Gov. Kate Brown's emergency coronavirus restrictions violate state law and are “null and void,” CNN said. The state immediately filed an appeal with the Oregon Supreme Court.\n\nRural counties with few cases that meet a series of health and safety prerequisites can apply to enter phase one of a three-part plan to reopen Oregon, Brown announced May 7.\n\nIn the first phase, under certain restrictions, restaurants can offer sit-down service, personal care businesses — such as gyms and salons — can open and gatherings of up to 25 people can occur.\n\nThe governor's office began accepting applications from counties starting May 8 with many opening on May 15. On that day, 31 of the state's 36 counties began to ease stay-home restrictions and enter into Phase 1 of the governor's reopening plan, according to KGW-TV.\n\nOregon reopened a small number of outdoor destinations on May 6, beginning a gradual effort to relax limits imposed on recreation. Eight state parks and boat ramps reopened at that time, with more places to come the following week, officials said.\n\nSki resorts will also be able to resume activities under a forthcoming executive order from Brown.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nGov. Tom Wolf said May 8 that 13 more counties will move to the yellow phase of reopening the following week. Also on May 8: Two dozen previously announced counties located in rural northern Pennsylvania made that transition.\n\nThe 13 new counties are in the western part of the state, including much of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.\n\nStay-at-home orders will be lifted in \"yellow\" counties and retail shops can start to reopen, though other restrictions will remain in place as counties move from \"red\" to \"yellow\" in a three-phase reopening plan.\n\nWolf also allowed golfers to hit the course and boaters to hit the water starting May 1.\n\nGolf courses, marinas, guided fishing trips and privately owned campgrounds will be able to open, but campgrounds in state parks remained closed through May 14. Social distancing and masking guidelines will be required just as for other essential businesses.\n\nWolf also announced that he reopened construction in the state beginning on May 1, moved up from May 8.\n\nAfter state liquor stores were closed in March, the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board is now allowing select stores to offer curbside delivery.\n\nPreviously, Wolf signed a bill to allow online notary services so online auto sales can resume.\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nOn May 11, Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced allowed construction and manufacturing to resume, provided that strict measures are followed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nAmong the sectors included are private construction and maintenance and repair work done to bolster the infrastructure in anticipation of hurricane season.\n\nThat follows comments made by Manuel Laboy, the secretary of the Department of Economic Development and Commerce, that other businesses like barber shops and hair salons would be able to open May 25 as long as confirmed new cases continue to decline.\n\nA medical task force appointed by Vázquez Garced submitted recommendations on April 25, suggesting that Puerto Rico abide by strict social distancing and hygienic measures for 18 to 24 months, absent of a vaccine or proven treatment for the virus.\n\nThe task force recommends a gradual reopening in four stages, broken down by the infection rate per industry. In the first tier are construction, mining, computing, agriculture and manufacturing. Rather than provide specific target dates for the stages, it recommended enacting each by monitoring the rate of transmission on the island.\n\nOn May 1, Vázquez Garced extended a lockdown order through May 25. It allows residents to leave their homes only from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. for essential activities. After 7 p.m., a daily curfew goes into effect until the following morning. The latest extension allows residents to walk, jog, run, ride bicycles and exercise, while observing social distancing measures from 5 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nRhode Island\n\nGov. Gina Raimondo lifted a statewide stay-at-home order effective May 9.\n\nRetail shops deemed nonessential and some parks can reopen. The state's limit of five people or less for social gatherings remains in effect, however.\n\nRaimondo announced May 12 that the state will allow restaurants to offer limited outdoor dining starting May 18 under regulations from the governor’s office.\n\nRaimondo on April 22 announced plans to roll out a staged reopening of parks and beaches in the coming weeks, citing encouraging virus statistics.\n\n“It is my hope that we will be able to enjoy our parks and beaches in some form or fashion in the month of May,” she said.\n\nThe next phase of reopening, however, will wait until June, the governor said Friday.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nOn May 11, Gov. Henry McMaster allowed dining inside South Carolina restaurants to resume.\n\nAnd close-contact businesses including gyms, barber shops, hair salons and pools reopened on May 18.\n\nRestaurants are limited to 50% capacity. State officials also issued a host of guidelines detailing how tables and equipment must be sanitized.\n\nMcMaster also removed all remaining coronavirus-related restrictions on South Carolina boaters, including a prohibition against anchoring in waterways except for fishing.\n\nThe announcement came four days after outdoor dining was allowed to resume at restaurants in the state. A mandatory stay-home order also was lifted Monday in South Carolina.\n\nMcMaster announced a plan April 21 called \"Accelerate South Carolina\" to \"stomp on the gas\" and reopen certain sectors of the economy.\n\nClothing, department, furniture, jewelry and sporting goods stores, as well as florists and flea markets can reopen but will be forced to operate at reduced capacity. The closure on beaches will be lifted, though it will be up to local officials to decide on the reopening of specific beaches.\n\nThe order still encourages social distancing directives to be followed. Barber shops, beauty salons, bingo halls, gyms and nightclubs must remain closed for now.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nGov. Kristi Noem unveiled in late April a \"Back to Normal Plan\" for businesses and residents for the next phase of the coronavirus response.\n\nThe plan lays out actions for residents, employers, schools and health care providers once four criteria categories are met, including a downward trajectory of documented coronavirus cases for 14 days in an area with sustained community spread.\n\nNoem had not issued a stay-at-home order but had placed some statewide restrictions.\n\nTennessee\n\nGuidance issued by Gov. Bill Lee's office May 1 says house of worship should exercise caution, encouraging their community members to wear face coverings and remain six feet away from others. The guidance urges faith communities to \"conduct as many activities as possible remotely.\"\n\nThe state reopened salons and barbershops May 6, the latest in a string of restrictions to be loosened in the state.\n\nDetails of business restrictions in the order, which also continued the state of emergency, apply to all but six counties in the state. Those counties, which are home to the state's larger urban areas, are following the guidance of their respective health departments which are operated locally.\n\nElvis Presley's Graceland in Memphis will reopen the week of May 18 after closing March 20. Tour capacity will be reduced to 25% and temperature checks will be given to guests.\n\nNashville city officials transitioned to the first phase of reopening the city on May 11, allowing restaurants and retail stores to open at half capacity, despite a recent increase in new coronavirus cases.\n\nPreviously, Lee allowed for restaurants to reopen on April 27, many retailers on April 29 and gyms on May 1, each of which came with rules on limited capacity and suggested guidelines.\n\nUnder Tennessee’s plan, businesses in six counties – Davidson, Shelby, Knox, Hamilton, Madison and Sullivan – will not open until local officials sign off on their own reopening proposals.\n\nOn April 28, Lee issued an executive order extending the closure of bars and close-contact businesses through the end of May.\n\nTexas\n\nGov. Greg Abbott on Monday announced his next wave of reopenings designed to restart the Texas economy during the coronavirus pandemic, saying child care facilities can reopen immediately, bars can open May 22 with limited capacity and sporting events can return without fans at the end of the month, the Texas Tribune said. Abbott also said he would permit restaurants to operate at 50% capacity starting May 22, up from 25% that’s allowed now.\n\nHair and nail salons reopened May 8 with restrictions on capacity and distances and gyms got back to business on May 18, Gov. Abbott said.\n\nBars, meanwhile, will remain shuttered pending more information on the best ways to keep staff and customers safe amid the fast-spreading pandemic, Abbott said.\n\nEvery restaurant and retailer across the state was allowed to open doors to customers May 1, although more widely in some cities than others and still under social distancing requirements.\n\nOutdoor sports such as golf and tennis can resume, as long as four people or fewer are participating in the event and social distancing is followed.\n\nAbbott announced executive orders April 17 that mandated all schools, public and private, to remain closed for the rest of the school year.\n\nAbbott, seeking to end a political firestorm, announced May 7 that officials will be prohibited from jailing Texans for violating any of his coronavirus-related executive orders.\n\nUtah\n\nGov. Gary Herbert said most of the state moved to \"yellow,\" or low-risk, May 16.\n\nA yellow designation means there can be social gatherings of up to 50 people, team sports are allowed and swimming pools are opened. Additionally, travel is opened up throughout the state — though Washington County has seen significant visitor numbers in recent weeks at the state parks.\n\nUtah moved May 1 from the \"red\" to \"orange\" phase of Herbert's proposal to gradually scale back restrictions.\n\nEvery household also has a chance to order face masks from the government. The program, which he dubbed \"A Mask for every Utahn,\" was unveiled as Herbert announced an official step back from the state's most stringent stay-at-home orders.\n\nVermont\n\nGov. Phil Scott made moves to relax numerous restrictions in early May.\n\nVermont's retail stores began to reopen on May 18. The stores will have to abide by certain conditions to reopen, including requiring all employees to wear masks and limiting the number of people in the store at a time. Big box stores will also be allowed to begin selling non-essential items again.\n\nChild care programs and summer camps will be allowed to open this summer — as long as they follow strict health guidelines, Scott said May 8. Regulated day care facilities that adopt those guidelines would be able to open June 1.\n\nGatherings of 10 people or fewer were allowed with precautions and golf courses and some other forms of outdoor recreation reopened May 7, Scott announced May 6.\n\nSome elective health care procedures will be able to resume as the spread of the new coronavirus in the state continues to slow, Scott announced May 4.\n\nScott on May 1 also announced additional steps to ease restrictions under the state's \"Stay Home, Stay Safe\" order.\n\nManufacturing, construction and distribution companies reopened May 4, with a maximum of 10 employees. The following week, on May 11, those same sectors re-opened at full operations with as few employees as necessary.\n\nIn order to return to work, Vermont employers and employees must undergo mandatory health and safety training developed by the Vermont Occupational Safety and Health Agency.\n\nVirginia\n\nOn May 12, Gov. Ralph Northam signed an executive order that allows much of the state to enter Phase One of his \"Forward Virginia\" plan and reopen on May 15.\n\nThe new order also allowed certain Northern Virginia localities to delay Phase One until midnight on May 28 in order to meet health metrics. Northern Virginia, whose counties are close to Washington, D.C., has suffered a higher infection rate than the rest of the state.\n\nNortham detailed measures in Phase one:\n\nNon-essential retail — In phase one, non-essential retail stores will be allowed to operate at 50% capacity. Northam said this is a slight increase from the current 10 person limit.\n\n— In phase one, non-essential retail stores will be allowed to operate at 50% capacity. Northam said this is a slight increase from the current 10 person limit. Restaurants and breweries — Restaurants, breweries and beverage services will still be limited to take out and delivery. If a restaurant or brewery already has a permit for outdoor seating they will be allowed to operate service in the outdoor area at 50% capacity.\n\n— Restaurants, breweries and beverage services will still be limited to take out and delivery.

Northam said the state is setting high bar to ease restrictions at beaches.\n\nNortham expects Phase One to last a minimum of two weeks, but it could last longer.\n\nNortham allowed elective surgeries and dental procedures to resume May 1. Veterinarians will also be allowed to see non-emergency pets, Northam said.\n\nWashington\n\nNon-essential medical procedures and services can resume May 18, CNN reported.\n\nOn May 11, Gov. Jay Inslee outlined metrics that counties must reach before they are allowed to enter Phase 2 of his \"Safe Start\" plan. Counties with fewer than 75,000 residents that have not had a new coronavirus case over a three-week span can apply for a variance to enter Phase 2 before other parts of the state.\n\nOnce approved, counties may enter Phase 2 effective immediately. It allows restaurants to resume operations at limited capacity. Restaurants will not be required to get customers’ contact information as initially planned, Inslee's office said in a May 15 release.\n\nThe Democratic governor's office in a news release Friday said that instead, businesses are asked to keep a list of those who voluntarily provide contact information.\n\nInslee said on May 8 curbside retail sales in Washington could begin almost immediately for businesses with reopening plans approved by health officials. Multiple rural counties will also be able to relax some stay-at-home restrictions early as the state move through the reopening process.\n\nInslee announced May 1 that the state's coronavirus stay-at-home order would be extended through at least May 31 and said there will be a four-stage phase for lifting of restrictions, starting with allowing retail curbside pickup, automobile sales and car washes by mid-May.\n\nThere will be a minimum of three weeks between each phase, though he said some counties with lower numbers of cases and deaths may be able to open parts of their economy sooner if approved by the Department of Health.\n\nFishing, hunting and golfing resumed on May 5, at which time people could also return to state parks and other state lands for day trips.\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nOn May 13, Mayor Muriel Bowser extended the District's stay-at-home order through June 8.\n\nSix stores, including four bookstores, were allowed to reopen May 18.\n\nBowser announced on April 23 the formation of a task force, the Reopen D.C. Advisory Group, that will issue recommendations in May on the timeline to ease restrictions. To accelerate the process, Bowser said the city would look to hire several hundred contact tracers.\n\nBowser said the District will be \"deliberate and strategic\" in its plans.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWest Virginia Gov. Jim Justice on May 13 widened the most aggressive phase of his coronavirus reopening strategy to allow tanning salons to open just before Memorial Day weekend.\n\nOn May 18, fitness centers, gymnasiums and recreation centers were able to resume operations in West Virginia, with limitations.\n\nJustice announced that more businesses would reopen, including restaurants with indoor seating on May 21.\n\nLarge specialty retail stores can open back up on that date. That doesn't include indoor malls, but he said mall anchor stores with exterior entrances can resume operations.\n\nBar areas at restaurants must remain closed and those businesses are limited to 50% seating capacity. Patrons will not be allowed to congregate in waiting areas and there will be no buffet-style service or self-serve salad bars. Drinks are recommended to be served in cans or bottles, according to the guidelines.\n\nOn May 11 physical therapy centers and drive-in movie theaters were allowed to reopen.\n\nJustice has so far let hospitals resume elective procedures and allowed the reopening of small businesses, outdoor dining restaurants and barber shops.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court on May 13 struck down Gov. Tony Evers' order shutting down daily life, marking the first time a statewide order of its kind has been knocked down by a court of last resort.\n\nThe ruling, for now, immediately throws out the administration's tool to control the disease for which there is no vaccine and comes at a time when Evers has already begun lifting some restrictions as the spread of the virus slows down for now.\n\nOn May 11, Evers said all stand-alone or strip-mall based retail stores are able to offer in-person shopping, as long as customers are limited to five at a time and social distancing practices are maintained. The new order is \"focused on small retailers,\" Evers said.\n\nEssential retail businesses like grocery and hardware stores were opened with reduced capacity.\n\nAnd on May 1, 34 state parks and forests could open under special conditions. The openings come with attendance limits and reduced daily hours, while facilities like public restrooms, shelters and playgrounds will remain closed.\n\nOutdoor recreational vehicle rentals like those that deal with boats, golf carts, kayaks and ATVs could also open April 29, as could automatic or self-service car washes.\n\nWyoming\n\nWyoming will again allow people to dine in at restaurants, meet in bars and gather in larger numbers, Gov. Mark Gordon said May 13.\n\nBar and restaurant tables will need to seat no more than 6 people at a time and be spaced at least 6 feet apart. Staff must wear face coverings and be screened for symptoms of COVID-19 under new state public health orders that took effect May 15.\n\nAs many as 25 people — up from 10 currently — will be allowed to gather, enabling movie theaters and other performance venues to reopen with limited numbers of customers.\n\nOn May 15, a strip club in Cheyenne became one of the first in the country to reopen.\n\nYellowstone and Grand Teton national parks also reopened on May 18.\n\nWyoming's famed Devils Tower National Monument partially reopened May 22 after an almost two-month closure.\n\nPreviously, Wyoming eased some of its coronavirus restrictions May 1, with barbershops, gyms, nail salons and child care centers among the businesses that were allowed limited re-openings, Gordon said.\n\nGordon also said residents were allowed to camp at state parks as of May 15.\n\nContributing: Savannah Behrmann, Grace Hauck, USA TODAY; Natalie Allison, Nashville Tennessean; Stacey Barchenger, Bergen Record; Teresa Boeckel, York Daily Record; Lisa Kaczke, Sioux Falls Argus Leader; Laura Peters, Staunton News Leader; Dustin Racioppi, Bergen Record; Sady Swanson, Fort Collins Coloradoan; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/05/06/meat-woes-food-pantries-counterfeit-masks-news-around-states/111665872/", "title": "Meat woes, food pantries: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: Traffic accidents are killing fewer people as they stay home more and drive less during the pandemic. Highway deaths in April dropped 58% from March and 42% from a year earlier, according to statistics from the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. State troopers also investigated 43% fewer traffic accidents in April than in March. Troopers in Mobile and Baldwin worked only one fatal crash in April. “It’s pretty unusual for around here. That kind of stood out,” Lt. Joe Piggott, a state trooper spokesman, told WALA-TV. The Alabama Department of Transportation reports traffic volume over a nearly three-week period in April was down by about 46% compared with 2019. One consequence of less congestion may be a tendency for drivers who are on the roads to drive faster. “It seems like the speeds are increasing on the highways,” Piggott said. “We’ve clocked quite a few at triple digits.”\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Dentists say their business may be hurt by a state mandate requiring patients to have a negative test result for the coronavirus within 48 hours of an elective procedure. The testing requirements cover non-emergency procedures generating aerosols, floating airborne particles that can carry the virus and are produced through the use of many dental tools, Alaska Public Media reports. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy and state health officials said elective health care procedures could restart in a phased approach, but they point to federal guidelines saying dentists are at high risk of virus exposure. Dr. David Nielson, president of the Alaska Board of Dental Examiners, told state Chief Medical Officer Dr. Anne Zink there is a challenge for patients to obtain test results within 48 hours of a dental appointment. “We do believe that waiting for the availability of testing to ramp up to the levels that would be necessary will jeopardize the oral health of the public,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Restaurants in the state can reopen next week amid a downward trend in coronavirus cases and other measurements laid out by federal officials, Gov. Doug Ducey announced Monday. Ducey said restaurants can open next Monday, and salons and barbershops can open this Friday. The businesses will need enhanced sanitation and social distancing to open their doors. Ducey is also considering allowing some food establishments that are licensed as bars to open as well. The decisions came less than a week after the Republican governor extended his stay-home order until May 15. The order remains in place, although closed retail businesses were allowed to start curbside sales Monday and can resume full in-store sales Friday. The governor has been hammered by some Republican lawmakers, who were angered at the extended closure order because the economy has tanked.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Movie theaters, bowling alleys, arenas and other large venues will be allowed to reopen but with new limits to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Monday. The Republican governor continued rolling back the state’s restrictions on businesses as gyms began to reopen with similar social distancing rules. He also issued recommendations to churches and other places of worship, which had not been closed in the state, on how to safely resume in-person services. Hutchinson said large outdoor venues will be allowed to reopen Monday, while indoor ones can open May 18. The venues will face similar restrictions, including limiting audiences to 50 or fewer people and requiring at least 6 feet of distance except for family groups. The recommendations for churches include eliminating the use of items touched by multiple people such as offering plates, no classes for youth or child care, and no physical contact.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: With more local governments moving ahead with their own plans for reopening, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday that the state will begin gradually allowing clothing stores, florists, bookstores and sporting goods shops to open their doors after a nearly seven-week coronavirus shutdown. Newsom said the threat of the virus spreading had leveled off to a point where certain retail businesses could again serve customers starting as early as Friday, but with curbside pickups and other restrictions. Requirements for operation won’t be released until Thursday, and Newsom warned that signs the virus has started spreading rapidly might force him to reimpose tighter restrictions. “I know this can sound confusing,” Newsom said at one point, as he sought to explain various requirements in the state’s evolving plan to emerge from the crisis. “Let’s stay the course; let’s stay together.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Offices in the state were allowed to reopen Monday with half the usual staff, and Denver’s mayor will let his stay-at-home order expire as the outbreak of the coronavirus eases in Colorado. Mayor Michael Hancock’s order is set to expire at the end of Friday. Gov. Jared Polis said Monday that fewer people were being hospitalized with the virus, and he referenced Star Wars multiple times to remind people to wear face masks and to practice social distancing while out. “May the Fourth be with you,” the governor said, using a catchphrase widely shared on May 4, the unofficial holiday celebrating the Star Wars movies. Polis showed graphics of a Darth Vader helmet and a 6-foot-long light saber to hammer home his point on safety precautions. “Darth Vader would be very safe right now despite his preexisting respiratory condition,” Polis cracked.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state agriculture commissioner is considering buying food in bulk to provide to organizations that feed needy people, which have seen huge upticks in demand coupled with challenges in getting supplies, he said Monday. Having the state or another entity do so on behalf of charitable food banks and pantries might help make more food available, said Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt, whose agency was recently tasked with overseeing food insecurity issues amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “Each organization is trying to outbid the other for additional food, and that can’t be the solution,” Hurlburt said at a virtual roundtable with U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, and the organization End Hunger CT. Hurlburt said his agency has already reached agreements with state colleges and universities to use their refrigerators to store bulk purchases of food and is looking to work with other entities.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state will now allow independent contractors and people who work for themselves to file for unemployment. The Delaware State News reports that the benefits are available as of Monday. Such workers normally are ineligible for jobless benefits. But a federal stimulus measure has temporarily opened unemployment benefits to them because of the coronavirus pandemic. People in Delaware who are eligible will receive $600 per week from the federal government. Benefits from the state range from $133 to $400 a week. The $600 federal benefit expires July 25. More than 75,000 Delaware residents have filed for unemployment since the state’s first coronavirus case was reported.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With more than 700,000 residents, the nation’s capital has more people than Vermont and Wyoming, WUSA-TV reports. But the question of statehood for D.C. is something President Donald Trump believes will never happen. In a New York Post interview, Trump said Republicans aren’t “stupid” enough to add guaranteed Democratic seats in Congress. While nearly 86% of district voters in 2016 endorsed statehood, D.C. residents vote heavily for Democratic Party candidates. Trump only received 4.09% of the district’s vote for president in 2016. Trump said he believes the real reason Democrats want to make D.C. a state has nothing to do with representation for its residents but is simply so the party can gain congressional votes.\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach: Officials issued about 900 verbal social distancing warnings to people during the first weekend Volusia County’s beaches were largely reopened for almost all activities. “For the most part, beachgoers spaced out and kept groups small,” Ray Manchester, Volusia County Beach Safety director, said Monday. While the beautiful weather drew crowds to the beaches, most people complied with the spacing rules, Manchester said. He said the heaviest crowds were near large, off-beach parking lots and hotels that have reopened. In addition to warnings, lifeguards made about 100 water rescues over the weekend. The warnings don’t necessarily mean citations or fines for breaking the rules. By and large, the verbal warnings are issued by megaphone to remind people to space out a little more. “When I say we issued warnings,” Manchester said, “what that means is we provided information and education to keep people safe and healthy.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Georgia State Board of Education is allocating $411 million in federal aid to help pay for COVID-19-related issues to the state’s school districts and independent charter schools. The board voted Monday to allocate 90% of the state’s total of $457 million in K-12 aid from the federal CARES Act based on districts’ proportion of students in poverty, as required by the federal law. The state Department of Education will later approve the release of funds after districts submit spending plans. The schools can spend the money on distance learning devices and internet services, supplemental learning efforts, school-provided meals, facility cleaning, equipment, counseling or offsetting potential revenue losses to avoid furloughs. State Superintendent Richard Woods said the state will retain $46 million for future needs.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The University of Hawaii said Monday that it plans to resume in-person instruction at its 10 campuses around the state during the fall 2020 semester. To prevent the coronavirus from spreading, the university plans to reconfigure some classrooms, laboratories and study areas to allow people to stay at least 6 feet apart. University of Hawaii President David Lassner told a news briefing that some classes would adopt a hybrid instruction format. Lectures would be given online, but then students would meet in person in smaller groups. The university switched to online instruction midway through the spring 2020 semester as coronavirus numbers grew in Hawaii. The school said it was also preparing for the possibility it may have to return to all-online courses at one or more of its campuses if there’s a significant outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Before the surge of coronavirus-related joblessness hit, the state estimated it had enough money to cover nearly 16 months’ worth of unemployment benefits. That’s far better than many states, but Idaho’s unemployment trust could still fall short, depending on how long the pandemic lasts. “It’s almost twice as solvent as it was in the Great Recession, so we think it’s very healthy, and it will sustain this one,” said Salvador Vazquez, Idaho Department of Labor’s market information director. “The other question is how long is this going to last, and, you know, nobody has an answer to that.” Idaho calculates its unemployment trust solvency rate based on the most expensive three years in the past 20. The last peak was during the Great Recession: In the first week of March 2009, nearly 4,000 new unemployment claims were filed, and nearly 47,000 people were already receiving unemployment benefits. That amount was dwarfed last month.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The legal sale of marijuana during the state’s first full month of lockdown due to the coronavirus surpassed sales in two previous months, officials announced Monday. The Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation reports April adult-use cannabis sales totaled more than $37.2 million. A little over $7.5 million of sales at the state’s 50 recreational marijuana dispensaries were to out-of-state residents. When Gov. J.B. Pritzker issued his stay-at-home order to battle spread of the coronavirus March 20, he allowed medical and adult-use cannabis dispensaries to remain open as essential businesses. However, operators adapted to the new social situation by implementing online ordering systems, curbside pickup and social distancing in stores. The pandemic has forced Illinois to delay awarding licenses for 75 new recreational cannabis dispensaries.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Shoppers trickled into some large shopping malls Monday as they opened for the first time in more than a month under a new order from the governor easing many restrictions imposed to slow the coronavirus’ spread. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb defended his decision announced Friday allowing more manufacturers and retailers to open their doors in most of the state, with the allowing of nearly all activities to resume July 4. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dr. Woody Myers, a former state health commissioner, called the steps premature, with the state still not providing enough COVID-19 infection testing. Holcomb said he believed it was important to give residents a long-term look at the state’s reopening plan. He said the establishing stages for reopening businesses and activities in stages will depend on Indiana’s number of coronavirus illnesses not suddenly jumping and putting pressure on the hospital system.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Nearly 1,400 workers at three Tyson Foods pork processing plants have tested positive for the coronavirus, the state reported Tuesday, as deaths surged to a new daily high. The Iowa Department of Public Health revealed that the state’s largest outbreak to date has been at the Tyson plant in Perry, in central Iowa. There, 730 workers were confirmed to have the virus, a stunning 58% of those tested, the department said. The Tyson plant in Waterloo has had 444 workers test positive, and its Columbus Junction plant has had 221 confirmed infections, the department said. The department said 258 workers at a National Beef plant in Tama tested positive, as did another 131 employees of a Newton wind turbine blade manufacturer. The department’s deputy director, Sarah Reisetter, said state officials determined that releasing the locations and scope of those five workplace outbreaks was in the public interest.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The hospital in the city is furloughing more than 220 employees because it is struggling financially after temporarily halting elective surgeries and treatments amid the coronavirus outbreak. Lawrence Memorial Hospital said Monday in announcing the furloughs that it has experienced revenue declines of more than $1 million per week since the pandemic began, the Lawrence Journal-World reports. Confirmed coronavirus cases in Kansas rose by 4.3% on Monday, up 215 to 5,245 total, though the actual number is thought to be higher because of limited testing and because people can be infected without showing symptoms. Reported COVID-19-related deaths increased by two. Meanwhile, the Kansas Department of Corrections reported that a third inmate died in a coronavirus outbreak at the state prison in Lansing, near Kansas City. The prison is the state’s hardest hit, with 380 inmates and 88 employees testing positive. Another seven staff and five inmates are infected at six other correctional facilities.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A federal judge has ruled that Gov. Andy Beshear’s restriction on travel amid the coronavirus pandemic is unconstitutional. But U.S. District Judge William O. Bertelsman sided with the governor on his ban of mass gatherings in a ruling issued Monday. A trio of plaintiffs who attended a church service in Louisville had filed suit challenging the two bans. The plaintiffs argued the mass gathering ban unfairly singles out religious gatherings. “To the contrary, the plain text of the challenged order categorically bans all ‘mass gatherings’ as a means of preventing the spread of a life-threatening virus,” Bertelsman wrote in the ruling. The judge said Beshear’s ban on travel “does not pass constitutional muster.” Bertelsman said, for example, it would prohibit a Kentuckian from visiting a relative in Ohio. Beshear said at his daily briefing Monday night that he was aware of the ruling and was willing to amend the travel restrictions.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Nearly every woman in a prison dormitory has tested positive for COVID-19, and two-thirds of them showed no symptoms, state figures show. The women at the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center in St. Gabriel are housed in a dormitory for some of the inmates moved out of the Louisiana Correctional Women’s Institute after floods in 2016, Department of Corrections spokesman Ken Pastorick said last week. He said 155 women without symptoms were tested after 39 became ill with the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. As of Monday, 192 inmates had tested positive, including 66 who had symptoms, according to Department of Correction statistics. The unit has about 195 inmates, though the number fluctuates, Pastorick said Monday. The chart showed 41 dormitory staffers diagnosed with COVID-19 but did not indicate total staffing.\n\nMaine\n\nBethel: A restaurant owner said he’s ready for Round 2 of flouting Democratic Gov. Janet Mills’ executive orders over the coronavirus. Rick Savage said he was reopening his Sunday River Brewing Co. on Tuesday in defiance of the governor’s orders, and he continued to criticize Mills for not acting fast enough to reopen the state’s economy. “They don’t understand. They think they can take their time and figure things out. Businesses aren’t going to last,” he said. Savage opened his restaurant for dine-in customers Friday and then closed over the weekend. He said he’s reopening after determining that his beer-making license wouldn’t be imperiled. The state already revoked his restaurant and liquor licenses, but he has said he’ll pay the fines.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: The state’s most popular beach destination is set to reopen its shore this weekend, and a city official has said “day-trippers” won’t be turned away, even though out-of-town visitors would be violating the state’s stay-at-home order. Ocean City’s mayor and City Council decided Monday to allow beaches and the boardwalk to open Saturday after being closed for more than a month to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, news outlets report. City Council Secretary Mary Knight said the reopening would give people more opportunities to get outside, and she suggested visitors from out of town could enjoy the resort town’s beaches, in addition to local residents. “If they want to come down and spend the day at the beach and walk the boardwalk, there’s no problem with that,” The Baltimore Sun quoted Knight as saying. “It’s Mother’s Day this weekend; it might be nice to take your mom somewhere.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nQuincy: A second Walmart store in the state temporarily closed after an employee died of COVID-19 and several others tested positive for the coronavirus that causes the disease, authorities said. The Walmart in Quincy closed Monday and will remain shuttered until further notice, Mayor Thomas Koch said on the city’s YouTube page. Nine workers, including the woman who died, tested positive, he said. “There are no words to express the loss of our associate, and we are mourning alongside their family,” Walmart said in a statement. The store will undergo a cleaning, and all employees will be tested, Quincy Health Commissioner Ruth Jones said. Walmart said employee temperature checks will continue at the Quincy store once it reopens. Employees will also be provided with face masks and gloves. A Worcester Walmart was shut down last week after dozens of employees tested positive. That store is expected to reopen this week.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A hospital under scrutiny for its treatment of the dead and dying during the coronavirus pandemic has been found in compliance of rules related to staffing and infection control, a state agency said. A spokesman for Michigan’s Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs said in an email Monday to The Detroit News that that no citations were issued against Sinai-Grace in northwest Detroit. The state began looking into Sinai-Grace after the newspaper reported April 9 that people hospitalized with COVID-19 were dying in its hallways and that nurses were searching for body bags and places to put the deceased. CNN later released photos that appeared to show bodies in vacant hospital rooms at Sinai-Grace and in refrigerated trucks in its parking lot. In early April, emergency room nurses protested what they called dangerous working conditions at the hospital, leading to the swift spread of the virus and a staffing crisis, the Detroit Free Press reported.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The COVID-19 pandemic has erased the state’s budget cushion, Minnesota Management and Budget reported Tuesday. The agency said it now projects a nearly $2.43 billion deficit for the current two-year budget period, which runs through mid-2021. That’s almost a $4 billion plunge from a February forecast that projected a $1.5 billion surplus. The projected deficit is slightly larger than the state’s budget reserve of nearly $2.34 billion, which the state can tap to cover the hole in the budget. Budget officials have been warning for the past few weeks that the pandemic would upend its budget projections, and they finally quantified the damage Tuesday. The agency said the economic shock of the pandemic has sharply cut tax revenues by $3.6 billion, while emergency measures have pushed projected spending $391 million higher.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Monday that he will ease some of the restrictions he imposed on restaurants and outdoor gatherings to slow the spread of the coronavirus, and the new rules will take effect Thursday. “The threat is not gone. … We all want to move on, but we must stay vigilant,” said Reeves, a Republican. Restaurants will be allowed to open their indoor dining rooms and outdoor seating areas, with each at no more than 50% capacity and with no more than six customers per table. Servers must wear masks, and customers entering restaurants will be asked if they have shown any signs of the virus or have been exposed to anyone who has it. For more than a month, restaurants have been restricted to takeout or delivery. Outdoor gatherings will be limited to 20 or fewer people, up from the current restriction of 10 or fewer. Reeves said the change could help some youth sports teams get back to practice.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Gov. Mike Parson has a simple reason for not wearing a face mask during a visit to a southwestern Missouri thrift store. “I chose not to,” Parson said tersely Monday in response to a reporter’s question. Parson’s stay-at-home order ended Sunday, and businesses reopened across most of Missouri a day later, except in St. Louis, St. Louis County and Kansas City. The Republican governor spent the morning visiting several businesses in southwestern Missouri. Among them was a thrift shop in Joplin operated by the Disabled American Veterans. A photo posted on Parson’s Twitter account shows him bare-faced but surrounded by mask-wearing veterans. “I think it’s up to the individual,” Parson said in response to a question during his afternoon news conference. “I don’t think its government’s role to mandate who wears a mask and who doesn’t.”\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: After nine years of steady job growth, COVID-19 plunged the state into its worst recession since World War II in just a few weeks, with a new economic forecast estimating the 2020 job loss at more than 51,000. “The world has changed,” said Patrick Barkey, director of the University of Montana’s Bureau of Business and Economic Research. “The economy is at a completely different place than we thought it would be.” In a preliminary analysis of the economic impacts of COVID-19 in Montana, BBER predicts that Montana’s economy will suffer an employment drop of more than 51,000 jobs, a 7.3% decline, in 2020; that personal income in 2020 will be $3.9 billion lower than a December projection, down 7.1%; and that stronger economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 and in 2021 and 2022 could close the gap and bring economic activity back within a medium-term growth projection made before the crisis.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Two meat processing plants in the state have announced temporary closures in the wake of a surge in coronavirus cases among meatpacking plant workers. A Tyson Foods pork plant in Madison and a Cargill beef plant in Schuyler announced Monday that they would temporarily shut down production to deep-clean the plants, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Tyson said it will await the results of workers who had been tested for COVID-19 last weekend before deciding when it will reopen. The closures follow that last week of Tyson’s beef processing plant in Dakota City – its largest in the U.S. – that sidelined some 4,300 workers. The plant had been scheduled to restart production Tuesday, but Tyson postponed the reopening to await results of COVID-19 tests for its workers. The plant closures will affect more than 3,000 workers and will likely slow the ability of producers to get hogs and cattle to slaughter, officials said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: When casinos eventually reopen, customer numbers will be cut in half, nightclubs will remain closed, convention groups will be limited, and gamblers will have to keep safe distances apart, according to new rules from state gambling regulators. “Plans should … address how licensees will disinfect cards and chips,” the Nevada Gaming Control Board guidelines said. Table games should be limited to three players for blackjack, six for craps, four for roulette and four for poker. Chairs could be removed from every second slot machine. Casino supervisors and managers have to prevent patrons from congregating in groups around tables. “We’re definitely going to require a lot of our licensees. They understand they need to get it right,” board Chairwoman Sandra Douglass Morgan said Monday.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Towns and cities are getting $40 million for costs associated with the coronavirus pandemic, and first responders are getting a temporary boost in pay, Gov. Chris Sununu said Monday. New Hampshire’s towns and cities have seen expenses such as overtime pay for police and welfare costs soar during the pandemic. The new grants can be used for those kinds of expenses, as well as costs associated with cleaning municipal buildings and moving services online. Full-time firefighters, emergency medical technicians, corrections officers and police will be eligible for an extra $300 per week, while part-time first responders will get $150 for the next eight weeks. Some Democrats had been calling for municipal aid and hazard pay for first responders for more than a month.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Former Gov. Chris Christie, saying that “there are going to be deaths no matter what,” called for leaders to allow people to get back to work before we “destroy the American way of life” by shutting down during the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking on The Daily DC Podcast hosted by CNN’s Dana Bash on Monday, Christie said, “What we are doing now I just don’t think can be sustained as a country.” The Republican former governor said people claiming a choice must be made between money and lives are offering a “false choice.” Christie also said the medical community might keep us “locked in our houses for another year” until there is a vaccine. He said it’s not time to have concerts or full stadiums for sporting events, and “temperature checks will be a way of life.” Also, we need to continue to “keep our more vulnerable folks inside.” Christie said if he were still governor of New Jersey, “I would be reopening.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: Former Gov. Bill Richardson has recruited two Hollywood actors to help raise money for areas of Dona Ana County that were already struggling before the pandemic. Richardson’s philanthropic foundation is partnering with the Las Cruces Sun-News to promote a relief fund. Richardson said he reached out to Edward James Olmos and Danny Trejo to see if they would join. The fund has already amassed $40,000. Olmos (“Battlestar Galactica”) and Trejo (“Desperado,” “Spy Kids”) said they have fond memories of filming in that part of the state. The colonias are unincorporated, low-income areas in Dona Ana County along the U.S.-Mexico border. The communities there often lack adequate housing and potable water, but the issues have been exacerbated by the pandemic. The Community Action Agency of Southern New Mexico will process applications for those looking for assistance.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state has reported more than 1,700 previously undisclosed deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities amid scrutiny over how New York has protected vulnerable residents during the coronavirus pandemic. At least 4,813 people have died from COVID-19 in the state’s nursing homes since March 1, according to a tally released late Monday that, for the first time, included people believed to have been killed by the virus before their diagnoses could be confirmed by a lab test. Exactly how many nursing home residents have died remains uncertain despite the state’s latest disclosure. The list released by Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration did not include nursing home residents who were transferred to hospitals before dying. With the inclusion of the additional deaths, the state now lists 22 nursing homes, largely in New York City and on Long Island, as having at least 40 deaths. And 62 nursing homes have reported between 20 and 39 deaths.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGastonia: The chairman of the board of a health care system has resigned after reports about his social media posts, including one in which he called stay-at-home orders “tyranny.” CaroMont Health board of directors chairman Donnie Loftis resigned Monday after eight years, The Charlotte Observer reports. On his personal Facebook page, Loftis showed support for anti-abortion protesters who violated the stay-at-home order. Gaston County issued a stay-at-home order March 26. Loftis appeared to support the county order at first, but in April he shared a picture of a pie chart that read: “What I worry about. COVID-19: 0.5, Loss of my rights: 99.5. You should be worried also.” CaroMont previously said board members’ personal opinions and beliefs “are not statements made on the behalf of CaroMont Health nor an indication of the health system’s position on any topic, situation or circumstance.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Health officials say a lack of testing supplies for COVID-19 forced a cancellation of mass screenings Monday in the city, which is North Dakota’s largest metropolitan area and the state’s biggest coronavirus hot spot. Fargo Cass Public Health said on its Facebook page that the event planned at the Fargodome was canceled due to a shortage of supplies at the state Department of Health’s microbiology lab. A spokesman for Gov. Doug Burgum said the cancellation was the result of a “supply chain issue,” and state health officials were investigating the cause. The mass screenings were set for Sunday and Monday afternoons at the Fargodome and were reserved for the close contacts of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and for essential workers. The county health agency said “the goal of 500 tests” was reached Sunday.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine announced Tuesday that he’s cutting $775 million from the state budget in the next two months because of plummeting revenue due to the pandemic. The spending reductions are necessary now to avoid worse cuts down the road and will affect every state agency except the prisons department, the Republican governor said. The state had been running $200 million ahead in revenue estimates in February, DeWine said. He said he’s not tapping Ohio’s $2.7 billion rainy day fund until the new fiscal year beginning in July. The budget can be balanced now with cuts, and the rainy day money will be needed later this year and next, he said. “This rain is not a passing spring shower,” DeWine said. The budget slashing includes $355 million for schools and $110 million for higher education, plus $210 million from the state Medicaid program, which provides health care for poor children and families.\n\nOklahoma\n\nGuymon: At least 116 employees at a pork processing plant have tested positive for coronavirus, Seaboard Foods spokesman David Eahart said in a statement Monday. The plant in Guymon has about 2,700 employees who are advised to stay home if sick, provided face masks and hand-sanitizing stations, and encouraged to maintain social distancing, Eahart said. Texas County, where Guymon is located about 235 miles northwest of Oklahoma City, has 236 confirmed virus cases and two deaths, according to the state Health Department. Eahart said about 30% of the plant’s employees do not live in Texas County. Health Department spokeswoman Donelle Harder said all cases and deaths would be attributed to an infected person’s county or state of residence. Guymon is about 15 miles north of Texas and about 20 miles south of Kansas. The Seaboard plant has not closed.\n\nOregon\n\nAstoria: A seafood processor has shut down after 13 workers tested positive for the new coronavirus. The outbreak at Bornstein Seafoods tripled the number of cases in Clatsop County after three weeks during which no new cases had emerged, The Astorian reports. Tests on five more people who show symptoms of the illness are pending. The newspaper reports the Lower Columbia Hispanic Council filed a complaint with the state Occupational Safety and Health Administration on April 13 – before the outbreak – on behalf of plant workers. The complaint cited a lack of personal protective equipment and a lack of social distancing inside the plants. Bornstein Seafoods employs more than 150 people between two plants at the Port of Astoria. An OSHA spokesperson confirmed a complaint is open but declined to comment on whether OSHA has inspected the plant.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A new initiative is bringing works by local artists to some downtown businesses temporarily shuttered in an effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, officials said. The Center City District and Mural Arts Philadelphia said two dozen works by 11 artists were selected for installation over the boarded-up windows of nine locations ranging from small retailers to large restaurants. Protective plywood boards installed by business owners at 56 downtown locations have drawn graffiti, and crews have been painting the boards black to stem the problem. As part of the Storefront Artwork Initiative, works of art were printed on 6-by-6-foot panels of parachute cloth and applied with acrylic gel adhesive to the boards. District president and CEO Paul Levy said it’s intended to “temporarily brighten the physical environment, engage local artists and send the message that through creativity and innovation we will prevail.” He said it’s important to ensure that Center City “remains ready to welcome back workers, students and shoppers as this crisis ends.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Almost everyone in an indoor or outdoor public place will be required to wear a face mask starting Friday to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Gina Raimondo announced Tuesday. The Democratic governor said at her daily news conference that she intends to sign an executive order requiring masks, with exceptions for small children, the developmentally disabled and people with certain medical conditions. She said she wants people to think of masks like they do a wallet, car keys or phone – “Don’t leave home without it.” Even people who go out alone for a walk, run or bike ride should carry a mask with them to put on if they come into contact with other people, she said. Penalties for violating the order are still being worked out, Raimondo said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: As Gov. Henry McMaster continues to gather data and opinions on reopening society during the coronavirus, the state’s peak of cases and deaths has been pushed further into the future, with predictions of hundreds more people dying. The new prediction is for more than 1,100 deaths by early August from COVID-19. Less than two weeks ago, state health officials predicted fewer than 700 deaths by early August, according to the Department of Health and Environmental Control. The latest epidemiological estimates reflect that virus and infection rates have not dropped significantly, so with more people circulating, more people will fall ill. The predictions released Monday also indicate the increase in cases reported each week is near a peak and should start to fall around the middle of May. McMaster, a Republican, acknowledged the desire of businesses to get back to making money and people to get out of their homes. During his introductory remarks Tuesday at his Accelerate SC committee, he said he’s balancing those wishes with a need to stop the virus from spreading rapidly again. “I get letters from ladies that are dying to go to the beauty parlor. Of course, we don’t want them to die when they go to the beauty parlor,” McMaster said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said Monday that the state’s budget is expected to take a big hit from the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. Noem said South Dakota’s general fund revenues for March are down $18.1 million. While not all of that is related to COVID-19, the Republican governor said the brunt of the economic impact will be felt in April. She said those figures will be available at the beginning of June. Meanwhile, state health officials on Tuesday reported three deaths from COVID-19, along with 53 new confirmed cases. All three deaths were in Minnehaha County, which has seen most of the infections in the state. A total of 2,721 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed, but the actual number of infections is thought to be far higher than the number of confirmed because many people have not been tested, and people can be infected without feeling sick.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The mayor of the state’s largest county issued rules Monday for the reopening of barbershops and hair salons after saying Gov. Bill Lee only offered guidelines but not strict COVID-19-related safety requirements for the reopening of “close-contact” businesses. During an online news conference Monday, Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris worried that confusion caused by mixed messaging from different jurisdictions could lead to the more rapid spread of the new coronavirus. Last week, Lee said close-contact businesses such as salons and barbershops can open Wednesday in 89 of 95 Tennessee counties. That did not include Shelby County, which, like the other excluded counties, has its own health department and can make its own public health directives related to the coronavirus response. However, barbershops and hair salons in some of the county’s suburban cities said they were going to reopen anyway, causing confusion.\n\nTexas\n\nAmarillo: A surge of coronavirus cases in the Texas Panhandle, a crucial region for the nation’s beef supply, has federal officials sending help to the city to try to control rising numbers of infections over the past week, the mayor said Monday. The Amarillo area is responsible for 25% of the nation’s fed beef supply, Mayor Ginger Nelson said, as the community joins others in the Midwest where the virus has sickened hundreds of meatpacking workers and threatens to disrupt the nation’s supply of pork and beef. In Texas, more than 240 cases are linked to a JBS USA plant in Moore County, according to Lara Anton, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has previously singled out the county as an area of concern. Confirmed cases in neighboring Potter County have doubled over the past week to more than 800, and at least nine people have died. President Donald Trump has ordered meat plants to remain open.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Intermountain Healthcare is accepting donations of homemade cloth face coverings for visitors and non-front-line caregivers at hospitals and clinics throughout the state. According to a press release, Intermountain Healthcare has set up 28 collection bins throughout Utah. After donation, the face coverings will be collected, sanitized and shipped to where they’re needed most. In St. George, donations are being accepted at the Dixie Regional Medical Center and at the Sunset Clinic. In Cedar City, donations are being accepted at the Cedar City Hospital. These drop-off donations are different from ProjectProtect, a partnership among Intermountain Healthcare, University of Utah Health and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints to produce medical-grade masks that can be used by frontline caregivers.\n\nVermont\n\nShelburne: For the first time in its 73-year history, the Shelburne Museum is not going to open for the summer season, as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Museum Director Thomas Denenberg told WCAX-TV it’s too hard to invite the public into the museum spaces and maintain social distancing. “So, unfortunately, we will be closed for the foreseeable future,” Denenberg said. The Shelburne Museum was founded by Electra Havemeyer Webb, the daughter of art collectors, in 1947. She not only acquired 19th-century folk art, quilts and decoys but also moved historic buildings from Vermont and New York – a one-room schoolhouse, homes, a round barn, a covered bridge and a steamship – to the site to house her collections. The museum’s online resources will remain available for schools and the community.\n\nVirginia\n\nLocust Hill: A rural food pantry has seen its membership spike in the weeks since the coronavirus pandemic began walloping the economy. Fifty new families have joined the pantry’s list of about 800 members, pantry chair Dave Cryer said last week. The food pantry in Locust Hill, on the Chesapeake Bay’s western shore, is operated by Hands Across Middlesex Interfaith Outreach. Middlesex is a county of about 10,000 people, although the pantry serves surrounding counties as well. “We’ve had more new people applying than we have in the last two years,” said Cryer, the organization’s vice president. He said the organization is blessed with an overwhelming number of volunteers and donations. It receives as much as 60,000 pounds of food each month. “We’re so blessed with the support we have here,” Cryer said. “We probably have two volunteers for every one that we need.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: More than 100 state parks, trails and boating sites across the state reopened Tuesday as some coronavirus restrictions were eased. Parks that open will be limited to daytime use, and the number of parking spaces will be reduced at some urban parks to discourage crowding. But authorities say all ocean beach parks and parks along the Columbia River Gorge on the Washington-Oregon border will remain closed to reduce impacts on rural communities and prevent crowds. The parks have been closed more than a month and are being reopened under the first phase of Gov. Jay Inslee’s plan to ease rules imposed to prevent the spread of the virus. Beaches and campgrounds would reopen under the second phase of the plan, although large gatherings would still be banned. State officials plan to wait at least three weeks between each phase to see how the changes affect infection rates.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told state officials that respirator masks distributed to 50,000 first responders might be counterfeit, but officials decided to leave them in use, according to a report. After the warning, the state’s top public safety official issued a report to first responders that said the masks are “authentic,” the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. “These masks are genuine products from Shanghai Dasheng Health Products Manufacture Co. Ltd. (Dasheng) and not counterfeit,” Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety Secretary Jeff Sandy said in a memo. A model of the mask with ear loops was “being misrepresented as” approved by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, the CDC said. Masks with ear loops instead of head bands often don’t have the proper fit to provide sufficient protection, according to the health agencies. Half of the 100,000 respirators West Virginia purchased had ear loops.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Conservative justices who control the state Supreme Court raised doubts Tuesday about whether Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ stay-at-home order is legal, asserting that the Legislature never intended to give the executive branch so much power. Justice Rebecca Bradley suggested during oral arguments about the order that state Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm’s decision to extend the mandate without legislative input amounts to tyranny. She also questioned whether Palm might next herd people into social distancing camps akin to World War II Japanese internment camps. “There is a constitutional problem with the Legislature giving away this much power to an unelected Cabinet secretary,” Bradley said. “The people never consented to a single individual having that much power.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Plans for in-person high school graduation ceremonies are tentatively back on in the state’s biggest city. The school district in Cheyenne has switched to distance learning for the remainder of the school year and was considering alternatives to traditional graduation ceremonies due to the coronavirus. Now, each of the city’s four high schools could have graduation ceremonies June 12 and 13 at Frontier Park Arena, where the Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo is held each July. “It will be very similar to the ceremonies we’ve had in the past. We probably will not have nearly as many people,” Superintendent Boyd Brown told the school board Monday. Frontier Days organizers are meanwhile looking at the ceremonies as a trial run ahead of their event, Brown said. Health officials say the 19,000-seat arena could accommodate about 5,000 people while following social-distancing regulations, Brown said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/06"}]}

It has been assigned to Judge Aileen Cannon, who was nominated to the bench by Trump in 2020.\n\nIn the suit, Trump argues his constitutional rights were violated and that there may have been privileged materials seized.\n\nThough the legal maneuver could slow down the Justice Department’s ongoing criminal investigation, Trump’s request to the federal court in South Florida could face an uphill legal battle after his team missed multiple opportunities to challenge the search.\n\n“The Aug. 8 search warrant at Mar-a-Lago was authorized by a federal court upon the required finding of probable cause. The Department is aware of this evening’s motion. The United States will file its response in court,” Justice Department spokesman Anthony Coley said in response to the new filing.\n\nThe ex-President’s lawyers declined to take a position in court in the immediate aftermath of the search warrant execution. They also did not weigh in on whether the search warrant affidavit should be made public before or during a court hearing last week in West Palm Beach, Florida, even though one of his attorneys was present.\n\nTrump, in the new filing, also asks for a more detailed receipt of what was removed from Mar-a-Lago. That request, if granted, would add to the two receipts the FBI already provided to Trump’s team describing 33 items seized, and which his attorney signed off on at the end of the search.\n\nThe Justice Department removed 11 sets of classified documents from Trump’s home, according to documents unsealed by a judge last week. The inventory shows that some of the materials recovered were marked as “top secret/SCI,” which is one of the highest levels of classification.\n\nThe department has already signaled that it is using an internal filter team to review the seized items, to separate material that could be subject to privilege claims. For instance, investigators mentioned the work of a filter team when they returned to Trump private documents that wouldn’t be part of the investigation, such as two expired passports and his diplomatic passport.\n\nThe Justice Department, in court documents, said it believed the evidence it collected at Mar-a-Lago will support its criminal investigation into the mishandling of federal records, including national defense material, after Trump’s team took boxes of records to Florida when he left office. The investigation is also looking at potential obstruction of justice in the investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department has said it has concerns that further information becoming public or known by Trump’s team could prompt witness or document tampering. And, according to CNN and New York Times reports, a lawyer for Trump told investigators in writing that no classified records were left at Mar-a-Lago after June. The FBI said in an inventory list at the end of its search that there were additional classified documents retrieved.\n\nA federal magistrate judge in the Southern District of Florida examined the DOJ’s reasons for the search earlier this month and approved it. The judge is now weighing whether to make more details about the investigation public.\n\nThe three attorneys who signed the motion are Lindsey Halligan, Jim Trusty and Evan Corcoran. The filing included a line about politics not affecting the administration of justice.\n\nTrump’s team gives his version of the Mar-a-Lago search\n\nIn the filing, Trump’s attorneys put forward the former President’s narrative for how the search went down, the events leading up to it and the fallout from it.\n\nThe lawsuit also recounted a message for Attorney General Merrick Garland that Trump’s lawyers gave to a top Justice Department official over the phone on August 11, a few days after the search.\n\n“President Trump wants the Attorney General to know that he has been hearing from People all over the country about the raid,” Trump’s message said, according to the lawsuit. “If there was one word to describe their mood, it is ‘angry.’ The heat is building up. The pressure is building up. Whatever I can do to take the heat down, to bring the pressure down, just let us know.”\n\nThe filing states that at 9:10 a.m. ET on the day of the search, that same top Justice Department official – Jay Bratt, the head of the counterintelligence section in the Department of Justice’s national security division – telephoned Trump’s lawyers to tell them a search warrant was being executed at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n“Heated discussion ensued as to why the Government did not make a voluntary request to further explore the premises, given the expansive assistance that President Trump had provided to that point,” the lawsuit said.\n\nIn Trump’s telling, the search took nine hours and involved two dozen FBI agents.\n\nThe lawsuit recounted a request from Bratt that Mar-a-Lago’s surveillance cameras be turned off – a request that the filing said was declined. Bratt also asked for the names of the Trump attorneys who may have been arriving at the search. The new lawsuit claims that Bratt rebuffed a request from Trump’s team that they be provided the affidavit.\n\n“Among other actions taken after being notified of this unprecedented event, counsel for President Trump contacted three attorneys in the general area who agreed to go to Mar-a-Lago,” the lawsuit said. “Once they arrived, they requested the ability to enter the mansion in order to observe what the FBl agents were doing, which the Government declined to permit.”\n\nJune meeting between Trump and feds detailed\n\nTrump’s legal team also describes, for the first time, their version of what happened in the criminal records investigation prior to the search – giving much agency to Trump himself.\n\nAt a June 3 meeting in which investigators visited Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s team states “President Trump greeted them in the dining room,” then left the agents with the parting words, “Whatever you need, just let us know.”\n\nThe investigators then inspected a storage room, which Trump authorized his lawyer to do, the filing says.\n\nFive days later, when the Justice Department wrote a letter asking for the storage room to be secured, “President Trump directed his staff to place a second lock on the door to the storage room, and one was added,” his team writes.\n\nTrump’s lawyers also say the former President directed the acceptance of a Justice Department subpoena in late June that sought footage from Mar-a-Lago surveillance cameras. This is the first time those investigative steps have been described in public in court.\n\nThe New York Times, citing people familiar with the matter, reported Monday that investigators have sought additional surveillance footage from Mar-a-Lago even after the search.\n\nTrump’s disclosures could come into play as a federal magistrate judge considers transparency in the case. A lawyer for media organizations seeking access to the search warrant’s affidavit argued last week that the Justice Department’s version of events that Trump’s team has described publicly should be unsealed.\n\nThe Justice Department has said it is investigating attempts to obstruct justice as part of the probe, and CNN and other outlets have reported a lawyer for Trump represented no more classified material existed at Mar-a-Lago, before the FBI search found several sets of documents marked as classified.\n\nIn addition to asking for a special master to be appointed, Trump and his lawyers used their lawsuit as a vehicle to re-air some of his years-old grievances about the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe suit blasted “biased FBI agents” and criticized key Russia probe figures – including Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Christopher Steele and Bruce Ohr, who all played a role in the early FBI investigation into the web of connections between Trump’s 2016 campaign and the Kremlin.\n\nTrump brought this up in the suit as part of his argument that the Justice Department and FBI are biased against him and that the Mar-a-Lago search was meant to derail his political career.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Katelyn Polantz Kaitlan Collins Tierney Sneed", "Katelyn Polantz", "Kaitlan Collins", "Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/politics/trump-special-master-mar-a-lago-ruling/index.html", "title": "Trump documents: Judge grants request for a 'special master' to ...", "text": "(CNN) A federal judge has granted former President Donald Trump's request to appoint a \"special master\" to review materials that the FBI seized from Mar-a-Lago last month.\n\nThe decision, from Trump-appointed District Judge Aileen Cannon , is a significant victory for the former President, who has railed against the Biden administration and Justice Department since the search was executed four weeks ago.\n\n\"As a function of Plaintiff's former position as President of the United States, the stigma associated with the subject seizure is in a league of its own,\" Cannon wrote. \"A future indictment, based to any degree on property that ought to be returned, would result in reputational harm of a decidedly different order of magnitude.\"\n\nCannon ordered that a third-party attorney, from outside the government , be brought in to review the materials that were taken from Trump's home and resort in Florida. The order also halts the Justice Department from continuing its review of the materials seized from Mar-a-Lago \"pending completion of the special master's review or further Court order.\"\n\nThe classification review and intelligence assessments being conducted by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, however, will be allowed to continue.\n\nBoth sides have until Friday to nominate special master candidates and their specific duties.\n\nTrump's lawyers argued that a special master was needed because they don't trust the Justice Department to fairly identify privileged materials that would need to be excluded from the ongoing criminal probe.\n\nTrump blasted the Justice Department and the seizure at his rally in Pennsylvania this weekend.\n\n\"This egregious abuse of the law is going to produce a backlash the likes of which nobody has ever seen before,\" he said. \"... these same exact people at Justice and the FBI, these same exact people, along with outside scum, are at it again with the horrific raid of my home. They just go on and on and they have to be stopped.\"\n\nHowever, Cannon wrote that Trump had not proven that his constitutional rights were disregarded.\n\n\"(T)he Court agrees with the Government that, at least based on the record to date, there has not been a compelling showing of callous disregard for Plaintiff's constitutional rights,\" she wrote.\n\nBut Cannon cited several reasons for bringing in the special master, among them \"the interest in ensuring the integrity of an orderly process amidst swirling allegations of bias and media leaks.\" She also cited the historic nature of the case.\n\nThe judge said the special master will be tasked with reviewing \"seized property for personal items and documents and potentially privileged material subject to claims of attorney-client and/or executive privilege.\"\n\nShe added: \"The Court is mindful that restraints on criminal prosecutions are disfavored but finds that these unprecedented circumstances call for a brief pause to allow for neutral, third-party review to ensure a just process with adequate safeguards.\"\n\nFBI obtained Trump medical and tax information in search, judge says\n\nThe Justice Department has said that its own \"filter team\" already finished its review of the Mar-a-Lago documents -- and found a small set of attorney-client privileged records.\n\nIn court documents, DOJ said a \"limited\" number of records potentially covering attorney-client privilege were filtered out, and that the department was following the procedures it laid out to a magistrate judge when it sought the warrant, but Cannon had questions about its results.\n\nThe Justice Department also obtained \"correspondent related to taxes,\" and medical documents during the search, according to the privilege team report that remains sealed but Cannon described Monday.\n\nCannon noted that Justice Department lawyers had acknowledged it seized some \"[p]ersonal effects without evidentiary value,\" as well as 500 pages of material potentially subject to attorney-client privilege.\n\n\"To appoint a special master to make privilege determinations while simultaneously allowing the Government, in the interim, to continue using potentially privileged material for investigative purposes would be to ignore the pressing concerns and hope for the best,\" the judge said.\n\nShe wrote that Trump's \"individual interest in and need for the seized property\" was one reason to rule in favor of Trump's requests for a special master.\n\nCannon also said that the privilege review team's report outlined \"at least two instances in which members of the Investigative Team were exposed to material that was then delivered to the Privilege Review Team.\"\n\n\"Those instances alone, even if entirely inadvertent, yield questions about the adequacy of the filter,\" she wrote.\n\n\"The United States is examining the opinion and will consider appropriate next steps in the ongoing litigation,\" said Justice Department spokesman Anthony Coley.\n\nFriday deadline for Trump, DOJ to propose special master candidate\n\nCannon set a Friday deadline for Trump's lawyers and Justice Department prosecutors to negotiate the special master's \"duties and limitations\" and to submit a list of potential candidates to serve in the role.\n\nShe also wants both sides to propose a schedule for the special master's review and to spell out how the person will be compensated for their work.\n\n\"The exact details and mechanics of this review process will be decided expeditiously following receipt of the parties' proposals,\" Cannon wrote.\n\nBecause the lawsuit demanding the special master was filed by Trump two weeks after the search, it has raised questions among legal observers what role a special master could even play, given that by that time the Justice Department was likely well on its way to finishing its review of the evidence.\n\nThe scope of a special mater will be key.\n\nThe DOJ had asked for the review, if it was granted, to focus on materials potentially covered by attorney-client privilege. Trump has been asking for the special master on the basis of there being executive privilege concerns with the seizure of the records.\n\nAt the hearing, according to reports, the judge said that Trump's ability to assert executive privilege as a former president was unsettled law. But she also had pointed questions for the Trump team about what the review they were seeking would look like.\n\nIf the two sides don't agree on the parameters for the soon-to-be appointed special master, they should explain their differences in a court filing, Cannon ruled Monday.\n\nCites Kavanaugh's recent Supreme Court ruling\n\nExplaining why she was ordering a special master review for material potentially covered by executive privilege, Cannon said that the Justice Department had not convinced the court that those concerns should be \"disregarded,\" as she went on quote from how the Supreme Court described its move in a dispute this year over Trump January 6 documents, including a statement from Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe DOJ had \"arguably overstate[d] the law,\" Cannon wrote, when asserting that executive privilege had no \"role to play here because Plaintiff -- a former head of the Executive Branch -- is entirely foreclosed from successfully asserting executive privilege against the current Executive Branch.\"\n\n\"The Supreme Court did not rule out the possibility of a former President overcoming an incumbent President on executive privilege matters,\" Cannon wrote.\n\nShe quoted from both the 1977 decision Nixon v. Administrator of General Services and from the order released this year by the Supreme Court when it refused to block the Archives' release to House January 6 investigators Trump White House documents.\n\n\"Further, just this year, the Supreme Court noted that, at least in connection with a congressional investigation, '[t]he questions whether and in what circumstances a former President may obtain a court order preventing disclosure of privileged records from his tenure in office, in the face of a determination by the incumbent President to waive the privilege, are unprecedented and raise serious and substantial concerns,'\" Cannon wrote, quoting from the Supreme Court order.\n\nCannon added a line from a statement Kavanaugh wrote with that Supreme Court order: \"A former President must be able to successfully invoke the Presidential communications privilege for communications that occurred during his Presidency, even if the current President does not support the privilege claim. Concluding otherwise would eviscerate the executive privilege for Presidential communications.\"\n\nJumping off of those quotes from the Supreme Court, Cannon wrote Monday that \"even if any assertion of executive privilege by Plaintiff ultimately fails in this context, that possibility, even if likely, does not negate a former President's ability to raise the privilege as an initial matter.\"\n\nJudge was confirmed after presidential election\n\nCannon of the Southern District of Florida, was nominated by Trump to the bench in May 2020 and confirmed by the Senate in a 56-21 just days after the presidential election in November 2020.\n\nShe previously served as an assistant US attorney in Florida in the Major Crimes Division and as an appellate attorney, according to written answers she gave to the Senate during her confirmation process.\n\nA University of Michigan Law School graduate, Cannon clerked for a federal judge and later practiced law at a firm in Washington, DC, where she handled a range of cases, including some related to \"government investigations,\" she told the Senate.\n\nAt her 2020 nomination hearing, Cannon thanked members of her family and shared the impact of their experience on her own life.\n\n\"To my loving mother ... who, at the age of 7, had to flee the repressive Castro regime in search of freedom and security, thank you for teaching me about the blessing that is this country and the importance of securing the rule of law for generations to come,\" she said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed", "Marshall Cohen", "Jeremy Herb", "Holmes Lybrand"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/08/doj-appeal-trump-special-master/7999425001/", "title": "DOJ appeals Trump special master appointment in Mar-a-Lago case", "text": "WASHINGTON – The Justice Department will challenge the appointment of a special master to review thousands of documents seized during last month's search of former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago beach club, a ruling that has effectively limited the criminal investigation into the Trump team's handling of classified government records.\n\nThe notice of appeal comes after U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon authorized the appointment of a third party to identify records that may relate to privileged attorney-client communications that should be shielded from federal investigators.\n\nIn court documents filed Thursday, the government also asked that Cannon suspend at least part of the ruling barring the use of the classified documents seized during the Aug. 8 search in the continuing investigation, pending the appeal.\n\nJustice officials argued that the \"government and the public would suffer irreparable harm absent a stay.\"\n\nThe new court filing states that Trump cannot assert any claim to the classified documents and that any assertions that they might be privileged communications between attorney and client did not apply.\n\nMore:Judge approves special master to review documents from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, pauses DOJ probe\n\nMore:Judge cites 'reputational harm' to Trump in ordering a Mar-a-Lago special master and pause in probe\n\n\"Although this Court suggested that (Trump) might be able to assert executive privilege as to some of the seized records, Supreme Court precedent makes clear that any possible assertion of privilege that (Trump) might attempt to make over the classified records would be overcome by the government’s 'demonstrated, specific need' for that evidence.\"\n\nCannon had signaled in her ruling that a special master could screen records that could be covered by claims of executive privilege.\n\nJustice lawyers argued the investigation would be seriously impeded by banning investigators from accessing the seized classified documents.

His work is the subject of the Netflix biopic “Worth,” in which Feinberg is played by actor Michael Keaton.\n\nIn 1997, a judge appointed a special master in Microsoft v. United States to advise the court on technical issues and investigate claims, like Microsoft’s suggestion that Windows would be made slower if Internet Explorer were to be removed, according to the Legal Information Institute.\n\nIn a case similar to Trump’s, a special master was appointed to oversee the document review in the federal investigation of the ex-president’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen. Cohen’s legal team argued at the time that a special master appointment was necessary to ensure documents covered by attorney-client privilege weren’t reviewed by the government. They also claimed a special master appointment would “protect the integrity of the Government’s investigation from the toxic partisan politics of the day.”\n\nSpecial masters also often appear in original jurisdiction cases, frequently involving boundary disputes between states, decided by the Supreme Court, according to the Legal Information Institute.\n\nListen here:Judge orders Mar-a-Lago special master, deadly earthquake in China: 5 Things podcast\n\nWhy does Trump want a special master?\n\nTrump’s legal team filed a lawsuit in August seeking to halt the continued review of classified documents taken from his Mar-a-Lago property until a special master could be appointed to ensure possibly privileged material is shielded from scrutiny.\n\nIn the filing, the former president’s lawyers argued that the search was both political and overly broad because it authorized FBI agents to seize \"boxes of documents merely because they are physically found together with other items purportedly within the scope of the warrant.\"\n\nWhat was the DOJ's stance?\n\nThe Justice Department claimed that the appointment of a special master would impede the government’s investigation, which it says has already uncovered evidence of obstruction in the handling of classified records.\n\nThe agency also said that federal authorities had already assigned a “privilege review team” to sort and exclude material that may not be relevant or information that may be privileged, noting that authorities had already identified a “limited set of materials” that may contain information protected by attorney-client privilege.\n\nDOJ's perspective:DOJ says it’s ‘likely’ Mar-a-Lago documents were hidden and efforts made to obstruct probe\n\nWhat impact does the judge's ruling have on the DOJ's investigation?\n\nIn the same ruling approving the designation of a special master, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon called for a temporary halt to the federal inquiry until a document review is completed.\n\nThe Florida judge asked Trump's team and the government to submit potential candidates for the special master role by Friday.\n\nWhat will happen next?\n\nThe Justice Department told USA TOAY that it was reviewing the decision.\n\n\"The United States is examining the opinion and will consider appropriate next steps in the ongoing litigation,\" department spokesman Anthony Coley said.\n\nContributing: Kevin Johnson, Bart Jansen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/politics/takeaways-trump-cannon-mar-a-lago-special-master/index.html", "title": "Takeaways from the ruling granting Trump's request for a special ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA federal judge threw a wrench Monday in the Justice Department investigation into potential mishandling of documents from former President Donald Trump’s White House by granting his request for a special master to review evidence seized from his Florida home last month.\n\nThe win for Trump temporarily prevents the Justice Department’s investigative team from accessing the thousands of documents – some of which are marked as classified – taken from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nUS District Judge Aileen Cannon cleared the way for a third-party attorney to review all the seized materials, not just for documents covered by attorney-client privilege – the circumstance in which special masters are usually used – but also for potential executive privilege concerns, a move the Justice Department has said would be “unprecedented.”\n\nShe did not agree, however, with Trump’s arguments that there had been a “callous disregard” for his constitutional rights with the search.\n\nHere are takeaways from the judge’s ruling and what happens next:\n\nA significant win for Trump\n\nThe primary takeaway is simple: The ruling is a major legal win for Trump.\n\nTrump filed a lawsuit seeking a special master to review the materials the FBI seized last month, and now one will be appointed with the potential to decide that certain materials are out of bounds to the FBI’s investigation.\n\nCannon bought into the skepticism Trump’s lawyers raised about the unprecedented search of the Florida resort, as they questioned whether investigators could be trusted to properly filter through the thousands of documents that were seized. The judge rejected the Justice Department’s assurances that its internal filter team had already sorted out materials that could be subject to attorney-client privileges.\n\nUltimately, the special master appointment may merely lead to a delay in the federal investigation into documents taken to Mar-a-Lago, but it now introduces a new layer of uncertainty and unpredictability into the investigation.\n\nThe former President did not get absolutely everything he asked for – the judge did not rule that any materials seized from his home should be returned to him, for instance.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 04:02 - Source: CNN Attorney explains judge's comments on Trump special master ruling\n\nImmediate next steps focus on rules for special master\n\nCannon left undecided many key questions about how the special master will operate. She sketched out a plan for how things will move forward for at least the rest of this week and focused on settling those logistical matters.\n\nShe ordered Trump’s lawyers and prosecutors to “confer” on several big-ticket items: Who are the proposed candidates to serve as special master? What will their specific “duties and limitations” be? What should be their schedule and pacing? And how much will they be paid for their work?\n\nBoth sides were told to file a “joint filing” by Friday, spelling out their answers to these questions. Based on how the case has progressed so far, it seems unlikely that the two sides will agree on much. They’ll both be able to put in writing their ideas for how they want this to move forward.\n\nCannon said she will “expeditiously” issue a court order setting out “the exact details and mechanics of this (special master) review process” after the joint filing comes in.\n\nShe noted the need to settle disputes between the parties about “whether certain seized documents constitute personal or presidential records” and “whether certain seized personal effects have evidentiary value.”\n\nPlans to review for “executive privilege”\n\nTrump had said that a special master review needed to go beyond documents covered by attorney-client privilege, and that materials covered by executive privilege should be filtered out as well.\n\nExecutive privilege refers to private communications presidents have with their advisers and other types of internal communications within the executive branch that are withheld from public release. While disputes over the privilege have come up in congressional investigations, the reaches of executive privilege – particularly when a former president is arguing it should apply when a current president is declining to assert it – is an unsettled area of law.\n\nCannon’s order requires the special master to examine the documents based on “executive privilege” concerns, making the job more expansive than the attorney-client privilege review that happens typically when a special master is appointed. (Documents potentially covered by attorney-client privilege will be part of this special master’s review as well, according to Cannon’s order.)\n\nShe did not elaborate on the parameters the special master should be considering.\n\nIn her ruling, Cannon said that the Supreme Court had not ruled out “the possibility of a former President overcoming an incumbent President on executive privilege matters.” She quoted from a 1977 Supreme Court case concerning documents from President Richard Nixon’s White House, as well as from a Supreme Court order earlier this year that allowed the release of Trump White House documents to House January 6 investigators.\n\nCannon quoted the Supreme Court saying in the recent case that the questions are “unprecedented and raise serious and substantial concerns” when it comes to scenarios where a former president is claiming to assert executive privilege over materials for which that privilege has been waived by the incumbent.\n\nCNN Illustration/AP/Getty Images\n\nShe also drew from a separate statement from Justice Brett Kavanaugh in that case in which Kavanaugh said it would “eviscerate the executive privilege for Presidential communications” if courts were to conclude that a former president could not “invoke the Presidential communications privilege for communications that occurred during his Presidency, even if the current President does not support the privilege claim.”\n\nCannon conceded that, when all is said and done, Trump’s assertions of executive privilege might fail, but she said that “does not negate a former President’s ability to raise the privilege as an initial matter.”\n\nIntelligence review will continue\n\nThe judge is not stopping the US intelligence community’s from continuing to examine the documents as part of its damage assessment into the potential risk to national security.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Avril Haines told Congress last month that the intelligence community would be conducting an assessment “of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of the relevant documents.” The intelligence community has also been working with the FBI since mid-May to examine some of the documents taken from Mar-a-Lago, CNN previously reported.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 05:59 - Source: CNN McCabe: Trump's backed himself into a corner on documents\n\nWhile the FBI investigation is related to at least three potential crimes – violations of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice and criminal handling of government records – the intelligence review is primarily concerned with determining whether the disclosure of the material that was housed at Trump’s resort and residence could place sensitive intelligence sources at risk.\n\nTrump got special consideration as ex-president\n\nThe judge repeatedly pointed to the “extraordinary circumstances” present in the special master dispute, given that it involved the “unprecedented” search of a former president’s home. She also said there was a risk of “stigma” that would come with a prosecution that was brought wrongfully and said that the threat was greater in this scenario because Trump is a former president.\n\n“As a function of Plaintiff’s former position as President of the United States, the stigma associated with the subject seizure is in a league of its own,” she wrote. “A future indictment, based to any degree on property that ought to be returned, would result in reputational harm of a decidedly different order of magnitude.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 03:35 - Source: CNN Why new Trump lawsuit shows disagreement behind the scenes\n\nThere were other examples in the order of Cannon putting Trump, as a former president, in a special class of defendants. She said that Trump’s reliance on “cooperation between former and incumbent administrations regarding” the exchange of documents also cut in favor of her intervening. (The Justice Department has pointed to several examples in the litigation of Trump’s team slow-walking that negotiation).\n\nIn a footnote rebutting the DOJ’s arguments that special masters are usually appointed to review searches of an attorneys’ offices, Cannon wrote that she did “not see why these concerns would not apply, at least to a considerable degree, to the office and home of a former president.”\n\nWhat can the Justice Department do now?\n\nThe ruling does not shut down the Justice Department’s criminal investigation. Trump still has potential legal jeopardy. But the ruling will limit what investigators can do, and may slow things down a bit, while the special master review is underway.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman said Monday that officials are “examining the opinion” and considering “appropriate next steps.” The one-sentence statement did not explicitly reference an appeal, though that is the obvious next possible option for prosecutors.\n\nIf prosecutors appeal, those proceedings would be handled by the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which is based in Atlanta. The court has four full-time judges appointed by Democratic presidents, and seven by Republican presidents, including six by Trump.\n\nA three-judge panel would be randomly selected to hear the appeal. Whichever side loses that round would get an opportunity to ask the entire 11-member court to rehear the appeal “en banc.” The losing side also could appeal to the Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority.\n\nDOJ officials might choose to only appeal a portion of Cannon’s multi-pronged ruling.\n\nAndrew Weissmann – a venerated ex-DOJ official, former Robert Mueller team prosecutor and prominent Trump critic – tweeted that the Justice Department should “appeal immediately” the part of the ruling that blocks investigators from doing anything with the seized materials, which he called “precedent that is too wrong to not appeal.”\n\nJudge Cannon is a Trump nominee – does that matter?\n\nFederal judges routinely handle matters that involve the president who put them on the bench. The fact that Cannon was appointed by Trump, and that Trump filed this lawsuit, is not grounds for Cannon to recuse herself from the case, though she could if she thinks it creates a perception of unfairness.\n\nFor his part, Trump has a history of politicizing the judicial branch, by attacking “Obama judges” and openly saying that he expects his appointees to do his legal bidding. But this twisted view toward judicial loyalty seems to be pretty one-sided, with Trump expecting political fealty while most judges try to ignore his out-of-court rhetoric and focus on the facts.\n\nHow does DOJ’s so-called “60-day rule” for investigations come into play?\n\nA question lingering over this and other investigations that touch on the former president is how the Justice Department will view the so-called “60-day rule” as applying to investigations connected to Trump.\n\nThe “rule” is an internal DOJ policy that discourages public investigative steps that could influence an election 60 days before Election Day. Trump’s allies have argued the department’s Trump documents investigation stands to run afoul of this principle, even though Trump himself is not a candidate.\n\nIt’s not clear if DOJ was calibrating its approach to the documents probe with that rule in mind, and if prosecutors are doing so, it’s also not clear whether the appointment of a special master affects those plans.\n\nThe investigation appears to be in its very early stages. Prosecutors have described it as such in public court proceedings. And the types of attorneys publicly involved in the probe – mainly coming from the DOJ’s National Security Division – also suggest the probe is at an early phase, former agency officials have said.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed Jeremy Herb Marshall Cohen", "Tierney Sneed", "Jeremy Herb", "Marshall Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/08/trump-mar-lago-search-month-later/8010691001/", "title": "The search at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate was a month ago.

With Alabama ahead of only Mississippi in vaccinations and just 30% of the state’s population fully inoculated against the illness caused by the coronavirus, the Alabama Department of Senior Services said a new marketing campaign was aimed at overcoming vaccine hesitancy. The agency will work with local agencies for the aging and disability organizations to encourage more people to get shots. A telephone hotline will allow people to reach local services and make vaccination appointments, which has been difficult for some disabled people. Vaccination rates have dropped statewide to the lowest point since early this year, when doses were scarce, and only certain people were eligible to receive shots. While less than a third of the state’s population is fully vaccinated, precautions like face masks and social distancing are increasingly rare in the state. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are rising in a trend that is troubling to health experts. State statistics showed 252 people were being treated for COVID-19 in hospitals Thursday compared to a low of 166 late last month.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state court judge is scheduled to hear arguments Monday in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a voter-approved initiative that would end party primaries in Alaska and institute ranked-choice voting in general elections. Scott Kohlhaas, who unsuccessfully ran for a state House seat last year as a Libertarian; Bob Bird, chairman of the Alaskan Independence Party; Bird’s party; and Anchorage attorney Kenneth P. Jacobus sued in December, shortly after the initiative was approved. In court documents, they say people “exercise their right of free political association by forming political parties for the purpose of electing candidates” and advancing issues and principles. They call the new voter-approved system a “political experiment” and say it was designed in a way to harm political parties. They cite concerns that candidates for minor parties, like the Alaskan Independence Party, could get “lost in the shuffle” in a primary where all candidates are listed on one ballot and the top four vote-getters advance to the general election. Attorneys for the state Department of Law in court documents say the plaintiffs’ opposition includes a mix of policy arguments and speculation. They say the claims raised by the plaintiffs “rest on a misunderstanding” of what the initiative does, according to court filings.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey on Friday signed legislation banning state or local governments from requiring training in “critical race theory” and a bill creating a new small-business income tax category that will allow small-business owners to avoid paying any of the 3.5% income tax surcharge voters approved in November. The new small-business tax is expected to cut $292 million from the original $836 million schools would have received under Proposition 208, according to the Legislature’s budget analysts. Backers of the initiative have vowed to block the new law by referring it to the ballot. Ducey also signed a measure that tightens the state’s sex education law and requires parents to give permission for instruction that includes sexual issues in non-sex ed classes. The broad requirement would block discussions of historic events that have a sexual component, like the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York, considered the genesis of the modern gay rights movement, or even the U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage, without parental preapproval. “Parents should have the right to know what their children are learning in school,” Ducey said in a statement. “This is a no-brainer piece of legislation that protects our children from learning materials that aren’t suited for them.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Arkansas State Police on Friday handed over to prosecutors the results of the agency’s investigation into a deputy’s fatal shooting of a white teenager that has drawn the attention of civil rights activists nationwide. Lonoke County Prosecutor Chuck Graham said his office received the case file on the shooting of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain by Lonoke County sheriff’s deputy Sgt. Michael Davis during a June 23 traffic stop. Graham said the file has been taken to the state prosecutor coordinator since he’s requested a special prosecutor to handle the case. Authorities have released few details about the shooting, and State Police earlier Friday referred questions about the case file to Graham’s office. Brittain’s family has said the teenager was unarmed and holding a jug of antifreeze at the time of the shooting. Prosecutor Coordinator Bob McMahan said a special prosecutor should be named early this week. Davis was fired by Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley last week for not turning on his body camera until after the shooting occurred. Staley said there’s no footage from the shooting, only the aftermath. The Rev. Al Sharpton and two attorneys who represented George Floyd said the teen’s death highlighted the need for interracial support for efforts to reform police practices.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBurbank: Batman’s secret cave, Harry Potter’s cupboard under the stairs and the apartment from “Friends” are major centerpieces to the huge Warner Bros. studio lot expansion. Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood recently reopened more than a year after doors were shuttered because of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, attendees will have a chance to explore the studio’s nearly 100 years of television and filmmaking history, highlighting the DC Universe and “Harry Potter.” A firsthand look took place a couple of days before the tour opened in late June at the Southern California studio, which now welcomes families with children ages 5 and older. Warner Bros. officials said the expansion – which includes a new building – took five years to develop in Burbank. Officials say the studio tour will follow all city, state and federal COVID-19 safety protocols. “One of the most incredible things about Warner Brothers is the incredible history of epic films that are legendary,” said “Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenkins, who helped reopen the tour.\n\nColorado\n\nDurango: A 10-year-old died of plague in La Plata County, San Juan Basin Public Health said Friday. Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and health officials said they are investigating the case and will provide more information as it becomes available, 9News reports. No other information on the child was immediately released. “We are so sad for the loss of this young Coloradan, and our deepest condolences go to the family,” said Dr. Jennifer House of the health department. “Public Health is doing an epidemiological investigation and wants Coloradans to know that while this disease is very rare, it does occur sometimes and to seek medical care if you have symptoms.” Officials say plague is caused by bacteria that can be transmitted to humans by the bites of infected fleas or by direct contact with infected animals. The risk of contracting certain animal-borne diseases, while present year-round, increases during the summer when humans and animals are frequently in close contact. Most human plague cases are acquired directly from fleas. Officials say it’s important to wear repellent when outdoors and keep up to date on pet vaccinations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says symptoms of the plague include fever, headache, chills, weakness, and one or more swollen, tender and painful lymph nodes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State employee union leaders are suing to stop Gov. Ned Lamont’s order to have workers return to the office now that much of the state has emerged from the pandemic, accusing him of violating prior telework agreements reached with the unions and ignoring the benefits of having people work from home. The State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, which filed the request for an injunction in Hartford Superior Court on Tuesday, said in a statement that state workers proved throughout the COVID-19 crisis that a flexible teleworking agreement could be beneficial to the state of Connecticut. “From increased productivity and quality performance to the positive environmental impacts like reduced emissions, improved air quality and public health, the benefits of telework are clear and something that the Administration should be taking a proud step in leading,” SEBAC said in a statement posted on its website. In May, Lamont sent an email to state employees announcing that they would be returning to their offices as of July 1 and that any telework would be limited to no more than 50% of their time, with manager approval.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: More than 111 years after it sank off the Delmarva coast and 43 years after divers found and looted it, researchers can finally – and officially – say where the USS Nina is located and why the U.S. Navy steamer built in the 1860s likely sank. The University of Delaware is a big reason why. A two-day mission out of Lewes led by UD oceanographer Dr. Arthur Trembanis in mid-June used the school’s new autonomous underwater vehicle to help identify the sunken ship. The university has been partnering with the Navy for nearly a decade, and Trembanis’ group has been mapping the seafloor for years. The drone used during the mission has a shape similar to a small torpedo. Trembanis needed to test the new equipment and said the “stars aligned” nicely for this mission since Dr. Jim Delgado, senior vice president of SEARCH Inc., a cultural resource management firm, had been talking about a mission to officially identify the Nina. Using UD’s technology, the mission did in hours what divers and researchers may have needed days or weeks to do. “We’re really privileged at UD to have one of the most largest and advanced fleets of autonomous systems in the country,” Trembanis said. A violent February storm appears the likely culprit for the ship’s loss.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With more homicides so far in 2021 than by this same time in 2020 and carjacking incidents skyrocketing, the police department is trying to get a handle on the crimes by getting back to the basics of community policing. D.C. police officers in the 4th District have been hitting the streets, knocking on doors and starting conversations with people in the community, WUSA-TV reports. “This is an opportunity for folks to really give us some feedback – let us know what we’re doing right, what we’re doing wrong,” Inspector James Madison Boteler said. The work officers are doing is part of an initiative called “100 blocks in 100 days.” “It’s really just a get-back-to-the-basics kind of police work,” he said. Boteler, who is in a newly appointed position with the 4th Police District, is teaming up with officers covering parts of Northwest and Northeast to build better relationships with neighbors. “The amount of folks that live in the city versus the amount of crime that we respond to on a daily basis is ever-increasing,” Boteler said. To help fight that crime and the growing number of homicides year after year in the district, Chief Robert Contee selected a handful of inspectors to serve as second-in-command for larger police districts.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Red tide could cause people along certain parts of the Gulf Coast to experience respiratory irritation, health officials said. The Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County on Sunday recommended that anyone with chronic respiratory problems consider staying away from areas experiencing red tide, the Tampa Bay Times reports. Officials also advised people not to swim around dead fish and to keep pets away from water, sea foam and dead marine life. The National Weather Service in Tampa issued a beach hazards statement Saturday evening cautioning that red tide can cause coughing, sneezing and tears in the eyes and that symptoms can be worse for people with asthma, emphysema or other chronic lung diseases. Red tide is an algae bloom producing toxins that kill fish. The toxins may also make the surrounding air difficult to breathe and often turn the water red. Those with allergies also can be affected, National Weather Service meteorologist Paul Close told the newspaper. “And just the smell, dead fish smell,” he said. St. Petersburg crews cleaned up 9 tons of dead fish in 24 hours last week, the paper reports. During a news conference Friday, St. Petersburg Emergency Manager Amber Boulding said red tide blooms killed the fish, and Tropical Storm Elsa pushed them ashore.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Biden administration’s decision to reevaluate Georgia’s plan to overhaul how residents buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act came as a “surprise” and suggests it wants to revisit the plan’s approval, which is not allowed, Gov. Brian Kemp’s office said. The “Georgia Access” plan would improve the experience of shopping for insurance and encourage the private sector to enroll uninsured residents, the director of Kemp’s Office of Health Strategy and Coordination said in a letter to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Despite unsubstantiated claims to the contrary, Georgia Access will put more affordable, quality insurance coverage within reach of consumers in our state than a one-size-fits-all federal solution,” said the letter by Grant Thomas. Under the Republican governor’s plan, residents would bypass healthcare.gov and shop for federally subsidized health insurance through private agents. Critics worry the move will make it harder to shop for insurance and drive healthy people to cheaper plans that provide limited coverage, increasing premiums for older and sicker people who need the comprehensive benefits required by the ACA because the move to private websites would make it easier for consumers to simultaneously see plans that don’t provide all the benefits required by the federal health care law.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: To protect historic lands from invasive goats, officials will distribute the live animals to the public via a lottery. Hawaii officials will hold the lottery as a way to remove at least 700 goats from Puuhonua o Honaunau National Historic Park, which is an important cultural and historical site on the west side of the Big Island, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Those interested in the goats may apply for permits, which will be issued through a random lottery July 28. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources will distribute 20 to 50 goats per permit. Applicants must indicate how many goats they want and can’t choose individual animals. Lottery winners must have a 16-foot enclosed horse trailer or equivalent to pick up the goats so that they don’t escape. A permit can be refused if a trailer isn’t secured.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Friday mobilized the Idaho National Guard to help fight wildfires amid an ongoing drought and extreme heat. The Republican governor issued an emergency declaration allowing soldiers to help fight fires on the 9,700 square miles in mostly northern Idaho where the state provides fire protection. “Wildfire is presenting an imminent threat to life, property, and the environment, and we need all hands on deck,” Little said in a statement. “I appreciate our firefighters and fire managers for working so hard under such challenging conditions, and I am grateful that our guardsmen are able to step in once again to support Idaho communities.” It’s the first time the Idaho Department of Lands has requested the governor issue such an emergency declaration. The agency said the soldiers will help with fire suppression and logistics support. State officials didn’t say how many soldiers might be deployed to help with wildfires. Officials also said National Guard Blackhawk helicopters could be used to drop water or other suppressants on fires as well as transport firefighters and supplies. Besides tapping the National Guard, the Lands Department has also requested workers in the agency with fire line qualifications to make themselves available for fire assignments.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Visitors to this year’s Illinois State Fair will be able to visit one of the nation’s more historic highways with the creation of the Route 66 Experience. The multiyear project will turn the Springfield fairgrounds’ Gate 2 into a year-round destination for visiting a microform of the Mother Road in Illinois, from Chicago to the Chain of Rocks Bridge over the Mississippi River in Madison. It will highlight communities and attractions along the way. The project sponsor, the Illinois Route 66 Scenic Byway, will have the first phase completed by the state fair’s opening Aug. 12, executive director Casey Wichmann said. “Being able to provide visitors a central location to experience what our historic road has to offer is an amazing opportunity prior to the 100th anniversary of Route 66,” Wichmann said. The 2,448-mile highway, one of the nation’s first interstate “hard roads,” was begun 95 years ago. Dubbed the “Mother Road” by John Steinbeck in his novel “The Grapes of Wrath,” it runs from Chicago’s Loop business district to Santa Monica, California. Its path through Illinois is similar to that of current-day Interstate 55. Once running, the exhibit will feature Quick Response codes and story boards detailing historic attractions and businesses. Those communities lining Route 66 will be invited to participate.\n\nIndiana\n\nBunker Hill: Six inmates are alleging in lawsuits that they were kept in near-total darkness for weeks at a time and suffered electric shocks from exposed wires at a state prison. The lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana claim the conditions at the maximum-security Miami Correctional Facility near Peru amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. The lawsuits claim that the six men were held in isolation cells that had no lights and that some of them suffered cuts from broken window glass and were shocked by dangling wires from a broken light fixture while trying to make their way around in the dark. ACLU of Indiana attorney Ken Falk called the prison’s action “torture.” Inmate Jeremy Blanchard’s lawsuit filed in March said he was kept in nearly total darkness for about a month last year, and the conditions led to hallucinations and severe anxiety. Attorneys for the state have denied the allegations and asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit. The other five lawsuits were filed this month. A Department of Correction spokeswoman declined to comment on those cases.\n\nIowa\n\nVentura: The road running between a marsh wildlife area and Clear Lake in this small northern Iowa city is dangerous for turtles, even with a turtle crossing sign. So five boys have spent some time this summer helping the turtles cross it. On one recent summer day, they spent several hours assisting turtles, saving 20 to 30 from being flattened by motorists, and they reckon they’ve saved close to 200 overall, the Mason City Globe Gazette reports. “One time, I saw a pile of flattened turtles and two baby turtles – their parents must’ve died – so that motivated me to save other turtles,” said 10-year-old Zacaious Moe. Four friends have joined Zacaious in the turtle rescuing: Keygan Hoover, 9; Blake Meyer, 8; Cole Meyer, 10; and Casen Wenzel, 8. “That’s such a neat thing for them to spend their day doing that,” said Ventura City Administrator Else Taylor. Taylor said the turtle crossing sign and a geese crossing sign have been up for several years. “We have had issues with geese and turtles getting run over in large amounts,” she said. “I walk my dog by some of these places, and there are turtle pancakes.”\n\nKansas\n\nCheney: A central Kansas farmer has invented robots that can whack weeds and reduce the use of pesticides on crops. For years, Clint Brauer has struggled with keeping weeds out of his row crops. Along with keeping living roots in the ground, organic practices and no-till methods, he tried crimping, but the pigweeds just grew taller. Three years ago, Brauer, an ex-California-based executive who farms in Haven and Cheney, decided to implement a wild plan, using robots to behead weeds. “I realized there was no great way to get the weeds out at scale without chemicals,” Brauer said. “I needed to invent one.” So he started Greenfield Robotics. Before chemicals replaced them, workers pulled weeds from the farm. Greenfield Robotics puts the “workers” back in the field with a new kind of worker – a mechanized one. “We want to control weeds with labor and make it robot labor,” Brauer said. “Robotics is our way of putting (mechanized) labor back into the farm.” The challenge was that he felt regenerative farming did not work for large fields without the heavy use of agrichemicals. “I came up with the idea for it and tested it manually,” he said. “No one knew if it would work. It has to fit between rows.” Brauer uses the weeding bots on other farmers’ soybean crops in the area and hopes to work with sorghum, cotton and possibly canola farmers.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state Capitol is open again for visitors, but some fresh security regulations are in place. The new rules include measures detailing the types of masks allowed in the Capitol and prohibiting visitors from congregating in office entrances but still allow people to carry any gun of their choosing, with certain restrictions on ammunition and how they are secured. Gov. Andy Beshear said the emergency Capitol security measures were needed following the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, where supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the building and forced the evacuation of members from both chambers. He also cited “a rise in domestic terror around the country.” Armed protesters have been a common sight outside the Capitol since the onset of the pandemic and even after the Jan. 6 insurrection, with the president of the Kentucky Three Percenters notably hanging the governor in effigy at one protest. About a dozen masked men wearing camouflage and carrying rifles posed for photos in the Capitol Rotunda in early 2020 – the same day as a large protest against a proposed “red flag” gun law – near the governor’s office, while the House and Senate were in session. Visitors won’t be allowed to wear their own face mask in the Capitol but will be given one by security as they enter.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: The state’s newest food trail has the quirky name No Man’s Land: Gas Station Eats. No Man’s Land was one of the names for a buffer zone between U.S. and Spanish territories for about 13 years after the Louisiana Purchase. The Gas Station Eats food trail is starting with three stops in each of seven southwest Louisiana parishes, The American Press reports. The 450-mile route runs through Calcasieu, Allen, Beauregard, Sabine, Natchitoches, Vernon and DeSoto parishes. Stops range from the South Beau Dairy Barn in the Beauregard Parish community of Longville to French Market Express, which offers meat pies, plate lunches, yam cakes, cookies and pies in Natchitoches. There’s also an Exxon station in Natchitoches, Big Thicket BBQ in DeRidder, a Shop-A-Lott in Mansfield and another in Many, Anacoco Mercantile, and a Grab N Geaux in Lake Charles. Several stops offer fried boudin balls and whole sausages such as boudin and andouille. Others have fried fish, burgers, sandwiches – and, in Zwolle, tamales. All are in the seven-parish area known as No Man’s Land and the Neutral Strip from about 1806 until a treaty in 1819 established the Sabine River as the boundary between the United States and what later became the state of Texas.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: The state is nearly tripling the number of acoustic shark detectors in coastal waters a year after its first fatal shark attack. The Maine Department of Marine Resources deployed eight acoustic receivers in coastal waters a year ago between Wells and Popham Beach, raising the number of sensors to 11. This summer, the state has deployed 32 acoustic receivers between York and Boothbay Harbor, said agency spokesperson Jeff Nichols. The sensors don’t provide real-time data. They must be brought to shore for the data to be downloaded to determine if they detected sharks that were previously tagged with transmitters by researchers, the Bangor Daily News reports. The extra sensors come a year a fatal attack in Harpswell. Julie Dimperio Holowach, 63, of New York City, was killed by a great white shark while swimming. It was Maine’s first fatal shark attack and the third fatal shark attack in New England. An increasing presence of large sharks in New England waters is tied to a growing number of seals.\n\nMaryland\n\nTowson: Mobile crisis teams in Baltimore County respond to fewer than half of calls to help people having mental health crises. But The Baltimore Sun reports that a pilot program funded by a $1.6 million federal grant aims to add more behavioral health professionals and set up a system to redirect some 911 calls from police to behavioral health resources. Of 4,319 calls for service since September, crisis teams have responded to 1,844, according to police data. When teams aren’t available – about 57% of the time – requests for aid are rerouted to officers, according to Police Chief Melissa Hyatt. “We have a significant capacity limitation,” Hyatt told lawmakers during a state Commission to Study Mental and Behavioral Health briefing earlier this year. There are 20 part-time and full-time clinicians and 12 officers with 40 hours of crisis intervention training in the county of nearly 830,000 residents. Next month, officials begin planning the program’s rollout, police spokeswoman Joy Stewart said. The program was announced just weeks before a May rampage in which a man set his Woodlawn home on fire and killed three neighbors before police killed him. Police said crisis teams had previous interactions with him but didn’t disclose more details.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: Archaeologists combing a hill near Plymouth Rock where a park will be built in tribute to the Pilgrims and their Native American predecessors have made a poignant discovery: It’s not the first time the site has been used as a memorial. David Landon of the University of Massachusetts-Boston’s Fiske Center for Archaeological Research said his team unearthed a cache of personal items he thinks were buried there in the late 1800s, most likely by a brokenhearted settler who had outlived all three of her children. Landon said the objects – eyeglasses, clothing, sewing implements, a pocket watch and a book – gave him chills because they turned up during final excavations of Cole’s Hill, a National Historic Landmark site in Plymouth where Remembrance Park is set to be constructed. “Someone clearly used that space in that fashion in the past to memorialize members of their family,” said Landon, whose team spent the past month scouring the waterfront site where the Pilgrims are said to have come ashore in 1620. Remembrance Park originally was conceived to mark 2020’s 400th anniversary of the Pilgrim’s 1620 arrival, the founding of Plymouth Colony and the settlers’ historic interactions with the indigenous Wampanoag people. But then the coronavirus pandemic hit, idling events as well as construction.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Massive amounts of green are being spent to find green ways to prevent basements, yards, streets and freeways in the city from flooding during heavy storms like one last month. Of $100 million pumped each year into infrastructure upgrades for the city’s aging water and sewer systems, $10 million goes toward installing detention ponds, bioswales, rain gardens and permeable pavement. Called green stormwater infrastructure, the features hold and slowly release rainfall into sewers, lessening flooding that has plagued Detroit and other older cities for decades. “It’s not the end-all-be-all, but it is a type of intervention that reduces wet weather flows into the system or delays them,” said Palencia Mobley, deputy director and chief engineer for Detroit’s Water and Sewerage Department. City officials say 6 inches of rain that poured down in the area June 25-26 was the most at one time in 80 years. As with a funnel beneath a swiftly flowing faucet, the volume of water moved faster than it could be pumped out or pushed through sewers to water treatment plants. Water pooled in streets and yards as debris clogged sewer grates. Untreated water pushed up through basement drains. Motorists were stranded on freeways. New vehicles in one auto plant lot were nearly submerged.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state is planning to close all but one of its COVID-19 mass vaccination sites by Aug. 7. A statement from Gov. Tim Walz late Friday said the state will focus on the several hundred smaller vaccination sites around the state, at pharmacies and health care providers. Minnesota Public Radio reports the state’s COVID-19 vaccination rate has been stagnant in recent weeks, at about two-thirds of residents 16 and older with at least one vaccine dose. Health officials have been turning to small-scale, targeted efforts to get the shots to more people. As of Friday the state reported administering more than 618,000 vaccine doses at the mass vaccination sites since January. The Mall of America location will be the only state-run mass vaccination site to stay open past the first week of August. As of Sunday, the state-run sites in St. Paul, Oakdale, Lino Lakes, Duluth, Rochester, Mankato and St. Cloud are only offering second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in their final weeks of operation. The state-run site at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport will offer the one-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine until it closes in early August.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: The Justice Department is continuing its investigation into the killing of Emmett Till, the Black teenager whose slaying 65 years ago in the Mississippi Delta community of Money sparked outrage and illustrated the brutality of racism in the segregated South. The department’s latest report on civil rights cold cases, released late last month, lists three investigations dating back decades that were closed because witnesses or suspects have died, leads went nowhere, or cases were too old to prosecute, but the Till case wasn’t among them. Relatives of Till said they didn’t know of anyone in the family who’d received official notification that the review had ended, a key step in the department’s process. “That’s all we know, that it’s still open,” family member Marvel Parker said Friday. Her husband, Wheeler Parker, was with Till the night he was taken from a family home at gunpoint. The youth’s brutalized body was later pulled from a river, where it had been weighted down with a cotton gin fan. Some news outlets reported last year that the investigation had ended. Initially closed in 2007, the case was reopened after a 2017 book quoted a key figure in the case, Carolyn Bryant Donham, as saying she lied when she claimed that the 14-year-old Till grabbed her, whistled and made sexual advances.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Three of the state’s top health officials said Friday that trusted local leaders and community representatives must be the primary influencers in the state’s efforts to reduce a surge in COVID-19 cases. During a virtual news conference, Robert Knodell, acting director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said the state continues to have a strong relationship with federal health experts, but they all believe local health department workers and community representatives are the best avenue for persuading residents to be vaccinated. Knodell said federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials agree that people from out of state cannot “parachute” into Missouri to persuade residents to get vaccinated. “We’re on the same page as it relates to that,” Knodell said. The comments came after Republican Gov. Mike Parson said last week that he does not support a suggestion from President Joe Biden’s administration that government employees go door-to-door to urge people to get vaccinated. Jeffrey Zeints, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, responded that the program would rely on local doctors, faith leaders and others, and suggesting otherwise was “misinformation.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte has discontinued Montana’s membership in a coalition of two dozen states dedicated to fighting climate change. The U.S. Climate Alliance is a nonpartisan group committed to achieving the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement and avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. Democratic former Gov. Steve Bullock joined the alliance in 2019. The alliance is made up of nearby Western states, including Colorado, Washington and Oregon. Evan Westrup, of the U.S. Climate Alliance, said Gianforte did not respond to the organization’s invitation to continue the state’s membership, Montana Public Radio reports. Gianforte spokesperson Brooke Stroyke said in a statement that the governor believes the solution to climate change is unleashing American innovation, not overbearing government mandates. She said the Paris Agreement punishes the U.S., while letting countries like China off the hook. Stroyke didn’t respond to requests to clarify Gianforte’s climate goals, or what sort of innovation is necessary in Montana. Amy Cilimburg, executive director of Climate Smart Missoula, said the state needs more than innovation. “The U.S. Climate Alliance was not some kind of a radical group; it was governors realizing that we’re stronger together,” Cilimburg said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Roughly 200 people were possibly exposed to a rabid bat while staying overnight at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, the zoo said. The zoo and Nebraska health officials recommended that roughly 186 campers who stayed overnight at the aquarium in recent weeks, as well as some staffers, get rabies shots. A camper on July 4 woke up to a wild bat flying around her head. A zoo emergency medical technician didn’t find any bites or scratches on her. The zoo found seven wild bats in the aquarium and euthanized them. One tested positive for rabies. The zoo in a news release Friday said it has recommended that people exposed to wild bats while they were sleeping get rabies shots. The zoo gave campers refunds and is paying for their shots. Animal Health Director Dr. Sarah Woodhouse said in a statement that guests who visited the aquarium during the day shouldn’t be concerned because bats only come out at night. “The bats we identified were little brown bats, a common bat species in Nebraska that anyone could find in their backyard or attic,” Woodhouse said. “It is not unusual for a wild bat to be infected with rabies, which is why you should never directly touch a wild bat.” Zoo staff didn’t find any signs of long-term bat roosting at the aquarium.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The U.S. Department of Energy has agreed to pay the state $65,000 after the government mislabeled and mischaracterized low-level radioactive waste that was shipped to a disposal site north of Las Vegas for more than five years. The settlement agreement announced Thursday certifies that multiple changes have been made to prevent unapproved waste from being shipped and disposed of at the Nevada National Security Site in the future, state and federal officials said. It also establishes an additional groundwater monitoring well at the site. The Energy Department has said none of the materials shipped to Nevada posed any health or safety threats to workers or the public. They were mischaracterized as the wrong category of low-level waste and should have been classified as low-level mixed waste, the state’s review determined. Low-level waste can include equipment or worker’s clothing contaminated by exposure to radiation, while mixed low-level waste can include toxic metals. Former Energy Secretary Rick Perry notified Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak in July 2019 that 33 packages of unapproved waste were sent in 10 shipments between 2013 and 2018 to the site from the Energy Department’s Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A council tasked with addressing broad issues around housing affordability and stability in the state seeks to increase housing availability by 13,500 units by 2024, according to its plan released Friday. The plan includes a three-year framework to specifically address homelessness across the state, with emphasis on the need for an increase in inventory of affordable housing. Recommendations include promoting new housing development, reducing barriers to affordable housing, and using a data-driven approach to understand regional needs. “The plan serves as a blueprint for our collective efforts – statewide, regionally, and locally – with a focus on alignment, coordination, innovation, and accountability,” Gov. Chris Sununu, who created the council last year, said in a statement. Sununu created the Council on Housing Stability after state police cleared a homeless encampment outside a courthouse in Manchester. It represents a revamping of the existing Interagency Council on Homelessness.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSeaside Heights: Gov. Phil Murphy signed a package of bills Friday aimed at moving the state closer to its goal of generating 100% of its power from clean sources by 2050. The measures make it easier to develop some solar energy projects and to locate and build electric vehicle charging stations. But still waiting for action by the Democratic governor is another bill that would remove most local control from where and how offshore wind energy projects come ashore. Murphy did not mention that bill at a signing ceremony in Seaside Heights in a municipal parking lot across the street from a popular water park. “From wind turbine component manufacturing to solar to electric vehicles, we are well on our way to putting New Jersey back to its rightful place as a national leader” in clean energy, Murphy said. One measure makes it easier to locate electric vehicle charging stations throughout the state, eliminating the need to go before planning or zoning boards to get them approved. A similar bill signed by the governor encourages development of zero-emission vehicle fueling and charging infrastructure in redevelopment projects. Murphy also signed two measures dealing with solar power projects. One allows so-called dual use solar projects located on unpreserved farm land that is still also used for agricultural purposes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Republican lawmakers are asking the state attorney general to weigh in on a spending dispute over $1.75 billion in federal pandemic relief aid. GOP leadership in a letter sent Thursday asked New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas, a Democrat, to issue a legal opinion declaring the funds must be allocated by the Legislature to protect the body’s fiscal authority. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said her administration must distribute the money because of the way Congress passed the pandemic relief bill. The Legislature allocated money earlier this year, but Lujan Grisham used her veto power to effectively bring the money under discretionary control by her office. Republican lawmakers took issue. They, along with one vocal Democratic senator, signed a petition that called for an extraordinary legislative session to be convened to override the governor’s veto and bring the funds back under the Legislature’s control. Democratic majorities in the House and Senate did not sign on. “Standing on principle isn’t always popular,” Sen. Jacob Candelaria, D-Albuquerque, said on Twitter in response to a news article. “Was easy for my Dem colleagues to challenge (the) power of (former Republican Gov. Susana) Martinez. Such a fair weather commitment to the law.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is seeing an uptick in COVID-19 cases as vaccination rates slowly rise, according to data released Saturday. About 525 people each day tested positive for the coronavirus in New York for the seven days through Friday. That’s up from 369 people – a 42% increase – for the prior week. It’s unclear why more people in New York are testing positive, at a time when fewer people are getting tested. The state Department of Health said a higher percentage of cases are linked to more contagious variants and urged more people to get vaccinated. New York City is driving much of the increase in positives, though cases are also rising on parts of Long Island. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are flattening: Hospitals reported 342 COVID-19 patients as of Friday, similar to 340 patients from last Friday. About 55% of 20 million New Yorkers are fully vaccinated. That’s up from nearly 48% as of June 6. Vaccination rates are lowest in parts of western and central New York; about one-third of residents in Allegany County are fully vaccinated. Rates are also lower in parts of New York City: 43% of Bronx residents and 45.5% of Brooklyn residents are fully inoculated.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: Fayetteville State University has used pandemic relief funds to clear $1.6 million in tuition debt for nearly 1,500 students. The Fayetteville Observer reports the historically Black school utilized money from the federal legislation that’s known as the American Rescue Plan. Signed into law in March, it provided nearly $40 billion to higher education institutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. FSU cleared tuition that was not covered by federal student grants or loans. The school also plans to use $4.7 million in federal funds to provide free summer classes to 1,400 undergraduates through the summer of 2023. “The university is focused on students’ success by clearing past due balances and erasing debt,” FSU spokeswoman Joy Cook said. “When the burden of financial stress is taken away, student success increases.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A Midwestern network and technology services provider says it plans to invest $200 million to upgrade and expand its fiber network in North Dakota. Midco said it’s part of a larger $500 million investment to its network in the upper Midwest that will benefit telehealth, education, government operations and remote working. Upgrading to 10-gigabit speed by 2030 is a goal toward which the cable provider has been working for the past couple years. “Now we think we can do it sooner,” said Midco President and CEO Pat McAdaragh. The phased upgrade begins in earnest in 2022, doubling Midco’s fiber network to 22,000 miles, McAdaragh said. Work in North Dakota will begin with a $100 million first phase in Bismarck, Dickinson and Fargo, lasting about three years. “Then immediately we’ll begin spending the other $100 million and getting to areas we haven’t gotten to done yet, so we’re looking at more of a six-year process than 10,” McAdaragh said. More than 25 communities, many of them rural, stand to benefit from the upgrade in North Dakota, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Midco expects remote work to continue to be an employment trend, sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOhio\n\nRootstown: An Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper successfully performed the Heimlich maneuver after a man allegedly attempted to swallow a bag of cannabis when he was pulled over for speeding. Ohio State Police Sgt. Ray Santiago said the traffic stop occurred July 3 in Portage County. Trooper Charles Hoskin stopped a vehicle that was allegedly traveling at 94 mph in a 70 mph zone, WEWS-TV reports. Dash camera video posted to the Ohio State Police Twitter account shows Hoskin asking if the driver could breathe before helping him out of the car and performing the Heimlich. The man expelled a bag of marijuana and apologized to the officer. After the man recovered, Hoskins asked: “Do you want to die over a minor misdemeanor?” The man received citations for speeding and failing to wear a seat belt, according to Santiago. The man also received a summons for marijuana and was released at the scene.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health officials on Friday urged more residents to get vaccinated amid an alarming spike in new cases and hospitalizations for COVID-19, particularly in the northeastern part of the state. Oklahoma is seeing an uptick in cases with the emergence of the new delta variant of the coronavirus, particularly in rural areas where there are lower rates of vaccinations, said Oklahoma Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye. He said those numbers will likely continue to increase following the Fourth of July holiday. “Vaccination numbers for 12 to 34 years old are particularly low, meaning this demographic is especially at risk,” Frye said. “We want people to get out and enjoy their lives and their freedoms. Vaccination is the way to get there.” Oklahoma has the 11th lowest percentage of its population fully inoculated at 38.9%, compared to a national average of 47.8%, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Oklahoma has risen over the past two weeks from 190.29 new cases per day June 23 to 278.71 new cases per day Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Meanwhile, the CDC on Friday said it identified 47 cases, all with the delta variant, in April and May associated with a central Oklahoma gymnastics facility.\n\nOregon\n\nPendleton: Dozens of baby hawks, desperate to escape a blast of early summer heat in recent weeks, bailed from their nests and plummeted to the ground. Calls poured into Blue Mountain Wildlife day after day as temperatures pushed beyond 110 degrees across Eastern Oregon. Lynn Tompkins told the East Oregonian that she hadn’t seen anything like it in her 30 years as director of the wildlife rehabilitation center outside Pendleton. “They had no choice,” said Tompkins, 68. “It was just too bloody hot to survive.” In all, the center took in nearly 50 nestling Swainson’s and Cooper’s hawks after they leaped from their nests in the extreme heat wave that baked the Pacific Northwest. Thirteen of the raptors suffered injuries severe enough that they had to be euthanized. “We knew the temperature was going to spike beforehand, and we assumed we might get a few more calls,” said Trisha Marquez, a volunteer who fielded the calls and who is Tompkins’ niece. “But we did not expect this at all.” The influx was more than the small staff could handle. They hardly had the space to put them all and, eventually, asked people to turn on their sprinklers and hoses and set out pans of water for less-injured birds to cool themselves down.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A museum has returned to public view a 19th-century diorama that shows lions attacking a camel and its human rider, about a year after covering it up in response to complaints about how the courier was depicted. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reports a curtain around “Lion Attacking a Dromedary” at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History was removed a week ago, and information was posted to address the controversy. X-rays have confirmed that the figure contains a human skull and jaw, presenting an ethical problem for the museum, which does not know where those remains originated. The courier’s costume has been determined to be derived from at least five separate North African cultures. A new sign tells museum patrons that the exhibit, which vividly depicts two lions attacking a camel and its knife-wielding rider, is popular but reinforces stereotypes. “For the present, the museum is keeping the diorama on display,” the sign says. “We want to engage with visitors, staff, and community members to listen and learn from you as we consider the future of this diorama.” Museum director Gretchen Baker told the paper the curtains “were more harmful than not having them up at all,” and in hindsight covering the exhibit may not have been the right approach. The French-built diorama has been at the Carnegie since 1899.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee has vetoed legislation that would make property owners register with the state before listing short-term rentals through online lodging websites, to the chagrin of some concerned about the unregulated nature of the industry. “I cannot support this bill because it will create additional burden for property owners,” the Democratic governor wrote Thursday in a veto message. “Short-term rental concerns, like other property/land use and small business matters, are most effectively addressed at the municipal level.” Some municipal leaders and residents are worried about properties rented on vacation rental websites like Airbnb and VRBO becoming de facto hotels. Calls for a registry increased in the spring after a 22-year-old University of Rhode Island student was fatally stabbed during a party at a rental property in Newport. The proposal was overwhelmingly approved by the heavily Democratic Legislature, which can override McKee’s veto. Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, both Democrats, wrote in a joint statement that they were “disappointed” by the veto.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Conservationists have pulled a historic canoe from a river and plan to put it on display. Volunteers with the Chattooga Conservancy hauled the weathered wooden canoe out of the South Carolina side of the Chattooga River on Tuesday after a group of canoeists headed downstream discovered the craft last fall, The State newspaper reports. Archaeologists at the University of South Carolina say the boat could be 200 to 250 years old, a discovery that could shed light on life in the late 1700s. Canoes of that age are rarely found along the Chattooga, a free-flowing mountain river that runs along the Georgia-South Carolina border. Most of South Carolina’s historic canoes have been found in the state’s Lowcountry region, said underwater archaeologist James Spirek. “Up in the mountains on the rivers, they’re a little rare,” Spirek told the newspaper. “It’s interesting to find people were using canoes on some of these wild rivers.” The experts said the canoe was hollowed out using an iron hatchet or ax, suggesting it was made after Europeans settled in the Southeast. A nail was also found at one end of the canoe. Volunteers are expected this week to pull the boat up a mountain slope and down a bank to then float it down a calmer river stretch to move it out of the river corridor for storage or display.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Two Native Americans announced Thursday that they were joining a lawsuit against South Dakota alleging that state agencies failed to offer voter registration services. The two tribal members, along with the Lakota People’s Law Project, said they were asking a federal district judge to allow them to join a lawsuit that alleges state agencies are breaking federal law by not providing ample opportunities to register to vote or update voter registration information at places like motor vehicle and public assistance offices near Native American reservations. Federal law requires the agencies to help people register to vote at those kinds of offices, including ones that provide public assistance or serve people with disabilities. The Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe initiated the legal challenge last year. The state has denied those allegations in court documents and asked that the lawsuit be dismissed. The tribes have argued that state practices already make it difficult for Native American people to register to vote. They alleged that they have documented instances in which people tried to register their votes at state agency offices but were turned away.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge on Friday halted enforcement of a new state law requiring businesses to post special signs if they allow transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. The first-of-its-kind law went into effect July 1 and would require such businesses to post signs on multiperson bathrooms that say: “This facility maintains a policy of allowing the use of restrooms by either biological sex, regardless of the designation on the restroom.” Businesses in Nashville and Chattanooga sued over the law, claiming that being forced to post those signs would violate their First Amendment rights by compelling them to communicate language they find offensive. The state of Tennessee argued in court that the signs are merely factual. In her Friday decision, U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger handed a victory to the businesses that sued, granting a preliminary injunction that effectively prevents the state from enforcing the law while the case works through the courts. She noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has found that compelling individuals to “mouth support for views they find objectionable” violates a cardinal constitutional command unless justified by “the strongest of rationales.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A Houston man who received widespread attention after standing six hours in line to cast a ballot in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary was in jail Friday on charges that it was illegal for him to vote at all because he was on parole. Hervis Rogers became an overnight face of Texas’ battle over voting access when he emerged from a polling center at a historically Black college around 1:30 a.m. He was among Houston voters on Super Tuesday who waited more than an hour – some for several hours – in mostly minority, Democratic neighborhoods. Lines in mostly white, Republican neighborhoods were shorter. “The way it was set up, it was like it was set up for me to walk away,” Rogers told reporters. He was arrested this week on two counts of illegal voting, a second-degree felony that carries a possible sentence of two to 20 years in prison. His bail was set at $100,000. Rogers, 62, voted last March while still on parole from a felony burglary conviction, making him ineligible to cast a ballot under Texas law. Andre Segura, an attorney for the ACLU of Texas who is representing Rogers, said his client did not know he was ineligible to vote. “We shouldn’t be prosecuting people for innocent mistakes,” Segura said. The rare arrest on illegal voting allegations comes as Texas Republicans begin a second attempt at passing many of the same restrictive voting measures blocked by Democrats during a dramatic late-night walkout in May.\n\nUtah\n\nMilford: Just outside this town of about 1,400 people in southwest Utah, researchers behind a major energy project are hoping to tap into a limitless supply of clean, reliable power. The energy exists thousands of feet below the surface, where the natural heat from the Earth’s core can be used to create electricity. Researchers at the Utah-based FORGE lab are working on technology to create geothermal reservoirs almost anywhere in the world, KUER reports. Geothermal power already exists but currently makes up just 0.4% of energy production in the U.S. So far it’s largely been limited to select areas around naturally occurring hot springs, such as the Roosevelt Hot Springs in Beaver County. FORGE lab researchers have recently completed one of two major wells they’ll use to develop the tools to build “enhanced geothermal systems” – human-made versions of natural geothermal reservoirs that pump water through cracks underground, heat it, and use the steam to power turbines or to heat buildings. If successful, the project and others like it could lead to “a 40-fold increase over present geothermal power generating capacity,” according to the U.S. Department of Energy. “The world is looking at Milford,” said Joseph Moore, a geologist and lead researcher at FORGE.\n\nVermont\n\nWinooski: The state is undergoing a pandemic-related liquor shortage, regulators say, leading to empty shelves in some stores and warehouses, WCAX-TV reports. “It is a global issue. A lot of it has been exacerbated by the pandemic. It’s not going to be a quick fix,” said Wendy Knight, deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Liquor and Lottery. It’s a global supply chain issue “from production gearing back up from the pandemic, worker shortages, shipping issues, and a glass shortage. That comes on top of demand from restaurants and bars reopening,” she said. The Burlington bar The Archives planned to open a second location in Winooski last year, but the pandemic kept it closed until Thursday. Now the arcade bar is facing another obstacle. “The liquor shortage has been a challenge,” the bar’s co-owner Matthew Walters said. Bars and restaurants are not the only ones feeling the tight supply. “There’s enough to at least have your second choice, if not your first,” George Bergin of the Beverage Warehouse in Winooski told the news station. “With all the bars and restaurants opening up everywhere, everyone is trying to restock their shelves, and it’s just taking a little bit of time to get caught up with the sudden demand.” Vermont saw a 13% increase in liquor sales amid the pandemic, Knight said.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Cheers erupted Saturday as a Confederate statue that towered for nearly a century over downtown was carted away by truck from the city where it had become a flashpoint for racist protests and deadly violence. It was a day of palpable joy and immense relief for scores of residents and visitors who lined neighboring streets to watch the larger-than-life figure of Gen. Robert E. Lee as it was hoisted from its pedestal and taken – at least for now – to storage. The statue’s removal came more than five years after racial justice activists had renewed a push to take down the monument, an initiative that drew the attention of white supremacists and other racist groups, culminating in the violent “Unite the Right” rally in 2017. “I’m ecstatic that we’re here now. It’s sad that it’s taken so much to get us to this point. But this is an incredible day,” said Don Gathers, a local Black activist who long advocated for the statue’s removal. Work to remove Lee’s statue, as well as one of Confederate Gen. Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson shortly after, proceeded peacefully and without interruption. Also removed Saturday was a statue depicting Sacagawea and explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark that has been criticized for a depiction of the Native American guide and interpreter that some view as subservient and weak.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A federal jury has convicted a timber thief who authorities said started a large forest fire in a case that prosecutors said marked the first time tree DNA had been introduced in a federal trial. The jury deliberated for about seven hours before convicting Justin Andrew Wilke, 39, on Thursday of conspiracy, theft of public property, depredation of public property, and trafficking and attempted trafficking in unlawfully harvested timber, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Western Washington said in a news release. The wood he sold to a mill in the city of Tumwater had been harvested from private property with a valid permit, Wilke said. But a research geneticist for the U.S. Forest Service, Richard Cronn, testified that the wood he sold genetically matched the remains of three poached trees. Wilke used gasoline to destroy a wasp’s nest in the base of a maple tree he was stealing, prosecutors said, though jurors did not convict him of charges related to the fire. Some witnesses testified that, although Wilke was standing next to the nest when the fire began, they did not actually see his actions in the dark. Wilke and others conducted an illegal logging operation in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, near Hood Canal, between April and August 2018, according to records filed in the case.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice called on Saturday for the resignation of a state lawmaker who posted a sexually explicit TikTok video to his public account. State Del. Joe Jeffries was stripped of a committee assignment Friday after word spread of the social media posting, according to a statement from House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, who called his fellow Republican an “embarrassment.” On Saturday, the GOP governor issued a statement calling Jeffries’ behavior “sad” and “childish.” “Not only did he yell graphic comments about me to a group of senators during the recent Legislative Session, but now we find that his not-so-secret TikTok is full of disgustingly vulgar videos, which are especially insulting to women,” Justice’s statement said. “This is the behavior of an immature child, not a 39-year-old father and elected official.” The governor said he had expected to hear an apology from Jeffries by Saturday morning, “but all he has done is hide from the media and the criticism.” Jeffries, whose district includes a group of counties near Charleston, posted the video Thursday. His account was set to private Friday. Belinda Biafore, chair of the West Virginia Democratic Party, said Jeffries “has a slew of inappropriate and vulgar videos with his own sexually explicit commentary on a social media app aimed at youth.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A bishop has taken the unusual step of removing a priest from the ministry after he made a series of divisive remarks about politics and the pandemic. The Diocese of La Crosse said in a statement Friday that Bishop William Patrick Callahan has issued a decree immediately removing the Rev. James Altman as pastor of St. James the Less, a parish in the city of La Crosse. The decree will remain in effect for an undetermined length of time, the statement said. “(The bishop) and his diocesan representatives have spent over a year, prayerfully and fraternally, working toward a resolution related to ongoing public and ecclesial concerns of the ministry of Fr. James Altman,” the statement said. “The obligation of a Bishop is to ensure that all who serve the faithful are able to do so while unifying and building the Body of Christ.” Diocese officials didn’t release the decree and didn’t immediately respond to a request for a copy. Altman told conservative news outlet LifeSiteNews.com that he’s not surprised the Catholic hierarchy is trying to silence him. “Unfortunately for the corrupt hierarchy, I will not be silenced by any arbitrary Decree, nor will I be cowed by any action against my priestly faculties,” he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A rancher who was pinned by an all-terrain vehicle survived on beer and bottled water for two days. Frank Reynolds, 53, was trying to round up a cow and calf on a neighbor’s pasture outside Gillette when the vehicle tipped over on him July 4, Reynolds told the Gillette News Record. “It was scary as hell is what it was,” Reynolds said Wednesday from a hospital room. Family thought Reynolds had gone camping or was with friends, said Quentin Reynolds, the Campbell County undersheriff and Frank’s brother. Later Monday, they began to worry. Eventually, they learned Frank Reynolds had planned to do some work on the property, where he was laying with a dislocated shoulder and broken ribs. A search began. Reynolds, meanwhile, honked the ATV’s horn so much he wore down the battery – to no avail. He was able to ration a couple of bottles of water and Keystone Light beers from a cooler, Sheriff Scott Matheny said. Searching on horseback, neighbor Don Hamm found Reynolds about 8 a.m. Tuesday. By that point, Reynolds recalled he was “pretty much out of it.” “Everything on the left side pretty much hurt, from the top of my head to my toes,” he said. He was expected to remain in the hospital a few more days and eventually recover.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/12"}]}

Even as Biden climbed to the dais in the House of Representatives, Kyiv was bracing for an all-out Russian assault that could lead to the occupation of the capital and the overthrow of the nation's democratically elected government.\n\nRead the whole story here:A world of change: Biden seeks his footing as his agenda and the landscape are transformed\n\nWho heckled Biden?\n\nA notable moment in the State of the Union came when Biden talked about talked about the flag-draped coffins of fallen service members, including his son, Beau, who died in 2015 of brain cancer at age 46.\n\nAs Biden spoke about Beau, people inside the House chambers reported someone shouting, “You put them in there, 13 of them.\" After the comment was made, attendees in the chambers began to boo and groan at the comment, as Biden paused for a brief moment and continued his address.\n\nBoebert later confirmed on Twitter she in fact made the comment, in reference to the 13 U.S. soldiers who were killed in a suicide bombing attack at Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport in August as the Taliban took over Afghanistan and Afghans attempted to flee the country.\n\n--Jordan Mendoza\n\nBiden touts Justice Breyer, Ketanji Brown Jackson\n\nIn one of the more touching moments of Biden’s remarks Tuesday, the president briefly recognized Associate Justice Stephen Breyer, who announced he will step down from the Supreme Court after nearly three decades.\n\nBreyer, holding his hands over his heart and, at one point, his face, appeared to be embarrassed by the attention. Breyer, who will retire in June, approached Biden after the address and the two spoke for several minutes and shared a laugh.\n\n“Thank you for your service,” Biden said to Breyer during the speech. “Thank you. Thank you.”\n\nBiden nominated U.S. Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for Breyer’s seat on Friday, and the Miami native, who has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit since June, has started to meet with members of the Senate who will vote on her confirmation later spring.\n\nThe president described Jackson as a “consensus builder” but made no mention, as he has in other venues, of what makes Jackson a historic candidate: She would be the first Black woman ever to serve on the nation’s highest court.\n\nAt 51, Jackson could serve on the Supreme Court for decades. Democrats are seeking to confirm Jackson by early April.\n\n-- John Fritze\n\nWho is Joshua Davis? Here's more about the 13-year-old who stole the show at State of the Union\n\nOf all the guests invited to President Joe Biden's first State of the Union address, one of the few mentioned was 13-year-old Joshua Davis. Davis, who is from Midlothian, Virginia, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when he was just 11 months old, according to the White House.\n\nAt the age of four, Davis began advocating for the Virginia General Assembly to make \"school safer for kids with Type 1 diabetes.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the seventh-grader at Swift Creek Middle School introduced President Biden at an event on prescription drug costs at a community college in Virginia.\n\n--Jordan Mendoza\n\nBiden's report on the State of the Union: Strong\n\nThe president struck an optimistic tone in his concluding remarks, praising American values and calling the moment a \"test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.\"\n\n\"It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged,\" he said. \"We will meet this test.\"\n\nBiden acknowledged while the country has faced a challenging period, he is \"more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life.\"\n\nThe president waited until the end of his speech, which lasted more than an hour, to deliver his report on the state of the union: \"strong.\"\n\n\"Because you, the American people, are strong,\" he said as the crowd erupted in cheers. \"We are stronger today than we were a year ago.

Many soldiers who breathe smoke from them develop headaches, numbness, dizziness and even cancer, Biden said.\n\n“I know,” he said. “One of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden.”\n\nBeau Biden died in 2015 of brain cancer at age 46.\n\n“We don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer or the diseases of so many of our troops,” Biden said. “But I’m committed to finding out everything we can.”\n\n-– Michael Collins\n\nBiden: ‘Let's end cancer as we know it’\n\nBiden highlighted his announcement last month to relaunch the Cancer Moonshot, an issue close to the president’s heart after his son, Beau, died of brain cancer.\n\n“Let's end cancer as we know it,” he said.\n\nBiden noted that the fight to end cancer is personal for him and First Lady Jill Biden, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris, whose mother died of colon cancer.\n\n“So many of you lost someone you love: Husband wife, son, daughter, mom, dad,” Biden added.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nLawmakers react in the chamber following speech\n\nFollowing the speech, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., walked towards the front of the chamber to take a photo of Vice President Harris and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \"Most powerful ladies in the world,\" Gillibrand shouted as she took the picture.\n\nBiden was swarmed by lawmakers as he exited the chamber. Rep. Adam Schiff shook his hand, and Biden placed his hand on Schiff's shoulder.

Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.\n\n\"And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the border and fix the immigration system,\" Biden said. \"We can do both.\"\n\nThe president said the U.S. implemented new technology to better detect drug smuggling, set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch human traffickers and is supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.\n\nBiden also called for obtaining legal status for so-called Dreamers, or undocumented immigrations who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, as well as those who have temporary status, farm workers and essential workers.\n\n\"It’s not only the right thing to do—it’s the economically smart thing to do,\" he added.\n\n-- Courtney Subramnaian\n\nBiden calls for ‘proven measures’ to reduce gun violence\n\nBiden vowed to cut down on gun trafficking and called on Congress to pass what he called “proven measures” to reduce gun violence.\n\nSpecifically, he urged lawmakers to pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and repeal liability shield that mean gun makers can’t be sued.\n\n“These laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment,” he said. “They save lives.”\n\n–- Michael Collins\n\nBiden: Nominee Jackson a ‘consensus builder’\n\nBetween the crisis in Ukraine, soaring inflation and a stalled domestic agenda, Biden doesn’t have a lot of good news to tout at his State of the Union address this year.\n\nOne exception: His recently announced historic nominee to the Supreme Court, U.S. Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nBiden called Jackson “one of our nation’s top legal minds” and a “consensus builder.” Jackson would be the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe president tried to signal bipartisan support for Jackson as she begins meeting with senators ahead of a confirmation hearing this spring.\n\n“Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support -- from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans,” Biden said.\n\nSenate Democrats hope to confirm Jackson to the high court by early April.\n\n-- John Fritze\n\nBiden: Right to vote ‘under assault’\n\nBiden called on Congress to pass voting rights legislation, saying that the right to vote is “under assault.”\n\n\"The most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted,” Biden said. “And it’s under assault.”\n\nHe added that he would like to see Congress pass the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Act.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nAmerican Rescue Plan essential to keep neighborhoods safe, Biden says\n\nPresident Biden touted his American Rescue Plan as an asset to community safety.\n\nThe plan, which was approved by Democrats in Congress last March, provides $350 billion in direct aid to cities, states and counties that can be used to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption.\n\n“We should all agree, the answer is not to defund the police, it’s to fund the police,” Biden said to cheers and applause.\n\n-- Chelsey Cox\n\nMore:President Joe Biden's COVID stimulus bill explained in 6 charts\n\nCOVID-19 reset\n\nBiden reflected on how COVID-19 has challenged the country since 2020, but that with roughly three-fourths of Americans fully vaccinated, and hospitalizations down by 77%, “most Americans can removed their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom and move forward safely.”\n\nThe president touched on how that has been the result of free vaccines, treatments, tests and masks. But Biden noted how this is a pivotal moment for Americans to stay focused in the face of the contagion’s possible resurgence.\n\n“Let’s use this moment to reset,” he said. “Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.”\n\nBiden noted how many lives have been lost, and that Americans cannot let the contagion divide them further.\n\n“We can’t change how divided we’ve been,” he said. “But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.”\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nTracking COVID-19 vaccine distribution by state:How many people have been vaccinated in the US?\n\nBiden: End the 'partisan dividing line'\n\nIn his speech, Biden asked Republicans to stop using the COVID pandemic as a \"partisan dividing line\" – and to lower the temperature on a whole host of important issues.\n\n\"Let’s stop seeing each other as enemies,\" the president said, \"and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.\"\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nBiden: Bring an end to shutdowns of schools and businesses\n\nThe president called for bringing COVID-19-related shutdowns of schools and businesses to an end as the country moves into a new phase of living with the pandemic.\n\n\"It’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again. People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office,\" he said. \"Our schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school.\"\n\nBiden also noted that with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their mask as they return to classrooms and offices.\n\nHe told the mostly maskless crowd that continuing his administration COVID-19 response efforts would cost more money and he intended to send Congress a request for more funds.\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden outlines plans to lower deficit\n\nThe president urged lawmakers to confirm his nominees to head the Federal Reserve, calling it crucial to his plan to fight inflation.\n\nBiden said his plan is designed to “monitor and lower costs” and “give families a fair shot” while also lowering the deficit.\n\n“The previous administration not only ballooned the deficit, it undermined the watchdogs of those pandemic relief funds,” Biden said, and added that his administration reprioritized going after criminals who commit pandemic relief-related fraud.\n\nBiden also stated that he is the only president to have cut the deficit by more than $1 trillion dollars in a single year and vowed to even the economic playing field for Americans.\n\n“Capitalism without competition is not capitalism. Capitalism without competition is exploitation,” Biden said.\n\n-- Chelsey Cox\n\nBiden on COVID: ‘We’re moving forward’\n\nBiden said the United States has made progress to move past COVID-19, noting the updated mask guidelines issued by the CDC last week.\n\n“Because of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines,” he said. “We’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19.\"\n\n“COVID-19 need no longer control our lives,” he added.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden vows to crack down on price gouging\n\nBiden announced a crackdown on companies that practice price gouging.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits, he said.\n\n\"I’m a capitalist,” he said. “But capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. It’s exploitation – and it drives up prices.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\n‘Secret ballot’ on taxes?\n\nBiden challenged Congress to adopt his plan at reforming the tax code, promising that under his plan no one earning less than $400,000 a year would “pay an additional penny in new taxes.”\n\n“I may be wrong but my guess is if we took a secret ballot on this floor that we’d all agree that the president tax system ain’t fair,” Biden said. “We have to fix it.”\n\nThe president’s remarks received a more lukewarm response, especially from congressional Republicans, who have resisted his idea.\n\nBut Biden’s pitch to the American people argued that his tax plan would grow the economy and doesn’t “punish anyone” but rather seeks to even the playing field by ensuring U.S. companies and its wealthiest individuals to “start paying their fair share.”\n\n“Just last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax,” Biden said. “That’s simply not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations.”\n\n-- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nSome Republicans take notes, joke to colleagues during Biden's speech\n\nSome Republican Senators appear to be taking notes on Biden's remarks, including Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., turned to Scott and Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., and moved his hand up and down, appearing to point out Democrats standing up and down in applause, garnering laughter from his colleagues.\n\n-- Dylan Wells\n\nBiden calls for reviving plan for child care and universal pre-kindergarten\n\nThe president reiterated his longstanding call to cut the cost of child care for parents, pointing out that most American families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child. A recent report by Child Care Aware of America found the price of child care has exceeded the annual inflation rate by 4 percent in 2020.\n\n\"Middle-class and working families shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children,\" he said.\n\nBiden's child care plan is part of his Build Back Better bill that was effectively killed after Sen. Joe Manchin announced late last year he wouldn't vote to pass it. The president also called for reviving plans to cut the cost of home and long-term care and creating a plan for universal pre-kindergarten for every 3- and 4-year-old.\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden pushes for climate investments as part of his inflation pitch\n\nBiden called for several climate investments that he said will save families money as part of his efforts aimed at tackling rising inflation.\n\nThat included investment tax credits for Americans to weatherize their homes, doubling clean energy production and lowering the price of electric vehicles.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nMore:UN panel's grim climate change report: 'Parts of the planet will become uninhabitable'\n\nBiden touts ‘revitalization’ of American manufacturing\n\nBiden praised what he said is the revitalization of the American manufacturing and said he agreed with Ohio Sen.

He’s also expected to urge Congress to pass his $300 million budget request to more than double the size of the Department of Justice’s COPS community policing grant program.\n\nRepublicans have sought to tie Biden and other Democrats to the “defund the police” mantra on the left, even though Biden has repeatedly rejected that phrase.\n\n“He'll make clear that the answer is not to defund the police, it’s to put more police – with better training and more accountability – out to take back our streets and make our neighborhoods safer,” a White House official said.\n\nAlthough Republicans in the Senate have refused to pass sweeping gun reform measures, Biden will point to his administration's unilateral efforts. That includes creating five new Justice Department gun trafficking strike forces to target the illegal; an executive order aimed at “ghost guns,” and new ATF rules.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nU.S. to close airspace to Russian planes\n\nBiden will announce in his State of the Union address that the U.S. is closing its airspace to Russian planes in retaliation for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, three sources told USA TODAY.\n\nThe U.S. joins a growing list of countries that have announced plans to close their airspace to Russian aircraft in response to the invasion.\n\nThe E.U. banned all Russian aircraft from its airspace after several European countries including France, Italy and Denmark as well as Canada announced the move Sunday.

Victoria Spartz, of Indiana, who was born in Ukraine, will wear a blue suit and yellow blazer to draw attention to the crisis. She took to Twitter ahead of the president’s remarks calling on the Biden administration to do more.\n\n“Putin’s war is not a war but a genocide of the Ukrainian people who wanted to be free and with us,” Spartz said. “We cannot let him embarrass our great nation and slaughter these brave people under our watch.\"\n\nRep. Brett Guthrie, of Kentucky, showed off how dozens of members from both parties had gathered on the Capitol steps before the address with a flag merging the U.S. and Ukrainian colors.\n\n“Today I joined my colleagues to show solidarity for the Ukrainian people,” Guthrie, a Republican, said. “Their bravery in the fight against Putin's unlawful and unprovoked invasion is inspiring. I support sending more aid to Ukraine and crushing Putin and his associates with a powerful arsenal of sanctions.”\n\nThe Democratic Women’s Caucus earlier Tuesday announced its members plan to “wear bright and colorful attire” in support Ukraine.\n\n-- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nSOTU comes as inflation soars\n\nBiden delivers his State of the Union address at a time when inflation has soared to its highest level in four decades.\n\nConsumer prices jumped 7.5% last month compared with 12 months earlier, the steepest year-over-year increase since February 1982, the Labor Department reported last month. The increase was driven by shortages of supplies and workers, heavy doses of federal aid, low interest rates and robust consumer spending, the department said.\n\nThe steady surge in prices has left many Americans less able to afford food, gas, rent, child care and other necessities.\n\n-- Michael Collins, Associated Press\n\nExplained:What is inflation and how does it affect you?

The lawmakers wanted to acknowledge voters who gave Democrats a majority in the House that year.\n\nThe tradition continued in 2020 in protest \"against President Trump's backwards agenda.\"\n\n-- Rebecca Morin and Chelsey Cox\n\nBiden to deliver speech as Russian convoy inches toward Kyiv\n\nBiden's State of the Union speech comes on day six of Russian President Vladimir Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the international crisis is expected to be a focal point of his speech.\n\nA 40-mile convoy of Russian tanks and vehicles appeared to stall about 15 miles outside of Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv. Troops appeared to run out of gas and food, but it's also possible the Russians are pausing to regroup and reassess their attack, a senior U.S. Defense Department official told reporters earlier Tuesday.\n\nUkrainians are bracing for continued attacks after at least 11 people were killed and 35 others wounded in an apparent rocket strike in Kharkiv. Earlier, Russian strikes hit Kyiv's main broadcasting tower and the nearby Babi Yar Holocaust Memorial site, where Nazis killed thousands of Jews during World War II. Ukraine's foreign minister confirmed the attack.\n\nAhead of his remarks, Biden spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for more than 30 minutes. The president said he discussed continued U.S. support, including security assistance and humanitarian aid, and vowed to hold Russia accountable.\n\nFor more updates on the unfolding crisis in Ukraine, follow USA TODAY's live coverage here.\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nMore:Satellite images show huge Russian convoys in Ukraine\n\nWhat will Biden talk about?\n\nBiden’s remarks to a joint session of Congress will give him a chance to trumpet his administration’s accomplishments during his first year in office and lay out policy goals for the coming year.\n\nA prominent Democratic strategist urged Biden to use the opportunity to offer Americans hope for better days.\n\n“What Americans want to hear is genuine understanding of what we have been through together and a clear path forward – less about Mr. Biden’s accomplishments than about the heroic, unsung sacrifices so many have made to see their families and communities through,” David Axelrod, who helped shape many of President Barack Obama’s addresses to Congress, wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times.\n\nWhat else is bound to come up? Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will cast a long shadow over Biden’s State of the Union address. Biden will seek to reassure the country that it's entering a new phase in the fight against COVID-19.

They keep moving. And, the costs and threats to America and the world keep rising,” he is expected to say.\n\n“That’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2. The United States is a member along with 29 other nations.\n\n“It matters. American diplomacy matters.\n\n“Putin’s war was premeditated and unprovoked. He rejected efforts at diplomacy.

We were ready,” he will say.\n\nMore:Russia has been accused of using 'vacuum bombs' in Ukraine. What are those?\n\nBiden to talk about inflation and the US economy\n\nBiden will also address inflation — an issue that is a top concern for the American people -- according to prepared remarks released by the White House.\n\n“We have a choice. One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer. I have a better plan to fight inflation,” he is expected to say.\n\n“Lower your costs, not your wages. Make more cars and semiconductors in America. More infrastructure and innovation in America. More goods moving faster and cheaper in America. More jobs where you can earn a good living in America. And, instead of relying on foreign supply chains – let’s make it in America.\n\n“Economists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.” I call it building a better America,” he will say.\n\n“My plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit,” he is expected to say.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden speech focus: The U.S. and Europe must be united against Russia\n\nPreviewing his State of the Union speech to a group of journalists, President Joe Biden said he will stress the importance of unity between the United States and Europe in confronting Russian President Vladimir Putin over his invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn a lunch with television anchors and others, Biden said he would re-emphasize \"my determination to see to it that the EU, NATO, all of our allies are on the same exact page in terms of sanctions against Russia and how we deal with the invasion – and it is an invasion – of Ukraine.\"\n\nThis from a tweet by CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who also reported that Biden declared global unity \"the one thing that gives us power to impose severe consequences on Putin for what he’s done.\"\n\nPresidents host these kinds of lunches with television anchors before every State of the Union address. The sessions are off the record, but White Houses often put a few comments on the record.\n\nIn this case, Biden wanted to make clear his message on Ukraine.\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nMore:Americans are at higher risk of Russian cyberattacks after Ukraine invasion: What you should do right now\n\nBiden will roll out mental health crisis strategies\n\nBiden will outline his plan for tackling the mental health crisis during his first State of the Union.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday that Biden will call on Congress to pass legislation to support those policies that increase the capacity of the mental health system to provide care, make it easier for those who need care to get it and address the determinants of health.\n\nAmong the policies he will pitch, according to the White House:\n\nA plan to spend $700 million on training, scholarship and loan repayment for those who pursue careers in mental health and substance abuse treatment in rural communities and other underserved areas.\n\nA proposal that health plans cover \"robust behavioral health services with an adequate network of providers, including three behavioral health visits each year without cost-sharing.\"\n\nTo address concerns about digital technology and social media damage to the mental health of young people, Biden wants to ban targeted advertising for children online and stop online algorithms from returning results that damage their mental well-being.\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nPelosi won’t be wearing a mask during State of the Union\n\nAs she sits behind President Joe Biden during his State of the Union address, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will be mask-less.\n\n“I’m not going to be wearing a mask tonight,” Pelosi told MSNBC Tuesday. “If I had little children, or if I were around little grandchildren I would because some of them would not be vaccinated.”\n\nDemocratic House leadership lifted its mask mandate in the House in time for the president’s first State of the Union. It comes as the rate of positive COVID-19 test results dropped to 2.7% at the Capitol’s testing site, according to Politico, and as the District of Columbia dropped its indoor mask mandate as COVID-19 cases have plummeted in Washington.\n\nThe White House on Tuesday ended its mask requirement for vaccinated staff members. But White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday said she hadn’t spoken to Biden on whether he will wear a mask when he walks into the House Chamber.\n\n“He will certainly not be wearing a mask when he's speaking,” Psaki said.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nWhat was the shortest State of the Union? the longest?\n\nWhich presidents delivered the longest and the shortest State of the Unions? It depends on your measuring stick.\n\nBased on word count, President George Washington’s delivered the shortest speech on record in 1790, before the annual message was even dubbed the State of the Union. Washington’s speech to a joint session of Congress measured in at 1,089 words, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nNot every president has delivered an oral message, however. After President Thomas Jefferson eschewed a speech in favor of a written message to Congress in 1801, it took more than a century before President Woodrow Wilson revived the tradition of an in-person speech in 1913.\n\nDating back to 1964, the shortest oral delivery of a State of the Union was President Ronald Reagan’s 31-minute speech in 1986, according to The American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The Congressional Research Service noted that speech still had a word count about three times as long as Washington’s inaugural annual message.\n\nThe longest written message to date belongs to President Jimmy Carter, who delivered a 33,667-word written State of the Union in 1981. In his final State of the Union in 2000, President Bill Clinton set the high watermark for an in-person speech at just under 90 minutes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s 80-minute average is the longest of all presidents dating to 1964, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nWhy is this Biden’s first State of the Union?\n\nThe concept of an annual update from the president to members of Congress has existed as long as the presidency. President George Washington delivered the first of what was then called the “Annual Message” in 1790.\n\nThat is rooted in the constitutional requirement to provide an update “from time to time.” The speech was not formally named the State of the Union until 1947, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nBut recent tradition has been for presidents to not deliver a formal State of the Union in the year they were inaugurated but instead to simply speak before a joint session of Congress.\n\nPresident Joe Biden did that in 2021, as the six presidents before him had done in their inauguration years. That means Biden’s 2022 address will be his first formal State of the Union.\n\n– Rick Rouan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/politics/joe-biden-first-year-in-office/index.html", "title": "Joe Biden enters the second year of his presidency looking for a ...", "text": "(CNN) As he walked through the front gate of the White House complex last year for the first time as President, Joe Biden declared it felt like \"going home.\"\n\nIf the presidency seemed then like a natural fit for a 50-year creature of Washington, today its limits are leading to a reckoning over expectations and ambitions in a country as exhausted, angry and divided as ever.\n\nBiden enters the second year of his term with one of the lowest approval ratings of a modern-day president, depleted of the political capital and sense of confidence that followed him into office.\n\nA sense of normalcy returned to the White House following the whiplash of Donald Trump's presidency , but a string of setbacks -- at home and abroad -- have eroded the air of competence that once surrounded a President and his team, who have spent most of their lives in government and campaigned for the job on a pledge of restoring order.\n\nOn most days since January 20, 2021, the President has arrived at the Oval Office early in the morning, peppered his team with detailed questions and tried not to think too much about the man who'd just vacated the building, leaving behind a pandemic, angry divisions and -- inside a drawer of the Resolute Desk -- a lengthy letter for Biden. The President has worked to make the place his own, installing his family's furniture, ordering up chocolate ice cream bars branded with the presidential seal and returning to traditions his predecessor abandoned.\n\nYet for all that, the country remains fractured and irritable. A \"malaise\" has sunk in as the pandemic persists, his vice president conceded in an interview this month. Americans are misbehaving on airplanes, in school board meetings and at grocery stores. So entrenched is the anger that one father felt comfortable blurting out a coded derogatory phrase about Biden when he was speaking to the President on the phone last Christmas Eve -- while his own son watched on.\n\n\"There are successes that he's had, but people do not feel it and you can't persuade people to feel better. You can't jawbone that,\" said David Axelrod, a senior adviser in former President Barack Obama's White House and a CNN senior political commentator.\n\nUnlike Trump, Biden is not actively stoking the anger. But his inaugural speech pledge to \"end this uncivil war\" remains unfulfilled.\n\nBiden's trademark personal style -- wielded over breakfasts in Delaware, inside caucus rooms on Capitol Hill and across the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office -- hasn't brought around holdout Democrats to some of his boldest ideas, let alone many Republicans.\n\nOverseas, a full-blown conflict now looms with Moscow just six months after coming face-to-face with the Russian leader in an old villa in Geneva. And after declaring \"independence from the virus\" on the South Lawn in July, Biden is contemplating Covid's permanent presence going forward.\n\nOn a personal level, just adjusting to life in the White House has been a struggle. By his own admission, Biden finds the place stifling and regularly spends three nights a week elsewhere.\n\nBlame game\n\nEven as top advisers and longtime friends of Biden try to help reset a floundering presidency, recriminations have quietly surfaced inside the West Wing about the fundamental causes of the challenges.\n\nA considerable share of finger-pointing is aimed at deep divisions among Democrats and how some top officials have sought to accommodate progressives in hopes of keeping peace inside the party.\n\n\"Over the last year, the White House has allowed the left to hijack and misinterpret the rationale for Biden's election,\" said one former Democratic official in regular touch with the President, speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity to talk candidly about the West Wing. \"He was not elected to transform the country.\"\n\nWhite House chief of staff Ron Klain, a longtime Biden adviser, is at the middle of those internal tensions. He is seen by some observers as pushing his own agenda or being too quick to side with demands from liberals, which raises expectations that ultimately lead to disappointment.\n\nWhen Democrats clinched their razor-thin majority in the Senate, following the Georgia runoff victories for Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, those expectations skyrocketed far beyond what the narrowly divided Senate has been able to deliver. The expected failure of voting rights legislation is only the latest example.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks to members of the media as he leaves a meeting with the Senate Democratic Caucus to discuss voting rights and election integrity on Capitol Hill on January 13.\n\n\"They pushed for everything you would have thought they would have done if they had 58 or 60 Democrats,\" one lawmaker told CNN, who lamented how Biden's first year is ending with a focus on what he didn't accomplish rather than what he did.\n\n\"Either your message is wrong, or your approach is wrong. Something is wrong.\"\n\nAt the center of the White House challenges, though, is Biden himself and what even many longtime admirers describe as unremarkable and uneven performances. Several members of Congress who speak with Biden frequently told CNN that his grasp of details is impressive, but how he communicates that publicly is often anything but.\n\nHeading into a tumultuous midterm election year, where Democrats are already bracing for the prospect of losing control of the House and possibly the Senate, the White House said Biden will spend more of his time communicating directly with the American people, rather than trying to negotiate deals in Congress.\n\nThat promise, however, rings familiar. The administration has repeatedly promised that Biden would spend more time on the road selling his plans, yet he has traveled less than most recent predecessors.\n\n\"There should be some really significant issues that we should be able to come around and coalesce around and get done. And I think we can. I think we can get it done. And we need the President, we need the administration to lead the way. They're in charge. The buck stops there. There is no doubt about, and we need to get things done. We're not doing good enough,\" said Rep. Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat who is running for Senate in the state.\n\n\"The President is the President, and there is no question that he bears some responsibility for it. But there is also Congress and the Senate, and the Republicans are MIA. They're worthless,\" Ryan said on CNN.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday hailed the legislative successes and the economic strides, despite coming into office under what she described as \"an incredibly difficult circumstance.\"\n\n\"You don't get everything done in the first year,\" Psaki said. \"The work is not done. The job is not done, and we are certainly not conveying that it is.\"\n\nConfronting Covid\n\nAs his second year begins, advisers tell CNN that Covid-19 and its messy fallout is the biggest weight on Biden -- the one challenge he believes could reverse his fortunes or forever damage his presidency.\n\nBiden has made significant strides, particularly in getting hundreds of millions of Americans vaccinated. But millions still refuse to get shots, a persistent source of frustration for the President.\n\n\"This virus has fooled us multiple times,\" one senior health official told CNN. \"Nobody expected Delta to just blow us away. And then to have Omicron come out of nowhere, it's a big, big surprise.\"\n\nStill, the President has maintained the same mentality throughout. He has repeatedly advised his team that while outsiders will quickly point out any of their missteps, \"you should keep your head down and keep working.\"\n\n\"He's not panicking. He's not blaming anyone,\" the official said.\n\nTrillions of dollars in Covid relief funds helped alleviate some of the economic stresses of the pandemic, but even Biden has admitted the influx of cash into the economy may have driven up consumer prices. Inflation triggered by a Covid-related mismatch between supply and demand remains a drag on the President's approval ratings.\n\nPresident Joe Biden removes his mask before speaking about updated CDC mask guidance on the North Lawn of the White House on April 27, 2021 in Washington, DC.\n\nBiden's poll numbers began taking a southward turn over the summer, when it became clear his celebrations of a waning virus were premature. Mask recommendations returned, shutdowns persisted and the once-hopeful feeling disappeared. Confusing messaging from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been a source of constant irritation in the West Wing.\n\nIn other ways, the pandemic has altered the normal rhythms of executive branch life. Unable to travel as extensively as he'd once hoped, Biden has taken to conducting events from an elaborate stage-set built in a White House auditorium where participants can beam in on video-chat. He has traveled abroad only twice, a slower pace than his predecessors.\n\nOrdinarily the West Wing and its adjacent offices are a hive of activity, where at any single moment meetings could be unfolding on dozens of pressing topics. But even a year into his presidency, Covid has left some staffers still working at home. Those who are selected for a meeting with the President himself must arrive well beforehand to undergo testing by the White House Medical Unit. What once could have been a 30-minute block of a Cabinet secretary or lawmaker's day becomes more of an ordeal.\n\n\"You know what it takes to go meet with the President?\" said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra last month. \"It's just a pain. And you knock out so much of your day. You've got to get tested, what is it, an hour and a half before you can see the President, you got to hang around there. So, the actual physical one-on-one, not as often.\"\n\nCalls for a reset\n\nGrowing anxious ahead of this year's midterm elections, many Democrats have issued various calls for a strategy reset -- on Covid, the economy and communications. Some have privately questioned whether Biden -- whose public schedule sometimes contains only a few events per week -- is doing enough to promote his accomplishments and break through to voters.\n\nBiden's speeches often rely on the same lengthy passages, recited verbatim from a teleprompter. When he does leave Washington, his events have tended to adopt a familiar look: a tour of a factory or plant, a speech to a group of unionized workers and up to an hour of shaking hands afterward. His top-visited state, aside from Delaware where he travels home on weekends, was Pennsylvania.\n\nAt moments, the nation's oldest President shows his age. After he reminisced about working with noted segregationist Strom Thurmond in a speech about voting rights last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemed perplexed: \"None of us have a lot of happy memories about Strom Thurmond,\" she said afterward.\n\nQuestions persist about whether he plans to run again in 2024 . And missteps by his vice president, Kamala Harris -- whose allies believe she is both underutilized as a political asset and overexposed to difficult issues -- have led to deeper introspection about the future of the Democratic Party.\n\nAfter urging from party strategists, Biden has lately begun drawing sharper contrasts with Republicans and speaking out louder about the corrosive lies peddled by Trump. The President has begun staging more events meant to highlight the benefits of what he has been able to accomplish, like passing the largest public works bill in decades.\n\nPresident Joe Biden disembarks from Air Force One upon arrival at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, July 28, 2021, after traveling to Pennsylvania to speak on the economy.\n\nHeading into the new year, the White House has drawn up executive actions on issues like police reform for Biden to act where Congress won't.\n\nAnd White House officials and Democratic lawmakers are beginning to quietly plot a way forward on Biden's sweeping spending agenda, including potentially splitting it into pieces.\n\nBiden has stood accused by some progressives, including his onetime rival for the Democratic presidential nomination Sen. Bernie Sanders, of failing to pursue an agenda focused on real-world economic issues. It's a charge that stings for the President who still makes a point in meetings of asking how policy proposals will affect pipefitters and construction workers in his Pennsylvania hometown, and angrily scolds advisers for using jargon those people wouldn't understand.\n\nHis top aides insist Biden's achievements have been squarely focused on improving conditions for the working class.\n\n\"I would not say that the Democratic Party has turned its back on the working class. We have had historic successes in the first year of the Biden presidency, the passage of the American Rescue Plan, to give one example, has cut child poverty in this country almost in half,\" said Susan Rice, Biden's domestic policy adviser, last week on CNN. \"We have put very important supports in the pockets of the American people at a time when the pandemic has made their economic prospects perilous.\"\n\nManaging expectations\n\nIn many ways, Biden's first year was defined by expectations getting away from him: about the trajectory of the pandemic, the durability of Trump and the ability of a governing veteran to find solutions to any of it. At junctures throughout the year, Biden appeared caught by surprise when challenges arose that, at least in retrospect, were not surprising.\n\nWhen the Taliban swiftly took control of Afghanistan in August, Biden said it happened quicker than anyone expected -- despite intelligence warnings painting a grim picture following a complete American withdrawal.\n\nPresident Joe Biden pauses as he listens to a question about the bombings at the Kabul airport that killed at least 12 U.S. service members, from the East Room of the White House in August 2021.\n\nWhen France erupted in anger following his deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, Biden said he thought someone had given Paris a heads up that their own agreement to provide conventional subs was off -- even though no one had.\n\nWhen Biden said in June that inflation would \"pop up a little bit and then go back down,\" he was discounting warnings from veterans of Democratic administrations of a more serious trend -- one that continues six months later.\n\nAnd when testing shortages at the start of the latest Covid surge caused mile-long lines, Biden said he wished he'd thought of ordering millions more tests earlier -- even though health experts have been warning for months of a looming shortage.\n\nRepeatedly appearing caught off-guard by events undercut Biden's promise of restoring competence to government and predictability on the world stage and led to accusations he was being poorly served by his team. It belied a President who, behind the scenes, solicits a wide range of opinions on critical issues and engages a panel of advisers inside and outside government. The process has sometimes delayed critical decisions, giving the impression of indecisiveness.\n\nAfter the harrowing Afghanistan ordeal, there were calls to fire his national security adviser Jake Sullivan. Others have urged Biden to replace his Covid response coordinator Jeff Zients. After publicly sinking prospects for quick passage of the Build Back Better plan, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia vented frustration at White House staff he said drove him to his \"wit's end.\"\n\nWhether Biden plans to replace anyone in the new year remains to be seen; he is a known deliberator and hasn't executed any major personnel changes since taking office. The advisers he continues to rely upon most -- chief of staff Ron Klain and senior advisers Mike Donilon, Bruce Reed and Steve Ricchetti -- have worked for him for decades.\n\nBut that doesn't mean there aren't voices advocating for changes in the West Wing.\n\n\"If I was down [this much] in my ratings, I'd have a new chief of staff,\" one prominent Democrat who speaks regularly with Biden said.\n\nA struggle to adjust\n\nThe pandemic has not been the only factor contributing to an uneasy transition to White House life. After spending eight years haunting the West Wing, Biden had only been upstairs to the private presidential residence once during his time as vice president.\n\nWhen he moved into the executive mansion last year, staff crowded him at awkward hours, including in the early mornings. Someone was always just outside the door or walking quietly through the hallways. It was a way of life Biden wasn't accustomed to -- and did not enjoy.\n\nAttempts to make the place feel more like home had mixed results. Some of the furniture from his home in Delaware made its way to the White House. Books and family photographs adorn shelves and tables that previously held antiques from the White House collection. But the family German Shepherd Major was dispatched permanently to a friend's house after a series of nipping incidents (a new puppy, Commander , arrived late last year).\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, look at their new dog Commander, after speaking virtually with military service members to thank them for their service and wish them a Merry Christmas, from the South Court Auditorium of the White House in Washington, DC.\n\nOver the course of the year, Biden and the first lady requested some changes. No longer are chefs or Secret Service agents posted in the private kitchen on his third-floor residence during breakfast hours; instead, he can wander in wearing a bathrobe and pour himself a bowl of Special K cereal before lifting weights in the residence gym.\n\nWaiting for him in the morning is a notecard with his schedule for the day, which Biden marks with checks as each meeting is completed, and a stapled-together compilation of daily news clips called \"The Bulletin.\" He packs it all in a worn leather briefcase to carry with him downstairs to the office.\n\nA focus on the familiar has extended beyond the White House. When Biden met Putin in Geneva last summer, an aide made sure to bring along a bottle of orange Gatorade, the President's preferred drink. And even when he is traveling, Biden places daily phone calls to his grandchildren, who remain at the center of his personal life.\n\nThe third time was a charm in Biden's quest for the presidency, with a triumph in 2020 after falling well short in the campaigns of 1988 and 2008. The question that many of his longtime admirers raise in quiet conversations is whether Biden still approaches the job and, in fact, Washington in the same way he might have decades ago.\n\nThere's little question that the outcome of his second year -- and his ability to spark a turnaround, as many presidents before him have -- will help shape how Biden answers the biggest question of all, likely by this time next year: whether he will run again in 2024.", "authors": ["Jeff Zeleny", "Kevin Liptak", "Kaitlan Collins"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/08/vice-presidential-debate-full-transcript-mike-pence-and-kamala-harris/5920773002/", "title": "Vice presidential debate: Full transcript of Mike Pence and Kamala ...", "text": "This is a transcript of the 90-minute debate between Vice President Mike Pence and vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris. It was moderated by USA TODAY's Susan Page. The time stamp is the length of time into the debate each person began their statement.\n\n00:01 PAGE\n\nGood evening. From the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2020, sponsored by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. I’m Susan Page of USA TODAY. It is my honor to moderate this debate, an important part of our democracy. In Kingsbury Hall tonight we have a small and socially distant audience and we've taken extra precautions during this pandemic. Among other things, everyone in the audience is required to wear a face mask and the candidates will be seated 12 feet apart. The audience is enthusiastic about their candidates, but they've agreed to express that enthusiasm, only twice. At the end of the debate and now when I introduce the candidates. Please welcome California Senator Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nPENCE\n\nThank you.\n\n01:05 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris and Vice President Pence thank you for being here. We're meeting as President Trump and the First Lady continue to undergo treatment in Washington after testing positive for COVID-19. We send our thoughts and prayers to them for their rapid and complete recovery and for the recovery of everyone afflicted by the coronavirus. The two campaigns in the Commission on Presidential Debates have agreed to the ground rules for tonight. I'm here to enforce them on behalf of the millions of Americans who are watching. One note, no one in either campaign, or at the commission or anywhere else has been told in advance what topics will raise or what questions I’ll ask. This ninety-minute debate will be divided into nine segments of about 10 minutes each. I'll begin the segment by posing a question to each of you, sometimes the same question, sometimes a different question on the same topic. You will then have two minutes to answer, without interruption by me or the other candidate. Then we'll take six minutes or so to discuss the issue. At that point, although there will always be more to say, we'll move on to the next topic. We want a debate that is lively, but Americans also deserve a discussion that is civil. These are tumultuous times, but we can and will have a respectable exchange about the big issues facing our nation. Let's begin with the ongoing pandemic that has caused our country so much. Senator Harris, the coronavirus is not under control. Over the past week, Johns Hopkins reports that 39 states have had more COVID cases over the past seven days than in the week before. Nine states have set new records. Even if a vaccine is released soon, the next administration will face hard choices. What would a Biden administration do in January and February that a Trump administration wouldn't do? Would you impose new lockdowns for businesses and schools in hotspots? A federal mandate to wear masks? You have two minutes to respond, without interruption.\n\n03:15 HARRIS\n\nThank you Susan. Well, the American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country. And here are the facts. 210,000 dead people in our country in just the last several months. Over 7 million people who have contracted this disease. One in five businesses closed. We're looking at frontline workers who have been treated like sacrificial workers. We are looking at over 30 million people who in the last several months had to file for unemployment. And here's the thing, on January 28, the vice president and the president were informed about the nature of this pandemic. They were informed that it's lethal in consequence, that it is airborne, that it will affect young people and that it would be contracted because it is airborne. And they knew what was happening, and they didn't tell you. Can you imagine if you knew on January 28, as opposed to March 13, what they knew what you might have done to prepare? They knew and they covered it up. The president said it was a hoax. They minimized the seriousness of it. The president said you're on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask, you’re on the other side of his ledger if you don't. And in spite of all of that, today they still don't have a plan. They still don't have a plan. Well, Joe Biden does. And our plan is about what we need to do around a national strategy for contact tracing, for testing, for administration of the vaccine and making sure that it will be free for all. That is the plan that Joe Biden has and that I have, knowing that we have to get a hold of what has been going on and we need to save our country. And Joe Biden is the best leader to do that and frankly, this administration has forfeited their right to reelection, based on this.\n\n05:21 PAGE\n\nThank you- Thank you, Senator Harris. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, more than 210,000 Americans have died of COVID-19 since February. The US death toll as a percentage of our population is higher than that of almost every other wealthy nation on Earth. For instance, our death rate is two and a half times that of Canada, next door. You head the administration's Coronavirus Task Force. Why is the U.S. death toll, as a percentage of our population, higher than that of almost every other wealthy country? And you have two minutes to respond, without interruption.\n\n05:55 PENCE\n\nSusan Thank you. And I want to thank the Commission and the University of Utah for hosting this event. And Senator Harris, it's a privilege to be on the stage with you. Our nation has gone through a very challenging time this year. But I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of Americans first. Before there were more than five cases in the United States, all people who had returned from China, President Donald Trump did what no other American president had ever done. And that was he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Senator Joe Biden, Biden opposed that decision. He said it was xenophobic and hysterical, but I can tell you, having led the White House Coronavirus Task Force, that that decision alone by President Trump bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II. And I believe it’s saved hundreds of thousands of American lives. Because with that time we were able to reinvent testing. More than 115 million tests have been done to date. We were able to see to the delivery of billions of supplies so our doctors and nurses had the resources and support they needed. And we began, really before the month of February it was hard to develop a vaccine and to develop medicines and therapeutics that’ve been saving lives all along the way. And under President Trump's leadership, Operation Warp Speed, we believe, will have literally 10s of millions of doses of a vaccine before the end of this year. The reality is, when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way. And quite frankly, when I look at their plan that talks about advancing testing, creating new PPE, developing a vaccine, umm, it looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about. I think the American people know that this is a president who has put the health of America first and the American people, I believe with my heart, can be proud of the sacrifices they have made. It’s saved countless American lives.\n\n08:05 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice Pres- Thank you Vice President Pence- Thank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris, would you like to respond?\n\n08:11 HARRIS\n\nOh, absolutely. Whatever the Vice President's claiming the administration has done, clearly it hasn't worked when you're looking at over 210,000 dead bodies in our country, American lives that have been lost, families that are grieving that loss. And you know, the vice president is the head of the task force and knew, on January 28, how serious this was. And then, big thanks to Bob Woodward, we learned that they knew about it. And then when that was exposed, the vice president said when asked ‘Well, why didn’t y'all tell anybody?’, he said ‘Because the president wanted people to remain calm’.\n\nPAGE\n\nWell, let's go –\n\nHARRIS\n\nNo, I – Susan, I – This is important –\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan, I have to weigh in here –\n\n08:53 HARRIS\n\nMr. Vice President, I’m speaking.\n\nPENCE\n\nI have to weigh in –\n\nHARRIS\n\nI'm speaking. I wanna –\n\n08:58 PAGE\n\nYou have 15 more more seconds and then we'll give the vice president a chance to respond.\n\n09:01 HARRIS\n\nThank you. So I want to ask the American people, how calm were you when you were panicked about where you're going to get your next roll of toilet paper? How calm were you when your kids were sent home from school and you didn't know when they could go back?\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you. Thank you, Sen Harris –\n\nHARRIS\n\nHow calm were you when your children couldn't see your parents because you were afraid they could kill them?\n\n09:19 PAGE\n\nLet’s give Vice President Pence a chance to respond. Vice President Pence, you have one minute to respond.\n\n09:22 PENCE\n\nYou know there's not a day gone by that I haven’t thought of every American family that’s lost a loved one. And I want all of you to know that you'll always be in our hearts and in our prayers. But when you say what the American people have done over these last eight months hasn't worked, that's a great disservice to the sacrifices the American people have made.\n\nHARRIS\n\nI’m referring to your president.\n\nPENCE\n\nThe reality – If I may, if I may finish, Senator. The reality is Dr. Fauci said everything that he told the President in the Oval Office, the president told the American people. Now President Trump I will tell you his boundless confidence in the American people and he always spoke with confidence that we'll get through this together. But when you say it hasn't worked- When Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Birks and our medical experts came to us in the second week of March, they said if the President didn't take the unprecedented step of shutting down roughly half of the American economy that we could lose 2.2 million Americans. But that's the reality.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you. Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\nThey also said to us if we did everything right, Susan, we could still lose more than 200,000 Americans.\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\nNow, one life lost is too many, Susan.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you –\n\nPENCE\n\nBut the American people, I believe, deserve credit for the sacrifices that they have made, putting the health of their family and their neighbors first, our doctors our nurses, our first responders –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– and I'm going to speak up on behalf of what the American people have done.\n\n10:43 PAGE\n\nVice President Pence, you in the front row in a Rose Garden event 11 days ago, at what seems to have been a super-spreader event for senior administration and congressional officials, no social distancing, few masks, and now a cluster of coronavirus cases among those who were there. How can you expect Americans to follow the administration safety guidelines to protect themselves from COVID when you were at the White House have not been doing so?\n\n11:10 PENCE\n\nWell, the American people have demonstrated over the last eight months that when given the facts they're willing to put the health of their families, and their neighbors and people they don't even know first. President Trump and I have great confidence in the American people and their ability to take that information and put it into practice. In the height of the epidemic, when we were losing a heartbreaking number of 2,500 Americans a day, we surged resources to New Jersey, and New York, and New Orleans and Detroit. We told the American people what needed to be done and the American people made the sacrifices. When the outbreak in the Sunbelt happened this summer, again, Americans stepped forward. But the reality is the work of the President of the United States goes on. A vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States has come upon us and the president introduced Judge Amy Coney Barrett –\n\nPAGE\n\nYes, thank you- Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\n12:05 PENCE\n\nAt that- If I may say, that Rose Garden Event, there’s been a great deal of speculation about it. My wife Karen and I were there and honored to be there. Many of the people who were at that event, Susan, actually were tested for coronavirus. And it was an outdoor event, which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advise, the difference here is President Trump and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interest of their health. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris consistently talk about mandates, and not not just mandates with the coronavirus but a government takeover of health, the Green New Deal –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you- Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– all government control. We're about freedom and respecting the freedom of the American people.\n\n12:46 HARRIS\n\nLet's talk about respecting the American people. You respect the American people when you tell them the truth. You respect the American people when you have the courage to be a leader –\n\nPENCE\n\nWhich we’ve always done –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– speaking of those things that you may not want people to hear but they need to hear so they can protect themselves. But this administration stood on information that if you had as a parent, if you had as a worker knowing you didn't have enough money saved up, and now you're standing in a food line because of the ineptitude of administration that was unwilling to speak the truth to the American people. So let's talk about caring about the American people. The American people who have had to sacrifice far too much because of the incompetence of this administration. It is asking too much of the people –\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan, we talked about the American people –\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– It is asking too much of the people that they would not be equipped with the information they need to help themselves to protect their parents and their children.\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan, the president –\n\n13:39 PAGE\n\nNo, I’m sorry. Kamala Harris – Senator Harris, I mean. I'm sorry.\n\nHARRIS\n\nIt’s fine. I’m Kamala.\n\nPAGE\n\nNo, no, you’re Senator Harris to me. For life to get back to normal Dr. Anthony Fauci and other experts say that most of the people who can be vaccinated need to be vaccinated, but half of Americans now say they wouldn't take a vaccine if it was released now. If the Trump administration approves a vaccine, before after the election, should Americans take it and would you take it?\n\n14:10 HARRIS\n\nIf the public health professionals, if Dr. Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I'll be the first in line to take it. Absolutely. But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I'm not taking it.\n\n14:21 PAGE\n\nVice President Pence, there have been a lot of repercussions from this pandemic. In recent days, the president's diagnosis of COVID-19 has underscored the importance of the job that you hold, and that you are seeking. That's our second topic tonight, it's the role of the vice president. One of you will make history on January 20, you will be the vice president to the oldest president the United States has ever had. Donald Trump will be 74-years-old on Inauguration Day. Joe Biden will be 78-years-old. That already has raised concerns among some voters, concerns that have been sharpened by President Trump's hospitalization in recent days. Vice President Pence, have you had a conversation or reached an agreement with President Trump about safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability? And if not, do you think you should? You have two minutes without interruption.\n\n15:17 PENCE\n\nWell, Susan, thank you. Although I would like to go back –\n\n15:20 PAGE\n\nWe should move on to the issue of the vice presidency –\n\n15:22 PENCE\n\nWell, thank you but, I would like to go back. Because the reality is that we're going to have a vaccine, Senator, in record time, in unheard of time, in less than a year. We have five companies in phase three clinical trials. And we're right now producing 10s of millions of doses. So, the fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine if the vaccine emerges during the Trump administration, I think is unconscionable. And Senator, I just asked you, stop playing politics with people's lives. The reality is that we will have a vaccine, we believe, before the end of this year, and it will have the capacity to save countless American lives. And your continuous undermining of confidence in a vaccine is just, it's just unacceptable. And let me also say, you know the reality is when you talk about, about failure in this administration, we actually do know what failure looks like in a pandemic. It was 2009. The Swine Flu arrived in the United States. Thankfully, it was, ended up not being as lethal as the coronavirus. But before the end of the year, when Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States, not seven and a half million people contracted the swine flu, 60 million Americans contracted the swine flu. If the swine flu had been as lethal as the coronavirus in 2009 when Joe Biden was vice president, we would have lost 2 million American lives. His own Chief of Staff Ron Klain would say last year that it was pure luck. That they did “everything possible wrong”. And we learned from that. They left the Strategic National Stockpile empty. They left an empty and hollow plan, but we still learned from it. And I think –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence – Vice President Pence, your time is up –\n\n17:19 PENCE\n\n– the American people, I’m gonna say again, can be proud of what we done--\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence, I’m sorry. Your time is up-- Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– and, Senator, please stop undermining confidence in a vaccine.\n\n17:26 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris, let me ask you the same question that I asked Vice President Pence, which is have you had a conversation, or reached an agreement with Vice President Biden, about safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability? And if not, and if you win the election next month, do you think you should? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n17:47 HARRIS\n\nSo let me tell you first of all, on the day I got the call from Joe Biden, it was actually a Zoom call, asking me to serve with him on this ticket was probably one of the most memorable, memorable days in my life. I, you know, I thought about my mother, who came to the United States at the age of 19, gave birth to me at the age of 25 at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California. And the thought that I'd be sitting here right now I know would make her proud and she must be looking down on this. You know Joe and I were raised in a very similar way. We were raised with values that are about hard work, about the value and the dignity of public service and about the importance of fighting for the dignity of all people. And I think Joe asked me to serve with him because I have a career that included being elected the first woman District Attorney of San Francisco, where I created models of innovation for law enforcement, in terms of reform of the criminal justice system. I was elected the first woman of color, and black woman, to be elected Attorney General of the state of California, where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice. There I took on everything from transnational criminal organizations, to the big banks that were taking advantage of homeowners, to for profit colleges that were taking advantage of veterans. And then, of course, now I serve in the United States Senate as only the second black woman ever elected to the United States Senate. I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee where I've been in regular receipt of classified information about threats to our nation and hotspots around the world. I've traveled the world. I've met with our soldiers in our, in war zones. And I think Joe has asked me to serve with him because he knows that we share, we share a purpose, which is about lifting up the American people. And after the four years that we have seen of Donald Trump, unifying our country around our common values and principles.\n\n19:51 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris. You know neither, neither President Trump nor Vice President Biden has released the sort of detailed health information that had become the modern norm until the 2016 election. And in recent days, President Trump's doctors have given misleading answers or refused to answer basic questions about his health. And my question to each of you, in turn, is, is this information voters deserve to know? Vice President Pence, would you like to go first?\n\n20:18 PENCE\n\nWell, Susan, thank you. And let me, let me say on behalf of the president and the First Lady, how moved we've all been by the outpouring of prayers and concern for the President. And I do believe it's emblematic of the prayers and the concern that have ushered forth for every American impacted by the coronavirus. But the care the president received at Walter Reed, White House doctors, was exceptional. And the transparency that they practiced all along, they will continue because the American people have a right to know about the health and well-being of their President. And we'll continue to do that. But I'm just extremely grateful and was more than, more than a little moved by the broad and bipartisan support. And, Senator, I want to thank you and Joe Biden for your expressions and genuine concern. And I also want to congratulate you, as I did on that phone call, on the historic nature of your nomination.\n\nHARRIS\n\nThank you.\n\nPENCE\n\nI never expected to be on this stage four years ago so I know the feeling. But the reality is, we've got an election before the American people, in the midst of this challenging year, and the stakes have never been higher.\n\n21:35 PAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence. I wanna give Senator Harris a chance to respond to the same question I asked, which is do voters have a right to know more detailed health information about presidential candidates, and especially about presidents, especially when they're facing some kind of challenge?\n\n21:50 HARRIS\n\nAbsolutely. And that's why Joe Biden has been so incredibly transparent. And certainly, by contrast, the President has not, both in terms of health records, but also let's look at taxes. We now know because of great investigative journalism that Donald Trump paid $750 in taxes. When I first heard about it, I literally said “You mean $750,000?”. And it was like no, $750. We now know Donald Trump owes and is in debt for $400 million. And just so everyone is clear, when we say in debt it means you owe money to somebody. And i'd be really good to know who the President of the United States, the Commander in Chief, owes money to because the American people have a right to know what is influencing the president's decisions. And is he making those decisions on the best interest of the American people, of you, or self interest. So, Susan, I'm glad you asked about transparency, because it has to be across the board. Joe has been incredibly transparent over many, many years. The one thing we all know about Joe, he puts it all out there. He, he is honest. He is forthright. But Donald Trump on the other hand, has been about covering up everything.\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan –\n\n23:09 PENCE\n\nThank – Thanks – Thank you, Senator Harris. I want to give you a chance to respond, Vice President.\n\n23:13 PENCE\n\nWell, look, I respect the fact that Joe Biden spent 47 years in public life. I respect your public service as well.\n\nHARRIS\n\nThank you.\n\nPENCE\n\nBut the American people have a president who is a businessman, he’s a job-creator. He’s paid 10s of millions of dollars in taxes, payroll taxes, property taxes. He's created 10s of thousands of American jobs. The president said those public reports are not accurate. And the President also released, literally, stacks of financial disclosures the American people can review just as the law allows. But the distinction here is that Joe Biden, 47 years in public service, compared to President Donald Trump, who brought all of that experience four years ago--\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President –\n\nPENCE\n\n– and turned this economy around by cutting taxes, rolling back regulation, unleashing American energy-\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\n24:04 PENCE\n\n– fighting for free and fair trade, and all of the is on the line –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\n24:08 PENCE\n\n– if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are in the White House.\n\nPAGE\n\nYou know, that's a good segue into our third topic--\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat’s a great segue.\n\nPAGE\n\n– which is about the economy. This has been another aspect of life for Americans that's been so affected by this coronavirus. We have a jobs crisis brewing. On Friday, we learned that the unemployment rate had declined to 7.9% in September, but the job growth had stalled, and that was before the latest round of layoffs and furloughs in the airline industry, at Disney and elsewhere. Hundreds of thousands of discouraged workers have stopped looking to work. Nearly 11 million jobs that existed at the beginning of the year, haven't been replaced. Those hardest hit include latinos, blacks and women. Senator Harris, the Biden Harris campaign has proposed new programs to boost the economy and you would pay for that new spending by raising $4 trillion in taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations. Some economists warn that could curb entrepreneurial ventures that fuel growth and create jobs. Would raising taxes for the recovery at risk? And you have two minutes to answer, uninterrupted.\n\n25:16 HARRIS\n\nThank you. On the issue of the economy, I think there couldn't be a more fundamental difference between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden believes you measure the health and the strength of America's economy based on the health, and the strength of the American worker and the American family. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who measures the strength of the economy based on how rich people are doing. Which is why he passed a tax bill benefitting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America, leading to a $2 trillion deficit that the American people are gonna have to pay for. On day one, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill. He'll get rid of it. And what he'll do with the money is invested in the American people. And through a plan that is about investing in infrastructure, something that Donald Trump said he would do. I remember hearing about some infrastructure week. I don't think it ever happened. But Joe Biden will do that. He'll invest in infrastructure. It's about upgrading our roads and bridges, but also investing in clean energy and renewable energy. Joe is gonna invest that money in what we need to do around innovation. There was a time when our country believed in science and invested in research and development so that we were an innovation leader on the globe. Joe Biden will use that money to invest in education. So for example, for folks who want to go to a two year Community College, it will be free. If you come from a family that makes less than $125,000, you'll go to a public university for free. And across the board, we'll make sure that if you have student loan debt it's cut by $10,000. That's how Joe Biden thinks about the economy, which is it’s about investing in the people of our country, as opposed to passing a tax bill, which had the benefit of letting American corporations go offshore to do their business.\n\n27:09 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris.\n\nHARRIS\n\nYou're welcome\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence, your administration has been predicting a rapid and robust recovery, but the latest economic report suggests that's not happening. Should Americans be braced for an economic comeback that is going to take not months, but a year or more? You have two minutes to answer, uninterrupted.\n\n27:27 PENCE\n\nWhen President Trump and I took office, America had gone through the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. When Joe Biden was vice president they tried to tax, and spend, and regulate, and bail our way back to a growing economy. President Trump cut taxes, across the board. Despite what Senator Harris says, the average American family of four had $2,000 in savings in taxes. And with the rise in wages that occurred, most predominantly for blue-collar, hard working Americans, the average household income for a family of four increased by $4,000 following President Trump's tax cuts. But America, you just heard Senator Harris tell you, on day one Joe Biden's gonna raise your taxes. It's really remarkable to think, Susan –\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat’s not what I said.\n\nPENCE\n\n– I mean, right after a time where we're going through a pandemic that lost 22 million jobs at the height, we've already added back 11.6 million jobs because we had a president who cut taxes, rollback regulation, unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade, and secured $4 trillion from the Congress of the United States to give direct payments to families, saved 50 million jobs through the paycheck protection program. We literally have spared no expense to help the American people and the American worker through this. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to raise taxes. They want to bury our economy under a $2 trillion Green New Deal, which you were one of the original co-sponsors of in the United States Senate. They want to abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking, which would cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs all across the Heartland. And Joe Biden wants to go back to the economic surrender to China that when we took office, half of our international trade deficit was with China alone. And Joe Biden wants to repeal all of the tariffs that President Trump put into effect to fight for American jobs and American workers. Joe Biden says democracy's on the ballot. Make no mistake about it, Susan. The American economy, the American comeback is on the ballot with four more years of growth and opportunity –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– with four more years of President Donald Trump. 2020 economic year in the history of this country.\n\n29:36 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence – Thank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris?\n\n29:41 HARRIS\n\nWell, I mean, I thought we saw enough of it in last week's debate, but I think this is supposed to be a debate based on fact and truth. And the truth of the fact is, Joe Biden has been very clear. He will not raise taxes on anybody who makes less than $400,000 a year –\n\nPENCE\n\nHe said he’s gonna appeal the Trump tax cuts –\n\nHARRIS\n\nMr. Vice President I’m speaking.\n\nPENCE\n\nWell –\n\n29:57 HARRIS\n\nI’m speaking.\n\n29:59 PENCE\n\n– it’d be important if you said the truth. Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week that he's going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. That was tax cuts that gave the average working family $2,000 in a tax break every single year –\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat is – That is absolutely not true –\n\nPENCE\n\n– Senator, that’s the math –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– that tax bill –\n\nPENCE\n\nIs he only gonna repeal part of the Trump tax cuts?\n\n30:19 HARRIS\n\nIf you don't mind letting me finish –\n\nPENCE\n\nPlease\n\nHARRIS\n\nWe can then have a conversation. Okay?\n\nPENCE\n\nPlease\n\nHARRIS\n\nOkay. Joe Biden will not raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. He has been very clear about that. Joe Biden will not end fracking. He has been very clear about that. Joe Biden is the one who during the Great Recession was responsible for the Recovery Act that brought America back. And now the Trump Pence Administration wants to take credit when they ran when they rode the coattails of Joe Biden's success for the economy that they had at the beginning of their term. Of course now the economy is a complete disaster, but Joe Biden on the one hand, did that. On the other hand you have Donald Trump, who has reigned over a recession that is being compared to the Great Depression. On the one hand you have Joe Biden, who was responsible with President Barack Obama for the Affordable Care Act, which brought health care to over 20 million Americans and protected people with pre existing conditions and what it also did is it saved those families, who otherwise were going bankrupt because of hospital bills they could not afford. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who is in court right now trying to get rid of –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which means that you will lose protections, if you have pre-existing conditions. And I just, this is very important, Susan –\n\nPAGE\n\nYes, well we need to give – We need to give Vice President –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– and it's just – He interrupted me and I'd like to just finish, please. If you have a pre-existing condition, heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, they're coming for you. If you love someone who has a pre existing condition –\n\nPENCE\n\nNonsense\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Senator Harris –\n\nPENCE\n\nThat’s nonsense\n\nHARRIS\n\n– they’re coming for you. If you are under the age of 26 on your parents coverage, they're coming for you.\n\n32:09 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris, thank you.\n\nHARRIS\n\nYour welcome\n\nPAGE\n\nLet me give you a chance to respond.\n\n32:12 PENCE\n\nWell I hope we have a chance to talk about health care because Obamacare was a disaster and the American people remember it well. President Trump and I have plans to improve health care and to protect, protect pre-existing conditions for every American. But look, Senator Harris, you're entitled to your own opinion but you're not entitled to your own facts –\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat’s a good line\n\nPENCE\n\nYou yourself said on multiple occasions when you were running for president that you would ban fracking. Joe Biden looked his supporter in the eye and pointed and said “I guarantee, I guarantee that we will abolish fossil fuels”. We have a $2 trillion version of the Green New Deal, Susan, that your newspaper USA TODAY said really wasn't that very different from the original Green New Deal. More taxes, more regulation, banning fracking, abolishing fossil fuel, crushing American energy and economic surrender to China is a prescription for economic decline. President Trump and I will keep America growing. The V-shape recovery that's underway right now will continue with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.\n\n33:20 PAGE\n\nThank you very, very much, Vice President Pence. Once again you provided the perfect segue to a new topic, which is climate change. And Vice President Pence, I'd like to pose the first question to you. This year we've seen record-setting hurricanes in the south. Another one, Hurricane Delta is now threatening the gulf. And we have seen record-setting wildfires in the West. Do you believe, as the scientific community has concluded, that man-made climate change has made wildfires bigger, hotter and more deadly? And it made hurricanes wetter, slower and more damaging? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n33:57 PENCE\n\nThank you Susan. Well first, I'm very proud of our record on the environment and on conservation. According to all of the best estimates, our, our air and land are cleaner than any time ever recorded. And our water is among the cleanest in the world. Just a little while ago, the president signed the Outdoors Act, the largest investment in our public lands and public parks in 100 years. So, President Trump has made a commitment to conservation and to the environment. Now with regard to climate change, the climate is changing. But the issue is, what's the cause and what do we do about it. President Trump has made it clear that we're going to continue to listen to the science. Now Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, would put us back in the Paris Climate Accord. They'd impose the Green New Deal, which would crush American energy, would increase the energy cost of American families in their homes and literally would crush American jobs. President Trump and I believe that the progress that we have made in a cleaner environment has been happening precisely because we have a strong free market economy. You know what's remarkable is the United States has reduced CO2 more than the countries that are still in the Paris Climate Accord, but we've done it through innovation. And we've done it through natural gas and fracking, which, Senator, the American people can go look at the record. I know Joe Biden says otherwise now, as you do, but the both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and banning fracking.\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat’s not true\n\nPENCE\n\nAnd so by creating the kind of American innovation, we're actually steering toward a stronger and better environment. With regard to wildfires, President Trump and I believe that forest management has to be front and center, and even governor Gavin Newsome from your state has agreed we've got to work on forest management. And with regard to hurricanes, the National Oceanic Administration tells us that actually as, as difficult as they are –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President –\n\nPENCE\n\n– there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you –\n\nPENCE\n\n– but many of the climate alarmists use hurricanes and wildfires to try and –\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence, I’m sorry ,your time is up – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– sell the good of a Green New Deal. And President Trump and I are gonna always put American jobs and American workers first.\n\n36:14 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris, as the Vice President mentioned, you co-sponsored the Green New Deal in Congress, but Vice President Biden said in last week's debate that he does not support the Green New Deal. But if you look at the Biden Harris campaign website it describes the Green New Deal as a crucial framework. What exactly would be the stance of a Biden Harris Administration toward the green New Deal? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n36:43 HARRIS\n\nAlright, so first of all, I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. That is a fact. I will repeat that Joe Biden has been very clear that he thinks about growing jobs, which is why he will not increase taxes for anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. Joe Biden's economic plan Moody's, which is a reputable Wall Street firm, has said will create 7 million more jobs than Donald Trump's. And part of those jobs, that will be created by Joe Biden, are going to be about clean energy and renewable energy. Because you see, Joe understands that the West Coast of our country is burning, including my home state of California. Joe sees what is happening on the Gulf states, which are being battered by storms. Joe has seen and talked with the farmers in Iowa, whose entire crops have been destroyed because of floods. And so Joe believes, again, in science. I'll tell you something, Susan, I served, when I first got to the Senate, on the committee that's responsible for the environment. Do you know this administration took the word science off the website? And then took the phrase climate change off the website? This-- We have seen a pattern with this administration which is they don't believe in science. And Joe's plan is about saying we're going to deal with it, but we're also going to create jobs. Donald Trump, when asked about the wildfires in California and the question was, you know, the science is telling us this ,you know what Donald Trump said? Science doesn't know. So, let's talk about who is prepared to lead our country over the course of the next four years on what is an existential threat to us as human beings. Joe is about saying we're going to invest that in renewable energy, we're going to be about the creation of millions of jobs, we will achieve net zero emissions by 2050, carbon neutral by 2035-- Joe has a plan. This has been a lot of talk from the Trump administration, and really it has been to go backward instead of forward. We will also reenter the climate agreement with pride.\n\n38:57 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris just said that climate change is an existential threat. Vice President Pence, do you believe that climate change poses an existential threat?\n\n39:07 PENCE\n\nAs I said, Susan, the climate is changing. We’ll follow the science, but, once again, Senator Harris is denying the fact that they're gonna raise taxes on every American. Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week that on day one he was going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. Those tax cuts delivered $2,000 in tax relief to the average family of four across America. And with regard to banning fracking, I just recommend that people look at the record. You yourself said repeatedly that you would ban fracking. You were the first senate co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. And while Joe Biden denied the Green New Deal, Susan, thank you for pointing out, the Green New Deal is on their campaign website. And as USA TODAY said, it's essentially the same plan as you co-sponsored with AOC when she submitted it in the Senate. And you just heard the senator say that she's going to resubmit America to the Paris Climate Accord. Look, the American people have always cherished our environment. We will continue to cherish it. We've made great progress reducing CO2 emissions through American innovation and the development of natural gas and fracking. We don't need a massive, $2 trillion Green New Deal that would oppose all new mandates American businesses and American families, Joe Biden wants to retrofit 4 million--\n\n40:31 PAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\n40:32 PENCE\n\n– American business buildings. It makes no sense. It will cost jobs. President Trump –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– he’s gonna put America first. He's going to put jobs first and take care of our environment and follow the science.\n\n40:45 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nHARRIS\n\nOn the issue of jobs –\n\nPAGE\n\nSenator Harris\n\nHARRIS\n\nLet's talk about that. You, the Vice President earlier referred to, as part of what he thinks is an accomplishment, the President's trade war with China. You lost that trade war. You lost it. What ended up happening is, because of a so called trade war with China, America lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs. Farmers have experienced bankruptcy, because of it. We are in a manufacturing recession, because of it. And when we look at this administration has been, there are estimates that by the end of the term of this administration, they will have lost more jobs than almost any other presidential administration –\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– And the American people know what I'm talking about. You know. I think about 20-year-olds, you know we have a 20-year-old, 20-something-year-old, who are coming out of high school and college right now and you're wondering, “Is there going to be a job there for me?”. We're looking at people who are trying to figure out how they're going to pay rent by the end of the month. Almost half of American renters are worried about whether they're going to be able to pay rent by the end of the month. This is where the economy is in America right now and it is because of the catastrophe and the failure of leadership of this administration.\n\n42:10 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me give you just 15 seconds to respond because then I want to move on.\n\n42:15 PENCE\n\nWell, I'd love to respond. Lose the trade war with China? Joe Biden never fought it. Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for Communist China through over the last several decades. And, and again, Senator Harris, you're entitled to your opinion, you're not entitled to your own facts. When Joe Biden was vice president, we lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs and President Obama said they were never coming back. He said we needed a magic wand to bring them back. In our first three years, after we cut taxes, rolled back regulation –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– unleashed American energy, this administration saw 500,000 jobs created –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– And that's exactly the kind of growth we're going to continue to see as we bring our nation through this pandemic –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– your Green New Deal, your massive new mandates, your Paris Climate Accord, it's gonna kill jobs this time just like it killed jobs in the last administration.\n\n43:05 HARRIS\n\nSusan, I just need to respond very briefly, please.\n\nPAGE\n\n15 seconds and then we’ll move on.\n\nHARRIS\n\nThank you. Thank you. Joe Biden is responsible for saving America's auto industry and you voted against it. So let's set the record straight. Thank you.\n\n43:19 PAGE\n\nI'd like to talk about China. We have, as our next topic, we have no more complicated or consequential foreign relationship than the one with China. It is a huge market for American agricultural goods. It’s a potential partner in dealing with climate change and North Korea. And in a video tonight, President Trump again blamed it for the coronavirus, saying “China will pay.” Vice President Pence, how would you describe our, our fundamental relationship with China? Competitors? Adversaries? Enemies? You have two minutes.\n\n43:53\n\nThank you Susan. Well let me, before I leave that, let me, let me speak to voting records, if I can. You know, everybody knows that NAFTA costs literally thousands of American factories to close. We saw automotive jobs going south of the border. President Trump fought to renegotiate NAFTA, and the United States, Mexico, Canada agreement is now the law of the land. American people deserve to know Senator Kamala Harris was one of only 10 members of the Senate to vote against the USMCA. It was a huge win for American auto workers. It was a huge win for American farmers, especially dairy in the upper Midwest. But, Senator, you said it didn't go far enough on climate change, that you put your, your radical environmental agenda ahead of American auto workers and ahead of American jobs. I think the American people deserve to know that. It's probably why Newsweek magazine said that, that Kamala Harris was the most liberal member of the United States Senate in 2019, more liberal than Bernie Sanders, more, more liberal than any of the others in the United States Senate. So, now with regard to China, Susan, first and foremost -- China is to blame for the coronavirus. And President Trump is not happy about it. He's made that very clear. He made it clear again today. China and the World Health Organization did not play straight with the American people. They did not let our personnel into China to get information on the coronavirus until the middle of February. Fortunately, President Trump, in dealing with China from the outset of this administration -- standing up to China, that had been taking advantage of America for decades -- in the wake of Joe Biden's cheerleading for China, President Trump made that decision before the end of January to suspend all travel from China. And again, the American people deserve to know, Joe Biden opposed President Trump's decision to suspend all travel to China. He said it was hysterical, he said it was xenophobic –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence – Vice President Pence, your time is up –\n\n45:56 PENCE\n\n– but President Trump has stood up to China and will continue to stand strong.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\nWe want to improve the relationship, but we're going to level the playing field and we’re going to hold China accountable for what they did to America with the coronavirus\n\n46:09 PAGE\n\nThank you. Senator Harris, I’m going to ask you the same question that I asked the Vice President. How would you describe our fundamental relationship with China? Are we competitors, adversaries, enemies? You'll have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n46:24 HARRIS\n\nSusan, the Trump administration's perspective, and approach to China has resulted in the loss of American lives, American jobs and America's standing. There is a weird obsession that President Trump has had with getting rid of whatever accomplishment was achieved by President Obama and Vice President Biden. For example, they created, within the White House, and office that basically was just responsible for monitoring pandemics. They got away, they got rid of it.\n\n47:04 PENCE\n\nNot true.\n\n47:05 HARRIS\n\nThere was a team of disease experts that President Obama and Vice President Biden dispatched to China to monitor what is now predictable and what might happen. They pulled them out. We now are looking at 210,000 Americans who have lost their lives. Let's look at the job situation we mentioned before, the trade deal – the trade war, they wanted to call it – with China. It resulted in the loss of over 300 manufacturing jobs, and a manufacturing recession, and the American consumer paying thousands of dollars more for goods, because of that failed war, that they called it. And let's talk about standing. Pew, a reputable research firm, has done an analysis that shows that leaders of all of our formerly allied countries have now decided that they hold a greater esteem and respect Xi Jinping, the head of the Chinese Communist Party, than they do Donald Trump, the President of the United States, the commander in chief of the United States. This is where we are today, because of a failure of leadership by this administration.\n\n48:26 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris, we've seen changes in the role of the United States, in terms of global leadership, over the past four years – and of course times do change. What's your definition – we've seen strains with China, of course, as the Vice President mentioned, we’ve seen strains with our traditional allies in NATO and elsewhere. What is your definition of the role of American leadership in 2020?\n\n48:52 HARRIS\n\nSo, you know Joe is – I love talking with Joe about a lot of these issues, and you know, Joe, I think, he said, quite well. He says, you know, ‘Foreign policy: it might sound complicated, but really it's relationships there – just think about it as relationships. And so we know this, in our personal, professional relationships – you guys keep your word to your friends. Got to be loyal to your friends. People who have stood with you, got to stand with them. You got to know who your adversaries are, and keep them in check. But what we have seen with Donald Trump is that he has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world. Let's take for example, Russia. So, Russia – I serve on the Intelligence Committee of the United States Senate. America's intelligence community told us Russia interfered in the election of the President of the United States in 2016 and playing in 2020. Christopher Ray, the director of the FBI, said the same, but Donald Trump the commander in chief of the United States of America prefers to take the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of the American intelligence community. Look at our friends at NATO. He has walked away from agreements – you can look at the Iran nuclear deal, which now has put us in a position where we are less safe, because they are building up what might end up being a significant nuclear arsenal. We were in that deal, guys, we were in the Iran nuclear deal with friends and allies around the country, and because of Donald Trump's unilateral approach to foreign policy, coupled with his isolationism, he pulled us out and has made America less safe. So Susan, it's about relationships. And the thing that has always been part of the strength of our nation, in addition to our great military, has been that we keep our word. But Donald Trump doesn't understand that, because he doesn't understand what it means to be honest.\n\n50:54 PAGE\n\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President, you’ll have a chance to respond.\n\n50:59 PENCE\n\nWell, thank you. Well, President Trump kept his word when we moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel. When Joe Biden was vice president, they promised to do that and never did. We stood strong with our allies, but we've been demanding. NATO is now contributing more to our common defense than ever before. Thanks to President Trump's leadership, we strengthen our alliances across the Asia Pacific. And we've stood strong against those who would do us harm. You know when President Trump came into office, ISIS had captured an area of the Middle East, the size of Pennsylvania. President Trump unleashed the American military, and our armed forces destroyed the ISIS Caliphate and took down their leader al Baghdadi without one American casualty. al Baghdadi was responsible for the deaths of thousands. But notably, America's hearts today are with the family of Kayla Mueller, the parents of which are here with us tonight in Salt Lake City. Today, two of the ISIS killers responsible for Kayla Mueller's murder, were brought to justice in the United States. Jihadi John was killed on the battlefield, along with the other few. The reality is that when Joe Biden was vice president, we had an opportunity to save Kayla Mueller. Breaks my heart to reflect on it, but the military came into the Oval Office presented a plan. They said they knew where Kayla was. Baghdadi had held her for 18 months, abused her mercilessly before they killed her. But when Joe Biden was vice president, they hesitated for a month. And when Armed Forces finally went in, it was clear she’d been moved two days earlier, and her family says -- with a heart that broke the heart of every American -- that of President Donald Trump had been president, they believe Kayla would be alive today.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President.\n\nPENCE\n\nWe destroyed the ISIS caliphate. And you talk about reentering the Iran nuclear deal. I mean, the last administration transferred $1.8 billion to the leading state sponsor of terrorism –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President.\n\nPENCE\n\nPresident Donald Trump got us out of the deal, and when Qasim Soleimani was traveling to Baghdad, to harm two Americans, President Donald Trump took him out. And America is safer, our allies are safer and the Americans should know –\n\n53:27 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President. I would like to give Senator Harris a chance to respond, but not at such great length because of course there are other topics we want to talk about.\n\nHARRIS\n\nBut I would like equal time.\n\n53:36 PENCE\n\nYes. Please go ahead.\n\n53:41 HARRIS\n\nFirst of all, to the Mueller family, I know about your daughter's case, and I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. What happened to her is awful. And it should have never happened. And I know Joe feels the same way. And I know that President Obama feels the same way. But you mentioned Soleimani. Let’s start there. So, after the strike on Soleimani, there was a counter strike on our troops in Iraq. And they suffered serious brain injuries, and you know what Donald Trump dismissed them as? Headaches. And this is about a pattern of Donald Trump's, where he has referred to our men who are serving in our military, as suckers and losers. Donald Trump, who went to Arlington Cemetery, and stood above the graves of our fallen heroes and said, ‘What's in it for them?’ Because, of course, you know he only thinks about what's in it for him. Let's take what he said about John McCain. A great American hero. And Donald Trump says he doesn't deserve to be called a hero because he was a prisoner of war. Take – and this is, this is very important. When you want to talk about who is the current commander in chief, and what they care about and what they don't care about. Public reporting that Russia had bounties on the heads of American soldiers, and you know what a bounty is? Somebody puts a price on your head, and they will pay it if you are killed. And Donald Trump has talked at least six times to Vladmir Putin, and never brought up the subject. Joe Biden would never do that. Joe Biden – Joe Biden would hold Russia to account for any threat to our nation's security or to our troops who are sacrificing their lives for the sake of our democracy and our safety.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris. This is such an important issue, but we have other important issues as well and I want to make sure we have a chance.\n\nPENCE\n\nI really have to respond to that. She has –\n\n56:03 PAGE\n\nFifteen seconds, because –\n\n56:07 PENCE\n\nWell, I’ve got to have more than that.\n\nPAGE\n\nI'm sure, Mr. Vice President, that you had more time that she’s had, so far –\n\n56:11 PENCE\n\nThe slanders against President Donald Trump regarding men and women of our armed forces are absurd.\n\n56:18 PAGE\n\nI'm sorry, Vice President Pence –\n\n56:20 PENCE\n\nMy son is a captain in the United States Marine Corps, my son in law is deployed in the United States Navy. I can assure all of you with sons and daughters serving in our military, President Donald Trump not only respects but reveres all of those who served in our armed forces, and any suggestion otherwise it's ridiculous. Let me also say –\n\n56:47 PAGE\n\nVice President Pence. Vice President Pence. I didn’t – Vice President Pence – I did not create the rules for tonight. Your campaigns agreed to the rules for tonight’s debate,\n\nwith the Commission on Presidential Debates. I'm here to enforce them, which involves moving from one topic to another, giving roughly equal time to both of you, which is what I'm trying very hard to do. So I want to go ahead and move to the next topic, which is an important one, as the last topic was, and that is the Supreme Court. On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to open hearings on Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court. Senator Harris, you'll be there as a member of the committee. A confirmation would cement the court’s conservative majority, and make it likely open to more abortion restrictions, even to overturning the landmark Roe v Wade ruling. Access to abortion would then be up to the states. Vice President Pence, you're the former governor of Indiana. If Roe v Wade is overturned, what would you want Indiana to do? Would you want your home state to ban all abortions? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n57:49 PENCE\n\nThank you for the question, but I'll use a little bit of my time to respond to that very important key before. The American people deserve to know, Quasem Soleimani, the Iranian general, was responsible for the death of hundreds of American servicemembers. When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad to kill more Americans, President Trump didn't hesitate and Quasem Soleimani is gone. But you deserve to know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris actually criticized the decision to take out on Quasem Soleimani. It's really inexplicable, but with regard to Joe Biden it's explainable, because history records that Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against Osama bin Laden. It's absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American servicemembers, and that's what you have in President Donald Trump. Now with regard to the Supreme Court of the United States. Let me say, President Trump and I could not be more enthusiastic about the opportunity to see Amy Coney Barrett become Justice Amy Coney Barrett. She's a brilliant woman, and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizable American family, to the Supreme Court of the United States. And our hope is, in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Kavanaugh received with treatment from you and others. We hope she gets a fair hearing. And we particularly hope that we don't see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before. Democratic Chairman of the Judiciary Committee before, when Judge Barrett was being confirmed to the Court of Appeals, expressed concern that the “dogma of her faith lived loudly in her.” Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern. Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees, you actually attacked because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus, just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you. Thank you, Vice President, your time is up.\n\nPENCE\n\nMy hope is that when the hearing takes place, that Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be respected –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you Vice President.\n\n59:58 PENCE\n\n– treated respectfully and voted and confirmed to the Supreme Court of United States.\n\nPAGE\n\nSenator Harris, you're the senator from and former Attorney General of California. So let me ask you a parallel question to the one I posed to the vice president. If Roe v Wade is overturned, what would you want California to do? Would you want your home state to enact no restrictions on access to abortion? And you have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n1:00:21\n\nThank you, Susan. First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith. And it's insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe if elected will be only the second practicing Catholic, as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination – Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people. We are 27 days before the decision about who will it be, the next president of the United States. And you know before, when this conversation has come up, you know it's been about an election year or election time. We're literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so Joe has been very clear, as the American people are: Let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then we'll fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court. And to your point, Susan, the issues before us couldn't be more serious. There's the issue of choice, and I will always fight for a woman's right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence. But let's also look at what else is before the court. It's the Affordable Care Act. Like, literally in the midst of a public health pandemic – when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a pre-existing condition because if you contracted the virus – Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I've said it before and it bears repeating: That means that there will be no protections, if they win, for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose their coverage. It means that if you're under the age of 26, you can’t be on your parents coverage anymore. And here's the thing. The contrast couldn't be more clear. They're trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden’s saying let’s expand coverage, let's give you a choice of a public option or private coverage, let's bring down premiums, let’s lower Medicare eligibility to 60. That's true leadership.\n\n1:02:42 PAGE\n\nYou know, you mentioned earlier, Vice President Pence, that the President was committed to maintaining protections for people with pre-existing conditions and -- but you do have this court case that you are supporting, your administration is supporting, that would strike down the Affordable Care Act. The president says, President Trump says, that he's going to protect people with pre-existing conditions, but he has not explained how he will do that. So, tell us, specifically – how will your administration protect Americans with pre-existing conditions and give access to affordable insurance if the Affordable Care Act is struck down.\n\n1:03:23 PENCE\n\nWell, thank you, Susan. Let me just say, addressing your very first question, I couldn't be more proud to serve as vice president to a President who stands on a policy for the sanctity of human life. I'm pro-life. I don't apologize for it. And this is another one of those cases where there's such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion, all the way up to the moment of birth, late-term abortion. They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America. Now for our part, I would never presume how Jamie Kony Barrett would rule on the Supreme Court of the United States but we’ll continue to stand strong for the right to life. When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden gonna pack the court if judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? There have been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years, from George Washington to Barack Obama. Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases. But your party is actually openly advocating adding seats to the Supreme Court, which has had nine seats for 150 years, if you don't get your way. This is a classic case of if you can't win by the rules, you're going to change the rules. Now you've refused to answer that question, Joe Biden has refused to answer the question. I think the American people would really like to know. If Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States, are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way?\n\n1:04:58 HARRIS\n\nI'm so glad to have a little history lesson. Let's do that a little more. In 1860 –\n\n1:05:05\n\nWell, I'd like you to answer the question.\n\n1:05:06 HARRIS\n\nMr. Vice President, I’m speaking. I’m speaking. In 1864, one of the, I think, political heroes – certainly the president, and I assume to you as well, Mr. Vice President – is Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was up for reelection, and it was 27 days before the election, and a seat became open on the United States Supreme Court. Abraham Lincoln's party was in charge, not only in the White House, but the Senate. But honest Abe said it's not the right thing to do. The American people deserve to make the decision about who will be the next president of the United States, and then that person can select who will serve for a lifetime on the highest court of our land. And so Joe and I are very clear: the American people are voting right now. And it should be their decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime.\n\n1:06:09 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris and –\n\n1:06:11 PENCE\n\nWell, Susan. People are voting right now. They'd like to know if you and Joe Biden are gonna pack the Supreme Court of you don't get your way in this nomination.\n\n1:06:19 HARRIS\n\nLet's talk about that –\n\n1:06:21 PENCE\n\nOnce again, you gave a non-answer, Joe Biden gave a non-answer.\n\n1:06:25 HARRIS\n\nI’m answering now.\n\nPENCE\n\nThe people deserve a straight answer. And if you haven't figured it out yet, the straight answer is they are going to pack the Supreme Court if they somehow win this election. To the many people across this country: If you cherish our Supreme Court, if you cherish the separation of powers, you need to reject the Biden-Harris ticket come November the third and reelect President Donald Trump. We will stand by the separation powers and nine seats on the Supreme Court.\n\n1:06:51 HARRIS\n\nLet’s talk about packing the court then. Let's talk about.\n\nPENCE\n\nPlease –\n\nHARRIS\n\nYeah, I’m about to. So, the Trump-Pence administration has been – because I sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Susan, as you mentioned. And I've witnessed the appointments, for lifetime appointments to the federal courts, district courts, Courts of Appeal -- people who are purely ideological people who have been reviewed by legal professional organizations and found to be not competent, are substandard. And do you know that of the 50 people who President Trump appointed to the Court of Appeals for lifetime appointments, not one is Black? This is what they've been doing. You want to talk about packing a court? Let's have that discussion.\n\n1:07:38 PAGE\n\nAll right, thank you. Thank you, Senator. Let's go on to talk about the issue of racial justice.\n\n1:07:43 PENCE\n\nI just want the record to reflect, she never answered the question. Perhaps at the next debate Joe Biden will answer the question. And I think the American people know the answer.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President. In March, Breonna Taylor a 26-year-old emergency room technician in Louisville, was shot and killed after police officers executing a search warrant on a narcotics investigation broke into her apartment. The police said they identified themselves. Taylor's boyfriend said he didn't hear them do that. He used a gun registered to him to fire a shot, which wounded an officer. The officers then fired more than 20 rounds into the apartment. They say they were acting in self defense. None of them have been indicted in connection with her death. Senator Harris, in the case of Breonna Taylor, was justice done? You have two minutes.\n\n1:08:32 HARRIS\n\nI don't believe so, and I've talked with Breonna’s mother, Tamika Palmer, and her family, and she deserves justice. She was a beautiful young woman. She had as her life goal to become a nurse, and she wanted to become an EMT to first learn what's going on out on the street, so she could then become a nurse and save lives. And her life was taken, unjustifiably and tragically and violently. And it just, it brings me to, you know, the eight minutes and 46 seconds that America witnessed, during which an American man was tortured and killed under the knee of an armed, uniformed police officer. And people around our country, of every race, of every age, of every gender – perfect strangers to each other – marched shoulder to shoulder, arm and arm, fighting for us to finally achieve that ideal of equal justice under law. And I was a part of those peaceful protests. And I believe strongly that, first of all, we are never going to condone violence, but we always must fight for the values that we hold dear, including the sight to achieve our ideals. And that's why Joe Biden and I have said on this subject, look, and I'm a prosecutor. I know what I'm talking about. Bad cops are bad for good cops. We need reform of our policing in America and our criminal justice system, which is why Joe and I will immediately ban chokeholds and carotid holds. George Ford would be alive today if we did that. We will require a national registry for police officers who break the law, we will – on the issue of criminal justice reform – get rid of private prisons and cash bail and we will decriminalize marijuana, and we will expunge the records of those who have been convicted of marijuana.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me pose the same question to you. In the case of Breonna Taylor, was justice done? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n1:11:00 PENCE\n\nWell our heart breaks for the loss of any innocent American lives, and the family of Breonna Taylor has our sympathies. But I trust our justice system, a grand jury that reviews the evidence. And it really is remarkable, that as a former prosecutor, you would assume that in a panel grand jury, looking at all the evidence, got it all wrong. But you're entitled to your opinion, Senator. And with regard to George Floyd, there's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. Justice will be served. But there's also no excuse for the rioting and looting that followed. I mean, it really is astonishing. Flora Westbrook is with us here tonight in Salt Lake City. Just a few weeks ago, I stood at what used to be her salon, was burned to the ground. By rioters and looters. And Flora is still trying to put her life back together. And I must say this, this presumption that you hear consistently from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, that America is systemically racist. That asJoe Biden said, that he believes that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities, is a great insult to the men and women who serve in law enforcement. And I want everyone to know, who puts on the uniform of law enforcement every day, that President Trump and I stand with you. It is remarkable that Senator Tim Scott tried to pass a police reform bill, brought together a group of Republicans and Democrats – Senator Harris, you got up and walked out of the room. And then you filibustered Senator Tim Scott's bill on the Senate floor that would have provided new accountability, new resources. But we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement, providing public safety, and supporting our African American neighbors and all other minorities. Under President Trump's leadership –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Mr. Vice President\n\nPENCE\n\n– we will always stand with law enforcement and we'll do what we can -- we have improved the lives of African Americans. Record unemployment, record –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Mr. Vice President.\n\n1:13:18 PENCE\n\n– Fight for school choice, for –\n\n1:13:22 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris.\n\n1:13:24 HARRIS\n\nI will not sit here and be lectured by the Vice President on what it means to enforce the laws of our country. I'm the only one on this stage who has personally prosecuted everything from child sexual assaults to homicide. I'm the only one on the stage who has prosecuted the big banks for taking advantage of American families. I am the only one on this stage who prosecuted for-profit colleges for taking advantage of our veterans. And the reality of this is, that we are talking about an election in 27 days where last week, the President of the United States took the debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white supremacists. And –\n\nPENCE\n\nNot true.\n\nHARRIS\n\n– it wasn't like he didn't have a chance. He didn't do it, and then he doubled down. And then he said, when pressed, ‘Stand back. Stand by.’ And this is a part of a pattern of Donald Trump. He was – he called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He instituted as his first act a Muslim ban. He, on the issue of Charlottesville, where people were peacefully protesting the need for racial justice, where a young woman was killed and on the other side there were neo-Nazis carrying tiki torches shouting racial epithets, anti semitic slurs. And Donald Trump, when asked about it, said there were fine people on both sides. This is who we have as the President of the United States. And America, you deserve better. Joe Biden will be a president who brings our country together.\n\nPAGE\n\nSenator Harris –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– and recognizes the beauty in our diversity and the fact that we all spend so much more in common than what separates us.\n\n1:15:19 PAGE\n\nVice President, I’m going to give you a minute to respond.\n\n1:15:21 PENCE\n\nThank you, Susan. I appreciate that very much. I think that's one of the things that makes people dislike the media so much in this country. That you selectively edited, like Senator Harris did, a promise that President Trump and I, and others on our side of the aisle make. Senator Harris conveniently omitted, after the President made comments about people on either side of the debate over monuments, he condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and has done so repeatedly. Your concern that he doesn't condemn neo-Nazis – President Trump has Jewish grandchildren. This is a president who respects and cherishes all of the American people. But you talk about having personally prosecuted – glad you brought up your records.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you.\n\nPENCE\n\nI really need to make this point. When you were DA in San Francisco, when you held that office, African Americans were 19 times more likely to be prosecuted for minor drug offenses than whites and Hispanics. When you were Attorney General of California, you increased the disproportionate incarceration of Blacks in California. You did nothing on criminal justice reform in California. You didn't lift a finger to pass the first step back on Capitol Hill. The reality is, you're representing yourself. President Trump and I have fought for criminal justice, for –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence\n\nPENCE\n\n– for for educational choice and opportunities for African Americans –\n\n1:16:53 PAGE\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nPENCE\n\nAnd we'll do it for four more.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you. You know there is no more important issue than the final issue that we're going to talk about tonight, and that is the issue of the election itself.\n\n1:17:03 HARRIS\n\nListen, he attacked my record. I would like the opportunity to respond.\n\n1:17:06 PAGE\n\nLet me give you 30 seconds because we're running out of time.\n\n1:17:09 HARRIS\n\nI appreciate that. First of all, having served as the Attorney General of the State of California, the work that I did is a model of what our nation needs to do and we will be able to do under a Joe Biden presidency. Our agenda includes what this administration has failed to do. It will be about not only instituting a ban on chokeholds and carotid holes.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you.\n\nHARRIS\n\nI don't think, I would like to go through –\n\n1:17:38 PAGE\n\nThese are points that you made earlier in the hour and I want to talk about the election itself before we have to –\n\n1:17:43 HARRIS\n\nBut I want to talk about the connection between what Joe and I will do and my record, which includes – I was the first statewide officer to institute a requirement that my agents would wear body cameras and keep them on full time. We were the first to initiate a requirement that there would be a training for law enforcement on implicit bias, because yes, Joe Biden I recognize that implicit bias does exist, Mr. Vice President, contrary to what you may believe. We did the work of instituting reforms that were about investing in reentry. This is the work that we have done and the work we will do going forward and, again, I will not be lectured by the Vice President, on our record of what we have done in terms of law enforcement and keeping our community safe and a commitment to reforming the criminal justice system of America.\n\n1:18:32 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris, and I'd like to pose the – I'd like you to respond first to the question on our final topic, the election itself. President Trump has, several times, refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If your ticket wins and President Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what steps would you and Vice President Biden then take? What would happen next? You have two minutes.\n\n1:19:00 HARRIS\n\nSo, I'll tell you. Joe and I are particularly proud of the coalition we've built around our campaign. We probably have one of the broadest coalition's of folks that you've ever seen in a presidential race. Of course we have the support of Democrats, but also independents and Republicans, in fact, seven members of President George W Bush's cabinet are supporting our ticket. We have the support of Colin Powell, Cindy McCain, John Kasich, over 500 generals, retired generals, and former national security experts and advisors are supporting our campaign. And I believe they are doing that because they know that Joe Biden has a deep, deep seated commitment to fight for our democracy, and to fight for the integrity of our democracy, and to bring integrity back to the White House. And so, we believe in the American people. We believe in our democracy. And here's what I'd like to say to everybody: vote. Please vote, vote early, come up with a plan to vote, go to IWillVote.com. You can also go to Joe Biden.com. We have it within our power in these next 27 days to make the decision about what will be the course of our country for the next four years. And it is within our power, and if we use our vote, and we use our voice, we will win. And we will not let anyone subvert our democracy, with what Donald Trump has been doing as he did on the debate stage last week, when again in front of 70 million people, he openly attempted to suppress the vote. Joe Biden, on the other hand, on that same debate stage – because clearly Donald Trump doesn't think he can run on a record because it's a failed record – Joe Biden said on that stage, said, ‘Hey, just please vote.’ So I'll repeat what Joe said. Please vote.\n\n1:20:58 PAGE\n\nPlease vote. Thank you, Senator. Vice President Pence, President Trump has several times refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If Vice President Biden is declared the winner and President Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what would be your role and responsibility as Vice President? What would you personally do? You have two minutes.\n\n1:21:22 PENCE\n\nWell, Susan, first and foremost, I think we're gonna win this election. Because while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris rattle off a long litany, the establishment in Washington DC and the establishments Joe Biden's been a part of for 47 years. President Donald Trump has launched a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. And I have every confidence that the same Americans that delivered that historic victory in 2016, they see this President's record, where we rebuild our military, we revived our economy through tax cuts and rolling back regulation, fighting for fair trade, unleashing American energy. We appointed conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And we stood with the men and women of law enforcement every single day, and I think, I think that movement of Americans has only grown stronger in the last four years. When you talk about accepting the outcome of the election, I must tell you, Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election. It's amazing. When Joe Biden was vice president of the United States, the FBI actually spied on President Trump and my campaign. I mean there were documents released this week that the CIA actually made a referral to the FBI documenting that those allegations were coming from the Hillary Clinton campaign, and of course, we've all seen the avalanche with the -- what, what country’s been through for, for the better part of three years, until it was found that there was no obstruction, no collusion, case closed. And then Senator Harris, you and your colleagues in the Congress tried to impeach the president of the United States, over a phone call. And now Hillary Clinton has actually said to Joe Biden that under, in her words, under no circumstances should he concede election. So let me just say, I think we're gonna win this election. President Trump and I are fighting every day in courthouses to prevent Joe Biden and Kamala Harris from changing the rules and creating this universal mail-in voting, they'll create a massive opportunity for voter fraud. We have a free and fair election; we know we're going to have confidence in it. And I believe in all my heart that President Donald Trump's gonna be reelected for four more years.\n\n1:23:33 PAGE\n\nYou know I've, I've asked – I've written all the questions that I've asked tonight, but for the final question of the debate, I'd like to read a question that someone else wrote. The Utah Debate Commission asked students in the state to write essays about what they would like to ask. And I want to close tonight's debate with the question posed by Brecklyn Brown. She's an eighth grader at Springville Junior High in Springville, Utah, and here's what she wrote. Quote – “When I watch the news, all I see is arguing between Democrats and Republicans. When I watch the news, all I see is citizen fighting against citizen. When I watch the news, all I see are two candidate parties, trying to tear each other down. If our leaders can't get along, how are the citizens supposed to get along?” And then she added, “Your examples could make all the difference to bring us together” – end quote. So for each of you, in turn, I’d like you to take one minute, and respond to Brecklyn. Vice President Pence.\n\n1:24:37 PENCE\n\nBrecklyn, it's a wonderful question. And let me just commend you for your interest in in public. I started following the news when I was very young. And in America, we believe in a free and open exchange of debate. And we celebrate that as how we could, literally, the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world. And I will tell you that –don't assume that what you're saying on your local news networks is synonymous with the American people. You know, I looked at the relationship between Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the late justice who we just lost from the Supreme Court, and the late Justice Antonin Scalia. They were on polar opposites, on the Supreme Court of the United States – one very liberal, one very conservative. But what's been learned since her passing was the two of them and their families were the very closest of friends. And here in America, we can disagree we can debate vigorously as Senator Harris and I have on the stage tonight. But when the debate is over, we come together as Americans. That's what people do in big cities and small towns all across this country, so I just want to encourage you, Brecklyn, I want to tell you that we're going to work every day to have a government as good as our people, the American people, each and every day. We love a good debate. We love a good argument. We always come together and are always there for one another. And we've especially learned that during the difficulties of this year.\n\n1:26:17 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President. Senator Harris, what would you say to Brecklyn.\n\n1:26:20 HARRIS\n\nFirst of all, I love to hear from our young leaders, and when I hear her words, when I hear your words, Brecklyn, I know our future is bright, because it is that perspective on who we are and who we should be – that is a sign of leadership and it's something we should all aspire to be.\n\nAnd that you know that brings me to Joe. Joe Biden – one of the reasons that Joe decided to run for president, is after Charlottesville, which we talked about earlier, it so troubled him and upset him, like it did all of us, that there was that kind of hate and division. What propelled Joe to run for president was to see that, over the course of the last four years, what Brecklyn described has been happening. Joe has a long standing reputation of working across the aisle and working in a bipartisan way. And that's what he's going to do as President. Joe Biden has a history of lifting people up and fighting for their dignity. You mean you have to know Joe's story to know that Joe has known pain, he has known suffering, and he has known love. And so, Brecklyn, when you think about the future, I do believe the future is bright. And it will be because of your leadership, and it will be, because we fight for each person's voice through their vote. And we get engaged in this election, because you have the ability through your work, and through, eventually, your vote. To determine the future of our country, and what its leadership looks like.\n\n1:27:58 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris, thank you, Vice President Pence, and thank you so much for being with us tonight. We want to thank, also, the University of Utah for its hospitality, and most of all our thanks to all the Americans who watched this debate tonight. Again, our best wishes for a quick recovery to President Trump, the First Lady and everyone who is battling COVID-19. The second presidential debate is next week on October 15, a town hall style debate in Miami. We hope you'll join us then.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/01/20/joe-biden-inauguration-president/4228441001/", "title": "Joe Biden sworn in as 46th US president as Donald Trump departs", "text": "Taking over the reins of government at a time of extreme partisanship and violence and with a pandemic that has killed more than 400,000 Americans, Joe Biden was sworn in as president at 11:49 a.m. Wednesday outside the U.S. Capitol, formally ending Donald Trump's single term and becoming the nation's 46th chief executive.\n\n\"We have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility. Much to repair, much to restore. ... Few periods in our nation’s history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we’re in now,\" Biden said, delivering a 22-minute speech in which he called for America's \"better angels\" to bring it together much as Abraham Lincoln did in 1861 as the Civil War began. \"We can join forces, stop the shouting and lower the temperature. Without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury ... no nation, only a state of chaos.\n\n\"Let's listen to one another again, hear one another, see one another ... politics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war.\"\n\nBiden's swearing-in came in a historic ceremony just two weeks after a pro-Trump mob, some of whom were armed, stormed the Capitol near the spot where Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts read the oath of office to Biden.\n\n\"This is America's day,\" said Biden, as he began his speech after taking his oath on a 128-year-old family Bible a short time after Justice Sonia Sotomayor swore in Vice President Kamala Harris, the first woman, Black and Indian American to hold that office. \"This is democracy’s day, a day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve.\"\n\nBiden and Harris later met with Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and Senate in the Capitol, reviewed a military procession and visited the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. They then headed to the White House, where the president began signing a series of proclamations and orders reversing many of Trump's signature initiatives, including those declaring a national emergency to allow him to move funding to construct a southern border wall, barring travel from certain majority Muslim nations and withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris accords that commit the nation to reducing greenhouse gases as a way to fight climate change.\n\nThat list also included measures urging Americans to commit to wearing masks for the next 100 days to slow the spread of COVID-19 and requiring them on federal property; renewing the nation's involvement in the World Health Organization, which Trump had wanted to leave; taking steps to revoke a permit for construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, and reversing a Trump order to exclude undocumented immigrants from the Census count. He also was set to order his Department of Homeland Security to take steps to provide temporary protection from deportation to so-called Dreamers, people who were brought as undocumented immigrants into the U.S. as children.\n\nIt was a clear sign of how quickly Biden intended to put behind the nation Trump and the policies that were cheered on by his supporters but seen as unnecessarily divisive by many other Americans.\n\n\"There's no time to start like today,\" CNN reported Biden told members of the media in the Oval Office as he began signing executive actions. \"I'm going to start by keeping the promises I made to the American people.\"\n\nIt continued a day in which the tone in the nation's capital had quickly changed from that of the often-bellicose, norm-busting Trump to Biden, a politician steeping in the traditions of the city and seemingly eager to return to them.\n\nWith the occasional snowflake falling on a 40-degree day in Washington, the scaled-down inauguration ceremony took place on the west side of the Capitol with a smaller-than-usual crowd. Lady Gaga sang the National Anthem and Jennifer Lopez sang \"America, the Beautiful\" and \"This Land is Your Land.\" Because of concerns about COVID-19, the 1,000 guests were masked and kept socially distant.\n\nMore:As Kamala Harris prepares to take the VP spot, local women say: It's about time\n\nAmanda Gorman, 22, recited a poem in which she invoked images stark, hopeful, worrisome and uplifting as she sought to describe the journey of the nation and its diverse population. \"We've braved the belly of the beast, we've learned that quiet isn't always peace,\" she read. \"And the norms and notions of what just is isn't always justice. And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it, somehow we do it. Somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken, but simply unfinished.\"\n\nShe was the youngest inaugural poet in the nation's history.\n\nFormer Michigan Gov. Jim Blanchard, a friend of the Bidens, was one of those in attendance. He texted the Free Press, \"After 48 years (since entering government), Joe Biden’s dream has come true. He’s now the man for the moment. I believe he will make us all proud.”\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan said, \"The peaceful transfer of power is at the core of American democracy. Despite the events of these past weeks, today's ceremony affirmed that the fabric of our country is strong.\"\n\nAt 78, Biden becomes the oldest president in U.S. history. He is also one of the most politically experienced, having served eight years as vice president to former President Barack Obama and as a U.S. senator from Delaware for 36 years. It is a stark contrast to Trump, a reality TV show host and businessman who entered office with no experience, but who upset Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016 and, while losing to Biden this time, still won more votes nationwide — 74 million — than any other presidential candidate in history except Biden, who received the backing of 81 million Americans.\n\nMichigan played a key role in Biden's ascent, giving him an important victory over U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic primary last March and, in November, denying Trump a Midwestern state that helped assure his stunning victory four years before. For 2½ months, Trump maintained that the result in Michigan and several other swing states was incorrect and tainted by corruption, an accusation for which he showed no proof but which fueled the unprecedented attack on the Capitol.\n\nEarly Wednesday, with less than 12 hours remaining in his presidency, Trump issued a wave of commutations and pardons, including a commutation of former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick's 25-year prison sentence on corruption charges. While Kilpatrick, who had served seven years, had his supporters, including current Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a close ally of Biden's, Trump's action appeared counterintuitive to his complaints following the election that Detroit was steeped in corruption.\n\nBiden takes office in a deeply divided time\n\nIt falls to Biden to attempt to unify the country with partisan rancor at a high point and many voters, including many Michiganders on both sides of the political aisle, worried about more violence. On Wednesday, some 25,000 National Guard troops secured the Capitol and there were concerns of possible attacks in other areas.\n\nThe event, however, went off without any disturbance.\n\nIn his speech, Biden touched on the constellation of issues facing the nation, from racial inequities and climate change to white supremacy and partisanship. Saying he will be a president to both those who voted for him and those who didn't, he still warned that American democracy is fragile and could be destroyed by faction and lies.\n\n\"We must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured,\" he said.\n\n\"There is truth and there are lies — lies told for power and for profit and each of us has a duty and a responsibility ... to defend the truth and defeat the lies.\"\n\nHe said his whole soul would be in the job.\n\nMichiganders reacted differently based on their points of view. Justin Porth, a 40-year-old Trump supporter in Dearborn Heights, said he thought that while the message is a good one, it's undermined by Biden's move to reverse Trump's accomplishments on immigration and the economy as he enters office. \"The fact that Biden wants to undo all the massive good work Trump did right away is absolutely abhorrent to me,\" he said. \"He's calling for unity and he's going to completely dismiss the wants and needs of the other side.\"\n\nAngela Byrd, a 53-year-old Biden supporter in Canton, had exactly the opposite reaction, having been part of an online watch party of the inaugural events with her extended family. \"It was beyond beautiful and healing. It’s what we need right now,\" she said of Biden's message of healing.\n\n\"I'm really impressed,\" she said. \"I said, that's my president. I haven't said that in four years. It made me feel good to say that again.\"\n\nAmong other Michiganders in attendance at the inauguration were Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who, over the last year, has become a friend and adviser to the new president, and many members of Congress. Former Gov. Jennifer Granholm is set to become Biden's energy secretary.\n\nMore:In worrisome time, Biden's inauguration leaves Michiganders feeling optimism and dread\n\nMore:Whitmer won't mourn Trump's departure: He led to a 'deeply divided' nation\n\nThree former presidents were in attendance: Obama, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, as was Vice President Mike Pence. But Trump departed Washington earlier in the day for his home in Florida and became the first president since Andrew Johnson in 1869 to snub his successor's inauguration.\n\nAt no point during the transition period did he meet with Biden, as is customary, tbut Biden did confirm that Trump sent him a \"very generous letter,\" though he didn't disclose its contents. As he departed Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Wednesday morning, Trump said, \"I wish the new administration great luck and great success.\" But he also cast doubt on the new administration, touting his achievements and fretting that Biden could push for moves that he believes could hurt business. \"I hope they don't raise your taxes,\" he said. \"But if they do, I told you so.\"\n\nAccording to the website FiveThirtyEight.com, which compiles and analyzes polls and other political data, Trump — whose social media accounts were terminated or suspended in the wake of the riot because of the threat of further violence — left office with an average of 57.9% of Americans disapproving of the job he has done as president, the worst mark of his entire presidency.\n\nTrump says he will be back\n\nTrump indicated he plans to have a political future, however, saying cryptically, \"We will be back in some form.\" But it's unclear whether he can continue to keep a hold on the Republican Party in the wake of his loss and a second impeachment, on an accusation he incited the insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6 as Congress set about finalizing the vote for Biden, as required by the Constitution.\n\nThe Senate is expected to try Trump on the charge; while it can no longer remove him from office, it could bar him from holding political office again. Even some Republicans, including Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have indicated Trump bears responsibility for the riot, during which some in the mob shouted that they wanted to hang Pence, as he was in a titular role of overseeing the count for Biden's election.\n\nBut Trump's admonition aside, there have been many indications the American business community is ready to cut ties with the former president, especially in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nJay Timmons, president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers, put out a statement just before Biden took the oath, saying, “This is a new day for America. This new administration brings a new commitment to healing our country — healing from the deadly pandemic that has claimed the lives of 400,000 of our fellow Americans and healing from the deep divisions that have torn us apart.\"\n\nGeneral Motors Chairman and CEO Mary Barra tweeted, \"At General Motors we look forward to working together with the new administration on the issues that unite us. As a nation we are stronger together.\"\n\nMany Republicans congratulated Biden as well.\n\n“The peaceful transfer of power is the hallmark of American democracy and I congratulate both President Biden and Vice President Harris on this momentous day,” said U.S. Rep. Peter Meijer of Grand Rapids, who last week became one of only 10 Republicans to vote to impeach Trump for his role in inciting the riot at the Capitol. \"At a time when our country faces significant challenges and division, I urge the Biden administration to lead with unity and thoughtful governance.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph, who also voted for impeachment, said it's long since time for the nation's leaders to set extreme partisanship aside. U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Midland, congratulated the new administration as well.\n\nDemocrats were elated.\n\n\"Together, (Biden and Harris) will listen to the pain and fear many of our fellow citizens feel today,\" said Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Dearborn. Rep. Andy Levin, D-Bloomfield Township, said, \"I welcome the dawning of a bright new day.\"\n\nRep. Haley Stevens, D-Rochester Hills, who worked with Biden when he was vice president as the de facto chief of staff of the task force that developed the 2009 rescue of GM and Chrysler, said, \"Today was a historic and joyous day for our country. ... I know he (Biden) will prioritize the needs of hardworking Michigan families and our manufacturing economy.\"\n\nBiden and Harris, meanwhile, had promised to hit the ground running: The new administration has said it will press a new Democratic-led Congress to pass a $1.9-trillion package to spur 100 million vaccines to prevent COVID-19 in its first 100 days and help schools and businesses reopen.\n\nBiden's others actions, even beyond those to be signed on Wednesday, were designed to use his knowledge of how to use the levers of power in Washington to their full effect. He has promised to ask Congress for immigration reform that would put undocumented immigrants on a path to citizenship and end family separations at the southern border. Early Wednesday, he also said his administration would review mile-per-gallon standards for cars and light trucks that Trump had said he would roll back.\n\nThe package of orders and proclamations he was signing or planned to sign also included those to extend protections from foreclosures and evictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, extend a pause in requiring student loan payments during the pandemic; launch a review of federal agencies and their commitment to equality for people of color and historically marginalized or groups, and disbanding Trump's 1776 Commission, which was chaired by Hillsdale College President Larry Arnn and this week issued a report that was blasted as trying to excuse the nation's history of slavery and comparing progressivism with fascism.\n\nContact Todd Spangler:tspangler@freepress.com.

The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the contributors.\n\nFatima Goss Graves: A nomination that should unite the country\n\nNational Women's Law Center\n\nJudge Ketanji Brown Jackson is an eminently qualified public servant with distinguished experience as a federal judge, and her historic nomination promises an end to the erasure of Black women from our most sacred legal institutions. She brings extensive litigation experience at every level of the federal court system, including distinguished service as a federal public defender. As a district court judge, she ruled on over 550 cases and is renowned for her careful, methodical approach to ensuring equal justice under the law on reproductive rights, disability rights and workers’ rights.\n\nFrankly, this is a nomination that should unite the country. Diversity strengthens the integrity of the institution to the broader public and, in particular, the many Black women who face many of the harshest injustices of our system today. It’s critical for the US Supreme Court to understand the impact of its rulings in the real world, and it can’t do that until it reflects the country it governs. Jackson will move us closer to a more fair and just system for women, for Black Americans and for everyone on the side of equality before the law.\n\nIt is incumbent upon US senators to give her a fair and timely confirmation without obstruction, honoring their constitutional duty to advise and consent – and their moral duty to treat her with the respect and dignity she deserves.\n\n​​Fatima Goss Graves is president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center.\n\nElie Honig: A nominee Republicans will be hard-pressed to oppose\n\nFirst things first: it’s about time. It’s long past time. For the first time in the history of the US Supreme Court, a Black woman has been nominated as a Justice.\n\nAnd, to be clear, you will not find a more qualified nominee than Judge (likely soon-to-be Justice) Kentaji Brown Jackson. She graduated from Harvard, both undergrad and law school. She clerked for a federal district court judge and then, in a nice bit of symmetry, nabbed a mega-prestigious clerkship with Justice Stephen Breyer, who she now stands to replace.\n\nShe worked in private practice and for the US Sentencing Commission before she became a federal district court judge in 2013. Last year, she was nominated as a federal appellate judge, winning confirmation with 53 votes, including three Republicans. I have seen her in action on the bench, and I came away exceptionally impressed. In the case I covered, she was prepared, sharp, incisive and fair.\n\nSenate Republicans can act one of two ways in the wake of Jackson’s nomination. They can dig in and oppose it, but they don’t have much of substance to work with – and they’ll likely lose anyway, given the current Democratic Senate majority (which will presumably be coupled with the votes of three Republicans who supported her federal appellate judgeship).\n\nOr Republicans can pick their battles and throw their support behind Jackson, given her qualifications and the seeming inevitably of her confirmation. Maybe it seems quaint – Breyer himself was confirmed by an 87 to 9 vote back in 1994, which now seems impossible – but it also could be smart politics.\n\nElie Honig is a CNN senior legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor, and author of “Hatchet Man: How Bill Barr Broke the Prosecutor’s Code and Corrupted the Justice Department.”\n\nEd Whelan: Senate Republicans have an opportunity here\n\nEthics and Public Policy Center\n\nIn selecting Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to fill Stephen Breyer’s seat on the Supreme Court, President Joe Biden has fulfilled his campaign pledge to nominate the first female African American justice.\n\nBiden selected Jackson for additional reasons, of course. Jackson has impressive credentials, and Biden likely feels confident that Jackson will implement the results-oriented, make-it-up-as-you-go-along “living constitutionalism” that progressives espouse.\n\nBiden has already demonstrated that differences in judicial philosophy justify efforts to oppose the confirmation of the first female African American justice. Back in 2005, he even threatened to filibuster President George W. Bush’s possible nomination of DC Circuit judge Janice Rogers Brown to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe left is likely to make accusations of racism and sexism in response to any concerns expressed over Jackson’s vision of the judicial role. But if Senate Republicans assess Jackson on the basis of judicial philosophy, and don’t succumb to political pressure because of her race and sex, they will responsibly fulfill their constitutional duty to advise and consent.\n\nThe Democrats have control of the Senate, albeit slim control, so Jackson will almost certainly be confirmed. The process will probably be rather quiet. But Senate Republicans should use the opportunity to emphasize that judging is a craft that is distinct from policymaking. They can reinforce the message that the duty of a Supreme Court justice is to discern and apply the meaning that constitutional and statutory provisions bore when they were adopted, not to rewrite those provisions to advance an ideological agenda.\n\nEd Whelan holds the Antonin Scalia Chair in Constitutional Studies at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. A former law clerk to Justice Scalia, he is co-editor of “The Essential Scalia: On the Constitution, the Courts, and the Rule of Law” and of two other volumes of Scalia’s work.\n\nLaura Coates: The power of seeing a former public defender nominated\n\nFor me, the power of seeing a Black woman nominated to the highest court in the land is without equal. But what is also extraordinary is that she will be a former federal public defender – a position she held for 2 1/2 years – in a country with a legal system still aspiring to be a justice system.\n\nAs a prosecutor, I wielded a tremendous amount of power in the exercise of my discretion to pursue (or decline to pursue) charges and autonomy in the way I met my burden of proof. But like the power held by a co-equal branch of government, the power of prosecutors must be checked – not to disrupt the pursuit of justice but to further it. In a country where race and bias are far too frequently elevated above fairness, public defenders are the welcome foil to balance the system.\n\nThe relationship between public defenders and prosecutors may be necessarily adversarial, but it is always symbiotic. Prosecutors get all the credit (and blame) for ensuring accountability, as if they alone believe in it.\n\nThe public may mistakenly view those who represent the accused as soft on crime. Indeed, if past is prologue, I expect such an absurd talking point to emerge during Jackson’s confirmation hearings. But public defenders are not soft on crime – they are hard on injustice, which is precisely where we as a society must be. And precisely where a Supreme Court justice ought to be.\n\nI sincerely hope Jackson is afforded the dignity she ensured for the presumed innocent: due process, fairness, equal protection from an abuse of power and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. After all, it’s the US Supreme Court.\n\nLaura Coates is a CNN senior legal analyst and author of “Just Pursuit: A Black Prosecutor’s Fight For Fairness.” She is a former assistant US attorney for the District of Columbia and trial attorney in the civil rights division of the Department of Justice. Coates is the host of the daily “Laura Coates Show” on SiriusXM. Follow her @thelauracoates.\n\nJeffrey Toobin: What kind of justice will Ketanji Brown Jackson be?\n\nOne thing that’s always said when there’s a US Supreme Court nomination is that presidents are often surprised by how their choices turn out. Presidents think the future justice will vote one way, and they wind up voting another way.\n\nDon’t believe it. Especially in recent years, the art of picking Supreme Court justices has been refined to a science. All nine of the current justices largely vote in ways that would please the presidents who nominated them. That’s likely to be true if Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is confirmed as well.\n\nThe myth of the surprised president dates principally from the presidency of Dwight Eisenhower, who nominated Earl Warren and William Brennan to the Supreme Court and found, to his dismay, that they were both powerful and outspoken liberals.\n\nHere’s one thing to know about the Eisenhower administration: it was a long time ago. In those days, the court was not the public political battleground that it has become, and Eisenhower’s choices were motivated more by politics than ideology. (Eisenhower had promised the seat to Warren, then the governor of California, and he chose Brennan to appeal to Catholic voters on the eve of his 1956 reelection.)\n\nIt’s true that President George H.W. Bush’s appointment of David Souter in 1990 ranks as a modest surprise, but his behavior as a moderate on the court was consistent with both his own earlier record as a judge and Bush’s overall approach to social issues. Also, 1990 was a long time ago.\n\nIn recent years, though, as the court has become the focus of fights on such issues as abortion, guns and affirmative action, ideology has become the main criteria for selections. Presidents (as well as their advisers and supporters) care a great deal about the possibility of ideological mistakes. So they don’t make them. President Joe Biden wanted a judicial liberal, and that’s what he will get with Jackson. She will not surprise him, or us.\n\nJeffrey Toobin is CNN’s chief legal analyst and the author of “The Nine” and “The Oath.”\n\nA’shanti F. Gholar: An important step in addressing racial injustice\n\nMaeve Komenan\n\nJudge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination is an important step in addressing the injustices in the US judicial system, but it’s not the only step we need to take. America’s legal system has always looked different for Black women, who have historically been discriminated against. That will not change until we see more Black women jurists like Jackson in positions of legal power, and that begins with empowering Black women to be the leaders they deserve to be.\n\nJackson is the ideal role model in this regard. Her record is one that has championed equity and justice . She fought to defend the rights of incarcerated individuals, issued rulings that protected labor and women’s rights and upheld the integrity of our constitution when it was under attack by the Trump administration.\n\nAlong with her wealth of judicial expertise, she also brings with her experiences and identities that have never been enjoyed by another Supreme Court justice – and have been sorely missed in the highest court in America. I look forward to her swift approval process through the US Senate and hopefully to her being seated on a bench that doesn’t require her to bring her own folding chair.\n\nA’shanti F.

Irvine\n\nPresident Joe Biden simply could not have done better than his choice of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for the United States Supreme Court. In the world of law, credentials don’t get better than hers. A graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, she clerked for judges in the federal district court and the federal court of appeals. She was also a clerk for Justice Stephen Breyer, who she is now poised to replace. Jackson has had extensive experience in a variety of settings and has served as a federal judge since 2013.\n\nShe also brings to the court experiences and perspectives the current justices lack. Most obviously, she is the first Black woman to be nominated to the Supreme Court. If confirmed, Jackson will also be the only justice on the current court to have worked as a public defender. She has significant experience as a trial judge, something only Justice Sonia Sotomayor has among those now on the high court.\n\nAs I think about what makes for a great justice, Jackson has it all: keen intelligence, enormous experience, unquestionable integrity, a terrific judicial temperament and a vision of justice. She should be confirmed swiftly by the Senate and start what will hopefully be a long career on the Supreme Court. Many will rightfully point out the fact that she won’t change the current ideological balance of the court by replacing Breyer. But if Jackson is still a justice in 2040 and 2050, she may be a stabilizing force on a very different court.\n\nErwin Chemerinsky is dean and Jesse H.

Justice Jackson offers just that\n\nCourtesy Jennifer Rodgers\n\nJudge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden’s nominee to fill the retiring Justice Stephen Breyer’s seat on the Supreme Court, has it all. She is a highly accomplished lawyer and an experienced jurist with the sterling educational and clerkship credentials expected of someone about to ascend to the pinnacle of the legal profession. And, as a Black woman, Jackson will bring a historic perspective and important representation to the nation’s highest court.\n\nJackson shares all of the above characteristics with the other two final candidates Biden was considering: California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger and US District Judge J. Michelle Childs. All three women are also 55 or under; nominating someone relatively young has become close to mandatory in recent years for Supreme Court nominees of presidents of both parties since justices can serve for life. But what distinguishes Jackson from the others, and what very well may have led to her selection, is her service as a criminal defense lawyer, both as a federal public defender and in private practice. She offers the kind of professional diversity that has become one of the calling cards of Biden’s judicial nominations strategy.\n\nBiden is right to prioritize elevating judges who bring different backgrounds and experiences to the courts, especially to the Supreme Court, where not a single justice has Jackson’s experience defending criminal cases. The Supreme Court needs more diversity, of all kinds; hopefully Jackson will be the first step in making that become a reality.\n\nJennifer Rodgers is a former federal prosecutor, adjunct professor of clinical law at NYU School of Law, lecturer-in-law at Columbia Law School and a CNN legal analyst.\n\nElliot Williams: Jackson’s airtight resume is GOP kryptonite\n\nCourtesy Elliot Williams\n\nThe legal profession is plagued by elitism. It’s easy for me to say this, having attended Ivy League schools myself, but prestigious academic institutions do not confer much of anything that can’t be gained from other schools.\n\nOf the nine justices currently on the Supreme Court, however, eight have degrees from Harvard or Yale. If confirmed, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who has two Harvard degrees, will perpetuate the Ivies’ dominance on the Supreme Court.\n\nWhile I will be the first to argue that the Supreme Court desperately needs justices with more varied educational backgrounds, in Jackson’s case, her credentials from an elite institution are a good thing.\n\nHere’s why. Shortly after President Joe Biden announced he would fulfill his promise to put a Black woman on the court – an uncontroversial statement given past presidents’ commitments to make barrier-breaking nominations – a US senator went on the record to call the eventual nominee a “beneficiary” of affirmative action. Another senator expressed doubts about whether the nominee would know “a law book from a J. Crew catalog.” A prominent conservative took to Twitter and predicted the nominee would be a “lesser black woman.” (He later deleted the tweets and apologized, calling it “inartful.”)\n\nAt their cores, each of these statements was a manifestation of disbelief that – gasp! – a Black woman might be just as qualified as any other previous nominee to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\nBlack people face enough barriers in workplaces as it is. For instance, job applicants with “Black-sounding” names are less likely to get interviewed than their White counterparts, and Black women with natural hairstyles are seen as less professional and competent. I speak firsthand in saying that being Black and successful in America is a constant exercise in having to prove you are worthy. That struggle doesn’t end in the marble halls of the Supreme Court.\n\nIf, today, Jackson’s having two Harvard degrees and an otherwise airtight resume is what it takes to quiet at least some of the criticism, then so be it.\n\nElliot Williams is a CNN legal analyst.

Reyes: A justice who sees the basic humanity of immigrants\n\nCNN\n\nIn Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden has put forth a US Supreme Court nominee with impeccable credentials and a stellar legal background.\n\nIn addition to her degrees from Harvard College and Harvard Law School, she brings diverse professional experience to the high court; she has worked at large and small firms, as a public defender, and served on the US Sentencing Commission, where she backed a proposal to reduce federal drug trafficking sentences. This type of varied experience will serve her well on a court that often seems out of touch and has seen its public approval rating drop.\n\nAccording to Associated Press polling, the majority of African Americans say it’s very or extremely important that a Black woman serves on the Supreme Court, and the President has now delivered on a key promise.\n\nJackson will likely earn support from Latino advocacy groups as well, as our communities have much in common in the struggle for civil rights and social justice.\n\nJackson’s rulings on immigration are also important, as congressional inaction and legal challenges to immigration policy have given the Supreme Court an outsized role on this issue.\n\nAlthough in several cases she sought to protect the rights of migrants, she also denied a challenge to Trump’s border wall – so no one can accuse her of favoring “open borders.” Most importantly, whether ruling for or against migrants, Jackson has avoided using terms like “illegals” or “aliens.” As the National Immigration Law Center notes, this acknowledges the basic humanity of immigrants.\n\nThe Supreme Court holds immense power over our daily lives, on issues ranging from health care to the environment to reproductive and voting rights. At a time when many Americans have lost faith in institutions, Jackson will help restore trust and stability to the high court. Her historic nomination deserves bipartisan support.\n\nRaul A.

After a rigorous process, Jackson has proven that she has the experience and character to do this vital job.\n\nAs a Black woman, I am thrilled for what this means for me, my daughter and my community.\n\nWhile I rejoice in the historic nature of her nomination, I also want to celebrate the incredible qualifications Jackson brings to this role. A daughter of teachers, she went to Harvard Law School, has served in nearly every part of our legal system and brings that kind of well-rounded experience that we need on the highest court. It’s no wonder that she has been confirmed three times on a bipartisan vote.\n\nUnfortunately, even being an impeccably qualified nominee who has been praised by both former President Barack Obama for being an “unwavering voice for justice and fairness” and by former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who gave her “unequivocal” praise for her integrity and intellect, Jackson will almost certainly face racist and sexist comments that come with being the first.\n\nAt EMILY’s List, we have seen far too many history-makers and ground-breakers have their accomplishments questioned and their qualifications undermined. But we know what Jackson’s example proves: to be the first and to break the mold, you bring qualifications, experience and character that is unrivaled.\n\nI am proud to support her and look forward to the legacy she will hopefully create on the court.\n\nLaphonza Butler is the president of EMILY’s List, the nation’s largest resource for women in politics.

Her discussions with US senators, in visits and in the public hearing, will be an ideal forum for serious constitutional debate.\n\nJudicial nominees are rightly reluctant to prejudge issues, especially when the nominee is a sitting judge. If Jackson follows this tradition, then senators will have all the more incentive to ask her about the bigger picture: her view of the court’s role in government and its responsibility to faithfully interpret the laws as written.\n\nIn an era when the Supreme Court is enduring partisan attacks on its legitimacy, and facing dangerous threats to pack the court for partisan purposes, it is crucial for senators – and all Americans – to know that the next justice is committed to preserving the rule of law and the court’s indispensable constitutional role.\n\nAdam White is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. In 2021, President Joe Biden appointed him to the Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nMini Timmaraju: A smart choice for upholding reproductive freedom\n\nLes Talusan\n\nThe nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson – the first Black woman ever nominated to the US Supreme Court – is an historic and exciting moment.\n\nShe is an immensely qualified judge who will bring a new, much-needed and long-overdue perspective to the court. Not only that, Jackson has a demonstrated record of upholding reproductive freedom, a critical consideration with the right to abortion facing unprecedented attacks.\n\nJackson’s nomination comes at a pivotal moment for the court. Her confirmation won’t change the balance of the court or the outcome of the looming decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization – the case directly challenging Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion. However, we must seize this chance to confirm a justice who will work to protect our most cherished rights and freedoms and help to shape the future of our country in the decades to come.\n\nThe anti-choice movement and its political allies spent decades working to install their ideologues on our nation’s highest court. The confirmations of Trump’s justices to the Supreme Court cemented a majority that is unmistakably hostile to abortion, and that won’t be easily undone. But confirming justices like Jackson is how we move closer to a future in which all of our families and communities thrive – a future in which there is equal justice for all of us.\n\nWith so much on the line, we can’t leave anything on the table in our fight to confirm Jackson to the court.\n\nMini Timmaraju is the President of NARAL Pro-Choice America, an organization that advocates for abortion access in USA.\n\nPaul Callan: Timing is everything\n\nCNN\n\n​​With Russian troops on the march in Ukraine, Americans have not been sitting on the edge of their seats, waiting to see whom President Joe Biden will nominate to the US Supreme Court.\n\nInstead, they are glued to their television sets wondering if Russian President Vladimir Putin is crazy enough to trigger World War III in his quest to rebuild the former Soviet Union.\n\nBiden’s attempt to change the subject from war, inflation and the economy to the Supreme Court may hurt Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation prospects. The timing of this announcement means the White House has lost an important opportunity to rally the public behind Jackson before Republicans go on the offensive.\n\nNo doubt, Biden’s nominee is highly qualified for the position. Jackson checks all the right boxes – she holds a Harvard Law degree, clerked for federal judges and served as a public defender. She now sits as a federal appellate judge on the prestigious DC Circuit Court. She appears to be widely respected in the legal profession, and progressives have already applauded Biden’s decision to nominate her. Republicans, on the other hand, are likely to say that she is too radical for the Supreme Court.\n\nIronically, her biggest obstacle to a swift confirmation is more likely to be Putin than Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. With Americans more focused on the war in Ukraine than the Supreme Court, Jackson’s confirmation is unlikely to get the attention it deserves. Americans will need an opportunity to get to know Jackson, and the initial publicity surrounding any nominee serves an important educational purpose. Without that public support, Jackson could be more vulnerable to damaging attacks from the GOP.\n\nAnnouncing Jackson’s nomination at this moment, given the current crisis in Ukraine, is a rookie mistake for a president languishing in the polls. As a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden seems to have forgotten that even in the selection process for Supreme Court nominees, timing is everything.\n\nPaul Callan is a CNN legal analyst, a former New York homicide prosecutor and counsel to the New York law firm of Edelman & Edelman PC, focusing on wrongful conviction and civil rights cases.

Disruptions in the workforce needed to serve and deliver meals – along with supplies of food and packaging materials – are behind the shortages, Al.com reports. State education officials say every school district in Alabama is facing shortages to some degree. Alexander City Schools recently warned parents that it’s experiencing supply chain issues with its food vendors. In recent weeks, the school system hasn’t received food deliveries because suppliers are short on supplies, drivers and warehouse employees. The school system asked parents to feed breakfast to their students at home if possible. In southeast Alabama, Dothan City Schools asked parents last month to prepare for a possible shift to remote learning due to the district’s food supply issues.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Several Republican state lawmakers are urging easier access to ivermectin amid the pandemic, though that drug is not authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for preventing or treating COVID-19. Senate Majority Leader Shelley Hughes of Palmer said she urged Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the state health commissioner to consider supplying Alaskans with vitamins and drugs, including ivermectin, “that some Alaskan physicians are prescribing but pharmacies aren’t filling.” Three Republican House members testified about ivermectin at a recent state pharmacy board meeting, Alaska Public Media reports. “Maybe the pharmacists could be directed – or directed’s the wrong word – suggested that they allow the doctors to actually be doctors and do their jobs,” said Rep. Kevin McCabe of Big Lake. In a letter to the House members after the meeting, the board’s chair, Justin Ruffridge, a Kenai Peninsula pharmacist, noted potential legal liability for pharmacists for drugs they dispense and said pharmacists were free to use their “professional judgment” when deciding whether to fill prescriptions. He said the board has not threatened pharmacists’ licenses around the issue but said reports of misuse of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 “should give most prescribers and pharmacists reason to pause.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A judge has blocked the state from collecting $1.1 million from the city of Flagstaff to compensate for its minimum wage that is higher than the state’s rate, ruling that the state missed a deadline for the assessment and was stretching a law targeting higher voter-approved city wages to collect its indirect costs. But the ruling from Maricopa County Superior Court Judge James Smith released Monday sidestepped the question of whether the assessments are unconstitutional. The state minimum wage reached $12 an hour in 2020 with inflation adjustments after that and now stands at $12.15 an hour. Flagstaff voters in 2016 phased in higher city minimum wages, which hit $15 per hour this year with annual increases thereafter. Smith’s ruling said a law enacted by the Republican-controlled Legislature in 2019 targeting higher local minimum wages set a July 31 deadline for setting the yearly assessment. The state missed that deadline. The judge also said the state can’t charge for the indirect costs of Flagstaff’s higher minimum wage, which is what it did in coming up with the $1.1 million figure. The state is exempt from paying the higher minimum wage Flagstaff voters approved in 2016, and the law authorizing assessments does not specifically say the state can calculate the indirect costs of paying contractors.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Lawmakers sent the governor a congressional redistricting plan that critics say weakens the influence of minority voters in the Little Rock area by splitting the state’s most populous county among three U.S. House districts. The measure splits portions of Pulaski County, a heavily Democratic county that includes Little Rock, among the 1st, 2nd and 4th congressional districts. The county is currently in the 2nd District, which Democrats have tried unsuccessfully to flip in recent years. Republicans hold all four of the state’s U.S. House seats and a majority of both chambers of the Legislature. Democrats have criticized the plan for moving predominantly Black and Hispanic precincts out of the 2nd District and accused Republicans of trying make a GOP district even redder. Arkansas is the only former Confederate state that has not elected a Black representative to the U.S. House. “It’s going to disenfranchise African American communities, regardless of the intent,” state Rep. Fred Love, D-Little Rock, said before the House approved the measure last week. Supporters of the plan say splitting Pulaski County makes sense given its location in the middle of the state. They also say it helps limits the number of counties split up. Opponents of splitting up counties have said it divides up communities and their interests.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSantee: Recordings indicate the pilot of a twin-engine plane nose-dived into a San Diego suburb despite a growingly concerned air traffic controller who repeatedly warned the pilot to climb in altitude – information that will be examined by investigators who arrived at the crash scene Tuesday. The Cessna 340 smashed into a UPS van, killing the driver, and then hit two houses to ignite just after 12 p.m. Monday in Santee, a suburb of 50,000 people east of San Diego. United Parcel Service of America Inc. held a moment of silence Tuesday for van driver Steve Krueger, who was remembered for making work better with his laugh, the company said in a statement. The plane’s owner, an Arizona physician, also died, and an elderly couple whose home went up in flames after it was hit suffered burns. It was unclear whether others were on board the plane. An investigator from the National Transportation Safety Board arrived at the crash scene Tuesday morning, according to agency spokeswoman Jennifer Gabris. Investigators will review radar data, weather information, air traffic control communication, airplane maintenance records and the pilot’s medical records, she said. The plane had planned to land at Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport in San Diego when it crashed.\n\nColorado\n\nPine: Wildlife officials say an elusive elk that has been wandering the hills with a car tire around its neck for at least two years has finally been freed of the obstruction. The 41/ 2 -year-old, 600-pound bull elk was spotted near Pine Junction, southwest of Denver, on Saturday evening and tranquilized, according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife. Officers with the agency had to cut off the elk’s five-point antlers to remove the encumbrance because they couldn’t slice through the steel in the bead of the tire. “We would have preferred to cut the tire and leave the antlers for his rutting activity, but the situation was dynamic, and we had to just get the tire off in any way possible,” Officer Scott Murdoch said. Murdoch and fellow officer Dawson Swanson estimated the elk shed about 35 pounds with the removal of the tire, the antlers and debris inside the tire. Wildlife officers first spotted the elk with the tire around its neck in July 2019 while conducting a population survey for Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep and mountain goats in the Mount Evans Wilderness. They said they have seen deer, elk, moose, bears and other wildlife become entangled in a number of items, including swingsets, hammocks, clotheslines, decorative or holiday lighting, furniture, tomato cages, chicken feeders, laundry baskets, soccer goals and volleyball nets.\n\nConnecticut\n\nSimsbury: A plot of land that was once a thriving tobacco farm where Martin Luther King Jr. worked as a college student in the 1940s will be protected for its historic and cultural significance to the state’s civil rights history. Last month’s finalized sale of the 288-acre parcel of land was announced Friday. The nonprofit Trust for Public Land and the town of Simsbury plan to hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony Saturday for the Meadowood site. Nearly 130 acres will be set aside for recreational access and roughly 120 acres for working farmland. The rest will be saved for future needs of the town of Simsbury, while 2 acres will be kept for historic preservation purposes. Simsbury voters in May overwhelmingly authorized $2.5 million to purchase the property. Various state agencies, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the George Dudley Seymour Trust, individuals and foundations have provided an additional $4 million. Historians believe King’s experiences in Connecticut influenced his decision to become a minister and civil rights leader. He was among a group of students from Atlanta’s Morehouse College recruited by tobacco growers to work in the fields to earn money for tuition. “On our way here we saw some things I had never anticipated to see,” King wrote his father in June 1944. “After we passed Washington there was no discrimination at all. The white people here are very nice. We go to any place we want to and sit any where we want to.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state auditor, who is responsible for rooting out government fraud, waste and abuse, was indicted Monday on public corruption charges. An indictment issued by a New Castle County grand jury charges Kathleen McGuiness, 58, with felony counts of theft and witness intimidation, plus misdemeanor charges of official misconduct, conflict of interest and noncompliance with state procurement laws. Prosecutors said the charges include allegations that McGuiness hired her daughter and one of her daughter’s friends, both high school seniors at the time, as temporary employees in May 2020, even though other temporary employees had to leave their positions because of the lack of available work amid the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said Elizabeth McGuiness, who has not been charged, continued to be paid even after enrolling at a college in South Carolina last August, and she was still listed as an employee as recently as Aug. 28 of this year. She was initially listed as a “public information officer” and later as an “intern.” McGuiness also is charged with orchestrating a 2019 no-bid “communications services” contract for a company she had used as a campaign consultant when running for lieutenant governor in 2016.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Howard University and Netflix have announced a $5.4 million endowed scholarship to honor the late actor, writer, producer and Howard alumnus Chadwick Boseman, WUSA-TV reports. The Chadwick A. Boseman Memorial Scholarship will provide incoming students in the College of Fine Arts, recently named for Boseman, with a four-year scholarship to cover the full cost of tuition, the university said. “This scholarship embodies Chadwick’s love for Howard, his passion for storytelling, and his willingness to support future generations of Howard students,” Howard University President Dr. Wayne A.I. Frederick said in a release. “I am thankful for the continuous support and partnership of Chadwick’s wife, Mrs. Simone Ledward-Boseman, and to Netflix for this important gift.” The scholarship was established with the support of Ledward-Boseman, with Netflix as the inaugural donor. The first four scholarships were earmarked for one recipient in each class beginning this fall, and they’ll continue to be distributed to an incoming freshman every year. The university said the scholarship will focus on students who exemplify exceptional skills in the arts, reminiscent of Boseman, and who demonstrate financial need.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The state is investigating dozens of local governments, performing arts centers, the Miami Marlins, a law enforcement counterterrorism unit and a concert by singer Harry Styles for violating a law prohibiting businesses and governments from requiring people to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination. About 120 cases are being reviewed for violations of Florida’s “vaccine passport” law, which took effect last month and can result in a $5,000 fine per violation, according to a public records request from the Orlando Sentinel. The law is being challenged in court and conflicts with a Biden administration order that companies with over 100 employees require them to be vaccinated or face weekly coronavirus testing. In central Florida, the list includes Orange County government; the Orange County Convention Center; AdventHealth, one of the state’s largest health care systems; several performing arts venues; and the Amway Center, which is home to the Orlando Magic and recently hosted a concert by Styles whose tour mandated attendees either be vaccinated or have a negative test. “At this point … the courts have not reached the final decision, but the indication is that the Florida law flies in the face of our Florida Constitution and perhaps in the face of common sense,” Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings told the newspaper.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Officials in Fulton County, where election operations are already under review by the state, have fired two workers accused of shredding paper voter registration applications, according to a county statement released Monday. Preliminary information indicates the employees checked out batches of applications for processing, and they are alleged to have shredded some of the forms, the Fulton County statement said. Fellow employees reported the alleged actions to their supervisor Friday morning, and the two employees were fired that day. The county statement said the applications were received in the past two weeks. Fulton County includes most of the city of Atlanta, where voters are set to go to the polls Nov. 2 to elect a mayor, City Council members and other municipal officials. The deadline to register to vote in that election was Oct. 4. It’s not immediately clear whether the 300 voter registration records in question were lost, county spokeswoman Jessica Corbitt said. “Normally, processing a voter registration application involves entering them in the state system, updating them, verifying their information,” she said. “That is the matter that’s under investigation – was that process completed.” Voters don’t register by party in Georgia, so the applications had no party affiliation.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: The median sales price of a single-family home in Maui County dropped below $1 million last month as people priced out of the market have chosen to pause their homebuying. The Maui News reports the median sales price for a single-family home in the county stood at $996,500 in September. That’s up 27.3% from the same month last year. But it’s below levels from May through August, when the median topped $1 million for four straight months. Median sales prices for single-family homes in Kauai and Honolulu counties have also topped $1 million this year. The September report from the Realtors Association of Maui said declining affordability has had “a significant impact” on homebuyers who have been priced out of the market. Association President Keone Ball said Sunday that he believes prices will go back up. “The problem is the volume – you know, there isn’t enough for sale,” he said, noting that low inventory combined with high demand for affordable housing is also a nationwide problem. Pending sales decreased 4.3% for single-family homes in Maui County but increased 5.7% for condominiums. Ball said investment in condos may have spiked due to the settling of the COVID-19 pandemic, affordability and condominiums being “the only option.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials will make available up to $200,000 to be divided into payments for hunters and trappers who kill wolves in the state through next summer. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game late last month entered into an agreement with a nonprofit hunting group to reimburse the expenses for a proven kill. The agreement follows a change in Idaho law aimed at killing more wolves that are blamed for attacking livestock and reducing deer and elk herds. Montana this year also expanded when, where and how wolves can be killed. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, at the request of environmental groups concerned about the expanded wolf killing in the two states, last month announced a yearlong review to see if wolves in the U.S. West should be relisted under the Endangered Species Act. Idaho has managed wolves since they were taken off the list in 2011. State wildlife managers had been incrementally increasing wolf harvest during that time – but not fast enough for lawmakers, who earlier this year passed the law backed by some trappers and the powerful ranching sector. Republican Gov. Brad Little signed the measure lawmakers said could lead to killing 90% of the state’s 1,500 wolves before federal authorities would take over management.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Al Capone died nearly 75 years ago, but it’s clear interest in the infamous Chicago gangster is very much alive after some of his prized possessions were auctioned off over the weekend for at least $3 million. The Chicago Tribune reports Capone’s family sold several of his belongings, including what was billed as his favorite gun, at auction in California, where his three surviving granddaughters live. The event, called “A Century of Notoriety: The Estate of Al Capone,” was held at a private club in Sacramento and attracted nearly 1,000 registered bidders, including 150 who attended the nearly four-hour-long event in person. Among the items up for auction was a bear-shaped humidor as well as diamond jewelry and some family photographs. The most popular item proved to be Capone’s favorite Colt .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol, which went for $860,000. The story of Capone, the original “Scarface,” is a familiar one, thanks in large part to a host of movies, television shows and books about the mobster. Called Public Enemy No. 1 after the 1929 “Valentine’s Day Massacre” in which seven members of a rival bootlegger gang were gunned down in a Lincoln Park parking garage, Capone was convicted of income tax evasion in 1934. He spent 11 years locked up in Alcatraz and died of a heart attack in 1947.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: More than 6,600 Afghan refugees who began arriving at the Indiana National Guard’s Camp Atterbury training post nearly six weeks ago are awaiting resettlement. Additional evacuees are expected to arrive in the coming weeks, although it’s unclear how many, said Mark Howell, regional spokesman for the federal Transportation Security Administration overseeing Operation Allies Welcome. Officials said they’re also uncertain if the refugees will be permanently resettled by early November, as hoped. Howell said Friday that many Afghans are still completing medical and security screening checks. Once cleared, they’ll work with nongovernmental organizations to determine housing assignments, sponsor families and work authorizations before they can leave the post. Camp Atterbury, about 25 miles south of Indianapolis, is one of eight sites in the U.S. that the Department of Defense is using for Afghan special immigrant visa applicants, their families and other Afghan personnel. Exodus Refugee Immigration, an Indianapolis agency, has helped at least four Afghan families resettle in the city in the past month, Executive Director Cole Varga said. They were all U.S. citizens or had visas and family ties to the area. It’s unclear how many Afghans have resettled in Indiana, but the state is projected to take 490, according to U.S. officials.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A judge has found a local activist guilty of a felony theft count for taking a police flyer used to identify protesters from an officer’s back pocket during a protest last year. Alexandria Dea, 27, was found guilty of first-degree theft Monday by Judge David Porter after she waived her right to a jury trial and consented to allow the judge to base his decision on facts already on the record. Dea is expected to seek a deferred judgment when she’s sentenced Dec. 7. Prosecutors have said Dea picked up and threw a police radio that fell to the ground as the officer scuffled with a protester July 1, 2020. She was also accused of taking the intelligence bulletin from an officer’s back pocket during the confrontation, then giving it to another Black Lives Matter activist who gave it to a television reporter. Dea and the other activist had also initially been charged with a rarely used count of leaking intelligence data, but the charge was dismissed in July after a judge ruled that the bulletin did not count as “intelligence data.”\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: An organization run by rapper Jay-Z has facilitated donations totaling $1 million for an effort to investigate wrongful convictions in Wyandotte County. The money was raised by Team Roc, which is the criminal justice division of Jay-Z’s entertainment organization, Roc Nation, the Kansas City Star reports. Tricia Rojo Bushnell, executive director of the Midwest Innocence Project, called it “a huge investment,” adding that the ability to look at these cases is going to shine a light on what the group needs to do to provide a just criminal legal system in Wyandotte County. Among those injustices is the wrongful conviction of Lamonte McIntyre, who spent 23 years in prison for two murders he did not commit in Kansas City, Kansas. Another is the case of Olin “Pete” Coones Jr., who spent 12 years in prison before he was exonerated of a Wyandotte County murder – only to die from cancer that went undiagnosed 108 days after he was freed. About 40 others have asked the innocence project to investigate their convictions in Wyandotte County, Rojo Bushnell said Monday. In September, Team Roc filed a petition seeking records from the Kansas City, Kansas, police department related to what it calls a history of officer misconduct within the agency.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The city has agreed to pay $75,000 to a couple who say police removed them from their car and frisked them because they were Black and driving a nice vehicle. But in an unusual condition of the payment, the couple and their lawyers are forbidden from criticizing the Louisville Metro Government or the police officers involved. The prohibition includes criticisms in statements to the media or on social media, according to a copy of the settlement obtained under open records laws. Michael Abate, a lawyer for the Louisville Courier Journal and the Kentucky Press Association, said the stipulations are “totally improper.” “The city is paying to silence its critics,” he said. “It is paying them off. And it seems designed to impede reform. It is bad policy and really troubling.” In a statement, First Assistant County Attorney Ingrid Geiser said the couple “are not prohibited from talking truthfully about what happened during their traffic stop,” though she said the language “should have more accurately reflected the agreement of the parties.” In their federal lawsuit, Anthony Parker Sr. and Demetria Firman, who are now married, say they were pulled over in 2018 for failing to use a turn signal, but body camera footage from one of the officers showed their turn signal was on.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s problem of wasted COVID-19 vaccine shots continues to balloon, with about 224,000 doses thrown out across Louisiana as health providers can’t find enough residents willing to roll up their sleeves. The number of trashed doses has nearly tripled since the end of July, even as the state grappled with a fourth, deadly surge of the coronavirus pandemic during that time that led to increased interest in the vaccines. The latest data provided by the Louisiana Department of Health showed 223,918 doses of the two-shot Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine have been thrown out. That’s relatively small compared to the 4.4 million vaccine doses administered around the state. But while waste is not uncommon in mass immunization efforts, the throwing away of doses in the United States comes as millions of people around the globe still are waiting for the opportunity to get inoculated against COVID-19. Most of Louisiana’s wasted vaccine doses happened because vials containing the shots were opened, but hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and other providers couldn’t find someone to take the doses, health department spokesperson Kevin Litten said. More than 21,500 shots simply weren’t used before their expiration dates. Louisiana has one of the nation’s lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Environmental regulators will soon undertake a statewide investigation to find concentrations of long-lasting environmental pollutants. The investigation stems from the state’s efforts to mitigate a class of chemicals known as PFAS, also called “forever chemicals.” The substances are a problem in some parts of Maine because of the long-standing use of municipal sludge and paper mill waste as farm fertilizer, the Portland Press Herald reports. The state set aside $30 million to test for the chemicals and install filtration systems in areas with contaminated water. Maine officials also plan to help farmers and start cleaning up sites, the Press Herald reports. Maine is hiring and training 17 new staff members for the effort. The state needs to decide which of more than 500 sludge application sites should be prioritized for testing. Sewage sludge as farm fertilizer has caused environmental problems in other parts of the country as well. The chemicals also carry human health risks.\n\nMaryland\n\nGaithersburg: Four police officers will not be charged for fatally shooting a Black man they said fired first during a late-night foot chase in January. A grand jury declined to charge the officers from the Gaithersburg Police Department due to lack of evidence in a decision announced last week. The officers, members of a plainclothes street crimes unit, told investigators they saw a “muzzle flash” from a gun aimed at them by Kwamena Ocran, 24, according to their recorded statements released by Montgomery County prosecutors. One officer said he heard a round pass by his head. All four fired on Ocran, who was running away from them. He was hit eight times, according to a report from prosecutors. The shooting happened outside an apartment complex after officers said they received a tip that Ocran was illegally carrying a gun he intended to sell, according to the report. The incident was not recorded on video. Another officer arrived at the scene moments later and recorded footage of a gun next to Ocran’s body, but investigators could not find evidence he had fired it. Crime scene technicians failed to find shell casings from Ocran’s gun – only the 23 shell casings from the officers’ guns, prosecutors said. Howard County Deputy State’s Attorney Christopher Sandmann told The Washington Post that investigators had prepped Ocran’s hands for gunshot reside analysis, but there was a “mistake or miscommunication,” and his hands were never swabbed.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A letter written by founding father Alexander Hamilton during the Revolutionary War and believed stolen decades ago from the state archives has been returned following a federal appeals court decision, officials said Tuesday. Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin hailed the homecoming, after last week’s decision by the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a previous ruling by a district court judge. The letter was reputedly stolen between 1938 and 1945 by a “kleptomaniacal cataloguer” who worked at the archives, according to the court decision. Hamilton wrote the letter to the Marquis de Lafayette, a French aristocrat who served as a general in the Continental Army. Dated July 21, 1780, the letter resulted in Massachusetts sending troops to Rhode Island “to bolster the embattled French forces,” the appeals court wrote. Galvin, whose office oversees the archives and the Commonwealth Museum, said he was pleased the court ruled “that this historical treasure belongs to the people.” The letter is expected to be put on display at the museum for special events, including the annual Independence Day celebration, Galvin said.\n\nMichigan\n\nCenter Line: An employee at a suburban Detroit nursing home filled out absentee ballot applications for two dozen residents without consulting them before the 2020 election, authorities said Monday. The case was one of three cases of alleged fraud announced by the state. “Our election system is secure, and today’s charges demonstrate that in the rare circumstances when fraud occurs, we catch it and hold the perpetrators accountable,” Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said. A woman who worked at the Father Murray home in Center Line was charged with election forgery and signature forgery. In another case, a Detroit woman was accused of signing her grandson’s name on an absentee ballot and returning it, even though he had decided to vote at a polling place. In a third investigation, a woman who served as a guardian was charged in several communities after authorities said she fraudulently submitted 26 absentee ballot applications and sought to have ballots mailed directly to her. Benson and Attorney General Dana Nessel praised local election officials for noticing irregularities. “We will not hesitate to prosecute anyone who attempts to undermine our elections,” Nessel said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBeaver Bay: A Lake Superior lighthouse plans to welcome visitors back for an annual memorial honoring the sailors who died when the Edmund Fitzgerald sank. Every Nov. 10, the day the ship sank in a gale in 1975, the Split Rock Lighthouse just south of Beaver Bay holds a beacon lighting. Lighthouse officials announce the names of all 29 sailors who died as a bell tolls, Minnesota Public Radio reports. The lighthouse didn’t allow visitors to attend last year’s ceremony because of COVID-19 concerns. People had to listen through an online livestream. Lighthouse officials say this year’s ceremony will be a hybrid, with the lighthouse grounds open to the public and a livestream on the Minnesota Historical Society’s Facebook and YouTube pages for those who can’t attend. The ceremony will begin at 4:30 p.m. “There’s something about being here on site and hearing the bell ring and the names being read off and then seeing the beacon turned on right after that. There’s just something very special about that,” said Hayes Scriven, the lighthouse site manager. “It’s just a way to connect with the past and remember that Lake Superior is a fickle animal, and you’ve got to respect the power and not take it for granted.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Book Festival is being shown online after the in-person event was canceled because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Organizers say videos of 31 panel discussions have been recorded in the past month. Those became available Tuesday on the festival’s website, msbookfestival.com. “We’ve got an amazing group of authors and moderators who have rallied to record more than 35 hours of great conversations about books and writing,” Executive Director Ellen Daniels said in a news release. “Honoring these writers and continuing to engage our loyal and growing community of book lovers is what the festival is all about.” Among the authors speaking are Curtis Wilkie, Kiese Laymon, Nic Stone, W. Ralph Eubanks, Jerry Mitchell, Catherine Pierce, Beth Ann Fennelly, Mitch Landrieu, William Ferris, Angie Thomas, Aimee Nezhukumatathil, Robert Khayat and Kai Bird. The festival originally was scheduled for Aug. 21 at the Mississippi Capitol and nearby Galloway United Methodist Church in downtown Jackson. Organizers switched to the online format because the state was experiencing a surge of COVID-19 cases at the time.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Data shows that most of the people who participated in the state’s COVID-19 vaccine lottery were already immunized before the program started. The incentive program was started in July as Missouri struggled to control a surge of coronavirus cases driven by the more transmissible delta variant in less-vaccinated communities. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services conducted the last of the drawings in the program Friday. Among the participants, 57,117 adults got the shot after the program was announced, while nearly 600,000 got the shot beforehand, The Kansas City Star reports. The program also had more than 39,000 entries from children 12 and up. In total, the state will pay out $9 million to 900 prizewinners, who will each receive $10,000 in either cash or, for the youth winners, scholarship accounts. Anyone who had gotten at least one dose of a vaccine was eligible to enter, but separate drawings were conducted for those who had already gotten a shot, making the odds of winning higher for the newly vaccinated. Just over 48% of Missouri’s total population is fully vaccinated now, up from about 40% when the incentive program was announced.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: All local calls in the state must be dialed with the 406 area code to connect beginning Oct. 24 due to changing federal regulations. Montana’s 406 area code currently allows seven-digit dialing to complete local calls. That will change this month due to a Federal Communications Commission order designating 988 as the new nationwide number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Some seven-digit phone numbers in Montana’s 406 area code begin with 988. To prevent misdialing the 988 Lifeline, all local calls in Montana must be dialed with the area code. Calls that are currently considered local for billing purposes will continue to be billed as local calls. Existing seven-digit phone numbers will not change but will require the 406 area code to connect. Three-digit dialing services, such as the 911 emergency number, will continue to work as a three-digit number with no need to dial an area code. Along with manually dialed calls, all services that use automated dialing will need to be updated to include 10-digit phone numbers. The 988 number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline will be available beginning July 16, 2022.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Police are investigating after downtown pedestrians were forced to dodge deck chairs, tables and bricks thrown from a rooftop. The Omaha World-Herald reports the incident happened Saturday night when items were thrown from the roof of the nine-story Old Market Lofts apartments. Omaha resident Lisa Brauer told the newspaper she was nearly struck by several objects. Brauer, who works for Park Omaha, was checking parking meters when she was nearly hit by a rock. That was followed by a metal table, a metal chair and a grill rack, all landing within inches of her. A police report said a pickup truck was hit by something and sustained $2,000 in damage. No arrests have been made.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Two historic locomotives that were part of the pioneering shift from steam-powered to diesel-electric trains in the mid-1900s are coming back to their home in a northeast Nevada railyard. Built in 1951, Locomotive 201 is the last survivor among 38 experimental models manufactured by the American Locomotive Company. It is scheduled to be loaded onto a truck Nov. 2 at the Northwest Railway Museum in Snoqualmie, Washington, where it still sometimes pulls excursion trains on the museum’s Snoqualmie Valley Railroad. The truck hauling the 286,000-pound engine will take four or five days at a top speed of about 35 mph to make the 900-mile trip back to Ely at the Nevada Northern Railway Museum near the Nevada-Utah line, railway President Mark Bassett said. Details are still pending for the return from Delta, Utah, of the No. 401, the first special-duty model General Motors built in 1952 in its Electro-Motive Division. It was the only one painted in the “Desert War Bonnet” scheme, a cream, scarlet and black design that remains on it today. It became known as the “Last Empress of Ely.” “These both are one-of-a-kind locomotives,” Bassett said. “Both have a story to tell, and they are both tied into the early days of dieselization of the Nevada Northern Railway.” The museum plans to restore each and eventually return them to operation for tour rides.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: For the first time, New Hampshire’s only state-run psychiatric treatment facility has negotiated contracts with all major insurance carriers in the state. Carriers now under contract with New Hampshire Hospital include Aetna, Ambetter, Anthem, Cigna, Harvard Pilgrim and United Health Care, state officials said. “Over the past few years, we have made significant strides to rebuild New Hampshire’s mental health system, and those critical efforts will continue,” Gov. Chris Sununu said in a statement. “Having insurer contracts in place is an important step and will help alleviate the financial uncertainty that has been a challenge for patients at New Hampshire Hospital for decades.” Previously, special case agreements were negotiated on a patient-by-patient basis. However, some care was uncompensated. The practice of New Hampshire Hospital is to accept all patients regardless of insurance coverage. New Hampshire Hospital is currently the only inpatient institute for adults with serious mental illnesses in the state.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: No one understands the stress a nurse faces on the job better than another nurse. And nothing has caused more stress for nurses than the COVID pandemic, as front-line caregivers guard against exposure to the coronavirus, witness patient deaths, and worry about family members and friends becoming infected. A confidential mental health help line, staffed by current and retired nurses, was launched Monday for nurses and their family members in the state. The Nurse2Nurse help line – at 844-687-7301 – is based at Rutgers Behavioral Health Services and available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. “It’s in our hearts to help the healers,” said Barbara Brilliantine, one of the nurses staffing the help line. “We’ve walked in their shoes.” The counselors include active and retired nurses who receive training in reciprocal peer support and wellness principles and are mental health and peer support specialists. Services are also available through virtual support groups, wellness webinars and other resources at nurse2nursenj.com. Information provided on the calls is confidential, the sponsors say. The website says the project is not affiliated with any health care system or nursing organization, and no information from the calls will be shared with employers, co-workers or peers.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The final price tag for a settlement reached by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and a former campaign spokesman to settle accusations of harassment is now $150,000. The latest round of payments was disclosed in a mandatory campaign finance report that the Democrat’s campaign filed Monday. The twice-annual report on spending and contributions shows the incumbent has raised $2.5 million since April for her reelection bid as several Republicans are vying to take back the office. GOP state Rep. Rebecca Dow raised more than $440,500 since announcing her candidacy in early July. Her campaign said she has received contributions from more than 1,300 donors. In the settlement involving Lujan Grisham, former campaign staffer James Hallinan had accused Lujan Grisham of dropping water on his crotch and then grabbing his crotch in the midst of a campaign staff meeting prior to the election – accusations that the governor denies. Lujan Grisham said earlier this year that she decided to resolve the matter because she wanted to focus her attention on the pandemic. At the time, the governor said there hadn’t been any other financial settlements and nondisclosure agreements of a similar nature.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Recreational marijuana legalization is moving into a new phase. After stifling staff delays brought on by political infighting, newly minted members of the state Cannabis Control Board are now interpreting and shaping the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act, the cannabis law approved by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and lawmakers last spring. Much of what the redefined medical cannabis program and the implementation of the potentially lucrative legal market will look like in the Empire State is in the purview of the five-person panel, which had its first meeting last week. The board must do that work while putting particular emphasis on social equity and repairing the harms done during the substance’s prohibition. Already, language in the law has legalized possession of 3 ounces of cannabis for people 21 and over. However, some of the regulations for localities, as well as the licensing process and social equity provisions, have yet to materialize. Kristin Jordan of Park Jordan, a commercial real estate brokerage and cannabis industry advisory firm, said the cannabis regulators don’t have a model in other states in how to legalize while accentuating social equity. “So I think more than anything we’ve got a roadmap of what didn’t work,” said Jordan, the firm’s founder and CEO.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson is facing calls to resign from elected officials and LGBTQ advocacy groups over comments he made criticizing sexual education and likening gay and transgender people to “filth.” “There’s no reason anybody anywhere in America should be telling any child about transgenderism, homosexuality, any of that filth,” Robinson said at Asbury Baptist Church in Seagrove. The state’s highest Republican executive officeholder, already the focus of criticism for trying to influence how racism can be discussed in public schools, is getting more pushback since Right Wing Watch, a project of the progressive advocacy group People for the American Way, posted the video on social media last week. The Human Rights Campaign, Equality North Carolina, prominent Democratic lawmakers and the White House have condemned the remarks, with some demanding the lieutenant governor’s resignation. In a video posted on his Facebook page Saturday, Robinson narrated over images depicting gay sex that were taken from “Gender Queer,” an illustrated book he claimed “is currently in North Carolina schools,” though it wasn’t mentioned in the 831-page report he released in August highlighting cases of alleged “indoctrination.” In 2017, Robinson wrote: “You CAN NOT love God and support the homosexual agenda.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State wildlife officials are urging people to keep an eye out for migrating whooping cranes. The North Dakota Fish and Game Department says a portion of a population of 500 cranes is crossing the state on a 2,500-mile migration from nesting grounds at Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada to wintering grounds in Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Texas. The agency says anyone who spots cranes should leave them alone but record the date, time and location along with the birds’ activities and report the sighting to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The reports help biologists locate crane habitat areas, monitor marked birds, and determine population numbers and migration routes.\n\nOhio\n\nNelsonville: Thanks to a long-forgotten state law from 1953 and a community dinner, the city has challenged the results of the 2020 U.S. census. The results of last year’s count had downgraded the Athens County community from a city to a village after counting 4,612 residents – a 780-person drop from the 2010 census. Under Ohio law, the 5,000-resident level demarcates the difference between a city and a village. “We knew it was wrong,” City Auditor Taylor Sappington said. On Tuesday morning, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose agreed, restoring Nelsonville’s city status. Sappington set out to prove the city’s case by collecting census information and signatures from the town’s 5,373 residents. After a preliminary federal census report demotes a city to a village, state law gives a city auditor the authority to conduct a re-enumeration if the municipality’s governing body passes a resolution directing the auditor to do so, according to a statute in the Ohio Revised Code. After the City Council took that action, Sappington appointed five enumerators, who canvassed each block of Nelsonville over 10 days. Last week, volunteers served ham, green beans, cheesy potatoes, salad and rolls donated by Texas Roadhouse at a free community dinner where residents could come down to the town square to be counted, Sappington told council members Monday night. “I’m so proud of this community,” he said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The city and Tulsa County have each announced they will officially recognize Juneteenth as a holiday. June 19 will be an additional paid holiday for city and county employees beginning in 2022. June 19, 1865, is the day Union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas – some 21/ 2 years after President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation had freed slaves in Southern states. “Juneteenth is an important day in our country’s history, and I’m glad we are able to celebrate freedom for all Americans in this way by joining Tulsa County in adding Juneteenth to our official holiday schedule,” Mayor G.T. Bynum said in a statement Monday announcing the holiday. A 1921 massacre in Tulsa left an estimated 300 Black people dead at the hands of white mobs. Then-President Donald Trump scheduled his first campaign rally amid the coronavirus pandemic for June 19, 2020, in Tulsa but later rescheduled the rally for the following day amid widespread criticism from Black leaders. In June, President Joe Biden signed legislation officially recognizing the day as a federal holiday.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Former Oregon Secretary of State Bev Clarno and three other Republicans have filed a lawsuit to challenge new congressional districts recently passed by state lawmakers. They say the new maps are partisan gerrymandering, unconstitutional and contrary to state law. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the suit, filed Monday in Marion County Circuit Court, is the first such attempt to alter the six-district map that Democrats pushed through during a contentious special legislative session last month. That session nearly ended in a Republican walkout after House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland, reneged on a deal to grant the GOP an equal say in new congressional and legislative maps. Instead, Republican lawmakers showed up on the last possible day and allowed Democrats to pass a map that could lead to Democratic control of five of the state’s now-six seats in Congress. Oregon picked up an additional U.S. House seat because of population gains recorded by the recent U.S. census. The suit notes that four of the state’s six new congressional districts include part of the Portland metro area, which the Republicans say is a sign Democrats improperly stocked the districts with left-leaning voters. They have asked the court to block the plan and draw its own.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Total enrollment at Pennsylvania’s 14 state-owned universities has declined to the lowest level in decades, according to data released Monday. The State System of Higher Education figures indicate loss of another 5,000-plus students this fall, dropping the universities’ total enrollment below 89,000 students – a level not seen in more than three decades, dating nearly to the system’s founding, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. PennLive.com reports the percentage drop in enrollment was the highest in well over two decades. System officials earlier warned state lawmakers and others that the 2021-22 year would be a “very challenging” one for enrollment, citing factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The system, founded in 1983, saw its enrollment peak at about 119,500 students in 2010 but saw the total drop to 94,000 last year. A review of system data indicates that the current total below 89,000 is lower than in any year since 1989, the Post-Gazette reports. Chancellor Dan Greenstein said the drop likely stems from the pandemic finally catching up with the system, which had avoided the declines other institutions saw last year. He said anecdotal accounts point to the pandemic’s impact on family incomes and students taking advantage of $15 and $20 per hour wages some firms are offering.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Mayor Jorge Elorza wants to spend up to $1.6 million in federal coronavirus relief funding to establish nonviolence training and youth mentorship programs to address an increase in violence in the city. Providence recently opened requests for proposals for both initiatives, planning to allocate up to $500,000 in American Rescue Plan funds for training and up to $1.1 million for mentorship. Elorza said the idea began taking shape in May when nine people were injured in a shooting. “I reached out to some community leaders, sort of on the front line of things, and I asked them to put me in contact with families, mothers who had lost children, people who were either on parole or on probation, but were trying to turn their life around, and other folks who are on the front lines of living and working with these issues,” Elorza said. It became clear that the city was in need of more opportunities for youth, he said. There have been 20 homicides in the city this year. The five-year average for this point in the year is 11.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The South Carolina State Fair returns Wednesday after a hiatus brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. Last year’s event was drive-thru only due to a high number of COVID-19 cases. On Tuesday, Department of Health and Environmental Control officials reported that such cases have dropped below 1,000 for the first time since July. More than 50% of South Carolinians are fully vaccinated against the disease caused by the virus. State fair officials have instituted new protocols to prevent the virus’s spread, including increased cleaning, hygiene signage, hand sanitizer stations and reminding guests that in Columbia they must wear a face covering, WIS-TV reports. Guests are also encouraged to socially distance, use card and touchless methods for payments, and not come to the fair if they aren’t feeling well. The event, which runs through Oct. 24, includes rides, food, agriculture and livestock shows, crafts, art and a cookie kitchen.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Lawmakers redrawing the state’s political boundaries kicked off a three-day tour of public input meetings Monday amid intraparty Republican bickering and competing proposals for new legislative districts. The House and Senate committees, both dominated by Republicans, had previously sought accord in the once-in-a-decade process. But at a public input meeting in Box Elder, the schism between the House and Senate was on full display during the tour, dubbed “the redistricting roadshow” by lawmakers. The Legislature will convene Nov. 8 to consider new political boundaries, which must also be approved by Gov. Kristi Noem. If they can’t reach a consensus by Dec. 1, redistricting would be determined by the state Supreme Court. As Republicans accused each other of gerrymandering and “D.C. political tactics,” members of Native American communities used the meetings to press for greater representation in the Legislature. At the first meeting Monday, advocates pushed for compact political boundaries around northern Rapid City, which has a large number of Native Americans, that would allow the community to elect someone who represents its interests. The lawmakers are making seven stops this week, culminating with two meetings in Sioux Falls on Wednesday.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge on Tuesday slightly tweaked his order requiring Knox County schools to implement a school mask mandate, saying officials would be allowed to approve exemptions on a case-by-case basis. In his 14-page ruling, however, U.S. District Judge J. Ronnie Greer warned school officials – who had previously refused to adopt a mask mandate amid the COVID-19 outbreak – that the new mask exemption policy must not be abused. “The court reminds the Knox County Board of Education that its school system is no longer under a voluntary mask mandate; rather, it is under a court-ordered mask mandate,” Greer wrote. “The record evidence supports the need for – and the court ordered – a universal mask mandate, and the court fully expects its mask mandate to be exactly that: universal, to every possible extent, with ‘very few’ medical exemptions.” The Knox County Board of Education must file monthly status reports that identify not only the number of exemptions for students, employees and visitors but also the specific reasons for the exemptions. Greer said he would impose “considerable sanctions” if the education board did not comply with his latest order.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The state’s child welfare agency is being accused of removing a webpage that provided information about a suicide prevention hotline and other resources for young LGBTQ people, following criticism by one of Gov. Greg Abbott’s primary challengers. The Houston Chronicle reports Abbott challenger Don Huffines posted a video on Twitter in August accusing the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services of “promoting transgender sexual policies to Texas youth.” Within hours of the video being posted, the webpage was removed. The page appeared in a section of the agency’s website called “Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation.” Also gone was the entire website for the Texas Youth Connection, a division of Family and Protective Services that steers young people in foster care to various resources, including education, housing and those on its LGBTQ page. “These are not Texas values, these are not Republican Party values, but these are obviously Greg Abbott’s values,” Huffines said in his video. Abbott, who appoints the department’s commissioner and nine-member council, didn’t respond to the newspaper’s request for comment. Agency communications obtained through a public records request show that employees discussed removing the page in response to Huffines’ tweet.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Lawyers for Gov. Spencer Cox’s former campaign manager, who resigned last week after an investigation substantiated claims of sexual misconduct made against him by a female campaign employee, are calling the accusations baseless. In a statement Friday, lawyers representing Austin Cox said the relationship in question was a long-term one between two young adults that he ended earlier this year, KUTV reports. “Our client unequivocally and emphatically denies any allegations to the contrary,” the statement said. The Republican governor said Thursday that an independent investigation found cause to terminate Austin Cox, his 2020 campaign manager, but he resigned before its completion. The investigation also revealed previously unreported “hostile conduct” toward other members of the team. Austin Cox’s attorneys on Friday additionally criticized a joint statement from the governor and Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson on Thursday that condemned the former campaign manager’s behavior. KUTV requested to speak with Austin Cox on Friday, but his attorney declined their request for an interview. The governor and former campaign manager are not related.\n\nVermont\n\nBennington: An Abraham Lincoln statue at a museum was vandalized with the number “38,” which police say they believe is a reference to the execution of 38 Native Americans ordered by the former president in 1862. Police said an employee at the Bennington Museum arrived Sunday morning to find a large “LAND BACK” banner had been put up between two light poles at the entrance to the museum’s courtyard. The Lincoln statue in the courtyard had reddish spray paint on its face and hands, along with the number “38” painted on its chest, police said. Officials said it is expected to cost several thousand dollars to repair the statue and remove the paint. Police said they believe the vandalism is a reference to the Dakota 38, who were executed after the 1862 Dakota War, also known as the Sioux Uprising of 1862. A military commission sentenced 303 Sioux fighters to be executed. Lincoln reviewed the cases and decided there was evidence that 39 Sioux were guilty of murder or rape during the uprising and ordered their execution. The remaining 264 sentences were commuted. One of those sentenced to be executed received a reprieve. The Bennington Museum describes itself as a museum of art, history and innovation.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Former President Barack Obama will campaign with fellow Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the final stretch of the gubernatorial race. “The stakes could not be greater,” McAuliffe said as he announced the news Tuesday morning on MSNBC. McAuliffe’s race against the GOP nominee, first-time political candidate Glenn Youngkin, is tightening, according to the latest polls. His effort to win a second, nonconsecutive term in office is one of only two regularly scheduled governor’s races in the country this year and is being closely watched for indications of voter sentiment ahead of next year’s midterms. McAuliffe’s campaign announced that Obama will join him in Richmond on Oct. 23 to mobilize Virginians during early voting, which began weeks ago and runs in person through Oct. 30. Obama rallied Democrats in Virginia’s capital city in 2017 before Ralph Northam beat Republican gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie by nearly 9 percentage points. He’ll follow other high-profile Democrats visiting the commonwealth to support McAuliffe. First lady Jill Biden is set to visit on Friday. Stacey Abrams, the voting rights activist, grassroots organizer and former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate, will campaign with McAuliffe in Norfolk and northern Virginia on Sunday.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Rewards totaling $2.5 million are now being offered for information that helps solve the killing of federal prosecutor Thomas C. Wales in Seattle 20 years ago. Nicholas Brown, newly sworn in as the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Washington, announced Monday at a ceremony marking the anniversary of Wales’ death that the Justice Department had doubled its reward to $2 million, in addition to about $500,000 being offered by the National Association of Former U.S. Attorneys. Brown also said his office – long recused from the case – is taking on leadership of the investigation, as there are few remaining assistant U.S. attorneys in Seattle who worked with Wales. The investigation had been overseen by a special prosecutor in New York, Steve Clymer; transferring the oversight to Seattle will allow for fresh eyes and additional resources, Brown said. “Twenty years is far too long for this crime – this attack on the American justice system – to go unresolved,” Brown said. Wales was an 18-year veteran of the U.S. attorney’s office who focused on white-collar crime and also served as president of a gun-control group called Washington CeaseFire. A gunman shot him through a basement window of his home Oct. 11, 2001.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Lawmakers endorsed proposed maps of congressional and state legislative districts during a special session on redistricting Monday, setting up a potential fight between two of the state’s current members of Congress. West Virginia lost one of its three U.S. House seats after the 2020 census, and lawmakers are trying to redraw the state into two congressional districts. In the proposed map, Rep. David McKinley and Rep. Alex Mooney would be in the same district. All three current U.S. House members from West Virginia are Republicans. The state Senate redistricting committee forwarded its versions of congressional and state Senate maps Monday. Earlier in the day, a map that reconfigures all 100 House of Delegates seats into separate, single-member districts was endorsed by a House committee. The maps now go before the committees’ respective full chambers. The congressional redistricting map endorsed by the House committee would split the state roughly into north and south sections. The 1st District would include both panhandles and much of the northern part of the state along with Wood County on the western edge. The 2nd District would include the southern coalfields and the Greenbrier Valley, extending north into Ritchie County.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state’s Democratic attorney general, who represents the state elections commission, on Monday called for a Republican-ordered investigation into the 2020 presidential election to be shut down, saying it is a partisan political effort that lacks credibility, wastes taxpayer money and is not serious. “This investigation suffers from glaring flaws that destroy any credibility its results could have had,” Attorney General Josh Kaul said at a news conference. “Shut this fake investigation down.” Kaul’s comments came after the Republican leader of the Assembly election committee said she’s been kept out of the loop and doesn’t agree with moves being made by the leader of the probe. The latest twists comes after Michael Gableman, the retired Wisconsin Supreme Court justice leading the investigation, issued a video over the weekend taking aim at Gov. Tony Evers. The Democratic governor told local election officials they should be “lawyered up” and called the taxpayer-funded investigation a “$700,000 boondoggle.” Gableman called that “an incomplete and misguided view” of the probe. Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos ordered the investigation under pressure from Donald Trump, who has falsely claimed he won Wisconsin last year.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Rapper, music producer and clothing entrepreneur Kanye West has put his ranch and business properties in northwestern Wyoming up for sale. The West Ranch, formerly known as Monster Lake Ranch, went on the market Monday for $11 million. The property sprawls across 6 square miles of open land and tree-studded hills and outcrops about 6 miles south of Cody. The property features lakes, a lodge, a commercial kitchen, equipment sheds, a horse facility, corrals and a go-kart track, according to the DBW Realty listing. The listing came days after West listed his seven commercial properties in Cody for more than $3.2 million, the Cody Enterprise reports. The ranch, which leases additional land owned by the U.S. government, was listed for $13.3 million before West bought it in 2019, though it’s unknown how much he paid for the property. Wyoming law does not provide for public disclosure of real estate sale amounts. West moved from California to Wyoming in 2019 and set about basing at least some of his clothing business in Cody, a city of about 10,000 on the eastern approach to Yellowstone National Park. It wasn’t clear if the property sales mean West is leaving Wyoming or just reorganizing his business there.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/07/anti-pipeline-push-lynyrd-skynyrd-gopher-frogs-news-around-states/118674524/", "title": "Anti-pipeline push, Lynyrd Skynyrd, gopher frogs: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey on Friday reallocated $12.3 million of the state’s coronavirus relief funds to hire travel nurses to help hospitals overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients. The Republican governor announced the move as the state continues to see a surge in virus cases, straining hospital resources and staff. “I’m pleased to see more folks getting vaccinated, but we are still in the thick of COVID-19 and our hospitals are overwhelmed,” Ivey said in a statement. “The money is coming from the state’s share of CARES Act funds. Until our vaccination rates rise and our COVID-19 hospitalization rates fall, we will need the extra support these nurses provide.” The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated a nurse staffing crisis, sending U.S. hospitals into a competition for travel nurses and staff to handle the crush of patients this summer. Hospitals need more staff to handle the patient loads, while some nurses have left because they are exhausted, taken lucrative travel jobs or are out sick because they themselves are sick with COVID-19. Baptist Medical Center South in Montgomery, like hospitals across the country, has turned to travel staff to fill positions. “It’s a national arms race for clinical talent,” CEO Peter Selman, said. He said the hospital is paying up to $155 an hour to national staffing firms.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Residents in Wrangell and Petersburg now have the ability to text 911 for help when calling isn’t an option. “It’s been working out excellent,” Petersburg Police Department Chief James Kerr said. “It’s designed for the hearing impaired or domestic violence situations. If you can’t talk to the dispatch but you need help, you can text.” A third-party provider helped implement the technology with the two police departments. “One of the really big benefits I see with this is for search and rescue,” Kerr said, noting Alaska’s rugged terrain can make it difficult to get a call signal. “But you can send a text through. It gives us GPS coordinates and everything else.” The Juneau Police Department is also investigating a similar system, Lt. Krag Campbell said in an email to the Juneau Empire. He noted texting 911 could be useful in active shooter situations or other times when speaking into the phone would put a caller at risk, betraying their position. Currently, the option is only available to AT&T and GCI customers, Kerr said. Texters using other providers get a message that the service is not available. No one has texted police yet with it, other than kids trying to play a prank. But the text sent to emergency services also comes with the texter’s location, allowing police to arrive at the kids’ location and caution them not to misuse the service.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The father of an elementary school student was arrested after he and two other men showed up to the campus with zip ties, threatening to make a “citizen’s arrest” on the principal over a coronavirus quarantine, school officials said Friday. Diane Vargo, principal of Mesquite Elementary School in Tucson, said the parent came to her office Thursday with his son in tow. The father was upset the child would have to isolate and miss a school field trip because of possible exposure to someone with COVID-19. She said two other men also “barged in.” One was carrying “military, large, black zip ties and standing in my doorway.” Vargo said she tried to deescalate the situation while explaining the school had to follow county health protocols. “I felt violated that they were in my office claiming I was breaking the law and they were going to arrest me,” a visibly shaken Vargo said in a video statement released by the Vail Unified School District. “Two of the men weren’t parents at our school, so I felt threatened.” In a video posted on social media, Vargo can be heard calmly asking them to leave. One of them replies they aren’t leaving because they’re not going to let her control the situation. The principal called Tucson police. School officials said the man arrested was the father. Vargo said they are pursuing charges against the other two men.\n\nArkansas\n\nParis: The Frontier’s Day festival returns to town Oct.2. Tonya Fletcher, executive director of the Paris Area Chamber of Commerce and organizer of the festival, described Frontier’s Day as “where yesterday meets today for today.” This year marks the 43rd year Paris has celebrated Frontier’s Day. Typically, the festival draws 3,000 to 4,000 people each year, but Fletcher said it is hard to say how many people the pandemic will keep at home. “I still think we’ll have a good crowd,” she said, allowing that it will likely be a smaller gathering than in the past. Frontier’s Day will officially begin at 9 a.m. and end at 4 p.m., but Paris will celebrate its monthly “First Fridays” music night the evening prior, wrapping at 11 p.m. For the festival, the city will block off three sides of the square, only leaving Highway 22 open to traffic. Frontier’s Day has fun activities lined up for all ages, Fletcher said. Children can roam the free pumpkin patch, where they can pick out pumpkins to decorate. There will be live music, and the day will begin with a parade and end with a pageant. During opening ceremonies, area historian Curtis Varnell will discuss the legacy of the Paris Courthouse, which turned 150 this year.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The mysterious deaths of a Northern California family of hikers and their dog have led federal officials to close 28 miles along the Merced River, where high levels of toxic algae were detected. The Bureau of Land Management closed campgrounds and recreation areas along the river, between the towns of Briceburg and Bagby, on Friday after receiving test results of water samples downstream from where the family died. Algal blooms can form in waterways that are shallow and warm. “These algal blooms can produce toxins that can make people and pets extremely sick,” Elizabeth Meyer-Shields, a BLM field manager, said in a statement. “We will continue to monitor for the algae’s presence and look forward to when the public can safely recreate in the Merced River.” The bodies of John Gerrish, his wife, Ellen Chung, their 1-year-old daughter, Miju, and their dog were found Aug. 17 on a hiking trail close to the river in the Sierra National Forest. A family friend had reported them missing. A cause of death has not been determined, and investigators are considering whether toxic algal blooms or other hazards may have contributed to the deaths. Toxicology reports are still pending, and investigators have ruled out any weapons being used or dangerous gases from a mine along the trail.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state’s nonpartisan redistricting commission has proposed a congressional map that would create a new swing seat in the northern Denver suburbs and lump conservative firebrand Rep. Lauren Boebert into a Boulder-based, solidly Democratic seat currently held by liberal Rep. Joe Neguse. The proposal from the commission staff Friday would rearrange the political geography as part of the once-a-decade redistricting process. It’s the first test of the commission model approved by voters in 2018. The map will be followed by a series of hearings, along with a map of state legislative districts. Both may change significantly in the weeks to come as the commission races to meet an end-of-the-month deadline to approve maps. The congressional map keeps the four Democratic seats relatively safe, as well as preserving three as solidly Republican. It would add a new swing seat running from Adams County to Greeley that voted Democratic by 1.9 percentage points in last year’s Senate election. That could make the final breakdown of the state’s congressional districts 4-4, an underwhelming split for Democrats in a state they won by 13 points in last year’s presidential election. Still, Democrats see the map as an improvement over the initial map, which had a similar partisan division.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Nursing homes will once again be allowed to hire temporary nursing aides as they deal with staffing shortages during the pandemic. Gov. Ned Lamont on Friday signed an executive order that revives the state’s nurses aides program that was used last year. Under the program, the temporary workers will be allowed to provide nursing-related services – but nothing that requires a license. The governor’s office said the idea is to use those aides to help serve residents who do not have COVID-19, allowing permanent staff to focus on patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus. The measure also will assure adequate staffing at long-term care facilities, which have struggled with hiring and retaining workers, the governor’s office said. Connecticut recorded 111 cases of COVID-19 among nursing home patients and 94 cases among staff between Aug. 18 and Aug. 31, according to the state Department of Health. There were 16 patient deaths related to the coronavirus during that time and none among staff. The governor on Friday also extended to Sept. 27 the deadline for nursing home workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Numerous Walgreens pharmacies across the state have been unable to process prescriptions because of flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Ida. The internet services vendor for the stores was affected by the historic flooding Thursday, bringing delays for people receiving vital medications. Walgreens has apologized for the inconvenience. The company said it is working to address the issues that have caused the delays. “Our internet services vendor is currently working to fully restore their operations as a result of the storms in the Northeast, which has resulted in some technical difficulties causing longer than normal wait times in several of our stores,” a Walgreens spokesperson said in an email over the weekend. “I ended up at the urgent care on Friday because my throat was starting to close due to an allergic reaction I had and couldn’t get my meds in time,” one person commented on a Facebook post about the issue from the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services. “This is an issue and delay of care that represent lives at risk.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new art exhibit in the nation’s capital is remembering the twin towers, just ahead of the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The show opened Saturday at the National Building Museum and features more than 50 years of photos of the World Trade Center, WUSA-TV reports. The images, all captured by photographer Camilo Jose Vergara, chart the history of the iconic towers from their construction to the attack that brought them down and what came next. “I closely followed the construction of the towers, watching heavy trucks bring in steel or haul away dirt amid the noise of jackhammers and clanging metal,” Vergara wrote in an essay accompanying the photographs. “As they rose to become the tallest buildings in the world, I regarded them as a wild expression of mistaken priorities in a troubled time. “Eventually, my early resentment faded, and I grew to see them as great human creations. As I traveled farther away to photograph the towers from distant boroughs, they seemed to lose their solidity and become mysterious, fantastic, and alluring.” Chrysanthe Broikos, a consulting curator at the National Building Museum, said she hopes the exhibit inspires visitors to think about what the towers and those who worked there meant to the world, as well as how the world responded when they fell.\n\nFlorida\n\nJacksonville: The store that inspired Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “The Ballad of Curtis Loew” has been demolished. Jacksonville’s Woodcrest Grocery Building, where Ronnie Van Zant allegedly met “the finest picker to ever play the blues,” was torn down late last month. The abandoned store was a hangout for generations of kids. The song, written by Van Zant and Allen Collins, tells the story of a young boy who collected bottles to raise money so the old man who hung out at the corner store could play his dobro. Curtis Loew was fictional, but the store was real. It was known as Claude’s in the late ’50s and early ’60s and was right down the street from the house where Van Zant was raised. Scott Hill, who grew up in the neighborhood, said fans started dropping by the site last week to grab cinder blocks as souvenirs after hearing about the demolition. Gene Odom, who wrote a book about the band and leads tours of Lynyrd Skynyrd landmarks for fans, said the building has been vacant for decades. The building started collapsing during the demolition of nearby trailers and had to be taken down. A real estate group said a residential home will be built there. The band is still touring but pulled out of the Pro Football Hall of Fame concert last month after guitarist Rickey Medlocke tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Morehouse College announced Friday that it has canceled this year’s homecoming festivities due to a surge of COVID-19. Events were scheduled to occur Oct. 10-17 and will not be rescheduled. The Oct. 16 football game against Fort Valley State University will still be played but without the “homecoming” designation and with fewer tickets available to the game to implement social distancing. University officials said they made the decision last week as Georgia broke its record for COVID-19 hospitalizations. “The state has the sixth-highest per capita infection rate in the nation, and an unprecedented number of young people have become ill with the virus,” Morehouse President David Thomas said. “Given the circumstances, a massive in-person gathering on our campus presents a public health risk to our students which is impossible to ignore.” Thomas said nearly 100% of the students and employees on campus have met the school’s vaccination requirement. With “aggressive” masking requirements and other safety protocols, Morehouse has limited the spread of the coronavirus on campus, he said. But he had to consider the broader community. “Keeping our students safe is our top priority,” he said. In place of homecoming, the school will host a students-only fall festival.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: President Joe Biden’s appointment of two Native Hawaiians to the U.S. Department of the Interior could influence federal policy for the state’s Indigenous people and other Pacific Islanders. Summer Sylva, who is currently head of the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation, was appointed last week as senior adviser for Native Hawaiian affairs. Keone Nakoa, the Washington, D.C., bureau chief for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, has been appointed deputy assistant secretary for insular and international affairs. The positions carry a great deal of influence over federal policy involving Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, Hawaii Public Radio reports. Sylva will report directly to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to lead the agency. “She’s in a critical role to be in the secretary’s inner circle,” said Esther Kia’aina, a Honolulu City councilwoman who led the department’s Office of Insular Affairs under former President Barack Obama’s administration. Sylva’s appointment signals the agency’s desire to tackle Native Hawaiian issues, including homelands and self-governance, Kia’aina said. Nakoa will be serving in an office that oversees the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials are boosting pay and offering bonuses to try to attract and maintain correctional officers. About 24% of correctional officer positions at the Idaho Department of Correction were vacant last month, including 190 vacancies at the agency’s prisons in Kuna, south of Boise. “Attracting and hiring the right people to our security ranks is only one part of the equation,” Jeff Ray, the department’s public information officer, told the Idaho Press. “We’re putting an equal amount of emphasis on retaining the staff who have and continue to admirably serve the people of Idaho.” New correctional officers will receive $19 an hour, up from the previous $16.75. New hires will also get $1,500 bonuses and be eligible for $1,500 yearly retention bonuses during their first five years. Current employees will see hourly raises ranging from $0.75 for wardens to $2.25 for correctional officers starting Sept. 5. Also, on Oct. 15, all current correctional officers will receive a one-time retention bonus of $1,500. Correctional officers often must work mandatory 16-hour shifts because there aren’t enough workers. Department of Correction Director Josh Tewalt said the pay Idaho offers correctional workers isn’t competitive with surrounding states, such as an Oregon prison paying new correctional officers $22.64 an hour.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Years in the making, the visitor center and state historic site grounds at the Pullman National Monument have officially opened to the public. Chicago’s first national monument marks the site where Pullman passenger railroad cars were built. Employees lived nearby in the neighborhood on the city’s South Side. The sprawling Pullman company factory closed in 1982. The National Park Services’ visitor center features exhibits on worker demonstrations that helped plant the seeds of the modern labor movement. For instance, Black railroad workers won a significant labor agreement in the 1930s that helped lead to worker protections. Robert Bushwaller, a Historic Pullman Foundation board member, said he was encouraged by the crowd Saturday. Some drove vintage cars to mark the opening day during the Labor Day weekend. “The public support has been better than expected,” Bushwaller told the Chicago Sun-Times. “The turnout is tremendous. They remember so much from how it used to be and want to see if it still tasted that way, and they’ve been satisfied.” Former President Barack Obama designated the factory and surrounding area a national monument in 2015. Restoration and revitalization at the site has been ongoing for years.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb issued seven pardons to convicted criminals during his first year in office but hasn’t granted any more pardons in the past 31/ 2 years, with officials saying the number of applications for the governor to clear criminal records has declined to a trickle, The (Fort Wayne) Journal Gazette reports. Indiana’s expansive expungement law – first passed by the Legislature in 2013 – has meant fewer people seeking pardons, as that process of asking a judge to clear past convictions is both simpler and more private, said Charles Miller, vice chairman of the Indiana Parole Board. “Quite frankly, I knew the numbers were way down, but even I was shocked by just how low they were,” Miller said. “Speaking personally, pardons are the best part of my job, as you get to the good things people accomplish after what is usually just an unfortunate mistake.” The pardons Holcomb issued in 2017 were largely holdovers from when Mike Pence was governor. The most prominent case was that of Keith Cooper, whose pardon request over his conviction for a 1996 robbery in Elkhart languished under Pence even as the state parole board, the local prosecutor and witnesses supported his exoneration.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The University of Iowa’s graduate student workers union is calling for stronger on-campus mitigation protocols against the coronavirus. The union members sent a list of demands to the UIowa administration and state’s Board of Regents in a letter dated Sept. 1 and followed that up Thursday morning with a “die-in” protest on the Pentacrest to draw attention to their plea. Demands include more remote work options, a mask mandate inside campus buildings, and required COVID-19 vaccinations or mandatory weekly virus testing of unvaccinated people, none of which are currently in place. The union represents about 250 members and 1,800 in the collective bargaining unit. Members hold a unique position at the university, as they are there not only to learn but to teach classes. Members of the organization approved the list of demands before it was sent out. “We are very concerned for our health and safety this fall,” the letter said. “We are deeply disturbed by the obligation we face to share spaces with others who may be putting us at risk, or whom we may be placing in danger, because of inconsistent vaccination and the optional status of mask wearing and social distancing on campus.” About two dozen people gathered on campus at 10 a.m. Thursday for the “die-in.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly has placed 87 of the state’s 105 counties under a drought watch or warning. Kelly said Thursday that most of the state has been in drought or abnormally dry conditions for several weeks, and she encouraged residents to do what the can to minimize the risk of fire. Fourteen counties were placed under a drought warning and 73 under a watch. The 18 counties not included in the declaration are all in southeast Kansas. The action was recommended by Connie Owen, director of the Kansas Water Office and chairwoman of the Governor’s Drought Response Team. Kelly said in a statement that while some areas have had normal or higher amounts of rain so far this year, counties in the northwest, central and south-central have received less than 60% of their normal precipitation. Owen said future outlooks call for the drought-like conditions to continue into the fall, particularly in the northwest counties.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Tucked into the pandemic-heavy agenda for a special legislative session is a request to strengthen Kentucky’s negotiating hand in trying to reel in mega-sized economic development projects. Gov. Andy Beshear said Saturday that he will ask the GOP-led Legislature to give the state’s recruiting team more flexibility in offering incentives for investment projects topping $2 billion. “As we sit here today, we have at least five potential projects that would be that size,” Beshear told reporters. “In other words, the largest in our commonwealth’s history.” The Democratic governor announced Saturday that he’s calling lawmakers back to the statehouse for a special session that begins Tuesday and will be dominated by coronavirus-related issues. After winning a legal battle against Beshear, lawmakers will take the lead in crafting policies to respond to a recent surge of COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations, fueled by the delta variant of the virus. But Beshear is hoping the work on economic development policy helps put the state at the front of the pack in trying to land $2 billion-plus projects. Such a massive development would be certain to create loads of new jobs, with plenty of spin-off opportunities for even more job growth.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Families looking for their loved ones who evacuated from Hurricane Ida to a state shelter are getting help from the state. The Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services on Saturday launched “Connect,” a tool that will help families connect with each other. The number to call is 225-342-2727. Families can also fill out a form online to reach out to loved ones who may be in state-run shelter. The department said people will be required to provide the name, address and date of birth, if known, of the person they’re trying to find, as well as their name and contact information. DCFS will then determine whether the person is in one of the state’s congregate shelters and, if so, pass along the caller’s message. Individuals looking for loved ones evacuated from one of seven nursing homes linked to an evacuation warehouse site in Tangipahoa Parish should call 211, the department said.\n\nMaine\n\nOxford: The state is continuing to try to slow the spread of the invasive emerald ash borer with new restrictions. The Maine Forest Service has issued an emergency order preventing the movement of ash trees and products from areas including Norway, Oxford and Lovell in Oxford County. The order limits the movement of ash trees for planting and ash tree products such as logs, pulpwood, lumber and firewood from areas that are considered likely to harbor the pest. The new areas are in addition to areas already covered by a quarantine. The state’s ban on untreated firewood from outside Maine remains in effect as another way of preventing the pest’s spread.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Nursing homes in the state are seeing another rise in coronavirus cases, leading facilities to suspend visits from loved ones. The Washington Post reports the halt to visitations has led to a new wave of despair in facilities that were struck hard by COVID-19. The impact of loneliness on the health of the elderly has been extreme. Maryland has 227 nursing homes. Gov. Larry Hogan had ordered that all nursing home employees receive at least one vaccine dose by last week. Facilities that fail to comply will be subject to fines. The percentage of employees who have received a vaccine dose is 82%. At the same time, nearly 90% of all nursing home residents have had at least one vaccine dose, and 86.1% are fully inoculated. Meanwhile, outbreaks are rising in Maryland’s nursing homes. Outbreaks are defined by the federal government as at least one COVID-19 case. In July, fewer than 10 facilities had an outbreak. But by early August, there were 33. On Friday, there were 92.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: What started as a project to restore the gravestones of three Black men and women who played a role in the abolitionist movement on the North Shore is evolving into a larger effort to find and restore the final resting places for other African American families, officials said. In Salem’s Howard Street Cemetery, two of the stones marking the burial sites of Venus Chew, Prince Farmer and Samuel Payne, all of whom died in the 1850s, are broken into pieces, The Salem News reports. The graves to be restored are in what Rachel Meyer, a stone conservator with Epoch Preservation, described as a corner of the cemetery, effectively segregated from the main cemetery. They occupy a square piece of land the city donated to expand the cemetery to bury African Americans. The three stones in question have fallen over in time and were sinking into the ground when an area resident contacted Meyer about fixing them. Doreen Wade, president of Salem United, said she’s enthusiastically behind the project because of what it represents – more than just repairing fragmented gravestones, it’s repairing a fragmented story of Salem’s past.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlat Rock: A Ford plant is the source of benzene vapor in sewers that forced the evacuation of 10 homes and a school in the Detroit suburb of Flat Rock, according to state and company officials. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy confirmed Friday that the source of the flammable vapor is a fuel leak at the Ford Flat Rock Assembly Plant. “HAZMAT technicians will begin mitigating flammable vapors in the municipal sanitary system by injecting fire suppressant foam. These activities will take place at various locations where levels of benzene have been detected in a 4-square-mile perimeter of Flat Rock,” the department said. Ford on Wednesday discovered “what originally looked to be a relatively small leak in a pipe that carries gasoline used to fuel vehicles built at the plant,” said Bob Holycross, Ford’s vice president of sustainability, environment and safety engineering. But on Friday, the company “determined that the scale of the fuel leak was much larger and that Ford is the likely source of the problem in Flat Rock, for which we apologize,” he said. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said in an email late Friday that an estimated 1,000 to 3,000 gallons of unleaded gasoline spilled into the sewers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBemidji: Four congressional Democrats who are part of the progressive “Squad” and want President Joe Biden to stop construction of the Enbridge Line 3 oil pipeline traveled to the shores of the Mississippi River to make their plea. Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Cori Bush of Missouri, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan spent the holiday weekend visiting Bemidji and other parts of northern Minnesota to speak with members of Indigenous communities and others who have been protesting the project. Line 3 starts in Alberta and clips a corner of North Dakota before crossing Minnesota en route to Enbridge’s terminal in Superior, Wisconsin. The 337-mile line in Minnesota is the last step in replacing the deteriorating pipeline that was built in the 1960s. “We have been encouraged by Joe Biden’s boldness so far,” Omar said, referencing his January decision to cancel a border-crossing permit for the Keystone XL pipeline that would have carried oil from Canada to Nebraska. “Now we have another chance to reject a moving pipeline. We hope you will act.” Minnesota Republican legislators condemned the visit, which they said “will only serve to incite the obstructionists,” the Star Tribune reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nMoney: A historical marker describing the events leading up to the killing of Emmett Till was knocked down just days after the 66th anniversary of his death. The black Mississippi Freedom Trail marker with gold writing typically stands in front of the remains of Bryant’s Grocery and Meat Market, where, in 1955, the Black 14-year-old was accused of whistling at a white woman. Till was later kidnapped, beaten and killed. The sign is part of the Mississippi Freedom Trail, a route dedicated to honoring people and places in the state that had a significant role in the civil rights movement. Allan Hammons, president of Hammons and Associates, which manages the Freedom Trail, said a large vehicle like a tractor-trailer likely accidently knocked the marker from its post. The area is under construction, and Hammons suspects the driver of the vehicle may have not even realized they hit the sign. The marker was picked up by workers with the LeFlore County road department and stored in a storage facility until Hammons can inspect it. The Emmett Till Interpretive Center tweeted Thursday that it believes someone ran the sign down with a vehicle and removed it. The sign details how Till stopped by the store for candy before his abduction and death.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft is urging the General Assembly to prohibit local election workers from helping absentee voters correct mistakes, a move that would mean some votes aren’t counted. “We would like to see legislation that does not allow for curing of absentee ballots,” Deputy Secretary of State Trish Vincent told the House Elections Committee last week. “Curing” is a common term for fixing errors. The Kansas City Star reports the request adds to a growing list of measures advanced by Republicans to alter the state’s elections, including restoring a photo ID requirement and making it harder to amend the state constitution through voter-initiated ballot measures. Some similar proposals failed this year but could be considered again in the 2022 session. During the COVID-19 pandemic last year, Missouri lawmakers temporarily made all voters eligible to cast a ballot by mail but required most to have their ballot notarized. Missouri previously required an excuse for voting absentee. More than 28% of Missouri voters cast ballots by mail in November, up from 8% in 2018. “I don’t think we’re going to go back to the mail-in like we did during COVID,” said Republican Rep. Dan Shaul of Imperial, chairman of the House Elections Committee.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: Wildlife workers at Glacier National Park trapped and killed a black bear that officials said became a public safety risk after it lingered around a campground. The bear took apples from an open vehicle trunk while visitors were nearby at the Many Glacier Campground, officials said. It kept returning despite park staff attempts to scare it away. It was later trapped near a housing area in a large trap made out of a culvert and was euthanized Thursday. The female bear was about 4 years old and 120 pounds, park officials said. It’s believed to be the same bear that had been approaching people near Glacier’s Grinnell Lake the week prior, prompting the closure of a trail. A necropsy showed the animal had been in healthy condition. But officials said it had become used to getting human food and was unlikely to break the habit. They said it could not be relocated due to safety concerns.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State education officials halted their plans Friday for new health education standards after criticism from some parents and conservative family-values groups that the content was sexually inappropriate. The State Board of Education voted 5-1 to indefinitely postpone the standards, with one member abstaining, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The standards were nonbinding recommendations, so local schools could simply have ignored them, but opponents still railed against the proposal. The new resolution the board passed says members will determine an appropriate time to address health education standards after considering the status of the pandemic and the needs of local children, schools and communities. Under board rules, any member can attempt to revive the process with support from the majority. The first draft released in March faced strong opposition, as did a second draft released in July, despite removal of many topics opponents disliked. The initial draft called for teaching children as young as first grade about gender identity and gender stereotypes and older children about homophobia, transphobia, and vaginal, oral and anal sex. Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts blasted the draft, saying it was developed with input from activists and promoted “gender ideology.”\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A federal judge has denied tribal leaders’ bid to temporarily block digging for an archaeological study required before construction can begin for a lithium mine on what they say is sacred land where their ancestors were massacred more than century ago. U.S. District Judge Miranda Du refused three tribes’ request for a preliminary injunction blocking the trenching planned to collect samples near the Oregon state line at the site of the largest known lithium deposit in the United States. The tribes say their ancestors were massacred in the late 1800s at the proposed Thacker Pass site. Du emphasized in the ruling late Friday in Reno that she has pledged to hear and rule on the merits of the case before Lithium Nevada Corp. hopes to begin construction early next year on the mine the U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved in January. She rejected a similar request in July for a preliminary injunction sought by environmentalists who claim the digging would destroy critical habitat for greater sage grouse. Du said Friday that she was “not unpersuaded by the tribes’ broader equitable and historical arguments.” But she said that there was no evidence the bureau acted unreasonably, nor that the mine was planned on an actual massacre site, and the agency has contingency plans if “human remains are unexpectedly discovered.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu was released from the hospital Saturday after tests confirmed Friday that a bleeding ulcer was the cause of his flu-like symptoms. The Republican will continue to recuperate at home, according to a statement from his office. “New Hampshire is blessed with amazing health care staff and generous blood donors,” Sununu said in the statement. “Valerie and I can’t thank them enough and are grateful for everyone’s prayers and positive outreach.” Sununu was admitted to Portsmouth Hospital on Friday after experiencing the flu-like symptoms since Wednesday. He had tested negative three times for the coronavirus. Sununu said Wednesday that he tested negative, hours after his office said he wasn’t feeling well, postponed a meeting and began isolating. Sununu, 46, is fully vaccinated against COVID-19. He received the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine April 10.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMullica Hill: One of the most intense tornadoes recorded in New Jersey history all but demolished the state’s largest dairy farm. When Marianne and Wally Eachus, the owners of Wellacrest Farms, came out of their basement along with other family on their homestead, they saw that two of their massive grain silos had toppled over. Some barns were completely reduced to concrete, with roofs ripped off others, equipment demolished and uprooted trees crashed into the old farmhouse. “There was just metal, wood, debris, everywhere,” Marianne Eachus said. Hundreds of cows were trapped under collapsed barns. Thirteen have died; a couple dozen more suffered injuries. A crew was milking when the twister ripped through and had only seconds to hide and hold on. They saw several cows swallowed by the funnel. Up to 100 cows were still missing Monday. Somehow, there were no more deaths on the dairy farm from the EF3 tornado spawned by the remnants of Hurricane Ida. But the storm produced historic rain and massive flooding. Wellacrest Farms produces more than 17 million pounds of milk annually and works with other farmers to share and sell crops. There are 1,400 cows on the property. In the days after the destruction, the Eachus family has seen an outpouring of support and help, both physical and financial.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A group of Democrats in the state House has outlined a package of criminal justice bills intended to combat crime that includes penalties for failing to safely store guns, enhanced pay for police, and changes in the pretrial supervision and bail system. A record-setting number of homicides in Albuquerque this year is spurring concerns about violent crime and shortcomings of the police and justice system. In a statement Thursday, 17 House Democrats announced a lengthy list of goals for the next regular legislative session in January. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said she’ll put criminal justice initiatives on the agenda for the 30-day session that is confined to budget negotiations and a few additional governor-picked topics. Republican lawmakers are asking the Legislature to reconsider a long list of their recent crime bills that were rejected. House Democrats listed legislative goals in 16 bullet points. To address gun violence, the legislators want to place new restrictions on high-capacity magazines and establish an office of gun violence prevention. Enhanced penalties are part of the plan. Democrats want a longer statute of limitations on second-degree murder charges and tougher sanctions. A crackdown is proposed on property damage in the theft of copper and catalytic converters in automobiles.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A staff shortage at Rikers Island left two units without corrections officers for more than 24 hours last Tuesday and Wednesday, a prisoner reported, and a city oversight board said ongoing personnel problems factored in a wave of suicides in the jails since December. Two Rikers units were without corrections officers through at least through noon Wednesday, leaving inmates in the strange position of helping other inmates get to court transport and video conferences, said Terrence Ferguson, the hip-hop artist known as 2 Milly. “We are really running the dorm by ourselves. I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Ferguson, who is serving a sentence for gun possession. He said Wednesday that there had been no officer on his floor since 6 a.m. Tuesday. “I’ve been answering the phones,” he said. The two unmanned units together house about 80 prisoners. Department of Correction officials declined comment on whether parts of Rikers have gone unguarded for longer than 24 hours. But the department has acknowledged a personnel shortage. Officials have said that in July, about 3,500 of Rikers’ 8,500 officers either called in sick or were medically exempt from working with detainees. Another 2,300 just didn’t come in to work at some point. Rikers’ population has roughly doubled since July 2019.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A gay substitute teacher was wrongfully fired by a Roman Catholic school after he announced in 2014 on social media that he was going to marry his longtime partner, a federal judge has ruled. U.S. District Judge Max Cogburn ruled Friday that Charlotte Catholic High School and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Charlotte violated Lonnie Billard’s federal protections against against sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Cogburn granted summary judgment to Billard and said a trial must still be held to determine appropriate relief for him. “After all this time, I have a sense of relief and a sense of vindication. I wish I could have remained teaching all this time,” Billard said in a statement released Friday by the ACLU, which represented him in court. “Today’s decision validates that I did nothing wrong by being a gay man.” Billard taught English and drama full time at the school for more than a decade, earning its Teacher of the Year award in 2012. He then transitioned to a role as a regular substitute, according to his 2017 lawsuit. The defendants said they fired Billard not because he was gay but because “he engaged in ‘advocacy’ that went against the Catholic Church’s beliefs” when he publicly announced his engagement to another man, the ruling said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The idea to split the state’s legislative districts in half for House seats hasn’t gained traction with lawmakers, but some voters groups say the concept would benefit tribal nations that don’t have enough residents to stand alone as legislative districts. The Legislature’s Redistricting Committee meets Wednesday in Fargo as the state continues to examine redrawing legislative districts. Sen. Ray Holmberg, R-Grand Forks, who has served on redistricting committees since 1981, told the Bismarck Tribune splitting legislative districts would have to take into account tribal nations, and “that would make a difference according to how the Department of Justice views taking care of minority populations ... so we need to explore that, and it may happen,” Holmberg said. North Dakota Native Vote Executive Director Nicole Donaghy said subdistricts would allow “people on reservations to elect candidates of their choice.” She said in the past decade there have been elections encompassing the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in which “we’ve had several Native Americans run for county commission, run for a legislative seat for that district, and they were not able to be elected because of the dilution of the populations with the non-Native population that surrounds the reservation.”\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A Butler County judge has ruled that West Chester Hospital cannot be compelled to administer ivermectin to a COVID-19 patient. Common Pleas Court Judge Michael Oster Jr. issued the ruling Monday morning as a 14-day temporary injunction granted by another judge expired. Ivermectin is an antiparasitic treatment commonly used for livestock and recommended by the FDA to treat “infections caused by some parasitic worms” in humans, as well as head lice and rosacea. Interest in the drug as a COVID-19 treatment has spiked, fueled by endorsements from allies of former President Donald Trump and some Fox News personalities. While some studies are underway, none of the major medical organizations recommend the drug as a treatment for COVID-19, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has warned that reports of poisoning related to ivermectin have increased threefold this year. The judge said it is “impossible not to feel sympathetic” for Julie Smith, the guardian for her husband, Jeffrey Smith, 51. He’s been in the hospital since July 15, according to court documents. But the judge wrote that he must leave emotions out of the decision and must also consider the rights of the hospital and the impact that forcing a hospital to give a drug could have.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The city is paying $2million to settle a former death row inmate’s federal lawsuit over his 1988 conviction for two murders. Robert Lee Miller Jr. was set free in 1998 after DNA tests implicated a convicted rapist in the deaths. Miller sued in 2019 after an Oklahoma County judge ruled he had presented sufficient evidence to establish “a prima facie case of actual innocence of the crimes.” He had sought $95 million in compensatory and punitive damages. A jury trial had been set for January. He dismissed the case Friday after the Oklahoma City Council agreed 6-0 to the $2 million settlement. The city did not admit wrongdoing. “It was a tragedy from Day One,” said his attorney, Mark H. Barrett, of Norman. “If they had got DNA done before he got tried instead of afterward, all this would have been a very different story.” Miller, 62, has talked about using the settlement to start his own house-building business, Barrett said. In the lawsuit, the attorney complained that Oklahoma City police detectives used “bizarre, unreliable and coercive techniques” in their interrogations to fabricate a case against Miller. His attorney also blamed disgraced police chemist Joyce Gilchrist for Miller’s conviction and accused the city of condoning her shoddy, unreliable and fraudulent work.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A federal judge has ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to take immediate action to improve fish passage at dams in the Willamette Basin. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports that in a final opinion and order issued last week, U.S. District Judge Marco Hernandez said the Corps had for years failed to provide adequate passage for threatened chinook salmon and winter steelhead trout at dams it operates in the basin. “As evinced by the listed species’ continuing decline, the Corps’ failure to provide adequate fish passage and mitigate water quality issues is causing substantial, irreparable harm to the salmonids,” Hernandez wrote in the opinion. The order comes after the court decided in favor of three environmental organizations that sued the Corps and the National Marine Fisheries Service, arguing the agencies weren’t doing their part to protect the species. Chinook salmon and steelhead in the Upper Willamette River system are both listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Dams on the Willamette and its tributaries have blocked access to spawning grounds for the fish, contributing to population declines.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The Republican leader of the state Senate and a group of parents filed a lawsuit Friday seeking to overturn the Wolf administration’s new mask mandate for schools. The governor’s spokesperson dismissed what she called the GOP’s “effort at undermining public heath.” The suit, filed in Commonwealth Court, asserts that Acting Health Secretary Alison Beam failed to comply with state law when she ordered masks to be worn in all Pennsylvania public and private schools, as well as child care facilities. The masking order isn’t valid because it didn’t go through the state’s regulatory review process, the lawsuit said. It also accused the Wolf administration of trying to circumvent newly approved constitutional amendments limiting a governor’s emergency powers. “The Secretary of Health’s order subjects healthy, non-infected teachers, children, students, staff, and visitors ... to the wearing of face coverings,” the suit said. The plaintiffs, it said, are “not patients, they are heathy, non-infected children.” The parents said in affidavits that they intend to send their children to school without masks, claiming Beam’s order is illegal. The lawsuit seeks an injunction against the masking order. The court scheduled a hearing for Sept. 16.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Nineteen fire departments are getting a total of $5.5 million in federal grants that can be used to buy new equipment and upgrade training to enhance public safety, the state’s congressional delegation said. “These grants will help lift the budgetary burden on local governments and better protect the health and safety of the public and firefighters,” Sen. Jack Reed said in a statement Friday. The Warwick Fire Department is getting the largest chunk of the grant money, including almost $900,000 for an aerial ladder truck and more than $100,000 for portable radio equipment. The East Providence Fire Department is getting more than $800,000 for paramedic training. The Newport Fire Department is receiving more than $400,000 for portable radio units, mobile repeaters and associated communications equipment. The Federal Emergency Management Agency grants are also going to departments and fire districts in Bristol; Central Falls; East Greenwich; Johnston; Lincoln; Narragansett; North Kingstown; Pascoag; Portsmouth; Providence; Prudence Island; the Rhode Island Firefighting Academy in Exeter; West Warwick; and Woonsocket.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Wildlife scientists and Riverbanks Zoo are teaming up to save endangered gopher frogs. The survival rate of the eggs and tadpoles for the frogs is extremely low, so the Department of Natural Resources finds the eggs in Lowcountry wetlands, and the zoo raises them in captivity. “It’s a matter of how we can best use our strengths for species conservation,” Natural Resources herpetologist Andrew Grosse said in a statement. Wildlife scientists are also working to restore habitat for gopher frogs so that the eggs and tadpoles have a better chance at survival when they are returned to the wild, Grosse said. The frogs live in longleaf pines and are a good indicator at the health of that environmental system. “They have a very complex life history and highly specialized habitat requirements,” Grosse said. “All of the pieces must be in place and functioning at a high level to support these fragile populations.” Several hundred frogs have been saved through the South Carolina program and similar efforts in North Carolina, Alabama and Georgia, officials said. The project is attempting to keep the frogs off the federal endangered species list. Scientists are calling it “Head Start” since it gives the frogs a head start at surviving.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem wants to pass tougher abortion restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a Texas law banning most abortions in that state to go forward. The Texas law, which took effect Wednesday, prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around six weeks and before many women know they’re pregnant. “Following the Supreme Court’s decision to leave the pro-life (Texas) law in place, I have directed the Unborn Child Advocate in my office to immediately review the new (Texas) law and current South Dakota laws to make sure we have the strongest pro life laws on the books in (South Dakota),” Noem said in a statement on social media Thursday. Women in South Dakota are currently barred from terminating a pregnancy after 22 weeks. Noem has previously said she wants to ban abortions completely, with no exceptions in cases of rape or incest. The Texas law authorizes private citizens to sue abortion providers and anyone involved in aiding an abortion, including someone who drives a woman to a clinic. The law is being challenged by Planned Parenthood and other groups. The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota has vowed to push back against more abortion restrictions.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order late Friday blocking Gov. Bill Lee from allowing parents to opt out of school mask requirements in Shelby County. U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman issued the temporary restraining order for the county’s schools after it was sought by the parents of two children with health problems. The parents argued in a federal lawsuit filed the week prior that the Republican governor endangered students with health conditions and hurt their ability to attend in-person classes by allowing parents to opt out of a mask mandate via an executive order. The temporary restraining order remains in effect until Sept. 17. The students attend school in the Memphis suburbs of Collierville and Germantown, which began classes Aug. 9 under a universal mask requirement issued by the Shelby County Health Department. Lee resisted implementing a statewide mask mandate for schools, and he had initially left the decision to local officials. But on Aug. 16, he signed a statewide order allowing parents to opt out of the requirement for nonmedical reasons. Hundreds of students have been attending classes without masks ever since. The parents’ lawsuit claims Lee’s order violates the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A judge has temporarily shielded some abortion clinics from being sued by the state’s largest anti-abortion group under a new law banning most abortions. The temporary restraining order was issued Friday by District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble in Austin in response to a Planned Parenthood request. Although the law remains in effect, the judge’s order shields Planned Parenthood’s clinics, specifically, from whistleblower lawsuits by the nonprofit group Texas Right to Life, its legislative director and people working in concert with the group. A hearing on a preliminary injunction request is scheduled for Sept. 13. The law, which took effect Wednesday, prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around the sixth week of pregnancy and before some women realize they’re pregnant. The law also leaves enforcement to private citizens through lawsuits instead of to prosecutors through criminal charges. Planned Parenthood said in a statement Friday that the law was “already decimating abortion access in the state, as providers are forced to turn people away” once cardiac activity can be detected. It said historically, 85% to 90% of women who have gotten abortions in Texas were at least six weeks into their pregnancies.\n\nUtah\n\nFarmington: A paraplegic man who was injured on a roller coaster is now suing an amusement park, saying his paralyzed leg wasn’t properly secured while he was on the ride, and his foot was shredded. The Salt Lake Tribune reports Matthew Christensen filed the lawsuit against Lagoon Amusement Park on Thursday in Davis County’s 3rd District Court. The lawsuit said Christensen’s ligament in his big toe was “irreparably shredded,” and he suffered fractures to his lower leg, toe, and two other foot bones. A spokesman for the theme park in Farmington, north of Salt Lake City, said he couldn’t speculate on the facts of the incident, which are under investigation. “The ride in question has a lap restraint similar to others used throughout the amusement industry,” Adam Leishman said. Christensen is paralyzed from the waist down and was using a wheelchair at the park during an October 2020 visit with his family and a friend. Christensen’s son and friend helped transfer him from the wheelchair to the roller coaster car. According to the lawsuit, Christensen had the lap restraint secured correctly, but his right leg was not secured properly by the leg restraint, which caused the man’s paralyzed leg to dangle below, and he was injured when it got caught in the platform.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The first two years of a state program set up to keep patients healthier while reducing costs saved money on Medicare patients and kept more people out of the hospital, an evaluation of the program has found. The report commissioned by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and released last week looked at the first two years of Medicare participation in Vermont in what is known as the all-payer model of health care. The report found that in 2018 and 2019, the costs for Medicare patients in the system being studied saved about 4.7% from the previous year. For all of Vermont’s Medicare patients, the system saved about 6.5% over the previous year. In 2019 the system reduced by almost 18% acute care hospital stays by people in the system. It reduced the acute care days patients stayed in the hospital by 14.7% and reduced the number of people being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days by 12.4%. “Those declines are very encouraging,” Ena Backus, Vermont’s director of Health Care Reform, said Friday. The same report found the project run by the organization OneCare Vermont has not signed up as many people to participate in the system as had been hoped. In 2019 it had been hoped the program would be covering 75% of eligible Medicare patients, but it reached only 47%.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Curbside recycling pickup for some in the area has been delayed by labor shortages exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic and the hot weather. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the Central Virginia Waste Management Authority has warned customers that shortages of drivers and other waste workers could cause delays. The authority oversees waste and recycling collection in 13 local jurisdictions. The authority said Friday that residential recycling pickups that normally occur on Thursdays in a number of areas have been delayed for at least a week. TFC Recycling, a Chesapeake-based company that performs collections for about 265,000 residences in the authority’s jurisdiction, said pandemic-related labor shortages also affecting other businesses have made it harder to hire and retain drivers and other workers. The summer heat has made it even harder to find people to do the hands-on work. “In the last several months, we have had some real issues trying to recruit and maintain drivers – not only drivers but helpers, too,” said Tad Phillips, general manager of TFC’s Richmond-area operations, told the newspaper. Hiring has also become harder as package delivery companies compete for some of the same workers for their trucks as people turn to online ordering during the pandemic.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Days after suing to block what is believed to be among the nation’s strictest COVID-19 employee vaccine mandates, Washington’s largest state labor union has announced a tentative agreement for Gov. Jay Inslee’s order for state workers. The Northwest News Network reports the Washington Federation of State Employees has negotiated terms for Inslee’s mandate that all 46,000 of its union members be fully vaccinated by Oct. 18 or lose their jobs. The Democratic governor issued the order in August, citing the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The union countered with a labor complaint, claiming Inslee’s administration was bargaining in bad faith. The new agreement, which still needs to be ratified, was announced Saturday and defines the exceptions and religious and medical exemptions process for employees who can’t or won’t get their shots. “This agreement is a victory for both public health and due process,” WFSE said in a statement. “It puts in place a fair, equitable and consistent process for members seeking a legitimate exemption to the mandate.” Anyone who is eligible to retire by the end of the year can forgo the vaccine if they use accrued or unpaid leave until they reach their retirement date.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state had one of its worst weeks of the coronavirus pandemic as the number of newly confirmed cases neared a seven-day record. The 6,705 confirmed statewide cases for the six days ending Saturday already surpassed the previous week’s total and were the fourth-highest for any week since the first case was reported in the state in March 2020, according to state health data. The record is nearly 8,200 confirmed cases for the week ending Jan. 10, followed by about 7,600 cases the week ending Jan. 3. The number of COVID-19 patients in hospital intensive care units was 216, just shy of the record 219 set on Jan. 6. On July 4, there were only 17 virus patients in hospital ICUs across the state. And the number of patients on hospital ventilators has surpassed the previous high of 104 set Jan. 10.\n\nWisconsin\n\nJunction City: The state’s cranberry crop is expected to end up being about average – or maybe even above average – by the time harvest begins in about a month. The U.S. Cranberry Marketing Committee forecast in August that Wisconsin growers will produce 4.92 million barrels this year. But Wisconsin Cranberry Growers Association Executive Director Tom Lochner said this year’s estimated crop is closer to the state’s average of 5.5 million barrels. “We still have a few weeks to go before we start harvesting, and the continued warm weather might help the fruit size up a little bit,” Lochner told Wisconsin Public Radio. Dave Hansen, manager of DuBay Cranberry Company in Junction City, said this summer’s weather was warmer and drier than he prefers, but the crop ended up looking good. Lochner said the COVID-19 pandemic has helped boost domestic sales of the fruit, with more people consuming cranberry juice and dried fruit at home, while international sales tapered off during the pandemic, perhaps due to tariffs. The European Union has maintained a 25% tariff on U.S. cranberry products. The pandemic has also created labor issues for the cranberry industry. Lochner said some growers have been working to bring in migrant workers from Southern states to help this fall.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Cheyenne-based Big Boy No. 4014 returns home Tuesday from a monthlong tour of the nation. Led by Ed Dickens, the Union Pacific Heritage Steam program’s showpiece is the massive locomotive that concluded its restoration in 2019 with a tour that marked the 150th anniversary of the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, which became known as the “overland route” that linked the nation. The steam locomotive, along with 15 support and vintage railcars, is expected to arrive at the Steam Shop in Cheyenne about 1:45 p.m. Tuesday. It should be visible on track on the east end of town starting about 1 p.m, arriving from Greeley, Colorado, its last official stop before arriving home in Cheyenne. Dickens runs the Steam Shop and the UP’s Heritage program, and he is usually found in the engineer’s seat on Big Boy while it is en route. “It’s been excellent,” he said of the 2021 tour. “Our collaboration with our colleagues across the Union Pacific has ensured that we’re consistently running on time, much to the delight of the huge crowds that have greeted us everywhere we’ve been.” The completely rebuilt vintage steam engine has performed outstandingly throughout the trip,” Dickens said. “All of the long hours we put into its restoration and continuing maintenance are paying off.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/07"}]}
