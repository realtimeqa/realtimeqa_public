Trump to speak today", "text": "Jan. 23, 2025, 11:16 a.m. ET\n\nThe World Economic Forum annual meeting, a yearly gathering of global elites famously held in Davos, Switzerland, is more than halfway through, with President Donald Trump set to take the virtual stage this morning for a speech.\n\nBetter known simply as \"Davos,\" the summit is a place where policy and major deals and decisions are often shaped. The not-for-profit World Economic Forum (WEF) hosts this meeting of minds across the public and private sectors to encourage global collaboration and work towards solutions for the world's major ills of the day.\n\nNow in its 55th year, eyes are on Davos and its long list of heavy hitters as they convene under the 2025 theme \"Collaboration for the Intelligent Age.\" Here's what to know.\n\nWhat is the World Economic Forum?\n\nThe World Economic Forum annual meeting, colloquially known simply as \"Davos,\" is a yearly meeting of elites including leaders in government, business and civil society. Over the course of four days, decision-makers from across the globe discuss what they see as major issues of the day and plans to tackle them. The WEF focuses on promoting collaboration between the private and public sectors to \"make the world a better place for all.\"\n\nAccording to the WEF website, business partnerships, political breakthroughs and policy can and often do come out of the summit, which was held for the first time in 1971. It is an exclusive-invite-only event at which many private conversations happen, contributing to the air of mystery surrounding the event amongst the general public.\n\nWhen and where is the World Economic Forum held?\n\nThe WEF meeting is always held in Davos, Switzerland. Located in the Swiss mountains, Davos is the highest town in Europe in terms of elevation. The organization was founded as the \"European Management Symposium\" by Professor Klaus Schwab in 1971, primarily to discuss Schwab’s \"stakeholder theory,\" or his vision that businesses should serve all stakeholders, not just shareholders.\n\nIn 1973, the Annual Meeting endorsed the Davos Manifesto, a code of ethics for business leaders that lays out Schwab's principles of stakeholder capitalism.\n\nDavos is typically hosted in January. The meeting has taken place in Davos in January for most of its existence, save for 2001 when it was held in New York City after the 9/11 attacks and 2021 through 2022 during which it was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhen is Davos this year?\n\nDavos is taking place from Jan. 20-24 this year. The theme is \"Collaboration for the Intelligent Age.\"\n\nWho attends Davos?\n\nDavos is an invite-only event for world leaders and decision-makers, including politicians, academics and business people across public and private sectors. According to WEF, it also invites \"activists, artists, labour leaders, Indigenous community members and prominent youth voices.\"\n\nThe WEF lists a swath of big names planning to attend the 2025 session on its website. Some politicians include Donald Trump; Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission; Ding Xuexiang, Vice-Premier of the People's Republic of China; Federal Chancellor of Germany; Roberta Metsola, President of the European Parliament.\n\nAntónio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations; Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organization; Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund will be in attendance from the international organization category, while over 1,600 business leaders and more than 170 leaders from civil society and the social sector will attend as well.\n\nSome of these include David Miliband, President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee; Sania Nishtar, CEO, Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance and Luc Triangle, General Secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation.\n\nWhat happens at Davos?\n\nToday, Davos hosts more than 300 sessions, 200 of which are livestreamed to a global audience, all of which \"aim to accelerate progress and tackle global challenges.\"\n\nIt lists some of its overarching focuses throughout the years as climate change, inclusion, diversity and economics. WEF also releases the Global Risks Reportahead of the annual meeting to identify the major topics of the year.\n\nWhen is Trump speaking at Davos?\n\nTrump will make a virtual appearance at Davos on Thursday at 11 a.m. E.T., followed by a question-and-answer session. Sessions such as these are available for public viewing on the WEF YouTube page.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/01/22/what-is-davos-where-is-it-trump-world-economic-forum-speech-greenland-denmark-iceland/88298457007/", "title": "What is Davos? Where is it? About Trump's speech this week", "text": "Updated Jan. 22, 2026, 2:36 p.m. ET\n\nWhen President Donald Trump on Wednesday doubled down on his push for the US to acquire Greenland, he appeared to confuse it with Iceland multiple times.\n\nTrump gave a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos Jan. 21 to address increasing international tensions amid recent discussions by the U.S. to annex Greenland, a self-governing territory that's part of Denmark. He mistakenly referred to the significantly smaller Iceland, an independent island nation located about 200 miles away in the North Atlantic.\n\n\"They're not there for us on Iceland, that I can tell you,\" Trump said in his speech, referring to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. \"I mean, our stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland. So Iceland has already cost us a lot of money. But that dip is peanuts compared to what it's gone up.\"\n\nAt another point in the speech, Trump referred to Iceland instead of Greenland as he suggested European leaders aren't so fond of him at the moment. NATO allies have been rattled by Trump's desire to seize Greenland ‒ not Iceland.\n\n\"I'm helping Europe. I'm helping NATO. And until the last few days, when I told them about Iceland, they loved me. They called me 'daddy,' right? A very smart man said, ‘He’s our daddy. He’s running it,'\" Trump said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly argued that the U.S. needs Greenland for national security. The island's location could also be strategic for a ballistic missile warning system and the president previously said it is \"vital for the Golden Dome that we are building.\"\n\nLeaders of Greenland and Denmark, however, have repeatedly rebuked Trump's claims.\n\n\"You cannot annex another country. Not even with an argument about international security,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a Dec. 22 joint statement. \"Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders and the U.S. shall not take over Greenland.\"\n\nWhat is Davos? Where is it?\n\nDavos, where the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting is taking place Jan. 19-23, is a town in Switzerland. It is located in the eastern Swiss Alps, within the canton of Graubünden, and is home to Davos Klosters, a well-known skiing and snowboarding resort where the forum is taking place.\n\nHow many people are attending the World Economic Forum?\n\nWorld Economic Forum organizers said more than 3,000 delegates from more than 130 countries are attending in 2026, including 64 heads of state and government, particularly from emerging economies.\n\nThe list also includes several heads of G7 nations, with changes in U.S. policy under Trump in focus.\n\nWhy does President Trump want Greenland?\n\nTrump previously said that the U.S. needs Greenland for national security at a Dec. 22 news conference.\n\n\"You look up and down the coast, you have Russian and Chinese ships all over the place. We need it for national security,\" he said. \"We have to have it.\"\n\nThe island could be a strategic location for a ballistic missile warning system and it also has critical minerals used in industries where China has a near-monopoly power, although Trump previously said he is not interested in Greenland for its mineral wealth.\n\nWhere is Greenland located?\n\nGreenland is located northeast of Canada and has a population of about 57,000 people. It is slightly more than three times the size of Texas and is the largest non-continental island in the world.\n\nContributing: Kinsey Crowley, USA TODAY.

Andy Beshear met with leaders from 25 international corporations to discuss potential expansion into the United States.\n\nBeshear views his trip as a success, highlighting the opportunity to promote Kentucky on a global stage and build relationships with key decision-makers.\n\nGov. Andy Beshear is back in Kentucky after speaking last week at the World Economic Forum, an annual global meeting held in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, that brings together some of the world's most powerful political and business leaders.\n\n\"I believe that Kentucky was invited because we have broken every economic development record in our books, from private sector investment to new jobs to exports to tourism,\" Beshear told the Courier Journal on Monday. \"I mean, our economy is on a roll.\"\n\nThe trip provided Beshear an opportunity to rub elbows with companies that have an existing presence in Kentucky, all of which he said experienced \"the best years in their history,\" bringing some of the highest corporate profits the state has ever seen. And with a quick pit stop in Madrid, Spain, enroute to Davos, Beshear got to meet with North American Stainless, a key company on the supply chain for GE Appliances.\n\nAdditionally, the governor spent time recruiting new businesses to the Bluegrass State, having met with 25 international corporations looking to make a move to the United States.\n\n\"Being able to introduce our 'New Kentucky Home' to the world on one of the preeminent world stages, was an opportunity that we absolutely had to take, and from the comments that we received, I think we'll see a lot of return,\" Beshear said teasing soon-to-come economic development projects.\n\nThe Courier Journal sat down with Beshear to discuss the trip. A recap of the conversation is provided below.\n\nThis interview has been edited for context and clarity.\n\nWhat would you say is your most important takeaway from the World Economic Forum?\n\nBeshear: \"I think the biggest takeaway is we're on the right track. The things that we are delivering on in Kentucky, be it how we prioritize reliability, affordability and then sustainability in our energy portfolio, was exactly how these companies look at it. They want to see all three, but each one is so important. Kentucky's investment, what we're seeing out of Ford and SK [On], out of AESC, out of Shelbyville Battery Manufacturing, my biggest takeaway is we're not just booming as a state economy, but we are on the right track with the industries of the future and that other countries see it.\"\n\nWhy was your attendance at WEF beneficial to the average Kentuckian?\n\nBeshear: \"Well, for anybody who thinks I was on a vacation, I was sitting in a conference room about eight and a half hours a day doing a version of corporate speed dating to ensure that we met and got significant value out of this. Think about it, 25 meetings and five panels with some of the most influential CEOs in the entire world with the opportunity to talk about Kentucky, the chance to meet with one CEO whose company may be based in Asia, another in Europe, the chance to be able to sell Kentucky and to have Kentucky on that stage when just about no other state was there this year, I mean, it was an extraordinary opportunity. And while some of those CEOs might have come in not knowing about Kentucky, let me tell you, every participant in the World Economic Forum left knowing where we are, what we do, and who to call when they're interested in setting up their American expansion.\"\n\nWhat are you most excited to have been able to bring back with you to Kentucky?\n\nBeshear: \"I'm most excited for some of the direct relationships with the leaders of these companies that can, will or already do, invest in Kentucky. For a one-week total trip, we had more meetings with higher-level officials, with the final decision-making authority to bring new jobs or expand the number of jobs in Kentucky. The efficiency — being able to do these meetings back-to-back-to-back — one could result in 100 jobs and one could result in 1,000; that's the type of opportunity that you have there. It was very clear while we were there that the growth in the United States is some of the largest in the world, and that these companies are looking to invest more in the United States. So, as I left, one of the takeaways I had is that we're going to see a lot more foreign direct investment.\"\n\nWhy was it important for you to accept this invitation and speak on behalf of Kentucky to the World Economic Forum?\n\nBeshear: \"I was able to meet with 10 existing Kentucky companies whose headquarters are on three different continents in one place together — they employ about 8,500 Kentuckians — and the chance to do this in one trip is something that you rarely get. It gave us a chance to thank them for their Kentucky investments, talk about any challenges they face, and then make our pitch for expansions of the Kentucky facilities. But it's also important to market our state, to be there in front of different companies that have maybe never looked at Kentucky in a place like Davos.\"\n\nWere there any companies or CEOs that you met with that have you really excited for what could be done in Kentucky in the future?\n\nBeshear: \"We met with a number of CEOs that I believe are going to give Kentucky a very strong look. We went through the different potential participants, and we looked at who had announced that they were going to do U.S. expansions but hadn't yet decided where. We also looked at what companies are moving into, or a big part of some of the new area industries that we have, or some of the clusters. We met with companies that are suppliers to EV battery manufacturers. We met with companies that are in the metals industry. We met with companies that, again, were looking for a home in the United States where they could reach most of the U.S. population. It was an exciting week, and the conversations were directly with the international CEOs in almost all of these instances, and that's a meeting that's not easy to get.\"\n\nThis story was updated to add Story Highlights and additional images.\n\nContact business reporter Olivia Evans at oevans@courier-journal.com or on X, formerly known as Twitter, at @oliviamevans_.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/22/business/davos-2022-preview", "title": "Davos is back and the world has changed. Have the global elite ...", "text": "Davos, Switzerland CNN Business —\n\nThe last time top politicians, CEOs and billionaires gathered in a Swiss mountain village to discuss society’s biggest problems and pitch their solutions, the coronavirus outbreak in China was little more than a remote threat. The economy was humming, and a major armed conflict in Europe was on nobody’s list of major risks.\n\nMore than two years later, the world has been upended by the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But for the rich and powerful arriving in Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum, very little has changed.\n\n“Davos is the epitome of one of the greatest challenges to society right now, which is self-congratulatory elites,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale management professor who speaks regularly with many well-known executives.\n\nThe conference — which famously combines high-minded panels with flashy parties — aims to bring important people together to tackle pressing issues like inequality, climate change, the future of technology and geopolitical conflict. But the logic behind inviting some of the wealthiest people on Earth to solve these problems from a resort town looks even shakier these days.\n\nBillionaires added $5 trillion to their fortunes during the pandemic, according to a report from Oxfam published in January. The world’s richest 10 men saw their collective wealth more than double between March 2020 and November 2021. Meanwhile, tens of millions more people around the world were pushed into extreme poverty as the global economy shut down, and many struggling households became reliant on emergency government support.\n\n“The last two years have dramatized and clarified what has been true for some time now, which is an elite plutocratic class is not just leaving the rest of the world behind, but is thriving precisely by stepping on the necks of everybody else,” said Anand Giridharadas, author of the book “Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World.”\n\nThis year’s financial market sell-off has hit the ultra-rich. But that won’t serve as much consolation to people in both developed and many developing economies experiencing the worst cost-of-living crises in decades. Soaring food and fuel prices are already causing hunger and hardship, fanning instability, triggering protests and emboldening political insurgents.\n\nThe 2022 forum was initially scheduled for January, but it was postponed after the outbreak of the Omicron variant. And while organizers have cobbled together a delayed springtime edition that they hope will remain relevant, many heavy hitters have scheduling conflicts or are opting out.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, who leads America’s biggest bank, won’t attend the event, which coincides with the company’s annual investor day presentation. US President Joe Biden — who delivered a big speech at Davos in 2017 — will be wrapping up a trip to South Korea and Japan. China’s presence is much reduced, with its big cities still gripped by Covid-19 and its tech titans lying low.\n\nThe main event is likely to be a speech on Monday by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is expected to participate via videoconference. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are also scheduled to deliver addresses later in the week, which will be scrutinized as EU countries struggle to agree on a formal oil embargo against Russia.\n\nIn the past, Russian politicians and oligarchs were a fixture of Davos. Founder Klaus Schwab has long emphasized that dialogue and deeper economic ties can promote peace between political adversaries.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin delivered a speech at a virtual edition of the World Economic Forum just last year, and was invited to speak to attendees in 2015 after Russia annexed Crimea.\n\n“At this moment in history where the world has a unique and short window of opportunity to move from an age of confrontation to an age of cooperation, the ability to hear your voice — the voice of the president of the Russian Federation — is essential,” Schwab said when introducing Putin in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, the CEOs of Lukoil, Sberbank and Yandex were on the list of attendees, along with the country’s energy minister.\n\nThis year, Putin won’t be attending. Nor will any Russian officials, magnates or executives. Rather, the program features discussions on issues such as “Cold War 2.0” and the “Return to War.”", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/01/21/b-team-world-economic-forum-un-column/4659953/", "title": "Turning businesses into social problem-solvers: Column", "text": "The B Team\n\nJan. 21, 2014, 11:30 a.m. ET\n\nSome businesses have already shown that%2C despite skepticism%2C they can be a driving force in development.\n\nSeveral results of the UN%27s Millennium Development Goals have been dramatic.\n\nBut we are faced with a planetary emergency%2C which means the successor initiative must be more ambitious.\n\nThey lack neither influence, nor the ability to use it. But there is one asset that business leaders at the World Economic Forum this week could usefully exploit further: the power to advance the wider interests of people and planet. With the U.N. climate change negotiations underway and as the United Nations designs its flagship Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, business needs to engage.\n\nIndeed, broadening the business agenda could help secure its status in the long term. Faced with the ever-widening gap between rich and poor, widespread degradation of the natural world and runaway climate change, business has played a dual role, as chief instigator and seemingly disinterested observer. But some businesses have already shown that, despite skepticism among some governments, they can be a driving force in development, helping to achieve social and environmental ends that governments and community groups are unable to deliver alone.\n\nWhen the U.N. decided on its Millennium Development Goals, aiming to reduce poverty and improve quality of life in developing countries, businesses were not at the table. Today, their contribution to some of the initiative's successes is widely recognized. As foreign direct investment in developing countries leaped from 25% in 2000 to 60% of the global total, millions of new jobs were created, lifting many more out of poverty and helping finance new government programs. With growing interests in these economies, some companies adopted policies specifically designed to support the U.N. goals, and worked with governments and community organizations to deliver them, in particular in energy, health care, infrastructure and water.\n\nBusiness offers not only itstechnical expertise, but also capital and armies of skilled people to such initiatives, as well as capacity to scale through its global financial, logistical and communications networks. The expansion of mobile and Internet networks into new territories, for example, could not have taken place so quickly without the private sector. Today, there are nearly as many mobile phone subscriptions as there are people, and 39% of the world's population already use the Internet, dispersing knowledge and economic opportunity, driving collaboration and helping to respond to the needs of the 1.4 billion people still in extreme poverty.\n\nSome of the results of the Millennium Development Goals have been dramatic. Clean drinking water is available to 2 billion more people than in 1990, for instance, and the mortality rate from tuberculosis and malaria has been substantially reduced. Today we are faced with a planetary emergency, and this means the successor initiative, the Sustainable Development Goals, must be more ambitious yet. Realize that these will call into question the very purpose of business in the 21st century.\n\nTraditional business practices have brought new services, jobs and well-being to many communities in recent decades, while sustainable business practices have often helped a company's image and bottom line. But with increasing inequality and volatility, there is a real chance the gains in prosperity of the past 50 years will be lost to future generations — with the greatest burden falling on the world's poor, those least responsible for causing the problems. Business must go further, redefining its responsibilities and terms of success, embracing the need for equitable opportunities, fair returns to work and respect for the environment alongside profit and growth.\n\nOur peers in Davos, Switzerland, can start at home. A growing number of companies already pay a living wage, involve poor people as employees and are looking to serve low-income consumers. Others are delivering sustainable farming, aquaculture, forestry or ecotourism, and invest in new biochemical, low-carbon concrete and steel, and clean energy and transport technologies. Many have found new ways to work with governments and non-profit organizations in pursuit of social and environmental ends, partnerships that can be boosted by new financial instruments such as social impact bonds or investments in social businesses.\n\nBoth innovation and concerted action are needed to accelerate business practices that promote true transformation. Many managers might be unaware of the side effects of their decisions, or lack incentives to address them. Education in new management practices can help, as well as the measurement of environmental and social impacts, improved governance and increased transparency. Organizations such as the U.N. Global Compact and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development have also launched important initiatives that businesses can join and learn from.\n\nOur hopes for a new era of peace, shared opportunity and ever-increasing interdependence might be at risk, but realizing them is not beyond human capability. The strengths of business — enterprise, innovation and technological progress — could be instrumental. This version of the future — not that of a blighted planet — is fundamentally in the interests of business. Executives must rise above narrow sectorial and short-term interests, and work with governments to create a new framework of incentives and sanctions, rewarding investment in people and planet. It is time that they take the initiative at their own companies, and together with politicians of courage and conviction, drive toward a global goal of sustainable, inclusive prosperity — at the U.N. General Assembly, in Paris next year, and beyond.\n\nThe B Team, founded by Sir Richard Branson and Jochen Zeitz, is working to deliver a 'Plan B' that puts people and planet alongside profit.

Ten of what the WEF calls the \"global risks of highest concern\" for 2014 are as follows:\n\nFiscal crises in key economies\n\n\"Fiscal crises feature as the top risk in this year's Global Risks report. Advanced economies remain in danger, while many emerging markets have seen credit growth in recent years, which could fuel financial crises. A fiscal crisis in any major economy could easily have cascading global impacts.\"\n\nStructurally high unemployment/underemployment\n\n\"Unemployment appears second overall, as many people in both advanced and emerging economies struggle to find jobs. Young people are especially vulnerable – youth unemployment is as high as 50% in some countries and underemployment (with low-quality jobs) remains prevalent, especially in emerging and developing markets.\"\n\nWater crises\n\n\"Environmental risks feature prominently on this year's list. Water crises, for instance, rank as the third highest concern, illustrating a continued and growing awareness of the global water crisis as a result of mismanagement and increased competition for already scarce water resources.\"\n\nSevere income disparity\n\n\"Closely associated in terms of societal risk, income disparity is also among the most worrying issues. Concerns have been raised about the squeezing effect the financial crisis had on the middle classes in developed economies, while globalization has brought about a polarization of incomes in emerging and developing economies.\"\n\nFailure of climate change mitigation and adaptation\n\n\"Even as governments and corporations are called upon to speed up greenhouse gas reduction, it is clear that the race is on not only to mitigate climate change but also to adapt. Failure to adapt has the biggest effect on the most vulnerable, especially those in least developed countries.\"\n\nGreater incidence of extreme weather events (e.g. floods, storms, fires)\n\n\"Climate change is the key driver of uncertain and changing weather patterns, causing an increased frequency of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts. The Global Risks 2014 report draws attention to the combined implications of these environmental risks on key development and security issues, such as food security and political and social instability, ranked 8th and 10th respectively.\"\n\nGlobal governance failure\n\n\"The risk of global governance failure, which lies at the heart of the risk map, was viewed by respondents as one of the risks that is most connected to others. Weak or inadequate global institutions, agreements or networks, combined with competing national and political interests, impede attempts to cooperate on addressing global risks.\"\n\nFood crises\n\n\"One of the top societal risks in the report, food crises occur when access to appropriate quantities and quality of food and nutrition becomes inadequate or unreliable. Food crises are strongly linked to the risk of climate change and related factors.\"\n\nFailure of a major financial mechanism/institution\n\n\"Over five years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the failure of a major financial mechanism or institution also features among the risks that respondents are most concerned about, as uncertainty about the quality of many banks' assets remains.\"\n\nProfound political and social instability\n\n\"At number 10 is the risk that one or more systemically critical countries will experience significant erosion of trust and mutual obligations between states and citizens. This could lead to state collapse, internal violence, regional or global instability and, potentially, military conflict.\"\n\nThe WEF's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, begins next week on Jan. 22.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/01/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/01/15/davos-world-economic-forum-pre-event-presser/4487561/", "title": "Push 'reset' button on world, WEF founder says", "text": "Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nUpdated Jan. 15, 2014, 8:37 a.m. ET\n\nWEF%27s annual meeting in Davos runs Jan. 22-25\n\nGroup%27s core aim is to address pressing global problems\n\nDozens of heads of state%2C corporate elite attend\n\nIt's time to press the \"reset\" button on the world, the founder of the World Economic Forum said Wednesday, addressing media ahead of the WEF's much ballyhooed annual meeting in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, that gets underway in a week's time.\n\n\"The world is complex, it's fast-moving, it's interconnected, and we in Davos want to provide a mirror to the world as it is.

The world is still much too much caught in a crisis-management mode. We should look at our future in a much more constructive and strategic way.

Andy Beshear attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland to promote the state's economic progress and meet with potential investors.\n\nThe governor participated in panels discussing topics such as supply chains, manufacturing, the future of work and electric vehicles.\n\nThe governor expressed confidence that Kentucky's presence at the forum will lead to further economic growth and opportunity for the state.\n\nLast week, business, government and academic leaders from 125 countries traveled to Davos, Switzerland, for the annual World Economic Forum. And this year, Kentucky was there too.\n\nI was proud to receive the invitation because to me, it signified what would soon be confirmed: The world is seeing the historic progress we’re making in Kentucky, and they want to invest in us.\n\nSo we seized this incredible opportunity and accepted the invitation to reintroduce our New Kentucky Home to employers and CEO’s from across the globe.\n\nDespite being new to the event, we had one of the busiest schedules. In two and a half days, we had 25 meetings with company executives. Ten were with foreign owned companies that already employ over 8,750 Kentuckians. The other meetings were with potential investors from multiple continents that have announced plans to invest in the United States. From L’Oreal to Suntory, DHL, Schneider Electric, Henkel, Pinterest and more, the lineup was full, and the meetings were promising.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nIn between making these pitches, I attended multiple events. At each one, I’d interact with top executives as well as presidents and prime ministers. No matter the meeting or event, at the heart of each discussion was Kentucky, our workforce and our bright future. And everyone with an operation in our commonwealth sung our praises and talked about 2024 being one of their best years ever.\n\nI spoke on supply chains, manufacturing, EVs and more\n\nThat topic was also on display during the five panels I joined. While I spoke on supply chains and manufacturing, the future of our workforce, the future of EVs and more, folks wanted to know Kentucky’s take on global economic issues.\n\nWe took the stage with leaders like Jim Rowan, CEO of Volvo Cars, Randi Weingarten of the American Federation of Teachers, and Olivier Blum, CEO of our very own Schneider Electric, who praised our partnership and what we’ve achieved together.\n\nWe held our own among these experts and showed our strength as not just a national leader – but a global one. My final panel was with fellow Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas, where we showed that in Kentucky, we find common ground and use common sense for the greater good of our people and our future.\n\nIn less than 72 hours, we met with leaders from multiple countries spanning five continents. That would have taken us years to accomplish under normal circumstances.\n\nAnd that’s important, because foreign investment is essential to our overall economic success. Kentucky currently has 540 foreign-owned facilities that employ over 116,000 Kentuckians.\n\nCreating jobs is always my priority\n\nCreating new jobs for our people is always my priority, and I intend to build on the historic success we’ve celebrated these past five years. We’ve already announced $35 billion in private sector investment — the largest investment amount, by far, under any Kentucky governor — creating a record-breaking 59,800 new, good, full-time jobs for our people.\n\nThrough opportunities like the World Economic Forum, we have the chance to grow these numbers at a faster rate than ever before.\n\nAnd that’s why we didn’t waste a single minute on the ground in Davos. Every meeting slot was booked. And while a number of folks joked about us not slowing down, our response was always, “This is what we do in Kentucky — we work hard and get the job done.”\n\nAs I walked away from this incredible opportunity, the one thing I wanted to make sure to bring back home is the pride I felt entering each room. Leaders from companies whose names are familiar worldwide knew about us, about Kentucky. They knew about the success we’ve achieved, and most importantly, they knew that we achieved it by working together.\n\nOur New Kentucky Home was on the world stage. And I feel more confident than ever before that the next few years hold more promise than we could have imagined. Together, we’re going to keep moving forward and building a brighter future for your kids and mine.\n\nWe’ve got a lot to be proud of, Kentucky. And we’re going to make sure our New Kentucky Home continues to be the best place to live, work, invest and thrive.\n\nAndy Beshear is the governor of Kentucky.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/01/21/impeachment-trial-world-economic-forum-mlb-hall-of-fame/4452207002/", "title": "Impeachment trial, World Economic Forum and 5 things to know ...", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nUpdated Jan. 21, 2020, 4:07 p.m. ET\n\nImpeachment trial resumes against President Trump\n\nAfter House Democrats and White House lawyers traded written jabs over the weekend, the Senate will resume the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump on Tuesday and it will likely start with a fierce debate over proposed rules for the first stage of the trial. According to a copy of the four-page draft organizing resolution for the trial obtained by USA TODAY, all evidence from the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry must be made available to all senators before the lawmakers will be able to vote on admitting the materials at a later time. The Senate will debate and vote on these rules Tuesday. The Democratic impeachment managers and the president's lawyers would be given 24 hours each to present their cases. Under these rules, each side's presentations must take place over two working days in the Senate – meaning that presentations could go late into the night.\n\nTrump joins world leaders at World Economic Forum\n\nAs the Senate embarks on the impeachment trial of President Trump Tuesday, he will be in the Swiss Alps at the World Economic Forum in Davos, an annual meeting of world leaders and elite businesses executives. Trump's Davos trip marks his first return to the economic forum since 2018. He canceled a visit in 2019 because the swanky meetings \"to shape global, regional and industry agendas\" fell during the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. Davos has often appealed to left-leaning western ideals of international alliances that run counter to Trump's \"America First\" approach to foreign policy. But Trump downplayed those disputes in his appearance in 2018 and used the event to tout the U.S. economy, a theme he is certain to return to again this week.\n\nWaiting for the phone to ring: MLB announces Hall of Fame inductees\n\nIt's quite possible that baseball's latest cheating scandal could resuscitate the chances for Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens to be elected into the Hall of Fame this year, writes USA TODAY's Bob Nightengale. The National Baseball Hall of Fame will announce the results of its 2019 balloting on Tuesday evening (6 p.m. ET, MLB Network). Candidates must appear on 75% of ballots to earn induction July 26 in Cooperstown, N.Y. If Bonds and Clemens aren’t elected for the widespread belief they used performance-enhancing drugs, are we prepared to keep everyone involved in the Astros’ illegal sign-stealing scheme out of the Hall of Fame, too? Read Nightengale's position.\n\nHow reporters from the USA TODAY Network voted on their official ballots\n\nHuman-to-human transmission confirmed in China's coronavirus outbreak\n\nA Chinese official said that human-to-human transmission has been confirmed in an outbreak of a new coronavirus, a development that raises the possibility that it could spread more quickly and widely. Authorities announced a sharp increase in the number of confirmed cases to more than 200, and China’s leader called on the government to take every possible step to combat the outbreak. In Geneva, the World Health Organization announced it would convene an Emergency Committee meeting Wednesday to determine whether the outbreak warrants being declared a global health crisis. Such declarations are typically made for epidemics of severe diseases that threaten to cross borders and require an internationally coordinated response.\n\nChina virus concerns: Rare airport screenings for some travelers\n\nWeapons ban expires around Virginia's state Capitol\n\nThe Virginia governor's declaration of a state of emergency around the state Capitol expires Tuesday, a day after thousands gathered there to protest proposed gun restrictions. Gov. Ralph Northam had used the declaration to ban all weapons, including firearms, in the square around the Richmond building, in anticipation of violence especially centered around Monday. But the demonstration proved peaceful, even as many demonstrators — at least those outside a security checkpoint at the square itself — openly displayed military-style semiautomatic rifles.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/02/investing/stocks-week-ahead", "title": "Stocks week ahead: Can the stock market's momentum continue into ...", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.\n\nLondon CNN Business —\n\nThe stock market just wrapped up one of its best years on record. Can it repeat its stellar performance in 2022, even when faced with inflation concerns and rising interest rates?\n\nWall Street certainly thinks so.\n\nJonathan Golub, chief US equity strategist at Credit Suisse, predicts that the S&P 500 will rise to 5,200, roughly 9% above where it finished 2021. That would mark a healthy gain, though it pales in comparison to the index’s 27% climb over the past 12 months.\n\nDriving the call: Golub said he’s increasingly optimistic due to “robust projections for economic growth” — and because he expects companies to dole out more cash for stock buybacks, a move that lifts share prices.\n\nHe also said Credit Suisse is no longer betting that corporate taxes will rise to pay for fresh government spending. That’s allowed the bank to raise its forecast for corporate earnings over the next two years.\n\nAnother good sign: The Russell 2000, which tracks smaller American companies, rebounded in December after taking a beating in November. The fate of smaller firms is closely tied to the health of the US economy, since they aren’t insulated by their size. Their stocks are often seen as a barometer for economic expectations.\n\nThe big question mark is interest rate hikes. Near-zero rates have been the driving force behind the stock market’s rebound since its initial Covid-induced crash, providing companies with access to easy money and boosting overall confidence.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has indicated it could raise rates three times in 2022 as it tries to rein in inflation.\n\nShould that happen, borrowing costs will still be extremely low by historical standards. But an environment of increasing rates could shift the mood.\n\n“Risks are rising as central banks are getting closer to winding down emergency monetary support,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in the bank’s 2022 forecast for stocks.\n\nBut the strategists said the market rally is likely to continue thanks to an expected 8% increase in global corporate earnings.\n\n“This should support a reasonably strong year for equity markets overall, contributing to another year for the new bull market, albeit at a slower pace,” they said.\n\nMy thought bubble: Year-ahead predictions are best seen as a snapshot in time. Wall Street’s market estimates for 2020 were quickly thrown out as the pandemic gathered steam. At the start of 2021, few policymakers expected inflation would rise so sharply.\n\nEspecially during a global health crisis that can obscure economic data and make it harder to see the future, it’s tough to say with certainty what’s coming around the bend. For now, though, sentiment is positive.\n\nOmicron scrambles consumer tech’s big conference\n\nCES, one of the technology industry’s top trade shows, is going ahead despite an unprecedented spike in Covid-19 cases fueled by the fast-moving Omicron variant.\n\nThe event will return to Las Vegas this week for the first time since 2020. At last count, more than 2,000 exhibitors had committed to showing up, though there have been a number of high-profile cancellations in recent weeks.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC) and Meta (previously known as Facebook (FB)) have all said they won’t attend in-person. Other tech companies are continuing to pull out in the days leading up to the event.\n\nThe head of the Consumer Technology Association, which hosts CES, said on LinkedIn that the conference “will and must go on.”\n\n“It will have many more small companies than large ones. It may have big gaps on the show floor. Certainly, it will be different from previous years,” Gary Shapiro wrote. “It may be messy. But innovation is messy.”\n\nOn the radar: Other big event organizers have gone a different route. The World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which was due to take place in person in January, has been pushed to early summer.\n\n“Current pandemic conditions make it extremely difficult to deliver a global in-person meeting,” organizers said in late December. “Despite the meeting’s stringent health protocols, the transmissibility of Omicron and its impact on travel and mobility have made deferral necessary.”\n\nUp next\n\nTuesday: OPEC meeting; ISM Manufacturing Index; Data on US job openings\n\nWednesday: CES begins\n\nThursday: Initial US jobless claims; ISM Non-Manufacturing Index; Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Conagra (CAG), Constellation Brands (STZ) and Walgreens (WBA) earnings\n\nFriday: US jobs report for December; European inflation", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/01/02"}]}

There are more of them than you might expect.\n\nSo here's a list for you — a 2020 list of 20 Memphis-Oscar moments in history, from the undeniable to the tenuous.\n\n1. \"You know what, I think it just got a little easier out here for a pimp,\" joked gleeful host Jon Stewart after jubilant Memphis rappers DJ Paul, Juicy J and Frayser Boy startled viewers of the March 5, 2006, Oscars ceremony by knocking out “Travelin’ Thru” (a Dolly Parton song from “Transamerica”) and “In the Deep” (heard in that year’s Best Picture winner, “Crash”) to take home the Best Original Song award for their \"Hustle & Flow\" anthem,\"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp” — a title that instantly became a national catch-phrase.\n\nFor its busy Oscar-stage performance of the song, the Three 6 Mafia cohorts were joined by “Hustle” co-star Taraji P. Henson; but more memorable than the live musical number was the win itself, announced by Queen Latifah, who pointed out that if “It’s Hard Out Here for a Pimp” was an unusual title for an Oscar-nominated song, it was no stranger than “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” or \"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.”\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\n“This is the first Academy Award and nomination for Jordan Houston, Cedric Coleman and Paul Beauregard,” an offstage M.C. announced, probably unnecessarily, citing the birth names of Juicy J, Frayser Boy and DJ Paul; meanwhile, the director of the Oscar telecast cut to reaction shots of Parton and “Hustle” producer John Singleton, applauding in the audience as the rappers bounced onstage on their sneakered heels. “How come they’re the most excited people here tonight?” Stewart asked, after the trio made its noisy exit. “They’re thrilled. That’s how you accept an Oscar.”\n\n2. As Oscar-winning Memphis composers, the hip-hop artists followed in the piano pedal-pushing footsteps of “Hustle & Flow” co-star Isaac Hayes, who brought Oscar gold back to his Bluff City hometown in 1972 when he earned the Best Original Song award for his “Theme from Shaft,” the wah-wah-guitar-driven saga of “a black private dick who’s a sex machine to all the chicks.”\n\nIn one of the more elaborate and certainly the funkiest Oscar musical numbers up to that time, Hayes performed the song while seated at a rolling white piano, draped in his signature gold-chain vest and surrounded by about 20 dancers in bikini tops and bell bottoms. “Wow! Was that something?” asked Sammy Davis Jr., who came onstage after Hayes. “Talk about heavy.”\n\nBy the time he accepted the award from \"Cabaret\" star Joel Grey, Hayes had changed into a sort of fur-lined midnight-blue tuxedo with a floppy owl-wingspan bow tie. The 29-year-old \"Black Moses\" devoted most of his short speech to his 79-year-old grandmother, Rushia Wade, who had accompanied him to the Oscars. Hayes credited her prayers with “keeping my feet on the path of righteousness.” The \"Shaft\" Oscar is now on display at the Stax Museum of American Soul Music.\n\n3. \"Can't Stop the Feeling,\" a song that appeared in the animated toy-inspired fantasy-comedy \"Trolls,\" is hardly as significant to the career of Justin Timberlake as \"Shaft\" was to Isaac Hayes or \"Pimp\" to Three 6 Mafia. Even so, in 2017 Timberlake earned his only Oscar nomination to date, in the Best Song category, for composing that number, along with credited co-writers Max Martin and Shellback.\n\n4. A movie about an underdog team became an underdog winner when \"Undefeated\" won the Best Documentary Feature Oscar in 2012. The movie chronicled the relationship between volunteer coach Bill Courtney and the members of the football team at Memphis inner-city Manassas High School, many of whom faced hardship both on and off the gridiron. Competing against \"Undefeated\" for that year's documentary Oscar was \"Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory,\" the concluding film in the trilogy by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky that was instrumental in exonerating the so-called West Memphis Three, the three young men convicted in the 1993 child murders in West Memphis, Arkansas. A previous nominee in the Documentary Feature category was 1970's \"King: A Filmed Record ... Montgomery to Memphis,\" a movie about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that lost to \"Woodstock.\"\n\n5. Memphis-born Kathy Bates was a relatively busy relative unknown when she knocked viewers’ socks off and knocked James Caan’s ankles into bone-brittle as the mallet-wielding Annie Wilkes in “Misery,” the paranoid and prescient Stephen King horror/satire that imagined fan culture at its most lethal. She earned the Best Actress Oscar for her, shall we say, pains, and became one of the movie industry’s most recognizable and in-demand actresses.\n\nA proud member of the White Station High School Class of 1966, Bates was nominated again, in the Best Supporting Actress category, for 1999’s “Primary Colors” and for 2003’s “About Schmidt.” More to the 2020 point, she’s nominated this year, too, for her role as the loyal mother of the title embattled Atlanta Olympics bombing suspect in director Clint Eastwood’s “Richard Jewell.”\n\n6. If you want another high-profile nominee with a Memphis connection to root for during this year's Oscar telecast, set your sights on Shannon McIntosh, one of three producers cited — along with David Heyman and Quentin Tarantino — in the Best Picture nomination for writer-director Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" McIntosh came to Memphis to earn a master's degree in communication/film in 1991 at the University of Memphis; since that time, she has become a key Tarantino collaborator, as a producer of \"Grindhouse,\" \"Django Unchained\" (five Oscar nominations, including Best Picture), \"The Hateful Eight\" (three nominations) and \"Once Upon a Time\" (10 nominations).\n\n7. He's not nominated this year, but Memphis-born, Mississippi-based Morgan Freeman may be the Bluff City native with the most Oscar recognition. Freeman has been nominated twice for Best Supporting Actor, for \"Street Smart\" and \"Million Dollar Baby\" (he won the award that year), and three times for Best Actor, for \"Driving Miss Daisy,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption\" and \"Invictus.\"\n\n8. “Hustle & Flow” wasn’t the only Memphis-made movie recognized at the 2006 Oscars. Nashville-raised Reese Witherspoon was named Best Actress at that same ceremony for her performance as June Carter in “Walk the Line,” which was shot in Memphis and the Mid-South in 2004 by director James Mangold (“Ford v Ferrari”). The movie earned four other Academy Award nominations, including a Best Actor nod for the man who played the Man in Black, Joaquin Phoenix, considered the front runner for that honor this year for “Joker.” (The award in 2006 went to Philip Seymour Hoffman for “Capote.”)\n\n9. Competing against Phoenix but also going home empty-handed in 2006 was another “Hustle & Flow” nominee, Terrence Howard, whose pimp character, DJay, experiences the mid-life crisis that motivates not only the plot of writer-director Craig Brewer’s Memphis-made and Memphis-set movie but also the film’s Oscar-winning “Pimp” song.\n\n10. In 2003, director Alejandro González Iñárritu brought an all-star cast — Sean Penn, Melissa Leo and Danny Huston, among others — to Memphis to act in his second feature film, “21 Grams,” which earned a Best Actress nomination for Naomi Watts and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Benicio del Toro. Iñárritu went on to make Academy Award history as the third person to win back-to-back Best Director Oscars (after John Ford and Joseph L. Mankiewicz), for “Birdman” and “The Revenant.”\n\n11. It’s likely Academy members were thinking of the film’s stranded-on-a-tropical-island scenes rather than it’s home-in-Memphis moments, but Tom Hanks was nominated in 2001 for Best Actor for his role as a FedEx systems analyst in director Robert Zemeckis’ “Cast Away,” partly filmed in the city that is home base for the absolutely-positively-overnight delivery company.\n\n12. “The People vs. Larry Flynt” was a 1996 movie that was shot in Memphis even though it had no overt Memphis connections in its content (the story’s free-speech theme certainly was familiar to those who remember decades of Memphis arts censorship, however). Woody Harrelson earned a Best Actor nomination for his performance as “Hustler” magazine publisher Larry Flynt, while Milos Forman earned his third nod for Best Director — an award he’d won twice before, for movies that also took the Best Picture trophy, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and \"Amadeus.\"\n\n13. If you’re starting to sense that almost every time a major-studio movie is shot in Memphis it earns Oscar recognition, you’re right. Films adapted from novels by former Memphis lawyer turned best-selling author John Grisham contributed to the trend, and the first of these was director Sydney Pollack’s 1993 hit “The Firm.\" Tom Cruise was the star, but its Oscar nominations went to Holly Hunter, for Best Supporting Actress, and to composer-pianist Dave Grusin, for Best Score.\n\n14. The next Memphis-made Grisham adaptation was Joel Schumacher's 1994 “The Client,\" which brought Susan Sarandon a Best Actress nomination for her role as tough lawyer Regina “Reggie” Love. Unfortunately, the next film in the sequence, 1997's \"The Rainmaker,\" was ignored by Oscar, even though the director was Francis Ford Coppola and the cast was headed by a newcomer named Matt Damon.\n\n15. Although Memphians were upset when the movie was filmed in Georgia rather than in the Memphis area, where the action takes place, 2009's \"The Blind Side\" — the true-life story of high school football player Michael Oher and his adoptive family, the Tuohys — scored with Oscar voters, who nominated the film for Best Picture and named Sandra Bullock as Best Actress for her role as spunky Leigh Anne Tuohy. The supporting cast included Kathy Bates, and the movie was produced by FedEx founder Fred Smith's Alcon Entertainment company, with daughter Molly Smith an executive producer.\n\nWith her own company, Black Label Media, Molly Smith has continued to attract Oscar attention with her production \"Sicario,\" a border drug war drama nominated in 2016 for Cinematography, Original Score and Sound Editing, and, more notably, the much-acclaimed Los Angeles neo-musical \"La La Land,\" which due to a snafu at the 2017 Oscars ceremony was announced as the winner of the Best Picture award, until the show's producers recognized the mistake and announced that the actual winner was \"Moonlight.\" \"La La Land\" received a staggering 14 Oscar nominations, tying a record previously set by \"All About Eve\" and \"Titanic\"; although it did not win Best Picture, it won in six categories, including Best Director (Damien Chazelle), Best Actress (Emma Stone), Best Cinematography (Linus Sandgren), Best Production Design, Best Original Song (\"City of Stars\") and Best Original Score (Justin Hurwitz).\n\n16. Rarely mentioned today in lists of famous Memphians, director Walter Lang — born in Memphis in 1896 — directed movies for four decades, starting with \"The Red Kimono\" in 1926 and concluding with what he probably would be sad to learn has become one of his most-discussed efforts, \"Snow White and the Three Stooges,\" in 1961. In between, he was a musical stalwart, directing numerous song-filled CinemaScope hits, including the beloved 1956 version of \"The King and I,\" which earned Lang a Best Director nod among its nine Oscar nominations. Lang lost to George Stevens for \"Giant,\" but the film earned five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Yul Brynner).\n\n17. One of the greatest film artists ever to come out of Memphis was dancer/choreographer Hermes Pan, who spent about as much time here as did Aretha Franklin: He was born in 1909, but his family had moved to Nashville by the time he was 2 years old. A key collaborator at RKO on all the Fred Astaire musicals, Pan was Oscar-nominated in the now-vanished Best Dance Direction category for \"Top Hat\" (1935) and \"Swing Time\" (1936), and he won that award for \"A Damsel in Distress\" (1937).\n\n18. The connection is relatively minor, but no Memphis-linked movie has been as Oscar-honored as 1991's \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" one of three films in Academy Awards history — the others are \"It Happened One Night\" (1934) and \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" (1976) — to take home trophies in the so-called \"top five\" categories, namely Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay (it also earned nominations for Film Editing and Sound). Although only secondary footage was shot here, some of the story's gruesome action takes place in Memphis, including a key scene with cannibal Hannibal Lecter that involves a cage-like holding cell inside what is supposed to be the Shelby County Courthouse.\n\n19. Memphis' Academy Awards history goes back almost to the start of the awards. In 1930, for the third annual ceremony, King Vidor was nominated as Best Director for the previous year's \"Hallelujah,\" a groundbreaking movie with a cast of black actors that was shot in and around Memphis, in cotton fields and clubs. Vidor lost out to Lewis Milestone, director of the World War I drama \"All Quiet on the Western Front,\" which also won the award for Best Picture — a victory that could be echoed if the WWI nail-biter \"1917\" wins this year.\n\n20. At the same time, Memphis' Oscar history is as recent as last year. \"Green Book,\" winner in 2019 of the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (Mahershala Ali), contains a sequence set though not shot in Memphis, when the characters played by Ali and Viggo Mortensen check into a hotel that is supposed to be The Peabody. The film's cast includes Memphis-born David Kallaway, in the brief role of a Louisville \"redneck\" (the word used in the closing credits).", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/08/entertainment/denzel-washington-oscar-academy-award-record-cec", "title": "Denzel Washington just broke his own Oscar nominations record ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDenzel Washington keeps making history.\n\nThe iconic actor, known for his roles in movies like “Training Day” and “Malcolm X,” just picked up his tenth Academy Award nomination, this time for best actor in “The Tragedy of Macbeth” – making him the most nominated Black actor in Oscar history and breaking his own record.\n\nEven before Tuesday’s nominations were announced, Washington was the most nominated Black actor in history, receiving his ninth nod in 2018 for his work in “Roman J. Israel, Esq.”\n\nBut even with this accomplishment, Washington hasn’t actually won the award in 20 years. He only has two Oscar statues to show for his work – the first for “Glory,” at the 1990 awards, and the second for “Training Day,” in 2002.\n\nStill, he is prolific. With this year’s nomination, Washington has now been nominated for the Academy Awards in every decade since the 1980s. His first was a supporting actor nod in 1988 for “Cry Freedom.”\n\nThe Oscars historically have not been kind to Black actors. Though Sidney Poitier became the first Black man to win the best actor award in 1964, Washington was only the second in 2002. And only one Black woman has ever won the best actress award – Halle Berry, in 2002 for her work in “Monster’s Ball.”\n\nMeanwhile, Meryl Streep, whose feature film debut preceded Washington’s by four years, continues to hold the most acting Oscar nominations of all time with 21 nods.

The series is based on Jones' 2011 book, \"The Three of Us: Growing Up with Tammy and George.\"\n\nAlso in her post, Georgette Jones said the music for the series is being done by Oscar and Grammy winner T Bone Burnett, known for his work on such films as \"Walk the Line,\" \"Cold Mountain\" and \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\"\n\nIt's not clear when filming is supposed to start, but with all of the studio space at EUE/Screen Gems Studios currently booked with other productions, \"George & Tammy\" would appear to be using Wilmington-area locations for the most part.\n\nIn her post on Facebook, Jones said the actor Josh Brolin was initially set to play her father, but due to scheduling conflicts Brolin will serve as co-producer instead.\n\n\"George & Tammy\" started pre-production in Wilmington back in April, but went on hiatus after a couple of weeks. It will be the latest production to shoot locally in what could be a record year for the film industry in Wilmington.\n\nThere are currently four major TV productions currently listed as in-production on the website for the Wilmington Regional Film Commission: \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" for Amazon, \"Echoes\" and \"Florida Man\" for Netflix and \"Our Kind of People\" for Fox.\n\nThe feature films \"One True Loves\" and \"Breakwater\" are listed as being in pre-production.\n\nThe \"George & Tammy\" miniseries was written by Abe Sylvia, who's known for his TV work (\"Nurse Jackie,\" \"Dead to Me\"). Sylvia also wrote the screenplay for the forthcoming \"The Eyes of Tammy Faye,\" based on the documentary about the rise and fall of Christian evangelist Tammy Faye Bakker, which also stars Chastain.\n\nChastain is a Golden Globe winner (2013's \"Zero Dark Thirty\") and two-time Oscar nominee (best supporting actress for \"The Help\" and best actress for \"Zero Dark Thirty\"). Chastain's Freckle Films production company is also involved with \"George & Tammy.\"\n\nShannon has scored best supporting actor Oscar nominations for roles in \"Revolutionary Road\" and \"Nocturnal Animals.\"\n\n\"George & Tammy\" will chronicle the couple's often-tumultuous six-year marriage, which ended in divorce in 1975. The country couple was known for their series of duets — “We’re Gonna Hold On,” “Golden Ring” and “Near You\" — but had many individual hits as well, like Wynette's \"Stand By Your Man\" and \"D-I-V-O-R-C-E\" and Jones' \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" and \"The Race is On.\"\n\nAccording to a story from September of 2020 by film industry publication The Hollywood Reporter, \"George & Tammy\" was originally planned as a feature film for Fox Searchlight Pictures. A news release last year from the Paramount Network said it's now being co-produced by Spectrum Originals and Paramount Network.

They live a quaint life as they tend to their garden, host guests and play, all while the home borders a concentration camp.\n\nWhile the film may not show what lies behind the wall, sound designer Johnnie Burn and production sound mixer Tarn Willers bring it to audience members' attention through the echoes of gas chambers, distant gunfire shots and screams from inside the camp. For their work, they earned a BAFTA Award and an Oscar nomination for best sound. The film garnered four more nominations for picture, director, international feature film and adapted screenplay.\n\n\"The Zone of Interest\" also struck a chord with local audiences, as it won the FIPRESCI best international screenplay award at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. The film will be showing at Mary Pickford is D Place, Regal Rancho Mirage, Cinemark Century at the River and Cinemark Century La Quinta before the 96th Academy Awards on March 10. Showtimes can be found at www.fandango.com.\n\n\"I've never worked on a film like it for sound,\" Burn said in a recent interview with The Desert Sun. \"I felt enormously worried about the responsibility of landing that correctly, and doing it justice to the material and survivors and victims and making sure a good job was done.\"\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nBurn and Glazer have known each other for nearly three decades and have collaborated on past films \"Under the Skin\" and \"Birth.\" When the director approached him about \"The Zone of Interest,\" Burn said that Glazer knew he \"had no interest in recreating images of the atrocities that we have all seen.\" The film was going to rely on sound, though Glazer wasn't sure exactly how at the time. Burn was then tasked with finding out what 24 hours at Auschwitz would have sounded like in 1943.\n\nThe sound designer dove into novels, witness testimonies and the archives of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. First, it was understanding what the environment would have sounded like, such as what types of motorbikes would have passed by the camp and what kinds of guns would have been used. But the bulk of research, however, was dedicated to reproducing \"the atrocities and the incidences of murder,\" he said, a task that weighed heavy on Burn's heart.\n\n\"Prisoners escaping, whipping, the gas chambers, all of those things, and collating the many different descriptions of, say, how the gas chambers would sound with people screaming and banging on the door a few minutes in, and then that would slowly subside,\" Burn described. \"The German soldiers would start motorbike engines to block out the sound to preserve the sanity of the other soldiers, the other officers and the family.\"\n\nThe sounds are disturbing and ever-present in the film, but the Höss family tunes them out without second thought. Only when a family member comes to visit, someone who is not exposed to the constant horrors over the wall, does someone acknowledge what is happening just a few feet away.\n\nBurn added that some noises were taken out of the film because \"it was too much.\"\n\n\"Tarn said, 'You probably had it worse than me because whilst we were at Auschwitz, you had to listen to it,'\" Burn said. \"The whole period of post-production was pretty horrible, and I don't want to do that again.\"\n\nCapturing moments inside the family home also took on an interesting process. \"Normally on a film set, the director would say, 'Please record the words the actors are speaking primarily, I don't want to really hear anything else, we can do the rest in post-production,'\" Burn explained. But Glazer was more interested in hearing the lived-in experiences in the house, such as people walking from room to room or the clanking of teacups. To achieve that, there were 20 microphones hidden around the home, and scenes were filmed simultaneously.\n\n\"To follow the action around the house and blend the sound is kind of unusual in a film,\" Burn said. \"You normally want to only have one thing, like a voice or a piece of music, but here it's about hearing the entire house all at once in a way that a family house can be noisy.\"\n\nIt was a tough project to be a part of, but soon after Burn was able to dive into Yorgos Lanthimos' comedy \"Poor Things,\" which earned 11 Oscar nominations. The film also screened at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, and lead actress Emma Stone earned the Desert Palm Achievement Award, Actress, at the Palm Springs International Film Awards.\n\nBurn was with the \"Poor Things\" team in Dublin when Oscar nominations rolled in, and an Irish television news crew was filming people's reactions. When he heard his name announced, he laughed that he \"gave a very loud cheer live on Irish national TV.\"\n\n\"I'm amazed. I'm so pleased for the film. It's great that this film will get a wider audience,\" Burn said about \"The Zone of Interest.\" \"I've never had an Oscar nomination before, so I'm super thrilled.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/02"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/us/955380/does-golden-globe-awards-spell-trouble", "title": "Could the 'muted' Golden Globes spell trouble for awards season ...", "text": "West Side Story, Succession and Netflix drama The Power of the Dog were the big winners at Sunday night’s “muted” Golden Globe awards ceremony.\n\nThe traditionally glitzy event was “dramatically pared down”, said the BBC, without any celebrities in attendance or official press access.

Meanwhile, stars including Scarlett Johansson and Tom Cruise distanced themselves from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the organisation behind the awards.\n\nThis followed an investigation by the Los Angeles Times, which revealed that the HFPA had no black members and alleged that members had accepted freebies or perks which may have influenced how they voted.\n\nAccording to the LA Times, more than 30 HFPA members had flown to France in 2019 to visit the Emily in Paris set, where the “Paramount Network treated the group to a two-night stay” at a five-star hotel. Representatives for Paramount Network and Netflix declined to comment on the claim.\n\nDespite the row, the 2021 Golden Globes ceremony went ahead as scheduled on 28 February.\n\nBut the televised awards received “barely one-third the size of 2020’s viewership” and was “by far the least-watched ceremony in modern Globes history”, said New York Magazine’s Vulture site.\n\n‘On a journey of change’\n\nAfter the LA Times exposé, the HFPA announced that it would “overhaul its practices and diversify its membership”, said the BBC.\n\nOver the past year, repair work by the organisation behind the Globes has included “overhauling previously restrictive bylaws, implementing changes with regards to code of conduct and ethical practices, and bringing in a diverse set of 21 new members”, reported The Guardian.\n\n“Last year the Hollywood Foreign Press Association was challenged to change – and we did,” said HFPA president Helen Hoehne. “We are on a journey of change and we’re not going to rest. We are going to be outspoken about what we’re learning and challenge others to join us.”\n\nDeclining audiences\n\nNeither the Golden Globes nor the annual US-Canadian Critics’ Choice Movie Awards have “any relevance in this year’s awards season leading up to the Oscars”, said the LA Times.\n\nHowever, these various awards shows do have something in common: a declining audience.\n\nThe 2020 Oscars received around six million fewer viewers than it did in 2019 and the 2021 ceremony similarly suffered a “catastrophic drop in television viewers”, plummeting to below ten million, said The Times.\n\nDespite 2021 being a record-breaking year for diversity, the 93rd Academy Awards ceremony was described by USA Today as being “a train wreck at the train station, an excruciatingly long, boring telecast that lacked the verve of so many movies we love”.\n\nThis week, it was announced that the forthcoming Oscars ceremony – due to take place on 27 March – will have a host for the first time since 2018.\n\n“Producers will be hoping for a significant jump in viewership following last year’s disastrous numbers,” said The Times.

The award selection group, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, is \"made up of around 90 international — no Black — journalists who attend movie junkets each year in search of a better life,\" co-host Tina Fey said in her opening monologue. Several presenters and award recipients quipped about the lack of diversity behind the scenes and onstage.\n\nPressure has mounted to address the homogeneity of nominees and nominators in mainstream award shows in recent years. From 1980 to 2015, white actors won 84% of Oscars' men's categories and 89% of women's acting awards, according to data scientist Eugene Woo.\n\nNeed a news break?

They recognize the quality of films and television, and how marginalized groups are represented. The shows foster a space where communities can celebrate themselves and their art.\n\n\"All of us that are advocating for underrepresented groups, we all have an award event,\" said Deborah Calla, chairperson of the Media Access Awards, which honors films and TV that feature people with disabilities. \"They're spectacular because it tells the people who are winning that we are watching and appreciating what they're doing. For those not doing that, it reminds them there's another way to work and it can be just as exciting and successful.\"\n\nHere's a look at award shows that celebrate underrepresented creators, and use their platforms to draw attention to issues facing diverse populations.\n\nMedia Access Awards\n\nPeople with disabilities make up 25% of the population, but they are represented in less than 3% of onscreen roles, according to The Disability List, which the Media Access Awards created in collaboration with several other organizations. The Media Access Awards recognizes people with disabilities on screen, how they portray disability narratives and who fills roles behind the scenes.\n\nCalla had to dig to find writers, directors, actors and more to honor with Media Access Awards after she took over in 2010.\n\n\"Two minutes on a TV show was enough to give an award because there was nothing,\" Calla said. \"But these days it's like 'what about this person, that show, that person?' There are a lot more but still nowhere what we need to reflect this huge group of people.\"\n\nCreators may shy away from portraying disabilities out of fear or lack of knowledge about people with disabilities, Calla believes. She said it's important to hold an award show that honors this population to address people's misconceptions.\n\n\"I really hope that content creators continue to create stories that involve people with disabilities because television and film teaches society how to interact with each other,\" Calla said. \"With content we can change the world.\"\n\nWatch it: Catch the 2021 Media Access Awards at 9 p.m. EST Nov. 18.

GLAAD is an LGBTQ media organization that combats misinformation about the community and advocates for LGBTQ rights.\n\nGLAAD Media Awards, which began in 1990, celebrate LGBTQ narratives in film, television, journalism, theater and other media that showcase the community \"in fair, accurate and inclusive ways would inspire more media outlets to do the same,\" Ferraro said.\n\n\"We know that what people see in the media has a huge affect in the decisions that are made in schools, in classrooms, in the ballot box, in offices around the country,\" Ferraro said. \"The founders of GLAAD knew that if we were able to get queer stories in the media … we would be able to change hearts and minds and start to grow acceptance and pave the way for legal equality.\"\n\nAlong with recognizing media creator's accomplishments, GLAAD uses its award show stage to shed a global spotlight on LGBTQ issues, moments that are not typically seen in mainstream award shows. They invite household names to speak to key issues facing the community, like actress Betty White who spoke in support of marriage equality at the 2013 GLAAD Media Awards. Madonna presented at the same ceremony dressed in a Boy Scout uniform on stage to protest the organization's ban on gay members.\n\nWatch it: Stream the 2021 GLAAD Media Awards at 8 p.m. EST April 8 live on GLAAD's YouTube channel or stream later in the evening on Hulu.\n\nRed Nation International Film Festival\n\nThe first Native American to win an Oscar, Wes Studi, accepted his golden statue just two years ago. But Native American filmmakers and actors have produced work for decades. Joanelle Romero landed the first leading role played by a Native American actor in the 1977 film \"The Girl Called Hatter Fox.\" Romero is now president, CEO and director of the Red Nation International Film Festival and Awards.\n\nRomero founded Red Nation Celebration Institute 25 years ago to celebrate Native American stories and people in movies. Along with the international festival and awards, the institute puts on a Native Women in Film festival during the week prior to the Oscars \"so that we're in front of the industry in one of the most important weeks,\" Romero said. Zhao, the director who made Oscar history this year, has shown several films and won awards at previous Red Nation festivals.\n\nThe institute also manages Red Nation Television Network, which has been available to stream for 15 years.\n\nHollywood institutions, like the Academy, that put on mainstream award shows have made \"baby steps\" toward Native American inclusion with moves like recognizing Studi, but those small movements \"no longer hold weight,\" Romero said.\n\nRomero is a one of few Native filmmakers to be an Academy member. The Hollywood Foreign Press has even fewer Native American decision-makers, Romero said. The Red Nation Celebration Institute has repeatedly asked to partner with the Academy, to get Native films on mainstream screens and awards. The Academy says \"no\" each time.\n\n\"Our institute and our board of directors have created programs, initiatives, award ceremonies and festivals to amplify our contemporary voices in pop culture now. That’s what's relevant,\" Romero said. \"These [other] institutes should be looking at the Native organizations that have done the work for years.\"\n\nWatch it: The 2021 Red Nation International Film Festivals will run from Nov. 1-30 on Red Nation Television Network and its website, where you can find out more.\n\nA look at the Oscar nominations this year: Female directors triumph in Oscar nominations, but why is 'Judas' the only Black-led film in the best picture race?\n\nArab Film Fest Collab\n\nRepresentation of Arab cultures in film has gotten better, said Arab Film and Media Institute Executive Director Serge Bakalian. If you asked him five years ago, though, he would have shared a different opinion.\n\nViewership of screenings sent to voters and responses to films from Arab states have improved, Bakalian said. Historically, though, media has represented Arab people in \"atrocious\" stereotypes.\n\nLike Calla, Bakalian believes showcasing Arab narratives is \"transformative\" for how people understand the array of Arab cultures.\n\n\"We use the word ‘Arab’ in the most inclusive manner,\" Bakalian said. \"It's so diverse in terms of race, identity, faith. Within that spectrum you're not looking at a monolithic people. That's what we’re trying to show in all of our programming and our films.\"\n\nEgypt submitted the first Arab film the Oscars considered in 1959, \"Cairo Station.\" It did not receive a nomination, but the following decade the Academy nominated the first Arabic-language film, \"The Battle of Algiers\" for Best Foreign Language Film, Best Screenplay and Best Director. By 2010 to 2019, the Academy nominated from six Arab countries they had not selected content from before.\n\nBakalian grew up in Beirut, and when he moved to the U.S. he saw film after film set in his birth city told stories that perpetuated Arab stereotypes. He didn't see himself on the screen.\n\n\"When you're raised, especially for young Arabs, where Arabs are the bad guys, all these stereotypes, when that’s all you see and then you see a film ... one that you relate with, that you see a more authentic representation of you and your family and your culture, I think that’s really empowering,\" Bakalian said.\n\nWatch it: Organizers have not chosen a final date, but expect to hold the Arab Film Festival in October or November. Check the Arab Film and Media Institute's website for updates.\n\nBlack Reel Awards\n\nWhether it's a good or bad year for Black representation in film, TV or award shows, \"there's always a place for Black creatives, filmmakers and performers to have their work acknowledged,\" Tim Gordon said. That place: the Black Reel Awards, founded in 1999 and led by Gordon.\n\nThe Black Reel Awards recognizes independent and international films that span the African diaspora, in English or not, and looks for works by filmmakers who have been in the business for years but never earned awards.\n\n\"I think the days of wondering whether or not stories about Black people or stories told through a Black perspective are ... going to be told, I don't worry about anymore because of the influx of directors and new visionaries like Barry Jenkins and Ava DuVernay,\" Gordon said. \"The next frontier is that we've got to pull more women, whether it's women of color, whether it's just women in general.\"\n\nGordon believes the Black Reel Awards pick diverse films because the more than 100 members select nominees for the show's 24 categories.\n\n\"There's no lobbying, there's not studios calling up our voters trying to get them to change votes,\" Gordon said. \"People vote their conscience. Year in and year out, we see how that results in things that people feel are the best of a particular year are the things that are honored.\"\n\nWatch it: Catch the 2021 Black Reel Awards virtually on April 11 at 8 p.m. EST. Check its website and social media for updates on where to find the show.\n\nSpirit Awards\n\nDiversity runs in the DNA of Film Independent, the nonprofit that organizes the Spirit Awards, said President Josh Welsh.\n\nThat's in part because anyone passionate about film can become a member for a $95 annual fee and help select the show's nominees. Black, Indigenous and people of color made up 51% of the Spirit Awards nominations committee in 2020, according to a Film Independent Impact Report.\n\nIn contrast, members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences must receive invitations to join the voting body, and Hollywood Foreign Press Association applicants must be sponsored by two current members and have several years of entertainment journalism experience.\n\nSpirit Awards leader plan \"a ton of outreach and turn every stone to make sure filmmakers know they're eligible\" to make the process \"inherently inclusive,\" said Associate Director of Nominations Setu Raval.\n\n\"[The Spirit Awards are] so much about inspiring audiences and inspiring future artists and filmmakers and storytellers,\" Raval said. \"The more representation we have, the more young people will choose to be creators and tell their stories.\"\n\nIt's important for people to see themselves on screen, and films and TV with the ability to reach millions of viewers are such powerful mediums, Welsh said.\n\n\"Knowing there are segments of the population that don’t get to see themselves on screen is just not good,\" Welsh said. \"That carries over to award shows. It matters who the host is, who the presenters are. Some years we’re better at it than others, we are still committed to working on.\"\n\nWatch it: Catch the 2021 Film Independent Spirit Awards at 10 p.m. EST April 22 on IFC.\n\nAsian American International Film Festival\n\nAfter a successful debut film, marginalized filmmakers face obstacles to create films to follow it, said Wynton Wong, the programming manager for the Asian American International Film Festival. That's where the film festival steps in.\n\n\"We're trying our hardest to find not only the first-time filmmakers that we think are doing good work and deserve additional resources and time to have their second and third film, but also the filmmakers that have been grinding in the indie scene for decades,\" Wong said. \"We want to provide name recognition for this film, this evolution of their career.\"\n\nThe AAIFF award categories this year expanded to honor storytelling. Wong said people of color are usually at the forefront of new formats, and award categories include short-form web, which recognize creations like TikTok videos and Instagram reels. The group also gives awards for video games and virtual reality. Wong said really great storytelling is happening by \"the next wave of storytellers\" in video game spaces.\n\n\"What if you really pushed the boundaries of what form and structure are?,\" Wong asked. \"Because that's what we haven't seen, and if we're talking about representation, that is much more interesting.\"\n\nWatch it: The 2021 Asian American International Film Festival will take place Aug. 11-22 in a hybrid format with primarily virtual and some limited in-person events in New York City. Check out AAIFF's event website for more information.\n\nNAACP Image Awards\n\nWhen people think of the NAACP, they likely envision 112 years of racial justice work to gain equity and inclusion for Black Americans — not an awards show.\n\nThe NAACP Image Awards are a manifestation of the organization's year-round efforts, said NAACP Hollywood Bureau Senior Vice President Kyle Bowser. The Hollywood Bureau launched in 2002 after almost no Black people received Oscar nominations.\n\nFollowing Reign's #OscarsSoWhite hashtag that drew attention to the Academy's whiteness, the NAACP still had a space where they had to push for Black inclusion.\n\n\"We put a lot of energy into lobbying the [film] industry, both the infrastructure — those who sort of monetize the art — and the artist community themselves,\" Bowser said.\n\nThe NAACP Image Awards, like the Black Reel Awards, show Black filmmakers they are appreciated by their own, Bowser said. They continue to press for mainstream recognition, but coming to the Image Awards is like coming home and \"getting a warm hug.\"\n\n\"There's something very positive, warm and welcoming about the Image Awards, because it's a community turning inward and saluting itself for things that were well done,\" Bowser said.\n\nWatch it: Catch the 2021 NAACP Image Awards on March 27 at 8 p.m. EST on BET\n\nCinema Tropical\n\nLatin America has become an epicenter of world cinema, leading a generation of Latinx filmmakers to conquer Hollywood in recent years, said Cinema Tropical Executive Director Carlos Gutiérrez. But he believes the U.S. has been slow to assimilate, and Latinx creators’ projects cannot access funding as easily as their counterparts in Latin America.\n\nCinema Tropical works to promote and award filmmakers the organization feels are not getting the attention they deserve.\n\n“We are going to focus more on films that are pushing the envelope in terms of narrative,\" Gutiérrez said. “For the most part, looking back [at] the films that have won … they tend to be bolder.”\n\nCinema Tropical tries to “bridge the cultural experience between Latin America and Latinx people in the U.S.,” Gutiérrez said. The organization dedicates an award category to best Latinx film, along with a Latin American competition, but both showcase “a larger sense of what’s going on in Latin America and also here in the U.S.\"\n\nAlong with giving a platform to an underrepresented population, Cinema Tropical awards “validate” Latinx creators and fantastic work that many mainstream organizations do not showcase, Gutiérrez said.\n\nWatch it: Cinema Tropical's 2021 award show took place on Jan. 19, and they have not chosen a 2022 date, but say it will likely take place the second or third week of January 2022.

Of the more than 600 people arrested in a blitz in Chicago, only 16 had a criminal record, according to Justice Department records submitted in federal court.\n\nThe surge of federal resources comes as New Orleans is experiencing a drop in crime rates. According to city data, violent crimes – including murder, rape and aggravated assault – are down 7% from last year and 32% from 2022, when New Orleans had the highest homicide rate in the country.\n\nLouisiana Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, a close ally of Trump, said he supports the federal intervention.\n\n\"We welcome our federal partners,\" he said in a recent Fox News appearance, describing New Orleans as a \"crime-ridden city.\"\n\nNew Orleans Mayor-elect Helena Moreno, a Democrat, said she was concerned by federal agents' actions in other cities and launched a reporting tool to track potentially unlawful behavior by immigration officers.\n\n\"My first priority is to keep our community safe. The reports of due process violations and potential abuses in other cities are concerning,\" she said in a statement in late November. \"I want our community to be aware and informed of the protections available under law. We must demand accountability and that peoples’ rights are not violated.\"\n\nSince rumors spread of an operation in New Orleans, hundreds of demonstrators have taken to the streets in recent days to speak out against the federal push. Immigrant rights advocates braced for the arrival of federal agents, warning residents in immigrant communities to limit their time outdoors.\n\nNew Orleans is among a group of cities the Department of Justice considers sanctuary jurisdictions, which the agency defines as places with \"policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.\"\n\nFor more than a decade, the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office, which manages all detention facilities in New Orleans, has had a policy of refusing requests from immigration officials to temporarily hold arrested suspects unless they've been charged with murder, rape or other serious violent offenses.\n\nIn February, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill sued the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office, alleging that the agency's policies violate a state law passed in 2024 requiring law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/10/trumps-travel-ban-us-shuts-doors-countries/84123689007/", "title": "Trump's travel ban is here: What to know as US shuts the door", "text": "Updated June 10, 2025, 8:38 p.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON − President Donald Trump has launched a sweeping crackdown on legal entry into the United States through a revived travel ban, as his administration takes dramatic steps to block millions of people from taking up temporary or permanent residency.\n\nTrump's extensive effort to keep visitors from nearly two dozen countries out of the United States had led the administration to block most travel from places including Haiti and Somalia, revoke temporary protected immigration status for hundreds of thousands of people from nations trapped in conflict, clamp down on student visas − and all but cease refugee admissions.\n\nAn unconventional approach melding immigration reforms and national security policy has resulted in the most dramatic restructuring of admissions policy in a generation, with the second Trump administration taking full advantage of a rare do-over in government.\n\nPresident Trump bans travel from 12 nations, partially restricts entry from seven others\n\nTrump expands first term policies to target new countries\n\nThe Supreme Court in 2018 gave Trump permission to keep out foreign nationals whose presence the administration says would be detrimental to U.S. interests. Trump reinstituted and expanded a program last week that puts full or partial restrictions on travel to America from the citizens of 19 nations, with notable exceptions.\n\nCitizens of 12 countries were completely banned from entry beginning June 9: Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Chad, Republic of Congo (capital: Brazzaville), Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Visitors from an additional nine countries, including Cuba and Venezuela, were hit with partial immigration and travel bans.\n\nAthletes, relatives and coaches traveling for sporting events like the 2026 World Cup and the Los Angeles Summer Olympics in 2028 were exempted. So were immediate family members of some existing visa holders, Afghan nationals who were employed by the United States and ethnic and religious minorities facing persecution in Iran.\n\nTrump's administration also said Chinese students connected to China's Communist Party or studying in critical fields would no longer be welcome. And tried to stop international students from studying at Harvard.\n\nA leaked State Department cable also revealed the administration may require prospective international students at other universities to undergo social media vetting. The administration has also taken steps to deport pro-Palestinian demonstrators.\n\nTrump crackdown on legal entry draws less attention\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order that slammed America's doors to new refugees, halting admissions from Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Iraq and other war-torn countries.\n\nTrump moved to end temporary protected status for roughly 350,000 Venezuelan nationals in February and is not expected to renew TPS for an upcoming batch. His administration also declined to extend TPS for Afghans and rescinded an extension for 521,000 Haitians that had been approved by the Biden administration. Citizens of Cameroon, in West Africa, will lose the protections in June. Without an extension, Hondurans' TPS will expire in July.\n\nSupreme Court lets Trump revoke safe-haven program for Cubans, Haitians, Venezuelans and Nicaraguans\n\nThe administration also ended humanitarian parole for Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuela immigrants, making them eligible for deportation.\n\nTrump's claw-back of temporary protected status for citizens of countries experiencing conflict − a program run through the Department of Homeland Security that former President Joe Biden greatly expanded − also removes work authorizations and deportation protections.\n\nAlex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said Trump is pursuing the \"same sort of anti-legal immigration push\" he pursued in his first term, the refugee program was substantially curtailed.\n\n\"The areas that he has the clearest legal authority over are the ones that he is reducing,\" Nowrasteh said.\n\nWhile the number of refugees who come to America varies from year to year, 60,050 people were admitted in 2023, according to DHS.\n\nTrump's administration is only allowing refugees from one nation, white South Africans known as Afrikaners. He has repeatedly alleged that they are the victims of genocide.\n\nStephen Miller, the president's Homeland Security adviser, told reporters in May, as he sought to justify the policy, that the U.S. refugee program has historically been used as a solution to global poverty and it should not be.\n\n\"Wherever there's global poverty or wherever there is dysfunctional governments, then the U.S. refugee program comes in, swoops them up, relocates them to America, and you have multi-generational problems,\" Miller said. \"The U.S. refugee program has been a catastrophic failure.\"\n\nTrump administration cites national security concerns\n\nThe administration has cited broad national security concerns for many of its actions while refusing to go into detail on individual cases.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters during a May 29 briefing that seemingly disparate actions such as Trump's slashing of foreign aid, directives to universities and revisions to visas were all part of the administration's pledge to get serious about security.\n\nBruce, who was being pressed to say how many Chinese students would be affected by new visa restrictions, said, \"What the story is here is that the issue of being serious about safety for the country matters, and we’re going to look at that at every single front.\"\n\nTrump's approach \"perhaps has not been done before,\" Bruce said in the remarks, which preceded Trump's travel ban.\n\nAn analysis of State Department data by the American Immigration Council, which opposes Trump's moves, found the policy could prevent 34,000 immigrant visas and more than 125,000 nonimmigrant visas − typically for business and tourism − from being issued each year. The group's analysis of 2022 data found that 298,600 people from affected countries came to the United States.\n\nThe countries included were identified by the Trump administration as nations \"for which vetting and screening information is so deficient\" to warrant a full or partial travel ban and those whose nationals \"pose significant risks of overstaying their visas in the United States.\" Of the countries on Trump's list, Haiti had the most overstays in 2023, by far.\n\nStephanie Gee, the senior director for U.S. Legal Services at the International Refugee Assistance Project, a group that has taken Trump to court, criticized \"very arbitrary exceptions\" for people like athletes.\n\n\"I think it raises questions around that rationale that they're picking and choosing how to say and when to say somebody is a national security threat,\" she said.\n\nTrump did not explain in his order why athletes were a lesser concern.

While local police departments and sheriff’s offices can’t generally arrest people because of their immigration status, they do play a key role in enforcement.\n\nWhat local law enforcement can do to assist DHS\n\nLocal and state law enforcement plays more of a supportive role when it comes to immigration policy enforcement. Usually, local agencies assist the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which handles cross-border crime and illegal immigration.\n\n“When ICE has an operation in our county, we support them,” said Capt. Joe Abollo with the Indian River County Sheriff’s Office. “We usually get a phone call, ‘Hey, can you send out anyone you can?’ And we respond.”\n\nWhere local agencies usually come into play is by alerting federal authorities when they have a suspected noncitizen in their custody for a non-immigration related offense. For example, if someone is arrested on a drug-possession charge and the agency has reason to believe they are undocumented, the jail will alert ICE, which will come pick them up and may begin deportation proceedings.\n\nThese transfers account for 70% of ICE arrests inside the U.S., according to the Immigration Legal Resource Center.\n\n“These federal agencies, like our local FBI office, they have a certain number of agents, but they depend a lot on working with local law enforcement agencies and having those partnerships to be that force multiplier where we enhance their manpower and their ability to do investigations here locally,” St. Lucie County Sheriff Richard Del Toro told TCPalm.\n\nThat multi-agency partnership is primarily run through an ICE program called 287(g).\n\nThe ICE 287(g) program\n\nThe 287(g) program gives local law enforcement limited powers to execute immigration warrants against people in their agency’s jails. It also permits the jail to hold the inmate for up to two days passed their release date as they wait for ICE to pick them up.\n\nTo participate in the program, ICE must train and certify state and local law enforcement officers. The basic training program is four weeks and covers immigration law, civil rights training and how to use ICE databases.\n\nA 2022 law required Florida agencies that operate county jails to apply for the 287(g) program, though not every agency has been approved.\n\nICE did not approve any new 287(g) agreements with local law enforcement agencies during the Biden administration, according to the ICE database. That is expected to end during the Trump administration.\n\nThere are 49 Florida agencies that currently participate in the program, including Martin and Indian River counties. St. Lucie County has a pending application to the 287(g) program.\n\nICE has partnered with 132 agencies spanning 21 states, most of them in Florida and Texas.\n\nDeputizing local law enforcement as immigration authorities\n\nLocal law enforcement is currently able to assist federal authorities with immigration raids.\n\nOn Jan. 28, the Florida Highway Patrol already teamed up with federal immigration officers in Jefferson County to round up 12 people suspected of living in the country illegally.\n\n\"FHP is equipped and hard at work to enforce illegal immigration laws in Florida,\" the agency said on the social media platform X.\n\nThese deputized officers are usually assigned to extraditing suspects outside of their jurisdiction accused of federal crimes unrelated to immigration, Abollo said. The Fed reimburses some costs as well.\n\nHowever, it’s unclear if the immigration enforcement powers of local policing agencies may expand during the Trump administration.\n\nCongress passed a bill in 1996 allowing the federal government to delegate some immigration enforcement powers to local law enforcement agents if there is a “mass influx” of migrants. The bill was invoked for the first time on Jan. 20 under Trump.\n\nThis could allow local law enforcement to arrest suspected unauthorized immigrants, according to the American Immigration Council.\n\n\"Because this is the first time the law has been invoked, the powers it unlocks are not fully understood,\" the council stated.\n\nAt a Jan. 29 news conference in Brevard County, Gov. Ron DeSantis called for deputizing state and local law enforcement to carry out deportations rather than turning over suspects to federal agencies.\n\nWho do the crackdowns target?\n\nUnder the Biden administration, ICE was directed to focus on arresting undocumented immigrants who posed a public safety and national security threat.\n\nBut a new bill passed by Congress and signed by Trump expanded that focus. The Laken Riley Act allows for people living in the country illegally to be deported without serious criminal offenses. The law mandates detention for people accused, charged with or convicted of low-level crimes, such as shoplifting or driving without a license.\n\n“Some people think the mass deportations will just be targeting criminals. It will not,” said Tessa Petit, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition.\n\nImmigrants, especially undocumented migrants, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans, according to the National Institute of Justice. A Cambridge study also found immigrants are 60% less likely to be incarcerated than all U.S.-born men.\n\nThe Pew Research Center calculated there are over 1 million undocumented immigrants living in Florida.\n\nJack Lemnus is a TCPalm enterprise reporter.

But Stephen Miller, a deputy White House chief of staff and a top architect of Trump's immigration agenda, opposed the carveouts for certain industries, the Post reported.\n\n\"The President has been incredibly clear. There will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE’s efforts,\" Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary at DHS, said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\n\"Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safe guard public safety, national security and economic stability,\" she added. \"These operations target illegal employment networks that undermine American workers, destabilize labor markets and expose critical infrastructure to exploitation.\"\n\nA White House official confirmed the change in direction, telling USA TODAY that anyone in the United States illegally is at risk of deportation.\n\nTrump had promised changes to protect migrants in the farming, hotel and leisure industries in a June 12 Truth Social post that acknowledged ICE officers have expanded arrests beyond just migrants convicted of violent crimes, who Trump officials have said are the primary targets of raids and deportations.\n\n\"Our farmers are being hurt badly,\" Trump said in remarks later that day, echoing the concerns raised by Rollins. \"You know, they have very good workers. They've worked for them for 20 years. They're not citizens, but they've turned out to be, you know, great.\"\n\nTrump's new posture seemed to undermine his long-touted policy of mass deportations, which was a hallmark of his 2024 campaign.\n\nAbout 42% of farm workers in the United States between 2020 and 2022 lacked legal status, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAccording to the Post, an DHS official sent an email June 12 telling agents to “hold on all worksite enforcement investigations/operations on agriculture (including aquaculture and meat packing plants), restaurants and operating hotels.”\n\nBut over the weekend, ICE and the agency's Homeland Security Investigations division started learning that the new policy would be reversed. ICE officials confirmed in a June 16 call to agency leaders that they must continue immigration raids at farms, hotels and restaurants.\n\nDemocratic critics of Trump's hardline immigration agenda mocked Trump's shifting positions. \"Looks like Stephen Miller is the boss, after all. Trump got big footed by his own staff. Pathetic,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a post on X.\n\nThree days after Trump announced the short-lived carveouts for certain migrants, Trump on June 15 directed ICE officials to ramp up efforts to detain and deport migrants from large Democratic-run cities. It marked an escalation of his crackdown on illegal immigration despite millions of demonstrators rallying against the policy during recent \"No Kings\" protests across the country.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump challenged ICE officers to \"do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History.\" He called on them to increase their activities in cities led by Democrats, singling out Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York.\n\nA Trump administration budget document published last week said ICE aimed to deport 1 million immigrants per year, according to Reuters.\n\nICE arrested more than 100,000 people suspected of violating immigration law from January 20 to the first week of June, according to the White House. The figure amounts to an average of 750 arrests per day ‒ double the average over the past decade.\n\nStill, the pace of arrests remains far short of what Trump would need to deport millions of people. In late May, Miller set a quota for at least 3,000 arrests per day and told ICE leadership they should target anyone without legal status.\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/10/25/trump-crime-immigration-crackdown-cities-troops/86815712007/", "title": "What Trump's federal crackdown looks like in 5 US cities", "text": "Oct. 25, 2025 Updated Oct. 28, 2025, 9:26 a.m. ET\n\nIn Chicago, federal agents rappelled from Black Hawk helicopters onto an apartment building. In Portland, Oregon, masked officers clashed with protesters wearing inflatable animal costumes. In the nation's capital, police set up checkpoints and troops patrolled the streets.\n\nSince early June, President Donald Trump has surged federal resources into a growing number of Democratic-led cities as part of a widening crackdown on illegal immigration and violent crime.\n\nThe deployments have sparked intense backlash, a dizzying number of legal battles and upended daily life in communities flooded with federal agents and National Guard troops.\n\nThe Trump administration says the added resources are needed to service the president’s mass deportation campaign and clamp down on violence in liberal cities. Critics, including state and local officials, say the deployments are an illegal show of force and a power grab.\n\nAcross the country, federal operations have taken different forms, shaped by levels of cooperation between federal and local officials, protests over heightened immigration enforcement and the scale of the operations themselves.\n\nIn several cities, immigration raids touched off a wave of demonstrations, prompting Trump to call up National Guard troops. In others, federal agents worked closely with local police to target crime more broadly, setting up roving patrols and checkpoints. One major commonality: The cities all experienced a surge in immigration enforcement.\n\nReporters across the USA TODAY Network spoke with experts, residents, officials and local advocates to capture the impact of federal intervention in U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Memphis, Portland and Chicago – a short list that seems likely to grow as the president eyes deployments to other cities.\n\nMany residents and local officials said the cities didn't need intervention, especially a deployment of troops. Some living in crime-stricken areas said while they generally support the idea of more law enforcement in their communities, they want the operations to target violent crimes – not immigration violations.\n\nExperts, meanwhile, said targeted police work is the most effective way to lower crime and worry that the federal government's flood-the-zone tactics, both in immigration enforcement and general crimefighting, could erode public trust in police.\n\n“Aggressive enforcement needs to be reserved for the most aggressive criminals,” said Thomas Abt, director of the Center for the Study and Practice of Violence Reduction. He added that broad, heavy-handed policing has “limited benefits and a lot of collateral consequences.”\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson hailed the president's efforts and said local leaders across the country should take inspiration and \"clean up their city.\"\n\n\"Making America Safe Again – especially crime-ridden cities – was a key campaign promise from the President that the American people elected him to fulfill,\" Jackson said in a statement.\n\nChicago: Intensifying ICE raids and widespread protests\n\nThe nation’s third-largest city has become the latest flashpoint in the battle between local officials and the Trump administration over the president's deportation campaign and federal deployments.\n\nIn September, Trump launched Operation Midway Blitz, an initiative he said was needed to catch \"the worst of the worst\" criminal immigrants. Research has shown that, on average, immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans. Further, immigration violations, such as living in the country without proper documentation, are civil, not criminal, under U.S. law.\n\nExpanding Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids triggered protests in downtown Chicago and the city's surrounding suburbs. As tensions boiled, clashes broke out and federal agents used pepper balls and tear gas, hitting journalists, a pastor and officers with the Chicago Police Department, according to reports and a lawsuit.\n\nThe president called for the arrests of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson for “failing to protect” ICE agents.\n\nResidents and local advocates have accused ICE of employing reckless and brutal tactics during the blitz. Some incidents that have raised alarm: Immigration agents fatally shot a Mexican immigrant accused of resisting arrest; a Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a U.S. citizen on the city’s South Side; and, reportedly, a school had to hold recess indoors after federal authorities deployed a chemical agent nearby.\n\nThe most controversial raid came on Sept. 30, when federal agents descended from Black Hawk helicopters and ransacked a South Side apartment building in an aggressive search of apartments inhabited by Venezuelan migrants.\n\nTwo of 37 people arrested were “confirmed” gang members, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Dozens of U.S. citizens were pulled from their beds and temporarily zip-tied during the operation, which Pritzker wants investigated by state agencies.\n\nDHS officials say aggressive tactics are necessary to catch criminals, and accused protesters of attacking agents and \"rioting.\" Over 1,500 immigrants have been arrested in connection with the blitz, the agency said. USA TODAY has not been able to verify the number of detentions or the criminal background of those in custody.\n\nChicagoans said the federal intervention has made their neighborhoods virtually unrecognizable.\n\n\"We went from being this community that walks our kids to school or goes out to parks. Now the streets are empty,\" said Corina Pedraza, a longtime South Sider.\n\nLocal alderwoman Julia Ramirez told USA TODAY that people \"can't live their lives the way they did before.\"\n\n\"Agents have created a war zone in our community,\" she said.\n\nPortland, Oregon: Tensions flare at ICE facility\n\n“War ravaged,” “burning to the ground” and “hell” are words Trump has used to describe the liberal stronghold of Portland in recent weeks – characterizations vehemently disputed by local residents and officials.\n\nThe back-and-forth comes as the president seeks to deploy troops to the city over the objections of local and state officials. A federal judge in Oregon initially blocked the deployments, but an appeals court on Oct. 20 ruled in Trump’s favor, lifting one of the orders preventing the president from calling up 200 Oregon guardsmen to Portland.\n\nTrump officials say soldiers are necessary to protect federal personnel and an ICE facility in South Portland, where demonstrators have protested on a nightly basis.\n\nOutside the facility earlier this month, USA TODAY reporters saw demonstrators peacefully protesting. There were people in puffy animal costumes dancing on the sidewalk and waving signs as motorists drove by, honking in support. Other forms of resistance have had a distinctly Portland vibe, such as an “emergency” naked bike ride in mid-October.\n\nCity residents said Trump’s characterization of Portland as a city “under siege” is false and misleading.\n\n“It offends me so deeply that we have a president that is willing and able to spread such misinformation without hitting the streets and coming out here,” said Tiana Stewart, 37, a bartender. “But he knows that the people who are watching are going to buy into it. It’s ludicrous to me.”\n\nPortland is not without its problems. Homeless camps are visible in parts of the city and drug use, especially the surge of fentanyl, is a serious concern that prompted officials to declare a 90-day state of emergency last year. But residents said they don’t think the president’s crackdown is meant to address those issues.\n\n“Obviously, this is all a scam,” said Curtis Best, 70, a retired molecular biologist. “I really believe it’s a way to militarize police and make problems in these cities … I think he just wants revenge on us. I think he just doesn't like Democrat cities, Democrat states, or its people.”\n\nMemphis: A crime-stricken city flooded with feds. Is it helping?\n\nUnlike other cities where Trump deployed National Guard troops, Memphis sits in a state led by a Republican governor who has welcomed the president’s wishes to mobilize military forces.\n\nIn September, Trump created a crime-fighting task force involving over a dozen federal agencies and the state's National Guard – a move he said was requested by Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee.\n\nA week after troops were seen patrolling downtown Memphis on Oct. 10, a group of Democratic officials filed a lawsuit against Lee, claiming the deployment violated the state constitution. A judge has since denied the plaintiffs’ request to pause the deployment.\n\nIn 2024, Memphis had the highest rate of murder and other violent crimes of any large American city, according to a USA TODAY analysis of FBI data from 30 cities with more than 500,000 residents.\n\nMemphis Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, said he's working to steer the task force to focus on violent offenders, rather than immigration enforcement.\n\n\"The busier we can keep them with (the Memphis Police Department), the less time they will have to focus on immigration,\" he said at a town hall on Oct. 20.\n\nOfficials have given conflicting portrayals of the task force's work so far.\n\nThe White House says the task force has yielded 1,300 arrests related to outstanding warrants, drugs and firearms. But a county mayor and local advocates say a large portion of the arrests were for immigration offenses, not violent crime.\n\nMauricio Calvo, president and CEO of advocacy organization Latino Memphis, said some people have shut themselves in their homes because of the heightened immigration enforcement and concerns over racial profiling.\n\n“People don’t want to send the kids to school, people don’t want to work,” he said. “We’re in crisis mode.\"\n\nWashington, DC: Mixed feelings on Trump's crime crackdown\n\nTrump declared a “crime emergency” in the nation’s capital on Aug. 11, using its status as a federal district to take control of the city’s police department and send in thousands of federal agents and National Guard troops.\n\nFor weeks, federal agents and local police set up checkpoints across the city, spurring protests. Immigration raids expanded, instilling fear as officers arrested workers and delivery drivers. Several of the city’s small homeless campsites were broken down, leading some of the homeless to enter shelters temporarily.\n\nMeanwhile, National Guard troops patrolled monuments and Metro stations, some with assault rifles. They removed graffiti, picked up trash and shoveled mulch. An internal budget viewed by USA TODAY estimated the guard deployment could cost taxpayers more than $200 million.\n\nAfter 30 days, the federal takeover of the police department ended and Trump declared the operation a success, touting a drop in reported crimes and anecdotes of people “going out to dinner where they didn’t go out for years.”\n\nThe data, though, was murky. While local police data shows a short-term dip in some reported crimes after the crackdown began – especially incidents involving firearms – crime had already been trending downward in recent years. Experts who viewed the data said it’s too soon to know if the crackdown had any significant or long-term impact on violent crime.\n\nAcross the city, residents were conflicted about the federal operation.\n\nFor 20 years, Charles Wilson has lived in Anacostia, a neighborhood with one of the highest rates of murder and violent crime in Washington. He said while he has not seen a surge of federal agents in his neighborhood, he’s noticed fewer people loitering and he doesn’t hear as many “random gunshots.”\n\n“There’s definitely been a shift, and things feel a little calmer and a little safer,” he told USA TODAY.\n\nBut Wilson also said the assertive immigration enforcement in Washington, some of which has gone viral online, \"doesn't sit well\" with him or his neighbors.\n\n\"It seems un-American and mean-spirited,\" he said.\n\nLos Angeles: Raids, protests, state of emergency\n\nLos Angeles has remained one of the central targets of Trump’s sweeping illegal immigration campaign and was the first American city where he deployed National Guard troops in his second term in office.\n\nFollowing ICE raids at a Home Depot and a clothing manufacturer in June, thousands of people took to the streets to protest. While demonstrations were contained to a few downtown blocks, they erupted into violence, with clashes breaking out between protesters and police, and reports of looting and property damage.\n\nTrump ordered 4,000 California National Guard troops and at least 500 Marines to protect federal personnel and property in the city. The move was challenged in court, and a California judge said the deployment was illegal but did not order the remaining soldiers to leave. Gov. Gavin Newsom said in September that the deployment had already cost taxpayers nearly $120 million.\n\nICE agents kept up their high pace of arrests, and in October, the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors declared a state of emergency. Local officials said the federal agency \"created a climate of fear, leading to widespread disruption in daily life and adverse impacts to our regional economy.\"\n\nOngoing immigration raids and operations across Los Angeles County – which is home to over 3 million people born outside the United States – have led to a decline in workplace attendance and strained critical services such as schools, hospitals, and places of worship, according to the board of supervisors.\n\nLupe Lopez, 69, whose family owns nine Arteagas Food Center supermarkets, told USA TODAY she’s seen a big drop in foot traffic at her family’s shop in the Hispanic neighborhood of East San Jose. The reason: Young people are buying in bulk because their parents are afraid of being outside, where they might be picked up by immigration agents.\n\n\"A lot more people are either staying closer to home or not coming out at all,” she said.\n\nChristopher Cann, Michael Loria, Suzette Hackney and Terry Collins report for USA TODAY.

This will go further. We're starting very strongly with D.C., and we're going to clean it up real quick,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump did not elaborate on his plans for other cities. But one of the two executive actions he signed Aug. 11 directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to coordinate with governors of states and \"authorize the orders of any additional members of the National Guard to active service, as he deems necessary and appropriate, to augment this mission.\"\n\n\"We're going to take back our capital,\" Trump said. \"And then we'll look at other cities also. But other cities are studying what we're doing.\"\n\nTrump warns cities to 'learn their lesson'\n\nEach of the cities that Trump mentioned are led by Democratic mayors in states with Democratic governors, who could be less likely to request the Trump administration's intervention than Republican governors who are political allies of the president.\n\n\"Other cities are hopefully watching this.... And maybe they’ll self-clean up,\" Trump said, adding they could be targeted if \"they don't learn their lesson\" and study his administration's moves in Washington. He said he plans to look at New York City next \"and if we need to, we're going to do the same thing in Chicago.\"\n\nIn a separate executive order, Trump invoked authority under Section 740 of the Home Rule Act to take control of Washington’s police department. The move, authorized by federal law as part of the District of Columbia's unique status as a federal enclave, is not an option for Trump elsewhere.\n\nSecretary of Army Daniel Driscoll is set to lead the National Guard’s operation in Washington.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon is also prepared to bring in additional National Guard units and other specialized units if needed. \"They will be strong. They will be tough. And they will stand with their law enforcement partners,\" Hegseth said.\n\n\"This is nothing new for DOD,\" he added, pointing to Trump’s deployment of military troops at the United States-Mexico border to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nTrump's authority to direct National Guard troops was challenged earlier this year after he tapped the California National Guard to quell protests over widespread deportations from increased immigration enforcement in the Los Angeles area. After Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged Trump's control over the troops, a judge ruled in favor of Trump.\n\nTrump reeled off a list of recent violent crimes in Washington, D.C. to justify his actions. Yet, volent crimes so far in 2025 are down 26% compared to last year, and homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department. Similarly, homicides in New York City are down in 2025 compared to the same time last year.\n\nMayors push back at Trump's threat\n\nAn FBI report released Aug. 5 found violent crime in 2024 dropped by 4.5% in the United States compared to 2023, with murder and non-negligent manslaughter decreasing by nearly 15%.\n\nThe U.S. Conference of Mayors, which represents about 1,400 mayors, responded to Trump's actions and threats by touting a \"nationwide success story\" of plummeting crime rates.\n\n\"Ultimately, the best public safety outcomes are delivered by local police departments and local officials, who know the communities,\" Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt, president of the mayors' conference, said in a statement. \"America’s mayors never see takeovers by other levels of government as a tactic that has any track record of producing results.\"\n\nBaltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, in response to Trump singling out his city, said \"Baltimore is the safest it's been in over 50 years,\" adding that homicides are down about 28% in 2025.\n\n\"We still have real work to do to build on this progress,\" Scott said in a statement, \"but that work starts and ends here in Baltimore, with the local, state, and federal partners who have gotten us this far.\"\n\nContributing: Cybele Mayes-Osterman of USA TODAY\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/immigration/2025/07/30/fema-offering-states-millions-to-build-immigration-detention-facilities/85411157007/", "title": "FEMA offering states millions to build immigration detention facilities", "text": "Updated July 30, 2025, 1:29 p.m. ET\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency is making $608 million available for states to build immigration detention facilities.\n\nThe grants are funded by the Biden era Shelter and Services Program, which was put in place to ease the burden of serving massive amount of migrants arriving at the southern border.\n\nThe Trump administration blocked reimbursement of the SSP funds to cities, counties and charities demanding that they turn over the names of migrants. The program ended in April 2025.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency is preparing to provide states with $608 million in grants to expand immigration detention facilities across the country.\n\nFEMA has begun a “detention support grant program” to assist states with funding the construction of detention facilities that can be utilized by the federal government to detain immigrants arrested under President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. States have up through Aug. 8 to apply for the program.\n\nThe story was first reported by Reuters, which stated that the new FEMA grant will use funding from the Shelter and Services program, which was launched in December 2022 amidst the mass arrival of immigrants at the southern border.\n\nThe FEMA program had $800 million in available funding.

Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has stated that the everglade detention center is a model for others constructed by state governments, a press officer for FEMA said.\n\nThe shifting of funding shelters to funding detention is part of the Trump administration's efforts to rollback all the programs that were meant to assist migrants arriving at the border.\n\n\"Using SSP funding for immigration detention is illegal and something the administration clearly understands given how it repeatedly refers to holding immigrants in detention as ‘sheltering aliens’ throughout its public listing for this new program,\" Jorge Loweree, the Director of Policy at the American Immigration Council, said. \"Reallocating SSP funding isn’t so much about expanding detention as it is about the administration’s obsession with continuing to do everything possible to either end or undermine all prior efforts to make our system fair, functional, or just.\"\n\nRolling back Shelter and Services Program\n\nEl Paso County, the city and local charities benefited from the FEMA program, guaranteeing that migrants were not left on the streets after being released by Border Patrol. The funds allowed the city to buy the Morehead elementary school and allowed the county to open and operate the Migrant Support Services Center.\n\nThe county's service center closed on Dec. 31, 2024 amidst uncertainty over the future of the SSP funding.\n\nFEMA began blocking the reimbursement of funds to charities and local governments in March, including in El Paso, stating that the use of the funds to support migrants likely broke the law. The funds were frozen until recipients shared the names and addresses of the people who were served with the funding.\n\nThe Trump administration officially canceled the contacts in early April.\n\nThe number of migrants currently arriving at the southern border are at the lowest levels in decades.\n\nJeff Abbott covers the border for the El Paso Times and can be reached at:jdabbott@gannett.com;@palabrasdeabajo on Twitter or @palabrasdeabajo.bsky.social on Bluesky.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/07/23/immigration-arrests-in-washington-double-in-june-from-previous-high/85339689007/", "title": "Immigration arrests in Washington state increased in June ...", "text": "Jake Goldstein-Street\n\nWashington State Standard\n\nJuly 23, 2025, 1:41 p.m. ET\n\nFederal immigration arrests across Washington rose sharply in June as the Trump administration continues its aggressive nationwide push for deportations, according to new data.\n\nArrests in June, more than 275, were at least double any month since President Donald Trump reclaimed the presidency in January. At the same time, the share of arrestees in Washington with criminal records dropped sharply, to less than one-third.\n\nThe figures come from the Deportation Data Project out of the University of California, Berkeley, where researchers received the information via Freedom of Information Act requests. The data runs through June 26.\n\n“I think that every community member in our country who is watching the news and comes from an immigrant family is increasingly concerned about their safety here,” said Caedmon Magboo Cahill, director of policy advocacy at the American Civil Liberties Union’s Washington chapter.\n\nThe data provides the most complete look yet at the numbers underpinning the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n\nAssistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin defended the administration’s approach. “We are continuing to go after the worst of the worst — including gang members, pedophiles, and rapists,” she said in a statement.\n\n“We are delivering on President Trump’s and the American people’s mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and make America safe,” McLaughlin added.\n\nThe dramatic rise in arrests last month in Washington, which mirrors national trends, came as top federal officials upped arrest quotas.\n\nCongress this month added $170 billion to carry out Trump’s immigration agenda, an extraordinary funding injection sure to expand deportation efforts.\n\nThe legislation makes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement the largest federal law enforcement agency.\n\n“We’re bracing for even more ICE activity throughout the country and in our state,” Cahill said.\n\nThe rise in local arrests coincides with a surge in flights of migrants detained elsewhere and brought to Washington for detention. This has strained capacity at the state’s only federal immigration detention facility, the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma.\n\nThe Berkeley researchers’ data isn’t comprehensive. For one, it only includes ICE administrative arrests, excluding Customs and Border Protection. And, in some cases, no state is listed for individual arrest records. So the arrest figures for Washington are likely an undercount.\n\nHere are a few other takeaways from the statistics.\n\nArrests increasing in Washington during 2025\n\nIn the first five months of Trump’s presidency, ICE arrests jumped 35% in Washington.\n\nFrom Inauguration Day to June 26, the feds arrested 782 people, according to the Deportation Data Project. That’s up from 581 in the same period last year.\n\nSo far this year, ICE is averaging five arrests per day in Washington, an 85% leap from all of 2024.\n\nCatalina Velasquez, the executive director of the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network, said this increase in arrests since Trump retook office “represents an immeasurable amount of pain on Washington communities.”\n\nStill, Washington’s increase pales in comparison to much of the rest of the nation, as many states have seen arrests double or triple, according to a New York Times analysis. Arrests in Idaho, for example, have skyrocketed around 10-fold.\n\n“As immigration enforcement agents are ruthlessly targeting, surveilling, and detaining community members, this comparatively lower increase in ICE arrests demonstrates the necessity and importance of a proactive, community-centered deportation defense infrastructure ready to mobilize and protect our communities,” said Velasquez, citing her organization’s rapid response teams.\n\nThe ACLU’s Washington chapter has seen a nearly five-times jump in immigration-related calls since last year, Cahill said.\n\nExamples of calls include people concerned about Medicaid data sharing with immigration enforcement and someone who couldn’t get a loan because of the perception they’re from a Latin American country and wouldn’t be able to repay the money if ICE arrests them.\n\nHigher percentage with criminal record or pending charges\n\nSince starting his first campaign for president, Trump has especially focused his rhetoric on immigrants with criminal records.\n\nIn the first five months of his second term, 41% of those arrested in Washington have had criminal records, according to the Deportation Data Project’s statistics. Another 16% have pending criminal charges.\n\nThat’s up from 36% and 4% respectively in the same span last year when former President Joe Biden was in office.\n\nBut of those arrested this June, only 31% had criminal records, as immigration agents tried to reach hefty quotas.\n\nMcLaughlin claimed 70% of ICE arrests nationwide have been of “criminal illegal aliens” and accused the Deportation Data Project of cherry-picking data “to peddle a false narrative.”\n\n“Many of the individuals that are counted as ‘non-criminals’ are actually terrorists, human rights abusers, gangsters and more; they just don’t have a rap sheet in the U.S.,” she said. “Further, every single one of these individuals committed a crime when they came into this country illegally. It is not an accurate description to say they are ‘non-criminals.’”\n\nLiving in the United States illegally is a civil violation, not criminal.\n\nLiliana Chumpitasi, deputy director at the advocacy organization La Resistencia, said in an email that this tough-on-crime approach “is used as an excuse to destroy our communities.”\n\nDemographic shift\n\nThe Trump administration, in Washington and elsewhere, has focused its enforcement efforts on immigrants from Latin American countries.\n\nThe top six countries from which migrants emigrated are in Latin America. Migrants from Mexico have made up nearly half of the arrests in Washington since Trump took office. Mexico is followed by Venezuelan immigrants, who have been a specific target of the federal government amid claims migrants have ties to the Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nThe countries that follow are Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia and Nicaragua. Migrants from India rank seventh.\n\nDuring the same period last year, Indian immigrants were second most likely to be arrested.\n\nTrump’s border czar, Tom Homan, has suggested federal agents can question people “based on their physical appearance.”\n\nChumpitasi said, “They can’t be more clear about racial profiling than that.”\n\nThe Trump administration has also seemed to focus more on arresting men, as they make up seven in every eight arrestees since Inauguration Day. That’s up from less than 75% in this span last year.\n\nWhat is expedited removal?\n\nUnder Trump, ICE has also moved to more quickly deport immigrants through a process called expedited removal.\n\nThis process allows immigration officials to deport immigrants without legal status without a hearing before a judge. Trump expanded expedited removal in his first term, before Biden dialed it back.\n\nFrom Jan. 20 to June 26 this year, 13% of arrested immigrants were labeled as expedited removals, according to the data. That’s up from 3% in the same period last year under Biden.\n\nThe Trump administration came under fire in Seattle and elsewhere in May as it moved to dismiss many immigration cases in court so they could immediately detain those migrants and immediately place them into expedited removal proceedings.\n\nAdvocacy groups sued last week over due process concerns associated with this new practice.\n\nThe story was initially published by Washington State Standard, a nonprofit news organization and part of the States Newsroom network.

Trump sends troops to border", "text": "Updated Jan. 22, 2025, 10:47 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Donald Trump's major changes to the immigration system and along the southern border have continued into the third day of his administration.\n\nThe border continues to remain open despite what President Trump has claimed.\n\nHowever, the border has been closed to migrants seeking asylum through ports of entry as the new administration seeks to re-implement the Migrant Protection Protocols, commonly known as the \"Remain in Mexico\" program. The measure was first implemented during the first Trump administration and required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico as their cases advanced.\n\nHere is an update from the El Paso border region:\n\nTrump sends military troops to border\n\nActing Secretary of Defense Robert Salesses announced Wednesday that the U.S. Department of Defense will deploying 1500 active duty troops to the southern border as part of President Trump's state of emergency.\n\nMilitary troops are part of President Trump's crackdown on immigration and border security. This is part of his plans to declare gangs, such as Central America's MS-13, and drug cartels as terrorists organizations, and invoke the 1798 \"Aliens Enemies act\" to target and remove gang members.\n\nThe announcement also states that the department will be include four military cargo planes to deport 5000 migrants currently in Customs and Border Protection custody. The deportation flights are set to leave from San Diego, California and El Paso, Texas.\n\nMexico begins to construct structures to receive deported Mexican Nationals\n\nMexico has started to construct temporary faculties in cities across the country's northern border with the United States in preparation to receive Mexican nationals who are deported as part of President Trump's mass deportation campaign.\n\n\"The reception centers on the border are being installed,\" Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told the press on Wednesday as she started her morning press conference.\n\nThe reception center in Juárez began on Tuesday. The facility is near the Paso del Norte border crossing.\n\nShe has directed members of her cabinet to supervise the construction of the centers.\n\nPresident Sheinbaum also announced that she had spoken with Acting Homeland Security Secretary Benjamine Huffman on Tuesday and with in-coming Secretary of State Marco Rubio in what she called \"a very cordial\" call.\n\nDeportations at the southern border\n\nMexico received 50 Mexican migrants deported from the United States in Juárez on Tuesday, Jan. 21.\n\nThey are the first to enter the \"Mexico embraces you\" program, which was formed by President Claudia Sheinbaum's administration to address the needs of migrants returned to Mexico. At least three federal shelters are in Juárez, and a temporary structure is currently under construction.\n\nBut deportations of Mexican nationals at the border are common.\n\nThere were 190,491 Mexicans returned between January and November 2024, according to data from the Mexican government. In that same period, 12,388 Mexicans were returned to Juárez.\n\nThe United States has agreements to carry out deportations to other countries to around the globe. These flights are carried out via removal flights chartered by the Immigration and Custom Enforcement agency, commonly referred to as ICE Air.\n\nBiden's final year saw a historic 271,484 noncitizens deported in the 12 months of fiscal year 2024, which began in October of the previous year. In the same period there were 1564 removal flights, according to data compiled by Witness at the Border.\n\nThe first few days of the Trump administration have seen a sharp decrease than the averages during the Biden administration, according groups that track deportation flights.\n\n\"Deportation flights have actually been in the low range of typical,\" Tom Cartwright, who tracks deportation flights with Witness at the Border, said. \"We will see what the next week brings.\"\n\nDC Bishop calls for compassion\n\nA Washington, D.C. bishop called for mercy on those who may be feeling anxious about the rapid policy changes.\n\nRev. Mariann Edgar Budde urged President Trump during an interfaith service in Washington, D.C. to have mercy on the people who may be feeling anxious.\n\nTrump seethed on Wednesday at the bishop's words. He called her a \"Radical Left hard line Trump hater\" who \"brought her church into the World of politics in a very ungracious way\" in a post on his Truth Social account.\n\nAnxieties have increased in immigrant and minority communities following Trump's flurry of executive orders, which largely target immigrants and members of the LGBTQ communities.\n\nThe El Paso Diocese raised concern Tuesday over several of the new administration's orders and actions that affect the Borderland, including the announcement of reactivating the MPP and the State Department's removal of policy that respected \"sensitive locations,\" such as schools, churches, and hospitals.\n\n\"The end of the Department of Homeland Security’s sensitive locations policy strikes fear into the heart of ourcommunity, cynically layering a blanket of anxiety on families when they are worshiping God, seeking healthcareand dropping off and picking up children at school,\" El Paso Bishop Mark Seitz said in a press statement Tuesday. \"Whatever your faith and wherever you come from, we make your anxieties and fears at this moment our own.\"\n\nBorder communities respond to Trump's reversal on sensitive locations\n\nLocal governments and States along the southern border with Mexico are responding to the Trump administration's reversal on \"sensitive locations.\"\n\nThe New Mexico Department of Justice issued new guidance to protect spaces like schools, churches, and hospitals to ensure the continued accessibility of these spaces for families with irregular immigration status. The measures seek to uphold Fourth Amendment rights, work with communities to ensure safety, and collaborate with local community leaders.\n\n“I support enhanced border security and targeted enforcement operations focused on cartel members, violent criminals and anyone who represents a national security risk to our nation,” New Mexico's Attorney General Raúl Torrez said in a press release Wednesday. “But rounding up children, crime victims and sick people is beneath the dignity of a great nation.”\n\nThe attorney general's office also condemned Trump's threat of federal prosecution of state and local officials who do not participate in the administration's immigration enforcement policies, calling the move \"illegal.\"\n\nThe city of El Paso is seeking to ease anxieties over the possibility of immigration raids carried out by the Trump administration. El Paso Mayor Renard Johnson, who took office on Jan. 6, promised residents that local authorities would not participate in immigration raids.\n\n\"I want everyone to know in El Paso that you are in a safe community,\" Johnson said in a press conference Wednesday. \"I want you to go about your day to day routines.\"\n\nJeff Abbott covers the border for The El Paso Times and can be reached at:jdabbott@gannett.com;@palabrasdeabajo on Twitter or@palabrasdeabajo.bsky.social on Bluesky.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/12/trump-immigration-migrant-farmers-hotel-workers-deported/84166061007/", "title": "Trump vows changes to immigration crackdown to protect migrant ...", "text": "June 12, 2025 Updated June 13, 2025, 12:12 p.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said he plans to make changes to his administration's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration to protect migrant farmers, hotel workers and others in the leisure industry who have been among those deported.\n\nTrump promised the changes in a June 12 Truth Social post that acknowledged Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have expanded arrests beyond just migrants convicted of violent crimes, who Trump officials have said are the primary targets of raids and deportations.\n\n\"Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\" Trump wrote on the social media platform he owns.\n\nHe added that in many cases \"Criminals allowed into our Country by the VERY Stupid Biden Open Borders Policy\" are applying for these jobs.\n\n\"This is not good. We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!\" Trump said.\n\nThe president did not specify what changes could be in store to address worker shortages caused by his immigration crackdown. Critics of Trump's mass-deportation agenda have long said migrants ‒ who tend to provide cheap labor by working for low wages ‒ are an essential part of the country's agriculture workforce.\n\nAbout 42% of farm workers in the United States between 2020 and 2022 lacked legal status, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\"Our farmers are being hurt badly,\" Trump said during an event in the White House East Room when asked about his position. \"You know, they have very good workers. They've worked for them for 20 years. They're not citizens, but they've turned out to be, you know, great.\"\n\nTrump said he plans to sign an executive order to address the situation, adding that it will take a \"common sense\" approach. \"We can't take farmers, take all their people and send them back because they don't have maybe what they're supposed to have, maybe not,\" Trump said.\n\nThe White House has defended deportations of non-violent migrants who are in the United States unlawfully, arguing their presence in the country is grounds for being deported.\n\nDemocrats seized on Trump's new posture. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Washington, in a post on X, wrote: \"Step 1: Trump creates a problem Step 2: Blames it on Joe Biden, who isn’t even president Step 3: Posts a rant about his solution — which doesn’t actually offer a solution.\"\n\nJayapal added: \"Yes, our country and economy rely on immigrants. How is he just figuring that out?\"\n\nThe Trump family's company, the Trump Organization, has a history of relying on labor from undocumented immigrants to staff Trump-owned hotels, the Washington Post reported in 2019, citing accounts from 48 former and current Trump workers. The migrants included hotel housekeepers, groundskeepers, waiters and stonemasons.\n\nIn recent weeks, ICE has dramatically expanded its deportation efforts after the White House demanded the agency increase its arrests of migrants in the country illegally, Reuters reported. Daily quotas have increased from 1,000 arrests per day to 3,000.\n\nThe shift has produced chaotic scenes across the country. Immigration authorities, wearing bulletproof vests and other tactical gear, recently raided a popular San Diego Italian restaurant.\n\nABC News published a video on June 11 showing ICE agents chasing down a farmer worker in a field in Ventura County, California, outside of Los Angeles, where Trump this week deployed National Guard troops to counter protests opposing the deportations.\n\nStories of identity across the country: Sign up for USA TODAY's This is America newsletter.\n\nTrump's border czar, Tom Homan, said in late May that the administration had deported around 200,000 people over four months ‒ a total that lags behind the deportations during a similar period under former President Joe Biden. The White House has said the discrepancy is the result of fewer migrants coming to the border.\n\nMigrants seeking to cross the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped significantly during Trump's first five months of his second term. Border Patrol agents have seen their monthly encounters of migrant and asylum seeks drop to fewer than 10,000, down from more than 100,000 one year ago.\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/12"}]}

You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms.\n\nCNN —\n\nThis is exceptionally hot and humid for any time of year.\n\nPeriod.\n\n“We don’t change our criteria based on the time of year,” Matt Beitscher, a National Weather Service meteorologist in St. Louis, told CNN weather.\n\nA heat dome which began last week in the Southwest has shifted over the central US, where heat and humidity will climb together to levels which will significantly impact the human body.\n\n“This is a day where not only folks who are susceptible to heat-related illnesses, but really just about anybody that’s going to be outside for an extended period of time is at risk for heat-related illnesses,” Beitscher said.\n\nMore than 125 million people are under heat alerts, which include excessive heat warnings and heat advisories, across much of the central and eastern states Monday evening. This is over one-third of the US population. Cities under excessive heat warnings include Tulsa, Memphis, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Cincinnati, Raleigh and Charlotte.\n\nAbove average temperatures sit under a heat dome across the US. CNN weather\n\n“Record breaking heat is forecast to spread from the Great Plains today then into the Mississippi Valley and Southeast through midweek thanks to the expansion of an upper-level ridge,” the Weather Prediction Center said Monday afternoon.\n\nDaily high temperature records are already being set across several cities Monday afternoon, here are a few:\n\nColumbia, South Carolina, reached an afternoon high of 103°, breaking their old June 13 record of 102° set in 1958\n\nNorth Platte, Nebraska, hit 108°, breaking their old record of 103° set in 1952\n\nSt. Louis, Missouri, hit 100°, breaking their old record of 98° set in 1952\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina, hit 98°, breaking their old record of 97° set in 1958\n\nNashville, Tennessee, hit 97°, tying the previous record of 97° set in 2016\n\nJackson, Kentucky, hit 94°; the previous record was 91° in 2000\n\nAsheville, North Carolina, hit 92°; the previous record was 91° in 2016\n\nThe sweltering conditions will feel worst right in the middle of the country, putting the cities of Memphis and St. Louis under the highest risk category, “excessive heat warnings.”\n\n“To have an excessive heat warning this early in the year is kind of unusual,” Mike Johnson, a meteorologist with the Memphis NWS pointed out. “We issue excessive heat warnings maybe once or twice a year. It’s pretty rare because it requires a heat index of 110 degrees.”\n\nThe heat index is a chart combining humidity and heat to signify what the air actually feels like to a human.\n\nTake it from this southern meteorologist, when it’s this humid, you constantly look like you just ran a marathon just by walking outside.\n\nIt’s because the air already has too much moisture, and it will keep your sweat from evaporating.\n\nEvaporation is the process which cools your body. So, your body won’t cool when it is humid because there is nowhere for the sweat to go. It makes it feel much hotter than it is.\n\nThe reason behind the extremely high temperatures is an area of high pressure creating a clear lid over the US. The lid will trap any escaping radiation and send it back to the ground while the sun’s rays continue to penetrate through.\n\nThe dire heatwave is even more dangerous because it is happening in June, near the longest days of the year. The National Weather Service measures temperature in the shade and the heat index is calculated using the reading from the shade. So, it will feel even hotter in the direct sun.\n\nIt’s going to feel “much, much worse in the sun than it is in the shade,” Beitscher noted. “These values are sort of your baseline, and then they get worse from there if you’re talking about the impact that the sun has.”\n\nTo add insult to injury, don’t expect it to be hot one day and cool the next.\n\n“This is going to be a long-term event, and it’s not just going to last yesterday and today; it’s going to continue all week,” Johnson said.\n\nThe sultry weather will continue to shift farther northeast into the upper Mississippi Valley, western Great Lakes, and Ohio Valley, while continuing to build over the southern Mid-Atlantic and Southeast on Tuesday, the WPC forecast.\n\n“Little change is expected on Wednesday, with many locations forecast to see back-to-back record-setting days,” the WPC wrote.\n\nChicago may even see temperatures climb to near triple digits, allowing the heat index to exceed 100 degrees easily there this week.\n\nIt is depressing to think about\n\nI hate to be the bearer of even more sweltering news, but heatwaves are something we are going to have to get used to.\n\n“Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of heat waves around the world, tilting the scale in the direction of warmer temperatures,” CNN meteorologist and climate expert Brandon Miller explained.\n\n“In the United States, record high temperatures are now well more than twice as likely to occur compared to record low temperatures,” according to the US National Climate Assessment.\n\n“And while much of the country is baking in peak summerlike heat before the summer solstice has even come, major heat waves are simultaneously occurring in Europe and Asia as well,” Miller observed.\n\nIn Europe, heat is being pumped north around an area of high pressure, similar to what we have going in the US. It is bringing unrelenting heat to Spain and France through the rest of the week.\n\nIn France, it is likely to peak Thursday and Friday. Spain, where it will last until at least Thursday, is also dealing with an astonishing drought. The aridness, coupled with the heat, is putting most of the country into “extreme” fire danger.\n\nIt is very similar to what is happening in New Mexico, where the fire threat is critical once again, today and tomorrow.\n\nAnd then there is northwestern China, where temperatures will reach well into the triple digits Fahrenheit.\n\nA heat dome and a derecho\n\nAnother disaster is likely on the northern and northeastern edges of this heat dome: A derecho could form.\n\nTo be called a derecho, severe storms must have winds in excess of 58 mph and cause damage spanning at least 250 miles. The resulting conditions can be described as a tropical storm over land. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climatologist Adam Smith described a 2020 derecho to CNN Weather as an inland hurricane, with winds reports in excess of 100 mph and hurricane-force winds lasting for up to 45 minutes.\n\n“Some of the most intense summer derechos, especially those of the progressive type, occur on the fringes of major heat waves,” the SPC wrote on their website explaining derechos.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback What is a derecho? 01:01 • Source: CNN What is a derecho? 01:01\n\nThey happen on the edge of heat domes historically, because the jet stream goes around the high pressure – the level of the atmosphere where jets fly and the stream of the strongest winds are found – up and around, which helps create instability.\n\nBut at noon Monday, it was still uncertain if one will form later today.\n\nEven if it doesn’t, thunderstorms capable of hurricane-force wind gusts (75+ mph) could occur from Wisconsin down to Ohio Monday afternoon and evening.\n\n“A fairly widespread severe wind damage threat exists tonight and through the overnight hours,” CNN meteorologist Chad Myers stressed. “Expect severe weather watches and many warnings starting this afternoon. In fact, this rapidly moving cluster of storms may even approach the Mid-Atlantic states by morning.”", "authors": ["Judson Jones"], "publish_date": "2022/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/15/weather/extreme-heat-belt-us-impact-study-climate", "title": "An 'extreme heat belt' will impact over 100 million Americans in the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWorsening heat and humidity as a result of climate change will bring extremely dangerous heat indices to much of the United States in the next 30 years, increasing both the intensity and frequency of the hottest days of the year, according to a new study published Monday.\n\nTemperatures above the threshold of the National Weather Service’s “extreme danger” category, when the heat index is more than 125 degrees Fahrenheit, is expected to affect about 8 million people in the US this year.

On Tuesday afternoon, some 61 million Americans live where heat warnings, watches, or advisories were in effect, the National Integrated Heat Health Information System reported.\n\nAnd all-time record high temperatures have been set or tied in Texas cities such as Del Rio (115 degrees), Laredo (115 degrees) and San Angelo (114 degrees) last week. The heat index, which is how hot it feels to the human body when humidity is factored in, reached an unofficial record of 125 degrees in Corpus Christi.\n\nThe death last week of a postal worker in Dallas, where the heat index reached 115 degrees, was blamed on the extreme heat. And a 14-year-old boy died after hiking with his stepfather and brother in extreme heat at Big Bend National Park in Texas on Friday as the temperature rocketed up to 119 degrees.\n\nThat was not only the nation's hottest temperature so far this year, according to weather historian Christopher Burt, but just missed the state's all-time record of 120 degrees, Weather.com reported.\n\nClimate change made the heat wave five times more likely, study says\n\nAn analysis of data from Climate Central, a science communication group in Princeton, N.J., said that climate change is making this heat wave at least five times more likely.\n\n\"Human caused climate change made the extreme and extremely unusual temperatures in Mexico and the southern U.S. much more likely. Heat this intense, this early in the year will create stressful conditions for millions of people,\" said Andrew Pershing, vice president for science at Climate Central, earlier last week.\n\nClimate Central's findings come from its Climate Shift Index, which is \"a model-derived analysis of the likelihood of local temperatures with and without the influence of climate change, expressed on a simplified scale to quantify the degree to which carbon pollution affected average temperature,\" according to Peter Girard, the Vice President of Communications for Climate Central.\n\nTexas is heating up due to climate change\n\nIn Texas, the epicenter of this heat wave, the average daily high temperatures have increased by 2.4 degrees – 0.8 degrees per decade – since 1993, according data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This comes amid concerns over human-caused climate change resulting in rising temperatures.\n\nLooking far into the future, some 70 years from now, Texas is likely to have three or four times as many days per year above 100 degrees as it has today, the Environmental Protection Agency said.\n\nHeat wave is 'extremely unusual'\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania meteorologist Michael Mann told USA TODAY that this intense June heat wave is \"extremely unusual. We’re seeing record heat indices (which combine the heat and humidity), for example (unofficially) 125 degrees in Corpus Christi.\"\n\nEverything you need to know about heat: From the heat index to a heat dome to an excessive heat warning\n\nMann agrees that climate change is a factor in the heat wave, along with the natural warming from the El Niño climate pattern, but said \"it’s difficult to parse out the precise roles of these things at present – that will require some additional diagnostic work.\n\n\"Climate change, as our own work shows, is leading to more of these very persistent 'stuck' summer jet stream patterns, where, for example, a big high-pressure system with hot sinking air gets stuck in one particular region of the country,\" Mann said. \"That’s what happened during the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome and something very similar is playing out right now over the south central U.S. and northern Mexico.\"\n\n\"Sure, El Niño is having an impact right now on the large-scale atmospheric circulation, and could be playing a role in this current jet stream configuration. But El Niño has happened many times before without giving us such unprecedented weather extremes,\" he said.\n\nWhat is a heat dome?\n\nA heat dome occurs when a persistent region of high pressure traps heat over an area, according to William Gallus, professor of atmospheric science at Iowa State University.\n\n\"The heat dome can stretch over several states and linger for days to weeks, leaving the people, crops and animals below to suffer through stagnant, hot air that can feel like an oven,\" Gallus said in an article in the Conversation.\n\nMore about heat domes: Millions expected to suffer as heat dome expands beyond Texas this week: Graphics\n\nSpeaking about the current heat dome, WFLA-TV chief meteorologist Jeff Berardelli tweeted last week that \"this configuration, likely enhanced by climate heating, is fueling a record heat dome so extreme that even experts are astonished!\" He added that this heat dome is “basically impossible” without climate change.\n\nHeat is a killer\n\nHeat waves are less dramatic than other natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding or even thunderstorms, but they kill more people in the U.S. than all other weather-related disasters combined – causing hundreds of deaths each year, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nHow long will this heat wave last?\n\nThe heat wave that has plagued the south-central U.S. for much of this month will continue through the end of the week and into the weekend, forecasters said.\n\nBut meteorologists from AccuWeather said the pattern that's keeping this stifling heat in place will begin to break down by later in the weekend. Temperatures are still likely to remain a few degrees above historical averages, but not nearly at the level of this week's searing heat.\n\nThen, as the calendar turns to July, the nation enters what's historically the hottest month of the year for many areas.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/09/05/california-western-states-extreme-heat-this-week/7996448001/", "title": "Heat wave in California, West to continue; 39M people under warnings", "text": "Updated Sept. 5, 2022, 5:46 p.m. ET\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — Western states are about to feel what it has been like in scorching California the last few days – minus the beaches.\n\nThe extreme heat that broiled the drought-ravaged Golden State over the Labor Day weekend will continue for much of the week while also having a similar effect on states east of California, forecasters said Monday.\n\nMore than 100 records for daily high temperatures could be broken between Sunday and Wednesday, the National Weather Service said, using terms like “blistering heat’’ and “uncomfortably hot’’ overnight lows to illustrate what lies ahead in the West at least until Thursday.\n\nDeath Valley could hit 125 degrees; more than 39M under warnings\n\nThe nation’s hottest spot, Death Valley, California, is predicted to hit 125 degrees Tuesday. The state capital of Sacramento, which had not climbed above 109 degrees in any previous September, is expected to top 110 all but one day this week until Saturday. Fresno in the Central Valley figures to surge past its September record of 111.\n\nHeat warnings and advisories are in place for much of California and Nevada, but also for parts of Utah, Oregon, Idaho and Arizona, the weather service said.\n\nDave Houk, a senior meteorologist at Accuweather, said several of those states have already been impacted by this monster heat wave but not to the extent they will be in the next two days.\n\nFor example, Houk pointed out the highest temperature ever recorded in Boise, Idaho, on a Sept. 6 – Tuesday’s date – is 98 degrees. The forecasts for Tuesday and Wednesday are 103 and 104, respectively.\n\n“As you go through northern Nevada, Idaho and into Montana, there’s going to be another surge that is even more extreme than what they went through,’’ Houk said, extending that prediction to Salt Lake City and parts of Wyoming. “They are going to be in the core of the heat.’’\n\nAccuweather said Monday that more than 39 million people were under warnings for excessive heat, although the coastal northwest if finally getting some relief.\n\nHEAT IS THE TOP WEATHER-RELATED KILLER: Why ranking heat waves could save lives\n\nCalifornia facing 'dangerous heat'\n\nThe same can’t be said for inland parts of California, which will be exposed to “dangerous heat’’ the rest of the week, Houk said.\n\nEven the southern coastal areas of the state, like Los Angeles, will continue to swelter because of a rare combination of extreme heat and a high dew point, which correlates with more moisture in the air.\n\nThe dew point in downtown L.A. at 10 a.m. Monday was 70, which combined with a temperature of 87 degrees made it feel like 99 degrees. At the same time the previous day, that figure was 104.\n\n“Once we get those dew points up near 70, the body just has a tougher time cooling itself when it’s hot because that perspiration doesn’t evaporate on the skin,’’ Houk said. “It’s another factor, at least in Southern California, that we’re seeing with this heat wave.’’\n\nRequests for reduced power use through Friday\n\nThe intense heat is pushing energy demand close to record levels, raising concerns about the state's ability to meet those needs.\n\nThe California Independent System Operator has doubled down on its request for customers to cut down on their electricity use between 4 and 10 p.m. to avoid rotating blackouts. That means not using major appliances and setting thermostats at no lower than 78 degrees during those hours.\n\n“Starting tomorrow, this multi-day event is going to get much more intense,” ISO President and CEO Elliot Mainzer said in a Sunday posting. “We are facing a load forecast of 48,817 megawatts and energy deficits between 2,000 and 4,000 megawatts for Monday, resulting in the highest likelihood of rotating outages we have seen so far this summer.''\n\nThe calls for reduced power use statewide began Tuesday and are expected to last at least through Friday.\n\n\"The heat wave is historic for both its temperatures and its duration,'' the ISO said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/11/29/weather-forecast-winter-storm-warnings-tornadoes/10794265002/", "title": "Weather forecast brings winter storm warnings and threat of tornadoes", "text": "Nov. 29, 2022 Updated Nov. 30, 2022, 9:54 a.m. ET\n\nA severe weather outbreak threatened the south-central U.S. as strong thunderstorms and multiple tornadoes hit the region Tuesday, while what AccuWeather called an \"atmospheric fire hose\" was forecast to hammer the West.\n\nBracing for a week of wild, dangerous weather, the National Weather Service issued tornado watches in large swaths of the south-central, specifically in Louisiana and Mississippi where the weather service warned of “a particularly dangerous situation.” Watches are in effect until early Wednesday.\n\n“Parameters appear favorable for strong and long-tracked tornadoes this afternoon and early evening,” the weather service said, emphasizing northeast Louisiana and central Mississippi.\n\nResidents in several towns across Louisiana and Mississippi took cover as tornado sirens blared late Tuesday, and forecasters warned of the threat of strong twisters capable of tracking long distances on the ground as a severe weather outbreak erupted in the Deep South.\n\nMultiple tornado warnings were issued starting Tuesday afternoon and continuing into the nighttime hours as heavy thunderstorms rolled from eastern Texas to Georgia and as far north as Indiana. The National Weather Service confirmed that tornadoes hit the ground in Mississippi on Tuesday evening and Alabama was in the forecast path of the storms during the overnight hours.\n\nLocal officials across the region gave early reports of structural damages after tornadoes made ground.\n\nThe long-track tornadoes could produce wind gusts of up to 165 mph. As a precaution, some Mississippi public school districts ended classes and activities early, and Mississippi State University in Starkville switched to online instruction.\n\nThe combination of storms forecasters are predicting could fuel major travel disruptions, such as the temporary closing of runways at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport on Tuesday afternoon because of snow and impaired visibility.\n\nForty million people from Indiana and Illinois down to Texas were at risk for severe thunderstorms and possibly tornadoes on Tuesday alone, AccuWeather said. The National Weather Service warned that severe weather was likely Tuesday across a swath of the Mississippi Valley: Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee.\n\nThe weather service's Indianapolis office warned on Twitter that \"damaging winds will be the primary threat with lightning and isolated weak tornadoes also possible.\" The Chicago office cited the \"threat for isol'd gusts strong enough to down tree limbs.\"\n\nWHAT IS A NOR'EASTER?

The tornado moved across the Alabama state line into the western part of Mississippi where a nearby church had a steeple blown over in Lowndes County.\n\nIn Caldwell Parish, Louisiana, Sheriff Clay Bennett confirmed two people were injured from a tornado that damaged several homes. Trees were also reported to have fallen on homes in the parish as debris flew through the air.\n\nTornadoes hit Mississippi, central Louisiana\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center issued a tornado watch for portions of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas which will be in effect until early Wednesday.The region can expect several tornadoes, damaging winds, hail, and strong thunderstorms through the night, the center added.\n\nA tornado was first spotted in central Mississippi Tuesday afternoon near the town of Vaiden, about 80 miles northeast of Jackson. The storm was reported to be moving northeast at 50 mph at the time, according to AccuWeather. Hail, the size of tennis balls, was also reported in the region.\n\nTwo other tornadoes were confirmed to have hit Mississippi Tuesday The weather service said a tree fell onto a house due to a twister in Choctaw County, about 100 miles northeast of Jackson.\n\nA large and destructive tornado spun through Caldwell Parish, Louisiana, around 7:15 p.m. local time. The weather service confirmed damages in the southeast portion of the parish.\n\nWind gusts could reach 85 mph; outages could target 125M people\n\nA storm triggering severe weather and possible tornadoes in parts of the South from Tuesday to Wednesday will bring a blast of high winds as colder air sweeps from the Midwest to the Northeast, AccuWeather meteorologists warned. High winds and heavy snow in some areas could trigger power outages and travel delays.\n\nMore than 125 million people from the Midwest to the Northeast could face wind gusts of up to 85 mph, AccuWeather said.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF FLIGHTS DELAYED: 30M at risk for tornadoes, severe storms\n\nPacific Coast braces for heavy snow, driving rains\n\nToward the West, a strong cold front accompanied by powerful winds and heavy snow was sweeping across portions of the Upper Midwest on Tuesday.\n\n\"Heavy snow will develop over the parts of the Mississippi Valley and Upper Great Lakes, which has prompted Winter Storm Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories over the region,\" National Weather Service Meteorologist Paul Ziegenfelder said.\n\nWHAT IS AN ATMOSPHERIC RIVER? These rivers of water vapor can extend thousands of miles.\n\nThe Pacific Coast won't be exempt from the wild weather. A burst of intense moisture known as an atmospheric river, or a plume of intense moisture, will take aim at part of the West Coast and move southward midweek, AccuWeather said. Seattle could see its first snow of the season, and an \"intense\" 8- to12-hour period of precipitation could bring dangerous conditions to western Washington from Tuesday night to Wednesday, forecasters said.\n\nThe storm will roll into Northern California on Wednesday into Thursday. Southern California could see excessive rains at week's end, AccuWeather warned.\n\nWHAT IS THUNDERSNOW?

It's never going to get too hot to live in \"relatively dry climates\", because our bodies can cool off by evaporating water and heat from our skin.\n\nThe most dangerous places are those that get hot and humid – for example, the Middle East, Pakistan and India, where hundreds of millions live, mostly with no access to air conditioning.

The heat index, which is how hot it feels to the human body when humidity is factored in, reached an unofficial record of 125 degrees in Corpus Christi.\n\nThis cauldron of misery is courtesy of a sprawling heat dome that has parked itself over portions of Texas and Mexico this month, sending temperatures skyrocketing.\n\nWhat is a heat dome?\n\nA heat dome occurs when a persistent region of high pressure traps heat over an area, according to William Gallus, professor of atmospheric science at Iowa State University.\n\n\"The heat dome can stretch over several states and linger for days to weeks, leaving the people, crops and animals below to suffer through stagnant, hot air that can feel like an oven,\" Gallus said in an article in The Conversation.\n\nWFLA-TV chief meteorologist Jeff Berardelli tweeted last week that this heat dome, \"likely enhanced by climate heating, is fueling a record heat dome so extreme that even experts are astonished!\" He added that the heat dome is “basically impossible” without climate change.\n\nTexas heat dome to expand\n\nMillions more will be sizzling this week as the heat dome expands north, according to AccuWeather forecasters.\n\nMeteorologists said some states that have largely avoided record-high temperatures this month will begin to feel the extreme heat as the dome expands north and east.\n\n\"The heat that has gripped Texas for days on end will extend into [this] week as an intense core of high pressure high up in the atmosphere expands in coverage from northern Mexico into more of eastern Texas,\" explained AccuWeather Meteorologist La Troy Thornton.\n\nPersistent heat wave conditions\n\nAccuWeather forecasters predict that more locations across the central U.S. will suffer this week because of the weather pattern that brought the record-breaking heat to Texas last week.\n\nForecasters say that as the jet stream nudges slightly northward and eastward in the coming days, the heat will build into a portion of the Plains, Mississippi Valley and Southeast.\n\nHeat index chart calculates danger of humidity, heat\n\nThe National Weather Service warns that \"extreme heat and humidity will significantly increase the potential for heat-related illnesses, particularly for those working or participating in outdoor activities.\"\n\n\"Please stay safe in this ongoing dangerous heat wave!\" weather service meteorologist Kwan Yin Kong said in an online forecast Friday.\n\nThis chart shows how hot it feels when the effects of humidity and high temperatures are combined:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/13/weather/nationwide-winter-storm-blizzard-tuesday", "title": "At least 5 tornadoes confirmed in Texas as storms roll through ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAt least five tornadoes were confirmed in Texas during a storm outbreak Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service in Fort Worth.\n\nThree of the tornadoes were in Tarrant County, with the strongest having an EF-1 rating. One damage track was seen in the city of Grapevine, near the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.\n\nThe weather service said there was also an EF-2 tornado with 125 mph winds in Wise County, as well a tornado just west of the city of Paris. Damage surveys will be conducted in those communities Wednesday. Based on radar and damage reports, the National Weather Service said there could have been as many as 12 tornadoes in Texas Tuesday that they have not yet confirmed.\n\nThe storms have carved a path of destruction across Oklahoma and the Dallas-Fort Worth area Tuesday and injured at least seven people.

Visibility along Interstate 70 in that area was down to 100 feet, a Kansas Highway Patrol spokesman said on Twitter.\n\nSnowfall through Wednesday morning generally could be 10 to 18 inches in the central and northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Some areas inside the blizzard warning zones – particularly western South Dakota, eastern Wyoming and northwestern Nebraska – could get as many as 24 inches of snow, with winds strong enough to knock down tree limbs and cause power outages, the Weather Prediction Center said.\n\nSouth Dakota Gov.

The state’s Department of Transportation on Tuesday said wintry weather is impacting roadways throughout the entire state.\n\n“Not a single green stretch of road in the state,” the department said in a Facebook post. “Strong winds, blowing snow, whiteout conditions and slick spots are impacting routes statewide (and in some neighboring states!)”\n\nThe Wyoming Highway Patrol also advised motorists to be aware of road conditions, as “many roads across Wyoming are currently closed due to crashes and winter conditions.”\n\nIn Sidney, Nebraska, winds whipped Tuesday morning at 53 mph, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said, “and then you add in the snow, visibility is a quarter mile.”\n\nInterstates in South Dakota could become impassable amid the blizzard conditions, resulting in roadway closures across the state, the South Dakota Department of Transportation warned Monday.\n\nIce storm warnings were issued for parts of eastern South Dakota. Up to two-tenths of an inch of ice could accumulate in some of these areas, forecasters said.\n\nWintry precipitation “will begin to spread eastward over the Upper Great Lakes late Tuesday and Wednesday and into the Northeast late Wednesday as the storm system continues eastward,” the prediction center said.\n\nFreezing rain and sleet, meanwhile, will be possible through Wednesday in the Upper Midwest.\n\nMore tornadoes are a threat on the storm’s southern end\n\nMeanwhile, the southern end of the storm threatens to bring more tornadoes.\n\nAn alert for enhanced risk of severe weather – level 3 of 5 – was issued Tuesday for eastern Texas and the lower Mississippi River Valley, with the main threats including powerful tornadoes, damaging winds, and large hail. Baton Rouge, Shreveport, and Lafayette, Louisiana, are part of the threatened area, as is Jackson, Mississippi.\n\n“My main concern with the tornadoes is going to be after dark,” Myers said Tuesday. “We have very short days this time of year, so 5 or 6 o’clock, it’s going to be dark out there. Spotters aren’t as accurate when it is dark. Tornado warnings are a little bit slow; if you’re sleeping, you may not get them. So, that’s the real danger with this storm.”\n\n\"Everything was calm, and then I just saw a huge wall cloud,\" said Darrell Barton of the storm effect he spotted early Tuesday around Decatur, Texas. \"The rain and lightning was insane.\" Darrell Barton/B-Safe shelters\n\nA zone of slight risk – level 2 of 5 – encircled that area, stretching from eastern Texas and southern Oklahoma to southern Arkansas and much of the rest of Louisiana, including New Orleans, and central Mississippi.\n\nTuesday also brings a slight risk of excessive rainfall in parts of Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, with 2 to 4 inches of rain and flash flooding possible, the Weather Prediction Center said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the threat for severe weather is largely focused on the Gulf Coast, with tornadoes and damaging winds possible over parts of southern Louisiana, Mississippi, southwest Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle, the Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nIn Mississippi, the Meridian Public School District – which serves over 4,900 students – announced they will be closed Wednesday due to the threat of severe weather. Meridian is about 86 miles east of Jackson.\n\n“All schools, offices, and departments in the Meridian Public School District will be closed on Wednesday, December 14, 2022, due to the threat of 70 mph winds and possible tornadoes throughout the day on Wednesday, December 14, 2022. All extracurricular activities and practices are also canceled for December 14, 2022,” the school district said in a message on Facebook.\n\nThe Lawrence County and McComb School Districts also announced they were closing Wednesday due to the threat of severe weather.\n\nThe Mississippi Emergency Management Agency also noted the severe weather expected in the state and asked residents to prepare.\n\n“With severe weather expected throughout Mississippi tonight and tomorrow, please review your severe weather preparedness checklist to make sure you are ready for the storms,” the agency said in a message on Twitter.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Jason Hanna Monica Garrett", "Amir Vera", "Jason Hanna", "Monica Garrett"], "publish_date": "2022/12/13"}]}

So too has the personnel. The Avannaata Qimussersua, one of the world's major dog-sledding events, is out. There will be up to three Vances, not two − one is the vice president of the United States.\n\nIt's not always easy or obvious how to deal with uninvited guests. Just ask Danish and Greenlandic officials. They welcomed a U.S. decision to alter a planned visit this week to the Arctic territory they said was not wanted or needed. It threatened an icy reception amid President Donald Trump's vow to control Greenland.\n\n\"It's very positive the Americans canceled,\" Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Wednesday.\n\nUsha Vance, wife of Vice President JD Vance, and one of her sons had been due to visit the Danish territory Thursday to Saturday to see cultural and historical sites. The head of the dogsledding association asked her to wave a flag to open the annual dogsled race across ice and snow, which translates to \"The Great Race of the North.\"\n\nUpgraded and then downgraded\n\nBut amid what Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen described as \"unacceptable pressure\" on Greenland and local Greenlandic officials angrily characterized as an entirely unsolicited trip, the visit has both been upgraded and downgraded. Upgraded because the vice president will be joining his wife, becoming the most senior Trump administration official to set foot on the island. Downgraded because the American delegation will now only visit the U.S. Space Force Base at Pituffik, in northern Greenland, on Friday, not the dogsled race or other attractions. The Vances will be joined by White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright.\n\n'We want to be Greenlanders': Slow independence party wins vote, but pro-US party gains\n\nHere's a recap on Trump's quest to \"get\" Greenland, why he wants it, how that's going and the meaning of an invite:\n\nA primer: What's behind Trump's Greenland fascination?\n\nThe idea of the U.S. acquiring Greenland first came up in the 19th century when Andrew Johnson was president. The U.S. had recently taken control of Alaska from Russia. Johnson saw a Greenland acquisition as part of a broader push to expand U.S. influence in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nTrump first expressed interest in acquiring Greenland, the world's largest island that isn't a continent, in 2019, during his first term. That interest has been amplified in the early months of his second one. He has made repeated threats to acquire Greenland either through some form of financial transaction or even by using military force.\n\n\"We need Greenland for national security and even international security,” Trump said during an address to Congress in March, adding that the territory was \"very, very important for military security.\"\n\nThe U.S. has maintained a small missile defense base in Greenland since World War II. Trump has asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to come up with a plan for a U.S. missile defense system modeled after Israel's \"Iron Dome\" system. Straddling the Arctic Circle between the U.S., Russia and Europe, the Pituffik base could become part of Trump's \"Golden Dome\" defense system, which he believes will protect the U.S. from long-range missile strikes.\n\nUntapped cobalt, nickel, copper, lithium and zirconium\n\nThere also appears to be an economic motivation, that has national security implications, behind Trump's interest in the territory. Greenland has vast stores of untapped cobalt, nickel, copper, lithium, zirconium and other so-called rare earth minerals used in the production of batteries, cellphones, electric vehicles and other technology and defense systems. The U.S. gets most of its rare earths from China. Trump wants to end that.\n\nControlling Greenland could give the U.S. an expanded claim on undiscovered Arctic oil and natural resources and enable it to exert more dominance over Arctic shipping lanes used by Russia and China.\n\n'One way or the other': Five ways Trump's Greenland saga could play out\n\n\"Speaking for President Trump, we want to reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland because we think it's important to protecting the security of the entire world,\" the U.S. vice president said, when announcing he would be joining the second lady on the visit to Pituffik on Friday. Vance claimed that U.S. and Danish leaders had \"ignored Greenland for far too long\" and that \"we think we can take things in a different direction.\"\n\nDanish officials dispute that suggestion.\n\nRasmus Jarlov, a Danish opposition Conservative lawmaker, said his country has long been open to the U.S. having a bigger military presence in Denmark if it wants it. A case in point: A 1951 agreement that established a U.S. right to construct military bases in Greenland provided Denmark and Greenland are notified. And Ulrik Pram Gad, a researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies in Copenhagen, said Greenland's authorities are willing to to do business with American companies who want to open mines in Greenland to extract resources.\n\nIs Trump's Greenland pressure working?\n\nMartin Breum is a Danish journalist and author who specializes in Greenland and Arctic affairs. He said that many people in Greenland welcome the idea of inviting American companies to the territory to invest in mining, tourism, or fisheries. He said there is no particular animosity toward the U.S. in government circles.\n\n\"We should not fall into the trap that the Greenlanders don't want anything to do with the U.S. Nothing could be further from the truth,\" Breum said in a phone interview from Greenland's capital, Nuuk, on Wednesday.\n\n\"It's the idea of a (Trump) political takeover that they really object to,\" he said.\n\nDrew Horn is the CEO of Greenmet, an American company that is helping to facilitate business contacts between Greenland's government and Trump's White House. Horn played a role in organizing the upcoming U.S. visit.\n\nHe said in a phone interview prior to the shift in the U.S. delegation's itinerary that comments from Danish and Greenlandic officials asserting that the White House was applying political pressure on Greenland were \"ludicrous.\"\n\n\"Mike Waltz is the national security adviser,\" Horn said. \"He's looking at defense solutions that the Greenlanders have asked for in the past − out at the base there. It's within his purview and his responsibilities to go meet with the Space Force leadership there as a part of this planning. It's not a power move. It's not pressure on the Greenlanders.\"\n\nKuno Fencker, a member of Greenland's parliament, said many on the island are seeking more business opportunities.\n\n\"We want to diversity our economy. We want to trade with other companies and not only Denmark,\" he said in an interview.\n\nStill, Gad, the researcher, said that it was clear that Trump's strategy to send a high-powered U.S. delegation to Greenland was backfiring because whatever his intentions might be, it looks to most Greenlanders like \"dominance.\"\n\n\"If it's an attempt at playing some kind of soft diplomacy, then it's failed,\" said Gad, who worked in Nuuk for Greenland's government before moving full-time into academic research.\n\n\"Every time Trump says, 'We want to make you rich,' he then says 'we will have it one way or the other.'\"\n\nAbout that Greenland invite: Was there one?\n\nGreenland's government has been fairly explicit: There was no formal or informal official invitation to U.S. officials for them to visit, and they objected especially to any U.S. delegation arriving at a time when Greenland is in the middle of negotiations to form a new coalition government following an election there earlier in March.\n\nYet, Trump said there was an invite. So, which is it?\n\nBoth. Neither. Blame the dogs − or their benefactor.\n\nIn fact, the invitation for the second lady to attend the dogsled race was sent by an American named Tom Dans, according to his own admission. Dans runs a company called American Daybreak that seeks to strengthen U.S.-Greenlandic ties. He worked for Trump during his first term, as a commissioner for U.S. Arctic Research.\n\nIn a statement published late Tuesday on social media, Dans said that his company was a \"sponsor and supporter\" of the Avannaata Qimussersua and that in that capacity, he invited the second lady and other senior administration officials to come to Greenland \"with us to experience this unique and exciting cultural event.\" Dans said the visit was always intended to be \"purely personal in nature and in the spirit of the friendship between our two nations.\"\n\nStill, Denmark's leadership and Greenland's outgoing prime minister struggled to view the visit in those terms.\n\n\"What is the national security adviser doing in Greenland? The only purpose is to demonstrate power over us,\" Mute Egede said in an interview Sunday with the Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq. \"His mere presence in Greenland will no doubt fuel American belief in Trump’s mission − and the pressure will increase.\n\nSo why no dogsled race? And what now?\n\nWhat was supposed to be a three-day trip is now just a single day, perhaps only a few cloistered, frozen hours.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on why the dogsled race, which takes place in Sisimiut on Saturday, was being dropped from the itinerary or why the visit has been condensed to just a single day.\n\nStill, in recent weeks there have been protests over Trump's designs on Greenland, including one in Nuuk where demonstrators filed past the U.S. consulate and quietly sang the island's anthem. Another had been planned for Saturday at the dog race, when protesters intended to turn their backs at the second lady.\n\nAt least one U.S. media report suggested anti-U.S. demonstrations in Nuuk might have scared the Trump administration enough to revise the trip to avoid interactions with angry Greenlanders.\n\nSo, no dogs, but what appears to be a brief day trip to the U.S. military base.\n\nThe vice president said he and his wife will travel to the Pituffik to receive a briefing on Arctic security issues and meet with U.S. service members. There was no mention of whether their son would still be on the trip.\n\nFencker, the lawmaker, acknowledged the importance for Vance to visit the Pituffik base but doesn’t think that visit will boost trade and tourism. Fencker said nobody in Greenland knows much about what goes on there.\n\nPituffik is situated in Greenland's remote north, about 750 miles from the North Pole, an area where there are few civilians or Greenlandic officials. It seems unlikely, said Breum, the Danish expert on the Arctic, that the Vances; Waltz, the national security adviser; or Wright, the energy secretary, will encounter any locals.\n\n\"Pituffik is completely isolated from civil society,\" said Breum.\n\nHe noted that on Wednesday morning in Nuuk, two U.S. Hercules military aircraft, loaded with bullet proof cars and security officials, left Greenland. They were part of a White House advance security team no longer needed.\n\n\"Plus,\" Breum said of Pituffik, \"on Friday, it will be 25 below Celsius (-13 Fahrenheit).\"\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/01/20/usha-vance-pregnant-baby/88270749007/", "title": "Usha Vance is pregnant, expecting fourth child with JD Vance", "text": "Jan. 20, 2026 Updated Jan. 21, 2026, 9:22 a.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON ‒ Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance are expecting their fourth child, a boy, in what appears will be a historic first: the wife of a sitting vice president having a baby.\n\nThe second couple issued a statement on Jan. 20 announcing Usha Vance's pregnancy that said, \"Usha and the baby are doing well, and we are looking forward to welcoming him in July.\"\n\nThe Vances currently have two sons and one daughter: 8-year-old Ewan; 5-year-old Vivek and 3-year-old Mirabel.

The last wife of a sitting president to give birth was Frances Cleveland, wife of Grover Cleveland, in 1893. First lady Jaqueline Kennedy, wife of President John F. Kennedy, in 1963 had a premature baby, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, who died tragically after two days.\n\n\"During this exciting and hectic time, we are particularly grateful for the military doctors who take excellent care of our family and for the staff members who do so much to ensure that we can serve the country while enjoying a wonderful life with our children,\" the Vances said.\n\nJD Vance, 41, and Usha Vance, 39, met at Yale Law School and married in 2014. They are the nation's first millennial second family.\n\nUsha Vance told conservative commentator Meghan McCain in a June podcast that her husband sometimes talked about having a fourth child, but she felt \"pretty good\" about sticking with three. The second lady didn't rule it out, however. \"Never say never,\" she said.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with USA TODAY in December, Usha Vance said she dreams one day of returning to Cincinnati and the family's former home. But she said the couple's three children have had no trouble turning the vice president's residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington into their home.\n\n“They have full run of the place,” the second lady said.

The only purpose is to demonstrate power over us,\" Prime Minister Múte B. Egede said in an interview Sunday with the Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq.\n\n\"Until recently, we could trust the Americans, who were our allies and friends, and with whom we enjoyed working closely,\" Egede said. \"But that time is over.\"\n\nJens-Frederik Nielsen, leader of the Democrats, said the visit by the U.S. delegation during coalition talks and with municipal elections due next week \"once again shows a lack of respect for the Greenlandic people.\"\n\nThe Trump administration and Greenland\n\nSince Trump’s victory in November, he has shown a continued interest in buying the island for “national security purposes.”\n\nGreenland's strategic location and rich mineral resources could benefit the U.S. as Greenland lies along the shortest route from Europe to North America and could prove vital for the U.S. ballistic missile warning system.\n\nThe governments of both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly rejected and criticized Trump's annexation talk.\n\nIn January, Donald Trump Jr. visited the island's capital for a private visit, during which he handed out red MAGA caps, filmed a documentary, and spoke to Trump-friendly residents.\n\nThen, in an interview on Fox News earlier this year, JD Vance questioned Denmark’s stewardship of Greenland.\n\n\"If that means we need to take more territorial interest in Greenland, that is what President Trump is going to do because he doesn’t care about what the Europeans scream at us, he cares about putting the interests of America’s citizens first,\" Vance said.\n\nThe president has also, on repeated occasions, continued to insist that Greenland will come under American control. During Trump's address to a joint session of Congress, he said that he supported the right of the Danish territory’s people to determine their own future.\n\nBut he added in an aside: “I think we’re going to get it. One way or the other, we’re going to get it.”\n\nIn a January post on Truth Social, Trump said the people of Greenland would \"benefit tremendously\" if their territory was under American control.\n\n\"Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our Nation,\" he said. \"We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World.

And the second lady – the wife of Vice President JD Vance – was seen without her wedding ring, talking to the troops and to the first lady. Despite the online discourse, Vance has been pictured with and without her wedding band on numerous occasions.\n\nBy the time Friday, Nov. 21, rolled around, the split rumors surfaced on social media. Speculation about the state of the second couple's marriage intensified. But Vance, 39, is the first second lady of her kind, a reserved and hesitant public figure, more focused on motherhood than statesmanship.\n\nA spokeswoman for the second lady told USA TODAY in a statement Nov. 21 that Vance is \"a mother of three young children, who does a lot of dishes, gives lots of baths, and forgets her ring sometimes.\" The Vances have three children: Ewan, 8, Vivek, 5, and Mirabel, 3.\n\nOnce viewed simply through the lens of their vows, Vance is among a growing bipartisan group of modern women in America who are bucking the constructs and constraints of political marriages.\n\nWho is Usha Vance? Here's what to know about the incoming second lady\n\nJennifer Siebel Newsom, wife of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, reimagined her role as \"first partner,\" ditching the \"lady\" label due to gendered stereotypes. Michelle Obama has been outspoken during President Donald Trump's second term about the burden of being first lady. Rama Duwaji, married to New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, is an accomplished illustrator who never speaks to the press, offering statements through her artwork on Instagram.\n\nLike Melania Trump, she rarely sits for interviews. Besides an hourlong appearance on Meghan McCain's podcast, sitting as the former \"View\" cohost announced her third pregnancy, Vance has skipped press stops since her husband took office.\n\n\"Interesting. Usha Vance minus wedding ring yesterday at Camp Lejeune,\" Democratic strategist Adam Parkhomenko said on X, incorrectly stating the day of Vance's visit. \"Is JD sleeping on the couch?\" the Democratic Party's official X account said.\n\nUsha Vance skips wearing wedding ring. Why do we care?\n\nBorn and raised in San Diego, Usha Chilukuri was a child of Hindu Indian immigrants and both of her parents are educators.\n\nThe Vances met as students at Yale Law School, where she excelled. \"She seemed some sort of genetic anomaly, a combination of every positive quality a human being should have: bright, hardworking, tall, and beautiful,\" her husband wrote in his 2016 memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" calling the second lady his \"spirit guide.\"\n\nBefore President Trump picked her husband as his running mate, Vance was a lawyer at Munger, Tolles & Olson, a firm that specializes in litigation and corporate law. After Trump won the 2024 presidential election, Vance moved her family from their home in Cincinnati's East Walnut Hills neighborhood to the United States Naval Observatory, the traditional residence of the vice president's family.\n\nDuring her time as second lady, Vance has still been the subject of rumors about the health of her marriage. Kennedy heir Jack Schlossberg, now running for Congress, garnered backlash after joking that he was expecting a baby with Vance.\n\nThe internet ignited in furor after Charlie Kirk's widow, Erika, hugged her husband. Vice President Vance made headlines last month for saying he hoped his wife would convert to Catholicism.\n\n\"Do I hope eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved in by church? Yeah, I honestly, I do wish that, because I believe in the Christian gospel, and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way,\" JD Vance said, speaking at a Turning Point USA event at the University of Mississippi on Oct. 29.\n\n\"But if she doesn't, then God says, 'Everybody has free will,' and so that doesn't cause a problem for me. That's something you work out with your friends, with your family, with the person that you love,\" he added.\n\nThen, of course, the missing ring.\n\nThere are countless reasons why somebody may choose not to wear their wedding band. They took it off to be cleaned. It felt too tight. They left it on the bathroom counter before going to bed that night. In the movies, the wife slips off her wedding ring after an argument or fight. In real life, many people just forget.\n\nVance is busy doing the dishes and giving the kids baths. In America, it could also just be that the second lady's ring and narrative belong to her first.\n\nContributing: Amaris Encinas, Aysha Bagchi", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/25/vance-greenland-trump-usha/82656685007/", "title": "JD Vance heading to Greenland with wife Usha as US pressure builds", "text": "March 25, 2025 Updated March 26, 2025, 5:11 p.m. ET\n\nVice President JD Vance will travel to Greenland this week, joining his wife on a visit to the massive island President Donald Trump wants the United States to own.\n\nTrump has unnerved Greenland's leaders by offering to purchase it from Denmark − without ruling out military action or economic coercion.\n\nVance announced his visit on X on Tuesday afternoon, elevating a trip that his wife, Usha Vance, was scheduled to headline, but that Greenland's leaders characterized as an uninvited trip meant to intimidate them.\n\nDenmark's foreign minister on Wednesday addressed changes to the Vances' schedule.\n\n\"I think it's very positive the Americans canceled their visit to the Greenlandic society.

Or I can flip the channel.\n\nThursday was personal. The massacre at The Capital Gazette newspaper office in Annapolis, Maryland, by a disgruntled gunman who slaughtered five people and wounded two, didn't just hit close to home.\n\nIt was home.\n\nI worked at The Capital for nearly six years as a county government reporter. I dated Audrey Ross, the dogged police reporter who would become my wife. I worked, argued and drank with industrious journalists who would later join top-echelon newspapers such as The New York Times, The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times. I eventually reached USA TODAY, largely thanks to the foundation my mentors and colleagues built for me in Annapolis.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nA dig for sometimes uncomfortable truths\n\nFive people were coldly slain Thursday: editorial writer Gerald Fischman, 61; assistant editor and columnist Rob Hiaasen, 59; editor and longtime sports reporter John McNamara, 56; editor and reporter Wendi Winters, 65; and sales assistant Rebecca Smith, 34.\n\nI personally worked with Gerald, who came off as shy and taciturn – until you read his prose directed at misbehaving public officials. And I toiled with \"Johnny Mac,\" as he was known, whose effervescent personality shone through in his sports writing.\n\nBut really I worked with all of them. And all the reporters around the country who strive every day to be fair and accurate despite the false narrative increasingly being hurled by the American public claiming we have agendas to promote or scalps to claim or egos to burnish. News reporting is a cooperative effort to uncover the truth – or at least as much as of it as we can.\n\nSometimes that truth – or our depiction of it – is raw and uncomfortable. And often we find ourselves on the front lines facing public anger. Tragically, that anger devolved into violence Thursday.\n\nCapital Gazette newsroom shooting: 'It could have been me'\n\nCapital Gazette shooting shows us we need to support the media for democracy's sake\n\nTom Marquardt, my former editor at The Capital, put it aptly on Facebook:\n\n\"The Capital, like all newspapers, angered people every day in its pursuit of the news. In my day, people protested by writing letters to the editor; today it's through the barrel of a gun. Sure, I had death threats and the paper had bomb threats. But we shrugged them off as part of the business we were in. We prided ourselves in being an open newsroom, available to anyone to visit. What happened today could have happened in any newsroom.\"\n\nOf course, it doesn't help when people attack the press or, like extremist Milo Yiannopoulos, call for \"vigilante squads to start gunning journalists down on sight\" (as a joke, he said later).\n\nNewspapers have suffered in recent years. Readership, circulation and advertising revenue are down. There are fewer reporters being asked to take on more tasks with flat pay as they watch their ranks diminish.\n\nBut for many people newspapers remain the public square for reasonable discourse at a time when the echo chamber of social media is the refuge of those not interested in the full picture.\n\nOur job is to question and listen\n\nBuy a newspaper or go online to its website. If you don't like what you see, share your opinion with them. Constructively.\n\nAnd when a reporter respectfully approaches you for an opinion or a story, share it as well. Our job is to question, but mostly to listen. Especially to the voices not often heard.\n\nFor decades, newspapers like The Capital have reflected the communities they cover by being part of their fabric. If you wanted to know something about Annapolis, you read the Capital. You still do.\n\nAs my USA TODAY colleague and fellow Capital Gazette alum Bart Jansen wrote: \"We all loved living and working in Annapolis.

This comes after being assigned to that cohort back in September. They will return in the SpaceX Dragon, which is named Freedom, alongside NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.\n\nHere's what to know before the upcoming return to Earth.\n\nHow did the astronauts get 'stuck' in space?\n\nWhen is the next Florida launch? Is there a launch today? Upcoming SpaceX, NASA rocket launch schedule at Cape Canaveral\n\nWilliams and Wilmore certainly did not expect to be on the ISS for nine month when they launched to space in June aboard the Boeing Starliner spacecraft on a crewed test flight. The test flight − which would have certified Starliner to ferry NASA crews to and from the ISS − was supposed to last only eight to ten days.\n\nThat short test flight became extended as NASA and Boeing rushed to find answers after the spacecraft's thrusters malfunctioned upon the docking with the ISS in June. Uncertain about safely returning Williams and Wilmore onboard the Starliner, NASA reassigned the astronauts to the upcoming Crew-9 mission.\n\nNASA removed two astronauts from its Crew-9 mission to allow for Williams and Wilmore to join the cohort, and return onboard the SpaceX Dragon − which carries four people at a time. The altered Crew-9 − only Hague and Gorbunov − launched aboard the SpaceX Dragon Freedom in late September.\n\nMeanwhile, the Starliner spacecraft had landed on September 7, without Williams and Wilmore onboard. According to recent NASA press briefings, Boeing is still working on resolving the issue with the thrusters.\n\nCrew-10 SpaceX Dragon issues\n\nCrew-10 was supposed to launch to the space station back in February, yet late last year, SpaceX encountered production issues with the Dragon spacecraft which would have ferried the crew.\n\nThe new Dragon spacecraft, that was supposed to carry Crew-10, was not quite ready due to a battery problem, so NASA opted to go ahead with another Dragon — known as Endurance — in order to launch sooner. This Dragon has flown three previous missions and had originally been slated to fly Axiom-4's private astronaut mission to the ISS.\n\nAstronauts speak out: This is not a 'rescue' mission\n\nEver since remarks on social media by Elon Musk and President Trump in late January, the story has confused many people.\n\n\"The @POTUS has asked @SpaceX to bring home the 2 astronauts stranded on the @Space_Station as soon as possible. We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long,\" Musk wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on Jan. 28. Musk owns the social media website, is the CEO of SpaceX, and serves as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency under Trump.\n\nSince the remarks, many astronauts have been sharing thoughts on social media. This past week, NASA astronaut, Karen Nyberg, took to Facebook to point out NASA's side of the story.\n\n\"The main thing to point out is that there is no 'rescue' mission to get Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams home. NASA simply made changes to their operational timeline to accommodate them becoming part of the standard crew rotation − the decision to bring them home on a SpaceX vehicle was made LAST SUMMER. And nothing has changed since,\" wrote Nyberg.\n\n\"Though I know there had to be a huge mental adjustment for Butch and Suni as the plan changed from an 8-day mission to one of several months, making those adjustments is often part of the job,\" wrote Nyberg. \"As a former astronaut, the only astronauts I feel bad for are the two who had to be removed from Crew-9 to accommodate Butch and Suni's return and now have to wait for their chance to live and work on the ISS!\"\n\nNyberg also pointed out that NASA crewed missions to the space station typically last six months.\n\nThe expedition of Williams and Wilmore is not even close to the longest stay in space by U.S. astronaut. That record goes to Frank Rubio, who spent 371 days in orbit in between 2022-23 when the Russian Soyuz spacecraft he flew on to the space station sprung a coolant leak − which extended his stay on the space station by six months.\n\nWhen will the astronauts depart the Space Station?\n\nOriginally slated for Wednesday, Crew-9 may return to Earth a day sooner than expected.\n\nCrew-9, which includes Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore, Williams, will suit up and prepare to undock the Crew Dragon Freedom from the space station tonight, Monday, March 17. NASA plans to begin live coverage of hatch closure starting 10:45 p.m. EDT Monday.\n\nOf course this all depends on weather off the West Coast of Florida, where the spacecraft is scheduled to splashdown.\n\nNASA states that Tuesday is looking favorable for weather. Crew-9 is slated to undock at 1:05 a.m. Live coverage will be provided on NASA's website beginning at 12:45 a.m.. If all goes well, and weather is still looking favorable, the Dragon will undock at 1:05 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nWhen will the astronauts splashdown?\n\nThe return trip will be around 17 hours, as deorbit burn is anticipated for 5:11 p.m. − which will slow the spacecraft down from its 17,500 mph orbital cruising speed for its reentry into the atmosphere.\n\nAfter a ride through the atmosphere, parachutes will slow the Dragon spacecraft down to 15 miles per hour. It will splashdown softly into the ocean, and NASA and SpaceX recovery crews will welcome the astronauts back to Earth onboard a SpaceX recovery ship.\n\nSplashdown is scheduled for 5:57 p.m..\n\nMedical teams will be ready to assist the crew, offering stretchers, yet this is not a concern. It is normal for astronauts to experience muscle weakness their first days back on Earth after being in microgravity for an extended period of time − and was even an issue during week-long Space Shuttle missions. Astronauts return to normal in the weeks post-spaceflight as their bodies readjust to Earth's gravity.\n\nNASA will address the public and media beginning at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday evening, providing mission updates.\n\nFLORIDA TODAY will also provide live coverage of the events beginning 3:45 p.m. on Tuesday, March 18 at FloridaToday.com/space.\n\nBrooke Edwards is a Space Reporter for Florida Today.

The four spacefarers arriving on that mission, known as Crew-10, will pave the way for Williams and Wilmore to depart with the Crew-9 team.\n\nWhen the departing astronauts board a SpaceX Dragon docked at the outpost since September, it will represent the culmination of a return mission NASA laid out months ago – seemingly contrary to President Donald Trump's claim that he \"authorized\" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to retrieve the astronauts.\n\nBut even when the Crew-10 replacement mission reaches the space station as early as Thursday morning, the Starliner astronauts won't be able to come home right away. So when, exactly, could Williams and Wilmore return to Earth?\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nWhat happened with the Boeing Starliner?\n\nAs the two astronauts selected for the Starliner's first crewed flight test, Wilmore and Williams launched in June on a mission to test a Boeing vehicle intended to one day join the SpaceX Dragon in transporting NASA astronauts to orbit.\n\nThe mission was supposed to be a 10-day stay at the ISS. But that was before NASA discovered that the Starliner spacecraft had experienced multiple helium leaks and propulsion system issues.\n\nAfter months of deliberating, NASA officials decided that instead of having Wilmore and Williams return to Earth on Starliner, the agency would undock the empty vehicle for an autonomous landing in September in New Mexico.\n\nHow are the Starliner astronauts returning to Earth?\n\nUnder NASA's plan, first announced in August, it was decided that Wilmore and Williams would instead make their return journey aboard the Starliner's potential future competitor, a SpaceX Dragon.\n\nThe specific Dragon selected as Williams and Wilmore's ride back to Earth has since been at the station since late-September after arriving with the Crew-9 mission.\n\nThough that mission was the ninth science rotation mission to the station under NASA's commercial crew program, it was the first without a full contingent of four astronauts. Astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov were the only Crew-9 spacefarers sent to the orbital outpost on a Dragon with two empty seats reserved for the Starliner astronauts when their mission concludes.\n\nWhen could the SpaceX Crew-10 mission launch?\n\nBefore the Starliner crew members can depart with the Crew-9 team, they must await the arrival of the mission's successors.\n\nThe Dragon capsule transporting the four-member crew of Crew-10 is due to launch at 7:48 p.m. EST March 12 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, NASA said in a mission blog update. The U.S. space agency plans to provide coverage of both the crew's launch from Florida and arrival at the space station the following morning.\n\nThe launch date for the Crew-10 mission, originally anticipated to get off the ground in February, has twice fluctuated since December.\n\nNASA initially announced that the launch had been pushed to late March to give SpaceX more time to prepare a new Dragon capsule for liftoff. However, the launch date was moved back up to mid-March when NASA reconsidered and decided to use a \"previously flown\" Dragon named Endurance.\n\nWhen could Starliner astronauts, Crew-9 depart ISS?\n\nOnce the new astronauts arrive, a few days of handover activities will occur before Williams and Wilmore can join Crew-9 in the SpaceX Dragon to undock from the International Space Station.\n\nWhile NASA has provided targeted times for the Crew-10 launch and arrival at the space station, the agency has not yet released a date for the targeted return of Crew-9.\n\n\"NASA will provide additional information on the Crew-9 return timeline in the coming days,\" a spokesperson said Thursday in an email to USA TODAY.\n\nWilmore, however, previously told CNN that the return voyage could possibly take place March 19.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

After an early-morning departure from the International Space Station – their unanticipated home for the past 286 days – Wilmore and Williams splashed down around 6 p.m. ET in a SpaceX Dragon capsule.\n\nAnd they weren't alone.\n\nJoining them for the 17-hour voyage through the cosmos were NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, the two members of a SpaceX mission known as Crew-9. Hague and Gorbunov flew to the space station in September aboard the Dragon vehicle NASA selected for Williams and Wilmore's return journey.\n\nThe U.S. space agency's difficult choice became necessary when Boeing's Starliner encountered technical problems upon reaching the orbital laboratory that made it unsafe for its crew to ride back to the ground. To avoid having the station be understaffed, NASA opted to keep Williams and Wilmore at the station a few extra months rather than launch an emergency mission to return them to Earth.\n\nThough the experienced astronauts have long downplayed their extended mission as just part of the job, they no doubt are relishing the chance to finally reunite with loved ones while reacclimating to life on Earth.\n\n“We are thrilled to have Suni, Butch, Nick, and Aleksandr home,\" Janet Petro, NASA acting administrator, said in a statement.\n\nHere's what happened after the original crew of the Starliner landed with Crew-9, and what's next now that they're home.\n\nWhere did the astronauts land and what happened next?\n\nThe SpaceX Dragon vehicle, charred from its journey through Earth's atmosphere, deployed parachutes to land right on schedule at 5:57 p.m. ET in waters near Tallahassee.\n\nTeams aboard SpaceX recovery vessels raced to retrieve the floating spacecraft and its crew of four. SpaceX crews on a pair of boats were the first to reach the Dragon, helping secure it and hoist it onto a recovery ship.\n\nOnce the Dragon was firmly in place on the ship's main deck, recovery teams cut into the vehicle's side hatch to help Williams, Wilmore, Hague and Gorbunov exit.\n\nAs commentators explained during NASA's livestream, the astronauts were placed onto stretchers – standard protocol after long-duration spaceflights – and taken to receive medical examinations. Once cleared, the four astronauts were taken on a short helicopter ride to board an airplane for a flight to NASA's headquarters in Houston.\n\nThe astronauts landed at 12:19 a.m. ET Wednesday at Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base, a NASA spokesman said in an email to USA TODAY.\n\nWhat's next for the Starliner, Crew-9 astronauts?\n\nThe four astronauts who rode the Dragon to Earth will remain in crew quarters at the Johnson Space Center in Houston for a few days to recover from their long-duration missions and taxing spaceflight.\n\nBut they won't be isolated in quarantine, as is protocol before space missions get off the ground.\n\nWilmore and Williams, along with Hague and Gorbunov, will be reunited with their families and colleagues at NASA. Flight surgeons will monitor their recoveries as they readapt to Earth's gravity.\n\n\"Once cleared by NASA doctors, the crew members return home and begin fully reacclimating to life on Earth,\" a NASA spokesman told USA TODAY on Wednesday.\n\nThe four astronauts are also scheduled to address the public in the weeks ahead during a news conference.\n\nWhat happens to the SpaceX Dragon Freedom?\n\nThe Dragon capsule the astronauts piloted back to Earth, named Freedom, is one of four in SpaceX's Dragon fleet. The vehicles, standing nearly 27 feet tall and about 13 feet wide, can accommodate up to seven astronauts, though most missions comprise a contingent of four.\n\nThe Crew-9 mission was the fourth flight for that particular Dragon.\n\nUnder NASA and SpaceX protocol, Freedom will return to SpaceX’s refurbishing facility at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. There, teams will inspect the capsule, analyze data on its performance and begin preparing it for its next flight.\n\nThe SpaceX crew missions, most of which last about six months, are contracted under NASA's commercial crew program. The program allows the U.S. space agency to pay SpaceX to launch and transport astronauts and cargo to orbit aboard the company's own vehicles, freeing up NASA to focus on its Artemis lunar program and other deep-space missions, including future crewed expeditions to Mars.\n\nThe four astronauts of the Crew-10 mission, which replaced the Crew-9 mission at the International Space Station, flew to orbit aboard the Dragon Endurance, which also has been used on previous launches.\n\nThe Boeing Starliner is meant to one day become a second operational vehicle for NASA under the program, though its path toward certification remains fraught after its botched inaugural crewed flight test.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

(Wey left Revolver in September 2014 and Dalinowski has been sole operator since.)\n\n“I guess I was dragging my feet a little bit,” Dalinowski, 50, said of the decision not to reopen. “I don’t think that I decided fully to let go of the space until about the last two weeks. … My business model just happened to be the opposite of what could possibly work, though it worked for quite a while now. But what used to make it unique and charming and different — breaking bread with people — now it’s the last thing you want to do.”\n\nWhen Revolver debuted in 2013, the concept of a communal dining space with weekly rotating chefs who cooked dinners that you purchased tickets to in advance was still novel in the area.\n\nThe homespun space on Joseph Campau in the heart of Hamtramck’s commercial strip lit up most weekends, jammed tight with 40 diners at each seating who clamored for an early preview of the next big thing or a taste of an underrepresented cuisine — like eating at a different restaurant every weekend.\n\nBut the idea of communal dining — a big pre-COVID-19 trend — quickly lost its appeal as the pandemic descended upon Michigan in March. The final Revolver dinner, one celebrating Indigenous cuisine of the Great Lakes, just barely broke even on March 15, the day before Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered a statewide stay-at-home order and effectively shut down dining rooms across Michigan. Food was ordered for the expected 80 guests, but many no-showed or canceled out of caution. The writing was on the wall.\n\nLike many, Dalinowski prepared for a few weeks or at most a couple months of disruption and tried to wait it out. But then Revolver dinners that were postponed once had to be postponed again as the pandemic dragged well beyond those early estimates.\n\n“The communal dining thing was just a kick in the ass,” Dalinowski said. “And there’s no end in sight. Even after everything else opens back up, who is going to want to sit shoulder to shoulder or back to back with strangers who might sniffle or cough in the winter? The answer is almost nobody. Even the people who aren’t wearing masks and want to go to the bar aren’t going to be comfortable at a table with 13 strangers.”\n\nRevolver grew a fast following thanks in part to the excitement around a number of the chefs who used it as a staging ground to preview their own upcoming restaurants. Well-known names in the metro Detroit dining scene like Kate Williams (Lady of the House), Brad Greenhill (Takoi) and James Rigato (Mabel Gray) were among some of the earliest guest chefs.\n\nAs the pandemic stretched beyond weeks into months, Dalinowski held a sort of “keep the doors open” fundraiser, selling discounted gift cards for planned future events.\n\nAnd though he said many people who participated did so without expecting much in return, he feels obligated to make good on the outstanding debts.\n\nHe said there are two options on the table. The gift cards will be “absolutely good” at whatever his next venture is. He said he’s not interested in doing another full-service restaurant ever again and the space on Joseph Campau is no longer an option, but he’s got something small and simple cooking with a local chef that he hopes could launch by spring. The other potential option is the possibility of a few off-site Revolver-branded pop-up dinners, held in a fitting, socially-distant space.\n\nWhatever happens, Dalinowski remains sanguine.\n\n“It sinks in after a while — what you had,” he said. “I think COVID has helped me deal with that. If I had just had to walk away from the space after a full month of sold-out dinner events, I think I’d be pretty emotional about it. I have amazing memories there. It just feels really good to have built something. It’s like raising a kid. Me and Tunde had a kid together. We raised it. And now the kid needs to go off to college and just be his or her own thing. It’s time to just let it be.\"\n\nSend your dining tips to Free Press Restaurant Critic Mark Kurlyandchik at 313-222-5026 ormkurlyandc@freepress.com.

Their return capsule was hit and damaged by space debris fragments.\n\nChina's space agency has not revealed how badly damaged the capsule was, and it’s not known if the craft was hit by debris while in flight or while docked at the station. No one was injured. The Shenzhou-20 spacecraft remains attached to Tiangong, a permanently crewed space station operated by China Manned Space Agency.\n\nOfficials had ordered the astronauts to remain on Tiangong while engineers troubleshoot the capsule. Without a way to repair it remotely, another capsule docked at the station, Shenzhou-21, became the return vessel for the Shenzhou-20 crew, which arrived in China on Nov. 14.\n\nA backup Shenzhou craft will be sent for the Shenzhou-21 crew.\n\nThe Shenzhou spacecraft ‒ made up of an orbital module, a reentry module and a service section ‒ carries three astronauts and equipment to Tiangong after launching via a Long March 2F rocket. The Shenzhou-20 mission launched on April 24 from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China.\n\nWho are the Shenzhou-20 Chinese astronauts?\n\nThe three Shenzhou-20 astronauts are Chen Dong, Chen Zhongrui and Wang Jie. Combined, the three men have amassed more than 800 days in space. They were scheduled to return to Earth on Nov. 5 after a six-month mission aboard the station.\n\nThis is the third Shenzhou mission for Commander Chen Dong.\n\nAfter the Shenzhou-20 vessel could not be repaired aboard Tiangong, safety protocols established the Shenzhou-21 as the return vessel for the Shenzhou-21 crew. A backup Shenzhou craft for the Shenzhou-21 crew, now more than a week into their six-month rotation, will be sent from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre.\n\nThe Shenzhou program takes Chinese astronauts to and from Tiangong for rotating six-month stays, where they perform a variety of tasks.\n\nHow big is the Tiangong space station?\n\nBoth Tiangong and the International Space Station orbit the Earth at the same general altitude. Tiangong’s orbit is 210 to 280 miles high, while the space station can range from 230 to 285 miles with reboosts.\n\nTiangong, which means \"Heavenly Palace,\" supports three astronauts, with room for three more during crew rotations.\n\nHow was the Chinese spacecraft damaged?\n\nSpace debris, usually old satellites and rocket fragments, moves at very high speeds. It can pose a risk to space stations, which are capable of performing avoidance maneuvers and other steps to protect equipment.\n\nThe Tiangong delay is the first time a return mission has been postponed by space debris, Reuters reported.\n\nIt comes more than a year after an ordeal involving the crew of the Boeing Starliner, who were stranded aboard the space station for 10 months. NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams returned safely to Earth on March 18.\n\n(This story has been updated with new information.)\n\nContributing: Eric Lagatta, George Petras and Ramon Padilla\n\nSOURCES Reuters, Agence-France Presse", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/02/27/how-does-mummification-work-what-happened-to-gene-hackman-wife-betsy/80732635007/", "title": "How does mummification work?

His 64-year-old wife, a classical pianist, was found in an open bathroom near a space heater, according to a search warrant released by Santa Fe police Thursday.\n\nHackman's body, next to his cane and a pair of sunglasses, and his wife's body were discovered around 1:45 p.m. Wednesday by two maintenance workers, according to the affidavit. One of the family's German shepherds was found dead 10 to 15 feet away from Arakawa; two other dogs were found alive and healthy inside the home.\n\nThe manner and cause of death of the Hollywood star and his wife have not yet been revealed; but a police have indicated that the couple had been dead \"at least a day,\" according to TMZ.\n\nA deputy observed Arakawa with \"body decomposition, bloating in her face\" and mummification of her hands and feet, with Hackman having the same signs of decomposition.\n\nAs the case unfolds, here's what to know about mummification and how it relates to the stages of decomposition of the human body.\n\nWhat is mummification? How does a body mummify?\n\nMummification results when the tissue of the human body begins to dry out (desiccation) and occurs when a corpse is in an environment that is \"hot and dry,\" according to a recently published medical report on postmortem changes.\n\nMummification is the point at which the decompositional process ceases — with another published medical report in the International Journal of Legal Medicine, indicating the development of mummification \"is considered to take weeks, if not months, and once mummification is reached, the body can be preserved in that state for an extended period of time.\"\n\nWhen mummified, the skin of the body becomes dark and dry and appears leathery, causing a \"parched\" appearance that preserves the corpse for a more extended period, the one medical report states. It can occur to the body as a whole, or can be localized to certain extremities, including the tongue.\n\nThere are five stages of decomposition following a human death, which involves various changes to the body over a period of time for different organs.\n\nGene Hackman death cause: How did Gene Hackman, wife die?\n\nThe manner and cause of death of Gene Hackman, his wife, Betsy Arakawa, and their dog has not yet been determined. Police have stated the couple's death warrants a thorough investigation, deeming it \"suspicious enough\" because the person who called 911 found the front door of the home unsecured and opened, a healthy dog running loose on the property and another healthy dog near the dead dog inside, records show.\n\nGene Hackman's daughter, Elizabeth Jean Hackman, told TMZ they believe carbon monoxide poisoning could be to blame; however, the fire department did not find signs of a gas leak, according to police records.\n\nLori Comstock is a New Jersey-based journalist with the Mid-Atlantic Connect Team.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/05/19/musk-starship-explosion-spacex/83642288007/", "title": "Elon Musk says Starship will launch again this week: Here's what ...", "text": "Updated May 19, 2025, 8:53 p.m. ET\n\nMusk hinted on Tuesday, May 13 that SpaceX could launch its Starship \"next week\" on its ninth flight test from the company's Starbase in South Texas.\n\nThe test would come after SpaceX just received key federal approval to ramp up testing of a vehicle due to play a massive part in future crewed missions to both the moon and Mars.\n\nThe vehicle has not exploded on every iteration. In three tests between June and November 2024, Starship flew halfway around the world before landing in the Indian Ocean.\n\nMore than two months have gone by since SpaceX last launched its massive Starship rocket on an ill-fated flight test that ended in the vehicle's second consecutive explosion.\n\nFor viewers watching a livestream of the March 6 launch from home, they may have felt a sense of Déjà vu as the vehicle came apart in the sky and a cascade of fiery debris rained down below. But for SpaceX, the mishap likely represented a significant setback as billionaire founder Elon Musk has sought to accelerate the Starship's development.\n\nFollowing the botched demonstration, both of Starship's test flights in 2025 have ended prematurely after the rocket's upper stage, where crew and cargo would be transported, lost power and broke apart midair.\n\nThat means as Musk and SpaceX now prepare for the Starship's ninth-ever flight test from South Texas, the stakes could not be higher.\n\nThe tech mogul no doubt hopes his commercial spaceflight company can get the Starship program back on track – especially after SpaceX just received key federal approval to ramp up testing of a vehicle due to play a massive part in future crewed missions to both the moon and Mars.\n\nHere's a look back at the first two Starship launches of 2025, as well as a brief look at how the vehicle has fared since its debut flight two years ago.\n\nSpaceX rocket launch: When is Starship flight 9?\n\nMusk hinted on Tuesday, May 13, that SpaceX could launch its Starship \"next week\" on its ninth flight test from the company's Starbase in Boca Chica near Brownsville, Texas.\n\nSpaceX hasn't officially announced a target launch date, and the Federal Aviation Administration hasn't yet issued a launch license.\n\nBut maritime warnings over the Gulf of Mexico, renamed by the U.S. government as the Gulf of America, suggest the launch is being targeted for Wednesday, May 21.\n\nWhat is the Starship?\n\nStarship, the world’s most powerful launch vehicle ever developed, is SpaceX's massive spacecraft composed of both a 232-foot Super Heavy rocket and the 171-foot upper stage vehicle.\n\nAt more than 400 total feet in height, Starship towers over SpaceX's famous Falcon 9 rocket – one of the world's most active – which stands at nearly 230 feet.\n\nSuper Heavy alone is powered by 33 of SpaceX’s Raptor engines. The upper section, also called Starship or Ship for short, is the upper stage powered by six Raptor engines that will ultimately travel in orbit.\n\nSpaceX is developing Starship to be a fully reusable transportation system, meaning both the rocket and vehicle can return to the ground for additional missions. In the years ahead, Starship is intended to carry both cargo and humans to Earth's orbit and deeper into the cosmos.\n\nNASA's lunar exploration plans, which appear to be in jeopardy under President Donald Trump's proposed budget, call for Artemis III astronauts aboard the Orion capsule to board the Starship while in orbit for a ride to the moon's surface.\n\nBut Musk is more preoccupied with Starship reaching Mars – potentially, he has claimed, by the end of 2026. Under his vision, human expeditions aboard the Starship could then follow in the years after the first uncrewed spacecraft reaches the Red Planet.\n\nWhat happened on last Starship test?\n\nThe first two Starship tests of 2025 have been marred by explosions.\n\nIn the most recent launch March 6, flight operators lost contact with the upper portion of Starship, which exploded less than 10 minutes into the flight, creating debris visible from Florida to the Caribbean.\n\nThe explosion occurred despite SpaceX assuring that what mission teams learned from the seventh flight prompted them to make several modifications to the vehicle. The company provided more information on the cause of the explosion hours after the flight, while the Federal Aviation Administration was performing a mishap investigation.\n\nDespite the failure of the Starship vehicle, the spacecraft's rocket booster has now managed to navigate back to the launch pad twice in a row. The maneuver, first completed in October 2024, involves SpaceX catching the booster with giant mechanical arms known as chopsticks.\n\nHaving the capability of catching the Starship booster is crucial for SpaceX, giving the company a completely reusable vehicle that is able to fly again.\n\nExplosion was second of 2025\n\nThe first Starship demonstration of the year on Jan. 16 also ended in a fiery explosion after the vehicle was lost during its suborbital flight.\n\nMission controllers lost contact with the spacecraft within 8 1/2 minutes of its flight before determining that it was destroyed in what the company called a “rapid unscheduled disassembly.” Video on social media showed the explosion and its aftermath as remains of the spacecraft were seen breaking up in what looked like a stunning meteor shower.\n\nSpaceX, which conducted an investigation with the FAA, determined that the mishap was due to a series of propellant leaks and fires in the aft section of the vehicle that caused “all but one of Starship’s engines to execute controlled shut down sequences.\" This led to the communication breakdown and the vehicle to trigger its own self destruction.\n\nWhen did SpaceX begin Starship flight tests?\n\nPrior to the January launch, SpaceX's fourth and final Starship flight test of 2024 unfolded in November in front of a newly-elected Trump. Just two test flights were completed a year prior, beginning with the maiden launch in April 2023.\n\nWhile the Starship has reached space, it has yet to reach Earth's orbit – instead traveling at a lower-altitude on a suborbital trajectory.\n\nThe vehicle has also not exploded on every iteration. In three tests between June and November 2024, Starship flew halfway around the world before reentering Earth's atmosphere and splashing down as planned in the Indian Ocean – critical proof that its basic design is functional.\n\nEric Lagatta is the Space Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

It will mark his first public appearance in a week.\n\nTrump’s unusual media absence sparked rumors that he had died just ahead of Labor Day weekend. “Trump is Dead” started to trend on social media platform X on Aug. 30, with around 160,000 posts made by Saturday morning.\n\nConspiracy theories surrounding the rumors began popping up on Saturday after photos circulated of Trump departing the White House that looked similar to photos from 2019. People speculated online that the photos had been digitally altered, while some even claimed the photo showed a body double of the president.\n\nWatch live: Donald Trump to make televised announcement amid health rumors\n\nTrump is now expected to announce the relocation of U.S. Space Command headquarters from Colorado to Alabama, according to media reports.\n\nThe move would reverse President Joe Biden’s decision to keep the command in Colorado, which has been the temporary headquarters since the military space program was established in 2019.\n\nWhile the announcement is big news on its own, online discourse will no doubt hone in on Trump’s appearance and medical condition following his weeklong media hiatus. Here’s how the “Trump is dead” rumors got started.\n\nTrump had not been seen in public since Tuesday\n\nIt’s no secret that Trump is a fan of the spotlight, and this isn’t the first time people have pointed out unusual spans of time when Trump hasn’t made public appearances.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, internet rumors swirled when Trump had been hospitalized after he contracted the virus. Speaking from the White House balcony, Trump spoke to hundreds of guests on Oct. 10, 2020, and assured them the novel virus was “disappearing.”\n\nCommenters at the time noticed that Trump appeared to be visibly weak while speaking.\n\n“This 8 second video destroys all attempts by @realDonaldTrump to downplay the virus because it shows him gasping for air. Many Americans are now visually seeing how the virus causes breathing difficulties & lung damage,” tweeted Congressman Ted Lieu at the time.\n\nJD Vance commented about being ready to take over if something happened to Trump\n\nOn Thursday, Aug. 28, an exclusive USA TODAY interview with JD Vance went viral after making comments about being ready to take over for Trump if anything should happen to the president.\n\n“I've gotten a lot of good on-the-job training over the last 200 days,” Vance said in an exclusive interview with USA TODAY on Aug. 27, when asked if he was ready to assume the role of commander in chief.\n\nVance’s comments didn’t quite come out of left field, however. The interview covered Trump’s health, which has become a common talking point as concerns over his health have increased in recent months.\n\nThe White House announced in July that Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common vein condition, after images taken of the president showed visible swelling in his lower legs.\n\n“But I feel very confident the president of the United States is in good shape, is going to serve out the remainder of his term and do great things for the American people,” Vance said.\n\n“And if, God forbid, there's a terrible tragedy, I can't think of better on-the-job training than what I've gotten over the last 200 days,” he added.\n\nConcerns about Trump’s health have risen dramatically\n\nThe rumors stem chiefly from concerns that Trump’s health is rapidly declining.\n\nLast year, Trump was spotted with bruising on his hand, which some say is a sign of cannula bruising, which is common when an IV is placed. Trump initially claimed that the bruises were from shaking so many hands.\n\nTrump was later photographed with swollen ankles, which doctors say can be a sign of heart failure. The White House has since come out and confirmed that he was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, which is when the leg veins don't allow blood to flow back up to the heart, causing it instead to flow backward, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n\nWhen is Trump's announcement today?\n\nAccording to the White House, Trump will be making an announcement at 2 p.m. on Tuesday, Sept. 2.\n\nWatch Trump's announcement today live\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated live video of the announcement.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/02"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/953358/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-2-july-2021", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 2 July 2021 | The Week", "text": "1.

It landed on a runway minutes later.\n\n“We made it to space!” Palermo said.\n\nThursday’s supersonic flight takes Virgin Galactic closer to turning the long-delayed dream of commercial space tourism into reality. The company aims to take paying customers on the six-passenger rocket, which is about the size of an executive jet. Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson has said he wants to be one of the first on board.\n\nBranson greeted the two pilots after the test, declaring “Space is Virgin territory!”\n\nVirgin Galactic considers 50 miles the boundary of space because that is the distance used by the U.S. Air Force and other U.S. agencies. That’s different from a long-held view that the boundary is at 62 miles. Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides noted that recent research favors the lower altitude.\n\nWhitesides said a review of the flight’s data will last into the new year, and there will be more test flights, some with company employees as passengers. He wouldn’t estimate when commercial passenger trips might begin.\n\n“This is a huge step forward and once we look at the data we’ll see what that pathway is,” he said.\n\nAt the start of the test flight, a special jet carrying the Virgin Space Ship Unity flew to an altitude near 43,000 feet before releasing the craft. The spaceship ignited its rocket engine and it quickly hurtled upward and out of sight of viewers on the ground. The spaceship reached Mach 2.9, nearly three times the speed of sound.\n\nThe two test pilots — Mark “Forger” Stucky and former NASA astronaut Rick “CJ” Sturckow — will be awarded commercial astronaut wings, said Federal Aviation Administration official Bailey Edwards.\n\n“It was a great flight and I can’t wait to do it again,” said Sturckow, who flew on the space shuttle four times.\n\nSpace tourism goals\n\nVirgin Galactic’s development of its spaceship took far longer than expected and endured a setback when the first experimental craft broke apart during a 2014 test flight, killing the co-pilot.\n\n“People have literally put their lives on the line to get us here,” Branson said. “This day is much for them as it is for all of us.”\n\nMore than 600 people have committed up to $250,000 for rides that include several minutes of weightlessness and a view of the Earth far below. The spaceship will also be used for research: NASA had science experiment on the test flight.\n\nThe endeavor began in 2004 when Branson announced the founding of Virgin Galactic in the heady days after the flights of SpaceShipOne, the first privately financed manned spacecraft that made three flights into space.\n\nFunded by the late billionaire Paul G. Allen and created by maverick aerospace designer Burt Rutan, SpaceShipOne won the $10 million Ansari X Prize. The prize was created to kick-start private development of rocket ships that would make spaceflight available to the public.\n\nWhen Branson licensed the SpaceShipOne technology, he envisioned a fleet carrying paying passengers by 2007, launching them from Spaceport America. The facility is adjacent to the White Sands Missile Range in the Jornada del Muerto desert basin, 45 miles north of Las Cruces.\n\nJason Lazich, Virgin Galactic's director of infrastructure and ground services, told the Sun-News earlier this month that the company's operations at the New Mexico spaceport would begin “once the test program is complete in Mojave.\"\n\nAt that point, activity at the spaceport may pick up considerably as its anchor tenant moves closer to its promise to provide commercial space flight.\n\nThe test flights, the setbacks\n\nThe promise has had significant setbacks. Three technicians were killed in 2007 by an explosion while testing a propellant system at Scaled Composites LLC, which built SpaceShipOne and was building the first SpaceShipTwo for Virgin Galactic.\n\nThen, in 2014, SpaceShipTwo broke apart during a test flight by Scaled Composites when the co-pilot prematurely unlocked its unique “feathering” braking system and it began to deploy. The co-pilot was killed but the injured pilot managed to survive a fall from high altitude with a parachute.\n\nDuring descent, the craft’s twin tails are designed to rotate upward to slow it down, then return to a normal flying configuration before the craft glides to a landing on a runway.\n\nNew versions of SpaceShipTwo are built by a Virgin Galactic sister company and flight testing is now in-house. Its previous test flight reached 32 miles.\n\nBranson isn’t alone in the space tourism business: Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is planning to take space tourists on trips, using the more traditional method of a capsule atop a rocket that blasts off from a launch pad. SpaceX’s Elon Musk recently announced plans to take a wealthy Japanese entrepreneur and his friends on a trip around the moon.\n\nREAD MORE:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/spaceport/2019/05/10/virgin-galactic-moving-all-operations-southern-new-mexico/1164724001/", "title": "Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic to move facilities to So. New Mexico", "text": "Morgan Lee\n\nAssociated Press\n\nUpdated May 10, 2019, 6:25 p.m. ET\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. – Billionaire Richard Branson is moving Virgin Galactic’s winged passenger rocket and more than 100 employees from California to a remote commercial launch and landing facility in southern New Mexico, bringing his space-tourism dream a step closer to reality.\n\nBranson said Friday at a news conference that Virgin Galactic’s development and testing program has advanced enough to make the move to the custom-tailored hangar and runway at the taxpayer-financed Spaceport America facility near the town of Truth or Consequences.\n\nVirgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides said a small number of flight tests are pending. He declined to set a specific deadline for the first commercial flight.\n\nAn interior cabin for the company’s space rocket is being tested, and pilots and engineers are among the employees relocating from California to New Mexico. The move to New Mexico puts the company in the “home stretch,” Whitesides said.\n\nThe manufacturing of the space vehicles by a sister enterprise, The Spaceship Company, will remain based in the community of Mojave, California.\n\nTaxpayers invested over $200 million in Spaceport America after Branson and then-Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat, pitched the plan for the facility, with Virgin Galactic as the anchor tenant.\n\nVirgin Galactic’s spaceship development has taken far longer than expected and had a major setback when the company’s first experimental craft broke apart during a 2014 test flight, killing the co-pilot.\n\nBranson thanked New Mexico politicians and residents for their patience over the past decade. He said he believes space tourism – once aloft – is likely to bring about profound change.\n\n“Our future success as a species rests on the planetary perspective,” Branson said. “The perspective that we know comes sharply into focus when that planet is viewed form the black sky of space.”\n\nBranson described a vision of hotels in space and a network of spaceports allowing supersonic, transcontinental travel anywhere on earth within a few hours. He indicated, however, that building financial viability comes first.\n\n“We need the financial impetus to be able to do all that,” he said. “If the space program is successful as I think … then the sky is the limit.”\n\nIn February, a new version of Virgin Galactic’s winged craft SpaceShipTwo soared at three times the speed of sound to an altitude of nearly 56 miles (99 kilometers) in a test flight over Southern California, as a crew member soaked in the experience.\n\nOn Friday, that crew member, Beth Moses, recounted her voyage into weightlessness and the visual spectacle of pitch-black space and the earth below.\n\n“Everything is silent and still and you can unstrap and float about the cabin,” she said. “Pictures do not do the view from space justice. … I will be able to see it forever.”\n\nThe company’s current spaceship doesn’t launch from the ground. It is carried under a special plane to an altitude of about 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) before detaching and igniting its rocket engine.\n\n“Release is like freefall at an amusement park, except it keeps going,” Moses said. “And then the rocket motor lights. Before you know it, you’re supersonic.”\n\nThe craft coasts to the top of its climb before gradually descending to earth, stabilized by “feathering” technology in which twin tails rotate upward to increase drag on the way to a runway landing.\n\nBranson previously has said he would like to make his first suborbital flight this year as one of the venture’s first passengers on the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing on July 20. But he made no mention of timelines on Friday.\n\nPressed on the timeframe, Whitesides said he anticipates the first commercial flight within a year.\n\nThree people with future space-flight reservations were in the audience.\n\n“They’ve been patient too,” Branson said. “Space is hard.”\n\nHundreds of potential customers have committed as much as $250,000 up front for rides in Virgin’s six-passenger rocket, which is about the size of an executive jet.\n\nSpace tourism has not been a complete novelty since millionaire U.S. engineer Dennis Tito in 2001 paid $20 million to join a Russian space mission to the International Space Station. Branson’s goal has been to “democratize” space by opening travel up to more and more people.\n\nThe endeavor began in 2004 when Branson announced the founding of Virgin Galactic in the heady days after the flights of SpaceShipOne, the first privately financed manned spacecraft that made three flights into space.\n\nSpace sector analyst Adam Jonas, a managing director of equity research at Morgan Stanley, said Branson’s venture could have an outsized impact in the age of social media on how the public visualizes space as a domain for scientific and commercial exploration.\n\n“You bring them back to earth and they explain what they saw – that’s a story, put through the velocity of social media, people want to hear,” he said. “Sometimes you need some distance to gain a perspective, seeing the earth from space, seeing how thin that layer of atmosphere is that protects us.”\n\nBranson’s plans have gradually advanced amid a broader surge in private investment in space technology with cost-saving innovations in reusable rockets and microsatellite technology.\n\nAmazon tycoon Jeff Bezos announced Thursday that his space company Blue Origin will send a robotic spaceship to the moon with aspirations for another ship that could bring people there along the same timeframe as NASA’s proposed 2024 return.

Blue Origin regularly launches it with scientific payloads and other cargo on board from paying customers, including NASA.\n\nBlue Origin's famed New Shepard launch vehicle is on the cusp of ferrying its next crew of celebrities and notable people to the edge of space, where its passengers will have a front-row seat of Earth from more than 60 miles high.\n\nThe commercial spaceflights are ones billionaire Jeff Bezos's space technology company has been offering since 2021, ever since the Amazon founder himself boarded the spacecraft for its maiden crewed voyage. The upcoming flight is also the first in nearly four years with veritable household names that this time includes pop artist Katy Perry and \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King.\n\nThe spacecraft that Perry, King and four other women are set to fly aboard as early as Monday morning is the same one that 52 others have ridden to space on 10 previous human spaceflights. Joining them is civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, filmmaker Kerianne Flynn and Lauren Sánchez, an Emmy-winning journalist and fiancé of Bezos.\n\nThe New Shepard, composed of both a rocket and crew capsule, will blast off at supersonic speeds after it lifts off from Blue Origin's private ranch facility in west Texas, taking the notable all-women crew high above Earth's atmosphere.\n\nFor nearly four years since its first crewed spaceflight, New Shepard has served as a poignant symbol of Blue Origin's commercial spaceflight ambitions amid a growing space tourism industry. Bezos' company is increasingly becoming a major player in the commercial space arena, competing with the likes of Elon Musk's SpaceX for NASA's business, as well as the business of other private companies.\n\nHere's everything to know about the New Shepard rocket that will be at the center of what is sure to be a headline-grabbing flight.\n\nBlue Origin launch: Gayle King, Katy Perry among crew of all women launching to space\n\nWhat is the New Shepard spacecraft?\n\nNamed after astronaut Alan Shepard, the first American in space, the gum drop-shaped New Shepard launch vehicle is designed to be fully reusable, with a capsule that returns to Earth via three parachutes. The rocket itself is powered by one BE-3PM engine, which propels it to suborbit before restarting to slow the booster to just 6 mph for a controlled landing back on the launch pad.\n\nThe spacecraft operates autonomously – meaning no pilots are aboard – after taking off from the company's Launch Site One in rural west Texas, more than 140 miles east of El Paso.\n\nBut New Shepard doesn't just take celebrities on joy rides to the edge of space. In fact the majority of spaceflights Blue Origin has conducted to date with New Shepard haven't even had a crew.\n\nBlue Origin has launched the New Shepard plenty of times with scientific payloads and other cargo on board from paying customers, including NASA.\n\nFor instance, in early February, New Shepard successfully simulated the moon's low gravity on board its capsule during a brief flight. On board was cargo belonging to NASA, which helped fund the mission as the U.S. space agency prepares to send humans back to the moon in the years ahead under its Artemis campaign.\n\nHow long will the crew be in space? Here's what happens on a Blue Origin spaceflight\n\nThe New Shepard's crew capsule can hold up to six people for a brief voyage above the Kármán Line – the 62-mile-high internationally recognized boundary of space.\n\nEach spaceflight lasts about 11 minutes from liftoff to capsule touchdown, allowing passengers to experience a few minutes of weightlessness while in microgravity. The capsule also comes outfitted with large windows for them to enjoy the stunning view of Earth.\n\nDuring each launch, the rocket reaches initial speeds exceeding 2,000 mph – much faster than the speed of sound – before the booster separates within a few minutes of takeoff. As the booster lands, firing its engines and using its fins to slow and control its descent, the capsule continues its journey for a few additional minutes.\n\nOnce the capsule makes a parachute-assisted landing in a remote area, a Blue Origin team is deployed to recover the spacecraft and pick up its passengers.\n\nWhen did Blue Origin begin New Shepard launches?\n\nBezos joined the spacecraft's first crewed flight in 2021 as part of the NS-16 mission, which came after New Shepard flew on 15 flights tests beginning in 2012.\n\nWith the vehicle's latest crewed flight Feb. 25, 10 of Blue Origin's 30 missions have now carried people to the edge of space. A total of 52 people have flown on the New Shepard, including four repeat passengers.\n\nHowever, the launch vehicle's spaceflights were paused for nearly two years when the rocket was grounded in September 2022 following a failed mission without a crew on board.\n\nDespite the mishap, Blue Origin officials have insisted that the capsule is designed to safely abort a spaceflight by ejecting from the rocket and deploying parachutes early if needed – as happened in 2022. The rocket itself crashed back to Earth during the flight with no reported injuries or damage.\n\nBlue Origin spaceflights with human aboard then resumed in May 2024 after the Federal Aviation Administration closed its investigation and ordered the company to make 21 corrective actions.\n\nWhat other notable people have flown on Blue Origin launches?\n\nPassengers on Blue Origin's New Shepard have hailed from a variety of backgrounds, and have included tech executives, entrepreneurs, scientists and even a few well-known celebrities.\n\nIn 2021, both \"Star Trek\" actor William Shatner and NFL legend Michael Strahan boarded the New Shepard on separate flights.\n\nShatner, who was 90 at the time, embarked on his voyage Oct. 13 that year, becoming the oldest person to ever make a spaceflight. He was joined by former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, a Blue Origin vice president Audrey Powers and entrepreneur Glen de Vries.\n\nWhen the crew safely landed back on Earth several minutes later, Shatner could be heard saying the experience was \"unlike anything they described.\"\n\nStrahan's spaceflight then came toward the end of 2021 on Dec. 11, when he flew with a crew that included Laura Shepard Churchley, Alan Shepard's daughter. Also on the flight were tech CEO Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, venture capitalist Lane Bess and his child, Cameron Bess.\n\nAfter the flight, Strahan took to Instagram to say \"it was surreal.\"\n\nBlue Origin also developing massive New Glenn rocket\n\nBlue Origin also is developing its massive New Glenn rocket, which launched in January on its maiden flight.\n\nThe 320-foot-tall heavy-lift launch vehicle, which launched without a crew on Jan. 16 from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, is meant to challenge SpaceX in regularly deploying satellites and other cargo into orbit.\n\nNamed after John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, New Glenn rivals SpaceX's 400-foot Starship in size. Its first stage, powered by seven Blue Origin engines known as BE-4, is designed to be reusable for 25 missions.\n\n(This story has been updated to correct a misspelling/typo.)\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Of all of BEven then, Kinsley was in the middle of plans to build a new visitor's center at Gettysburg (Pa.) National Park. Q&A on new Gettysburg visitor center, old Electric Map, Thousands discover formerly unheralded Howard Tunnel and Glatfelter, Farquhar, Shipley: Insights from local greats.\n\nSeveral years ago, prominent York businessman John Schmidt told me at least one reason for builder Bob Kinsley's success. \"He just gets up a little earlier than the rest of us,\" Schmidt said. That goes a bit in providing insight to the man behind the question: Who is Bob Kinsley, the \"private\" side of the private-public venture that has constructed the new Gettysburg Visitors Center and Museum? ... . A long profile, appearing in the York Daily Record in 1998, provides the most detailed public piece on this prominent regional builder: Building on successKinsley's ChargeHe started 40 years ago with a pickup and a tractor. Today, he's playing to a national audience with his Gettysburg plan.\n\nRobert A. Kinsley has just toured the 1 million-square-foot distribution center his construction company is erecting in West Manchester Township for Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.In its 38 years, Kinsley's company has never built anything this big. It's believed to be the largest structure ever built at one time in York County. It could hold more than 20 football fields. A walk around its perimeter is a one-mile journey.A veritable concrete jungle has grown up on what had been farmland near J.E. Baker Co. The building has required so much concrete for its foundation, wall panels and dock aprons that Kinsley set up a temporary plant to make it on site.Yet leaving the site, as a passenger in his black BMW sedan, Kinsley discusses none of those facts with his driver and executive secretary, Neida Lau. A man who says \"green is soothing,\" Kinsley instead ponders the fate of 2,600 evergreens that have to be cleared from a utility right-of-way.\"Why don't we give Christmas trees for Christmas . . . ?\" he says rhetorically. The trees - with roots intact - will be offered to employees free for the taking or planted on Kinsley properties.And so Kinsley balances the seemingly warring roles of builder - he doesn't like the term developer - and preservationist.He operates a construction company with annual sales of $155 million and has under his control more undeveloped, industrially zoned land than anybody in York County.But he's a founding member of the Farm and Natural Lands Trust of York County. He wants to place with the trust his nearly 1,000-acre South Branch Farms in York Township, guaranteeing it will remain farmland in exchange for a tax credit. Kinsley would still own the farm, which grows crops and breeds Black Angus cattle.The easement would be the largest since the trust began in 1990 and would increase its protected acreage by 50 percent.Kinsley decries what big-box retailers have done to downtowns, but he leases suburban buildings to Wal-Mart, Lowe's and Giant Food Stores.One observer who admires Kinsley calls him a \"bundle of contradictions.\" Kinsley sees it differently.\"Buildings don't necessarily ruin the landscape,\" he says. \"And development has to happen unless we're going to stop growth in our population.\" But growth, he says, has to be contained, whether it's in York County or Lancaster County or Steamboat Springs, Colo., where he owns a cattle ranch with Donald Graham, the founder of Graham Packaging Co.During the past two years, Kinsley embarked on his most challenging project yet: a new visitors center and museum at Gettysburg National Military Park.While years from completion, that project already has elevated Kinsley from the regional scene - his company has offices in York Township and Baltimore - to the national stage. Indeed, these are heady days for Kinsley, whose improbable success began nearly 40 years ago with a used pickup and tractor.The early yearsKinsley, 58, grew up the middle of five children, the others all girls. His mother, whom her children call Molly, will turn 86 on Dec. 12. In 1929, she immigrated to New York, with her family, from east London.A self-taught artist, she worked for McCall's magazine in New York. On a trip to visit her aunt and uncle in Philadelphia, she met Kinsley's father, also named Robert Kinsley.The elder Robert Kinsley, who had attended the University of Pennsylvania, sold hardware to stores in southcentral Pennsylvania. The family moved to Wrightsville and, two stops later, a modest farm in York Township near the south branch of the Codorus Creek.Kinsley's father later sold kitchens for the Wolf Supply Co., now the Wolf Organization. Wolf Supply sponsored an annual home building show at the Valencia Ballroom in York. The younger Kinsley helped out at the show, passing out literature and operating a miniature train among the displays.His father suffered from depression and divorced Molly. He died about two years ago in Maryland.Molly played the more significant role in shaping her children's lives. She held on to the farm, raising her children while designing fashion advertisements for department stores, cigar labels and potato chip bags and illustrating children's books.She taught Kinsley how to knit and sew buttons and helped him build a stone wall on the farm.Her advice to her children: \" 'You stick to it until it's finished.' \"Around age 16, Kinsley accompanied Molly on one of her trips to see an agent in New York. She admired a Welsh cabinet in a store window. On their return, Kinsley built one for her that she still has.\"He looked at it the other day,\" she says, \"and said, 'It's kind of amateurish, isn't it?' \"Kinsley grew up around horses and began riding around age 6 or 7, he says. He taught himself woodworking, and his earliest projects included boxes for holding riding equipment.His father owned a backhoe, which Kinsley learned to operate. He graduated in 1958 from William Penn High School and worked for a small building contractor. One day, C. Joseph Deller, a Dallastown contractor, told Kinsley he needed a backhoe operator. Kinsley accepted the offer.The next summer, with a 1940 Chevy pickup and a 1947 Ford tractor, Kinsley left Deller and started a lawn grading business. C. Joseph \"Bud\" Deller Jr. was Kinsley's partner for several years before leaving for military service.In 1960, Kinsley attended the wedding of the elder Deller's daughter. One of her bridesmaids was Anne Whelan, whom Kinsley began dating and married in the midst of a blizzard the following January. They originally planned a spring wedding but moved the date up so it wouldn't interfere with Kinsley's busy season.He attended York Junior College, now York College, from 1958 to 1960 without earning a degree. He moved on to the University of Baltimore but stopped taking classes when juggling school and work became too much.Money was tight in those days, when earning $4,000 per year was good money, he says. Anne Kinsley, a legal secretary at the time, would type a bill as soon as Kinsley completed a job, and he would hand deliver it.One time, a check accidentally wound up in the trash, in the days when trash was burned. The young couple salvaged the pieces that weren't charred; the customer wrote a new check.\"But in those days,\" Anne Kinsley says, \"you couldn't afford to lose one check.\"The Kinsleys bought Molly's converted 1880 bank barn and 13 acres, where they raised their five children. They range in age from 28 to 36 and all work in the family business. (Molly has continued to live with them.)Rob, the youngest, was the longest shot to join his brothers. An anthropology major, he continued his education at the University of Pennsylvania, where last year he received a master's degree in architecture. He subsequently joined LSC Design Inc., a Kinsley-owned architectural and engineering firm.Kinsley on having his sons involved:\"It makes owning a business a lot more fun because you see your family and your children grow into - how would I say - formed, thinking individuals. We expect them to carry their share of the load (and be) contributing members of the team, and they certainly are.\"He allows that it's \"scary,\" as well, having so much family working together. It's as though he has five partners, he says, and they seek his counsel, increasing demands on his time when his company is \"growing tremendously.\" Anne Kinsley says her sons work well together because each fills his own niche.\"I saw them grow up,\" she says, \"and to see how well they get along now, it's amazing to me.\"Tim Kinsley, 33, graduated with a construction management degree from Colorado State University and joined the business. He works in the area of property management.As a boss, he says, his father is \"firm but fair.\"\"He allows you to learn from your mistakes,\" he says. \"Doesn't beat you on the head with them. But he doesn't allow you to make them over and over.\"Patrick Kinsley, the oldest son, says his first job was working in a sewer trench. An engineer, he worked for C.S. Davidson Co., a York engineering firm, for five years before joining the family business. Today, he is president of LSC Design.He marvels at his father's ability to \"cut through the extraneous\" and improvise. They recently spent part of a Sunday repairing a fence together. The job would have taken a normal crew a full day, he says, but it took them only two hours.Robert and Anne Kinsley still live in the original barn, while their five married sons live within two miles among nine contiguous farms that make up South Branch.Kinsley has remodeled his home so often that it has become a bit of a family joke. For five straight years when his family was young, he says, he worked all weekend remodeling. Most of his original millwork remains - \"sacred and not touched\" - as a reminder.\"I think he constantly re-creates his environment that he lives in,\" Tim Kinsley says. \"Just keeps that spirit going. I think it's also an effect of never being satisfied.\"Kinsley agrees with that assessment. He describes his home as \"rustic with a colonial flavor.\" It contains original chestnut beams, antiques from various periods and exposed stone walls. It's also next to Kinsley's offices on Water Street.The Galloping GroomerIt's from this address that Kinsley has built his mini-empire, on the strength of factories and warehouses, office buildings and strip malls. His ubiquitous red trucks increasingly are seen on road projects for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.He followed no master plan; he says his plan was to survive. His company really arrived in the mid-1980s, having solidified its place as an industrial builder, he says. That milestone coincided with the demise of R.S. Noonan Inc., a York general contractor that dated to 1935 and was the Kinsley of its era.Ever mindful of opportunity, Kinsley through the years has owned - and later sold - parts of a portable toilet business, York Waste Disposal and an auto dealership in Elizabethtown, Lancaster County.The walls of his office are covered with pine boards. He collects old kerosene lanterns, a dozen of which are on display. The base of the lamp on his desk is an old cognac bottle. Scenes of wildlife, cattlemen and Indians hang in pictures on walls, along with honors from the Boy Scouts and York College.His office usually contains more dogs (one or more) than computers (zero). Kinsley likes to say that he's the only chief executive who has a tin of dog biscuits on his desk. He picked up his black and tan dog, a mutt named Henrietta, as a stray at a job site.Dogs are so abundant among the Kinsleys that the Galloping Groomer truck calls on the office regularly. Scratches on the office's front door are a testament to canine comings and goings.Kinsley works 60 to 80 hours per week, dividing his time into thirds: his construction company, other parts of his business and community efforts, including Gettysburg.His work days start at 6 a.m. and typically last well into the evening. In the summer, he likes to leave the office and ride some of his 27 horses and ponies. In the winter, when it's dark early, he figures he might as well keep working.Kinsley says his management style is one of \"walking around.\" He wears a watch but says he never checks the time. He rarely watches television. His mind sometimes works faster than his mouth or pen do, resulting in incomplete thoughts and sentences, his wife says.He recalls a time-saving trick Molly taught him in his youth: Iron a shirt's collar and cuffs and wear a sweater over it. Today, someone else presses his trademark white oxford shirts, but Kinsley sets out his clothes the night before in the interest of time.He devised a system of color-coded files that direct him through each week's activities, starting with green on Monday and concluding with red on Friday.Standing no more than 5-foot-7, Kinsley walks as though trying to complete a roof before the onset of winter.\"The man literally runs. He doesn't walk. He trots,\" says Bob Baker, a former Kinsley executive. He left in 1996 to become president of Hanover Lantern Inc., a maker of upscale lighting fixtures.Kinsley is a tough taskmaster, he says, always asking what's next. It drives the organization, Baker says, adding that he operates Hanover Lantern in similar fashion. Kinsley, he says, will \"run people into the ground at times. Not intentionally, but this is a guy running 100 miles an hour.\"Kinsley says he learns by traveling, and barber shops offer the best place to learn about a new town. He jots down names he can use for streets in new developments. In October, he testified on behalf of a proposed \"business improvement district\" in downtown York - its focus is on serving visitors - by relating recent travel experiences in Montreal and Helsinki.He spends his limited free time riding horses and mowing riding paths on his farm. He fox hunts, fly fishes and skis, the latter sometimes on mountains accessible only with a helicopter.\"There's no repetition in the outdoors,\" he says, marveling at how trees can lose 5 percent to 10 percent of their foliage in a single fall night. One day he's on his farm watching a rabbit, another day a duck.\"Ever watch a turtle?\" he asks seriously.A cowboy at heart, he reads the western fiction of Louis L'Amour. Sometimes he's disappointed to pick up a L'Amour book at an airport, only to realize that it's one he already has read bearing an updated cover.On a hunt\"I really don't have a job,\" Kinsley says. \"Business is kind of a sport.\"Retired accountant Bill Carter, whom Kinsley calls one of his few confidants, offers a similar analogy.\"He's like a hunter on a hunt,\" says Carter, who also is a Kinsley business partner. \"And these deals he gets involved in, it's a thrilling experience.\"Kinsley's company has earned a reputation for completing projects on time - and sometimes going to great lengths to do so.Hanover businessman Terry Hormel met Kinsley at a crucial point in 1989. Drug company SmithKline Beecham needed a custom building for distribution, and it needed it in six months. Hormel's group acquired the lots in Penn Township Industrial Park in the third week of February 1990; Kinsley delivered the 130,000-square-foot building that June.Kinsley's hustle paid off last year with the Goodyear deal, on which Hormel again partnered. Goodyear walked away from the settlement table when Kinsley was in London, on his way to a fishing trip in Russia.He turned around, boarded the Concorde supersonic jet and landed in New York. He returned to York County in his private plane and negotiated a compromise. He was back on the Concorde within 16 hours.Kinsley's companies - some of them partnerships - employ 900 people. The companies are vertically integrated.A transaction might look like this: Kinsley Equities buys land, LSC surveys it and designs a building, and Kinsley Construction builds it with steel from Kinsley Fabrication and help from Kinsley-owned Walton & Co., a mechanical contractor, or I.B. Abel or Gettle, both electrical contractors.Kinsley says such control gives his company an advantage in managing quality, schedules and prices. Seventy-five percent of the company's business is from repeat customers.His land holdings give him another competitive edge. He says he buys in \"strategic locations\" - along well-traveled roads such as Interstate 83 and Route 30 - because the land feeds his business. He likens it to a company such as paper maker P.H. Glatfelter Co., which owns forests.By controlling land, he says, he was ready when Goodyear came looking. And it helped when Starbucks Coffee Co. knew that Kinsley's Orchard Business Park in East Manchester Township was under way.\"I'd rather have real estate\" than stocks, Kinsley says during a lunchtime meeting with development partners from Maryland. \"It's always there. And they're not making any more of it.\"Kinsley says he doesn't know how much land he controls.\"I never added it up,\" he says.There's no question that he has a big head start over newer competitors such as Wagman Development Inc., a family- owned subsidiary of Wagman Construction Inc., Manchester Township.Joe Wagman, president of Wagman Development, says his company has 250 industrially zoned acres available and wants to be an alternative to Kinsley. Yet Kinsley even owns lots in Wagman-owned Farmbrook Industrial Park, just west of Exit 11 on Interstate 83. His crews are building Manchester Township's new offices.Kinsley's presence in his park is an apparent sore point with Wagman, who declines comment on the subject. But asked about the rivalry with Kinsley, Wagman notes that he serves on community and service groups with Kinsley and two of his sons.\"I frankly wish they were less likable,\" he jokes.A contradictionTwo years ago, the Daily Record and Better York Inc. published \"The Rusk Report,\" which described the problem of urban sprawl in York County. From 1960 to 1992, the report said, the county lost 30 percent of its farmland to sprawl. In the past 20 years, the report said, more land was developed than in the previous 200 years.Kinsley sits on the Better York board and endorses the Rusk Report. He says the way development occurs has to change through government mandates or economic incentives. He says he would have \"no problem\" if every building permit included a fee for land preservation.Yet with all of his building projects, Kinsley has contributed to - and benefited from - sprawl. More development means more road congestion, which results in projects such as the recent widening of Route 30. Kinsley won that job.\"He develops the land, which creates the problem, which he solves,\" says John Luciani, president of First Capital Engineering Inc., York, and formerly with LSC Design. \"And he profits. So be it.\"And the economy benefits from added tax base and new jobs. Just this week, Friendly Ice Cream Corp., Wilbraham, Mass., announced plans to build an 86,000-square-foot distribution center in Kinsley's Orchard Business Park, East Manchester Township. It will create 100 jobs.The adage that it takes money to make money could be amended for Kinsley: It also takes money to preserve buildings and land. Sprawl has benefited him financially, but he has spent vast sums of that money on preservation.\"I guess if I had my druthers I'd only preserve land, but I know I have to eat,\" he says. \"So I do my bit.\"RestorationThrough the years, he has added to the 13 acres he bought from his mother. His South Branch Farms totals about 1,000 acres. He says a contribution of the land to the Farm and Natural Lands Trust is \"highly probable and being considered.\"He develops land that already is zoned industrial or commercial, but he won't ask a municipality to rezone farmland for development, he says. He also won't buy land that doesn't have utilities already within reach.While tending to business in the suburbs, Kinsley hasn't neglected the city. In fact, it's arguable that other than Louis J. Appell Jr. and his Susquehanna Pfaltzgraff Co., nobody has done more for restoring downtown properties than Kinsley has.He has restored what are now the Codorus & Co. office building and Foundry Apartments, both next to Codorus Creek, and turned the former Tassia's grocery at 156 N. George St. into the home of his LSC Design. (LSC needs additional space and plans to move next year to Kinsley property at 1110 E. Princess St., York, Kinsley says. He plans to find a new tenant for the former Tassia's.)He owns the Valencia Ballroom, 142 N. George St., where he used to operate the miniature train. In the late 1980s, The Dutch Club hired him to make $1.2 million in renovations, but ultimately couldn't pay him. He acquired the property at sheriff's sale.Now, next to LSC and the Valencia, he's converting the former Fox's Bread bakery at 212 N. George St. into a 30,000-square-foot office building. He owns that building as well.He says neglected historic buildings in York \"make you sick,\" and maintains that current neighborhood revitalization efforts are too scattershot. Entire blocks have to be targeted, he says, if the efforts are to succeed.Kinsley laments that some of his own residential developments are like ghost towns during the day. Children come home from school and are unsupervised until their parents return, he says. That's why he believes in home-based businesses and neighborhood schools.He points to his Spring Forge development along Route 116 in Spring Grove as a planning success. Residents there can walk or ride a bike to a nearby shopping center that he owns with partners. He donated land for the Spring Grove library.The tension between development and preservation isn't lost on family members. Kinsley's sister Elizabeth Ricklefs is a veterinarian and owner of Leader Heights Animal Hospital in York Township. She says she has long wanted to discuss the issue over lunch with Kinsley but hasn't.She says she has \"mixed emotions because I have a really hard time seeing all the development go on. And Bob's a developer.\"She once asked Jeff Snyder, president of the Farm and Natural Lands Trust, if he was bothered having Kinsley on his group's board. ( Kinsley no longer serves on the board, but his son Chris and sister Anne Wagner do.) Snyder said development was bound to occur, and that Kinsley would do it right.Ricklefs said her initial reaction to the Gettysburg project wasn't favorable. She eventually came around.\" Bob doesn't do anything ticky-tacky,\" she says.On to GettysburgTo Kinsley, Robert Monahan Jr.'s plans for Gettysburg National Military Park fell into the realm of ticky-tacky.Monahan, a Gettysburg developer, first broached the subject of a new museum with the park service in 1994. Monahan wanted to build on the so-called Fantasyland site, which is next to the property Kinsley ultimately proposed. Unlike Kinsley's tract, Fantasyland is owned by the park service.Monahan is a partner with Kinsley in the Hanover Hampton Inn, and the two have been involved together in retail projects along Hanover's \"Golden Mile,\" Eisenhower Drive. Monahan says he sug- gested to Kinsley that he might want to consider the Gettysburg project but that Kinsley wasn't interested.When Monahan's proposal met with public objections, the park service put the project out to bid. Monahan came back with bigger plans for private ground in the southeast intersection of routes 30 and 15.Monahan calls it an \"American heritage campus with educational entertainment,\" including a wide-screen IMAX theater, motion simulators and virtual reality. Monahan says he's \"severely disappointed\" that Kinsley submitted a pro posal without mentioning anything to him.Though passed up by the park service, Monahan says he's moving ahead with his project.Kinsley says he initially thought the Gettysburg visitor center would be a \"big headache.\" Prompted by some local figures, he says, he got involved because he didn't want his grandchildren to learn about the Civil War \"in a theme-park environment.\"Kinsley says Monahan should have stuck with the Fantasyland site rather than the one at routes 30 and 15. \"To me,\" Kinsley says of the latter proposal, \"it would have been like putting the museum in the parking lot of the Galleria.\"The park service, which picked Kinsley over Monahan and two other finalists, sees the public-private venture at Gettysburg as the wave of the future given scant financial support from Congress.The new building would allow for battlefield restoration and the protection of artifacts. Yet critics suggest that Kinsley is in the $39 million project for the money, and they worry what the development would do to everything from traffic and retail to bog turtles and woodlands.Kinsley concedes that all of the criticism surprised him. The project has occupied far more of his time than he ever imagined. Despite the frustrations, Kinsley vows to see this through, easily another five years on top of the two years he already has invested.He says he won't make any money on the venture. He is scheduled to make a final payment on the $2.75 million land purchase in early January. A nonprofit foundation formed by Kinsley to oversee the project would reimburse him for the land cost if the project moves ahead.If not, says Barbara Sardella, Kinsley's general counsel, \" Bob's going to be left with some very expensive farmland.\"Delayed rewardsBaker, the former Kinsley executive, says Kinsley will make money and raise the profile of his company nationally. \"It's all about getting projects and making money,\" he says.He refers to what he calls \"a little Gettysburg\" in Hanover: the Eichelberger Performing Arts Center. Kinsley won that job to convert the former Eichelberger School. Baker says it served as a further entree for Kinsley into the Hanover community and increased his potential for winning other contracts.Kinsley says his company \"couldn't survive on Eichelbergers,\" meaning that it needs the higher profits that come with new construction. But an Eichelberger project, he says, \"might be resume building.\"He sees Gettysburg in a similar light. \"Our reward,\" he says, \"will come later on another job.\" Although Kinsley has criticized the makeup of Monahan's Gettysburg project, his own plans have changed considerably amid public clamor about the potential harm to existing Gettysburg businesses.In his winning proposal, Kinsley described a \"small retail mall\" that would have accommodated a book store, National Geographic store, arts and crafts gallery, gift shop and restrooms. The proposal also described a \"food court or cafeteria and upscale casual restaurant.\"Kinsley suggests that the interpretation of \"mall\" was different from his in tended use of the word.\"What it really meant was a place for people to walk,\" he says.Originally, he says, he thought the project would require more revenue-producing space to support its cost. However, subsequent indications are that more money can be raised from the public than originally thought, requiring less debt service. As a result, commercial elements have been scaled back and the amount of museum space increased.Kinsley says his first choice was to build in Gettysburg's downtown and possibly incorporate the railroad, which delivered Abraham Lincoln for his Gettysburg Address in 1863. He says he couldn't find a big enough site.Instead, he settled on a 45-acre tract south of Hunt Avenue. According to Kinsley and the park service, that undeveloped land saw no combat during the Battle of Gettysburg. The existing visitors center and museum and the Cyclorama Building are where the Confederates' ill-fated Pickett's Charge occurred.Those buildings would be razed - for battlefield restoration - if a new visitors center is built. Their contents would be transferred to the new space. Kinsley and the park service hope to sign a binding agreement early next year.Early motivationKinsley says he first visited Gettysburg when he was in the eighth grade. His favorite school subjects were history, geography and civics.He wants the new visitors center and museum to enhance the Gettysburg experience. He wants it to address how the battle affected the town of 2,700 people. It's important that tourists see, he says, how the blacksmith or parson or attorney lived the day before the battle.What about soldiers' families back home? he wonders.\"Just think about the hardship of the people, the women, who were back there running the show,\" he says, calling to mind his own mother's predicament after her marriage ended.Kinsley wants his company to serve as general contractor, though that's a decision the foundation's board will make, he says.Meanwhile, Kinsley says he is busy interviewing architects, fund-raising firms and historians so that the foundation may move swiftly once the agreement with the park service is in place.The building's interior will be designed, he says, \"then we'll put a dress on this form.\" The exterior will be of stone and other natural materials, he says, and will be \"solid, timeless\" so as not to detract from the battle's importance.Kinsley recently reread the book \"Killer Angels,\" which was the basis for the movie \"Gettysburg.\" He has seen the movie two or three times. He has visited other museums and institutions to gather ideas. His visitors center, he says, will \"be on par\" with the Smithsonian Institution.He says it will have to be reverent. He conjures a powerful image from his visit to the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., that of a pile of shoes from victims of a concentration camp. That image, he says, leaves visitors with a feeling of disbelief that anything so horrible could have happened.Anne Kinsley says her husband knew he would have to find projects such as Gettysburg that would challenge him while allowing their sons room to grow into the business.What's clear is that Kinsley won't retire if he can help it. When they were younger, Anne Kinsley says, he would look at retirees and imagine jobs for them. Maybe, she says, he will slow down in another 10 years.\"What slow down means to him,\" she says, \"I'm not sure.\"Anne and Bob Kinsley were awarded the Cornerstone Award by Lutheran Social Services in 2005.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2008/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/07/21/hyperloop-race-gets-crowded-new-entrant-arrivo-and-maybe-musk/497630001/", "title": "Hyperloop race gets crowded with new entrant Arrivo and maybe Musk", "text": "Updated July 21, 2017, 2:40 p.m. ET\n\nLOS ANGELES — Ever since billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk presented a white paper in 2012 laying out the idea for a high-speed transportation system called hyperloop, there’s been a lot of hyper-talk.\n\nLittle surprise. Stuffing humans and freight into slick pods that ride inside vacuum-sealed tubes at 700 mph sounded more like a design brief for the next Blade Runner movie than a realistic way to move around the planet.\n\nMusk got folks buzzing again Thursday, when he blasted out a vague tweet saying he had received “verbal govt approval” for his Boring Company to start drilling tunnels under northeastern states for the purpose of installing a hyperloop system that could whisk passengers from New York to Washington, D.C., in 29 minutes.\n\nThe Telsa and SpaceX CEO had expressed disinterest in building a company around his hyperloop idea, giving Hyperloop One co-founder Shervin Pishevar his blessing to pursue the mission and limiting his involvement to sponsoring a contest for amateur hyperloop-interested scientists.\n\nBut The Boring Company released a statement following Musk's tweets saying its talks with officials should lead to breaking ground on a tunnel \"later this year.\" If Musk truly is considering starting a new company to build a hyperloop, his track record with Tesla and SpaceX signals a major shake-up among the small group of start-ups that are getting closer to building these futuristic transportation platforms.\n\nAfter a few years of much breathless conjecture and even an internecine lawsuit at one company that was fit for reality TV, hyperloop now seems to be approaching the next station: building and selling it.\n\n“All the tech and engineering work our team is doing today is to show how hyperloop as a concept can be commercially viable, so we don’t have to sell the value of it based on the public good or boosting GDP growth in that region,” says Brogan BamBrogan, who, with a legal scrap with Hyperloop One in his rearview mirror, recently started a competing company here called Arrivo.\n\n“I spent a lot of years at SpaceX working for a bold vision with amazing people,” the engineer told USA TODAY in an interview at Arrivo's headquarters, a large warehouse with room for expansion. “But I thought it was time to turn that knowledge back towards earth, where there a lot of problems to be solved, including transportation.”\n\nAll three main hyperloop companies — Hyperloop One, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT), and newly minted Arrivo — are in a race to prove that tube-based mobility is to the 21st century what the locomotive was to the 19th, a potent promise of cheaper, faster, safer.\n\nBut they’re on a time-sensitive search for deep-pocketed individuals, states or nation-states eager to be first to take a gamble on the transportation option of the future and to reap the commensurate financial rewards.\n\nA hyperloop 'within five years'\n\nEach of these hyperloop companies currently is forging ahead with tests and trying to secure partnerships, and they promise that anyone with at least a decade to live may well have the opportunity to enjoy the high-speed horizontal elevator ride that is hyperloop.\n\n“Will this happen within my lifetime? Well, I think it’s within five years, and I certainly hope to live that long,” BamBrogan says with a laugh.\n\n“My estimate is three years,” says Dirk Ahlborn, CEO of HTT, a global consortium of engineers collaborating via the Web and paid in equity. He says the company hopes to have a full-scale hyperloop capsule ready to test in a year, but the rest of the time will be dedicated to “dealing with the regulations and political hurdles we are facing continuously.”\n\nHyperloop One head of engineering Josh Giegel says his conversations over the past few years with various Department of Transporation officials have been “positive overall. They were thinking this would be feasible by 2025, but the more we talk to them, they see this could happen sooner.”\n\nBut skepticism about the technology’s viability remains high. Chief hurdles include infrastructure questions (if above ground, how to buy the land? If below, how fast can one tunnel?), safety concerns (traveling at the speed of sound, getting stuck in a tube during a breakdown) and perhaps most significantly, profitability.\n\nA few years ago, Musk published notes indicating that a hyperloop system in California would cost around $7 billion, or far less than the state’s mired high-speed rail project that could push $70 billion. But how much passengers might pay for the swift ride remains to be seen.\n\n“I’m not sure this meets the cost-benefit analysis test yet,” says Hani Mahmassani, director of Northwestern University’s Transportation Center. “It’s a long stretch from a 5-mile test track to a 600-mile deployment, so it’ll be interesting to see if hyperloop makes it to the next level on the investment level.”\n\nMahmassani adds that real-world conditions, which could include soil imperfections and instability that could ultimately compromise the seal of a vacuum tube, could also threaten to derail a large-scale hyperloop project. “There will be uncertainties in building a larger version,” he says.\n\nHyperloop company leaders all say that the science behind hyperloop won’t be the stumbling block.\n\nTo simply the science: Copper coils embedded in stretches of a track serve to both magnetically levitate as well as propel hyperloop pods inside their vacuum-sealed tubes, creating a frictionless environment that sees the pods race along on momentum much the way an air hockey puck floats on a cushion of air.\n\nAs technological tests continue, the remaining hurdle is by the far the biggest: How to get a city, country or investors to plunk down the billions required for the project, which critically includes payments to a hyperloop team for its expertise before its company’s funding runs dry.\n\nIntrigued parties from UAE to France\n\nHyperloop One, a start-up that has raised some $150 million in funding, recently revealed that in May its engineers had succeeded in getting a prototype up to 70 mph in a 500-meter tube, and that 250 mph is the company’s the next milestone.\n\nIt continues to tout a variety of feasibility studies and agreements inked with municipal officials in Europe and the Middle East, including landing $50 million in investment from DP World to explore ways to bring cargo ashore from freighters using underwater tubes.\n\nEngineering team lead Giegel says the appeal for countries such as Dubai include “being able to skip a generation of transportation technology, say trains, and move right to hyperloop to showcase the newest in tech.”\n\nHyperloop Transportation Technologies, has, much like Hyperloop One, a number of feasibility studies in the works around the globe with a specific focus on passenger transportation solutions.\n\nCEO Ahlborn reels off a long list of hyperloop studies partnerships in countries that include the Czech Republic, Indonesia, UAE and France. He says that HTT’s collaborative approach that leverages essentially volunteer engineering talent keeps the operation’s expenses down, which means less of a race against a burn-rate clock.\n\n“Overall though I welcome the competition, because if one of us succeeds it helps everyone,” he says. “What’s difficult here isn’t the tech, it’s really not hard to get the capsule moving in the tube. The real challenge is to help create new regulations that can make this a reality.”\n\nAnd then there’s the new entry in the hyperloop sweepstakes, Arrivo, the brainchild of former Hyperloop One CTO BamBrogan who last year settled a lawsuit with his former employer. He claimed harassment, including the threat of a noose left on his desk; they claimed the onetime SpaceX engineer was plotting to start his own hyperloop company.\n\nA few dozen engineers crowd the open-plan office space, which has labels on the walls indicating where future tests will be conducted on various aspects of hyperloop technology.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual, befitting the air of the boss who sports a white T-shirt with the phrase, \"Thanks for nothing.\" Says BamBrogan: \"I don't tell anyone here what to do. I just ask them, if you could build the future, what would you build?\"\n\nBamBrogan is tight-lipped about Arrivo’s mission and plans, citing Hyperloop One’s much-ballyhooed press event in the Nevada desert in April 2016, where media and investors were bused an hour outside of Las Vegas to witness a 5-second high-speed sled test.\n\nBut he says the company will have an announcement about its vision and potential partnerships in the coming weeks. He agrees with his rivals that in order for hyperloop to take a step closer to becoming the next transportation model, it will take far more than the brainpower of a few engineers.\n\n“For this to work, you need a classic infrastructure finance model,” he says. “We’d provide the tech, but you’d also have a construction company to build, an architecture firm to support how this interacts with a city, and land owners who get behind the vision that ultimately might increase the value of what they hold.”\n\nBamBrogan mentions the Concorde, the supersonic plane that captured the public’s fancy a few decades back. It cut travel between London and New York by more than half, but at astronomical ticket prices, reducing it to a plaything for the super-rich that eventually disappeared.\n\nThe challenge facing BamBrogan and his peers is to show that hyperloop is the latter-day railroad and not a futuristic boondoggle.\n\n“All self-gratifying technologies are eventually exposed,” he says. “To work, hyperloop has to have massive commercial value.”\n\nFollow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava @marcodellacava", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/21"}]}

The company failed to provide adequate warning to the Manders that the hippo posed an imminent danger, the lawsuit said.\n\nNeither of the Manders knew how dangerous hippos could be, according to the lawsuit.\n\n“Had we understood the dangers posed by the hippopotamus, we never would have agreed to be in such close contact while on foot,” Manders said in a statement released by his attorneys, Paul Slager and Nicole Coates, NBC News reported.\n\nHippopotamuses are one of the most dangerous land animals, killing around 500 people a year. The animals don't eat humans but are territorial in the water and will attack. Even though the animals weigh more than 3,000 pounds, their sharp tusks and ability to run 30 mph for short distances make them deadly creatures to humans and other animals.\n\nThe attack left Craig Manders emotionally debilitated and traumatized, according to the complaint. He's seeking at least $15,000 in damages to pay for Lisa's funeral and other expenses.\n\nAnouk Zijlma, a safari specialist with African Portfolio, said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY that the incident was \"tragic\" and that Chiawa Lodge in Zambia arranged the safari. Zijlma added guests were accompanied by a guide, ranger and armed National Park scout.\n\n\"Chiawa Lodge confirmed to both the Police, and Department of National Parks & Wildlife investigations at the time, that all safety measures had been implemented both before and during the incident, and repeated verbal warnings for the guests to return to the safety of the vehicle were issued during the incident,\" she wrote.\n\nAfrican Portfolio's attorney Rod Gould told USA TODAY the company only arranges tours and isn't legally responsible for what happens on the tours. Upon booking, people sign a release stating African Portfolio isn't responsible for third-party negligence. He nor the U.S. company provided USA TODAY a copy of the release.\n\n\"If there were negligence here, it really is the lodge and the safari people,\" Gould said. \"If they shouldn't have let the people out at this point, that's the lodge. If they should've let people in earlier than they did, that's the lodge.\"\n\nNo tours were paused or reevaluated since the incident, Gould said, adding that Lisa Manders' death is the only tragedy since the company's founding 30 years ago.\n\n10-day trip turns deadly\n\nThe Cranford, New Jersey, couple explored the Zambian wilderness with African Portfolio in the summer after booking a 10-day trip in the southern African country. According to the company's website, travelers meet a local representative at the Lusaka International Airport where they board a chartered flight to Kaufe and the Lower Zambezi National Parks.\n\nThe travel company said on its website that Lower Zambezi's wildlife is massively diverse with \"elephant, hippos, crocodiles, zebra and antelope as well as a myriad of birdlife.\" Each leg of the trip is spent with the company's representatives, according to the company.\n\nOn the fifth day of the tour, the Manders embarked on a \"bush walk\" tour of the Lower Zambezi National Park with African Portfolio's associates. During the exploration, associates saw signs of dangerous wildlife and encouraged the couple to follow the signs, the complaint claims.\n\nThat turned deadly when the couple and other tourists saw a partially submerged hippo in a body of water. Tour guides did inform them about the animal's presence, but didn't warn them about its territorial nature, the lawsuit claimed.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the tour guides, including at least one armed with a rifle, encouraged participants, including Craig and Lisa Manders, to approach the hippo. The representatives walked away and left the group alone with the hippo.\n\nRadio Christian Voice, a Zambian news organization, reported that the country's Minister of Tourism Rodney Sikumba, a wildlife police officer and a tour guide, attempted to intervene in the attack but the situation worsened, leading to Manders' death.\n\n“Government's thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of the deceased, even as investigations continue on the incident,” Sikumba said in a statement to the organization.\n\nAccording to her obituary, Lisa Manders worked in the finance industry for over 40 years as a Registered Client Associate, including over 20 years at Merrill Lynch.\n\nThe dangers of adventure tourism\n\nAdventure tourism can be deadly, whether it’s during a safari, a mountain climbing trip, or on the ocean, and as global travel has become easier and more popular, some experts say deaths have become more common.\n\nSome tourists choose high adventures to feel the thrill of pushing the limits. Danger may come from being in a remote location, the mode of travel, or the native wildlife. Some tourists increase their risks by disregarding safety tips such as crossing safety barriers or venturing out alone.\n\nThe U.S. State Department advises careful research to learn the laws and safety regulations in the specific location you plan to visit. Prospective tourists also should research the organization sponsoring the tour or activity because many groups that provide such tours have their own procedures and may not be subject to governmental safety regulations.\n\nSafety guidelines, for example, became a subject of scrutiny after the Titan submersible imploded in 2023 during a dive to see the Titanic wreck.\n\nRemote locations far from hospitals and access to medical care can increase the risk of death. A German tourist swimming alongside a catamaran off the Canary Islands was attacked last year and it took hours for first responders to reach the remote location by helicopter, according to the International Shark Attack File at the University of Florida’s Museum of Natural History.\n\nDeadly animals can be found in most locations in the world, whether it’s bison, hippos, or any number of venomous reptiles.\n\nOne group of researchers found that fatal lion attacks are increasing in Tanzania, and online accounts differ on whether hippos or reptiles kill more people each year in Africa.\n\nShark fatalities occur in more far-flung destinations as remote tourism has become more popular, according to research from the University of Florida’s International Shark Attack File.\n\nIn 2023, three of the four people who died in Australian shark attacks were surfers in a remote spot off the coast of southern Australia.\n\nEven some of the world’s most popular destinations for even the most basic travel have deadly animals, including Florida, which some estimates say has one alligator for every 16 residents.\n\nReading safe travel guidelines, which remind tourists to follow the rules of their guides and not to overexert themselves physically, is a reminder that each individual tourist can make decisions to keep themselves safe.\n\nEven when you’re not pushing the limits of safety on vacation, you’re likely to be exposed to one of the most dangerous animals in the world – the mosquito.\n\n'Angrier and angrier': How dangerous are hippos?\n\nBesides mosquitos, hippos come in a pretty close second or third as the world’s most dangerous animal, said Mark Walter, president of Blue Straits, an international law and development firm who once had an all-too-close encounter with a hippo.\n\nWalter was working in Ethiopia when he and a colleague went out with a guide in a boat on Lake Awasa to see hippos. The trip quickly turned into an adventure when the boat began sinking.\n\nAs the guide began bailing, Walter thought he was seeing two hippos. The guide explained it was one hippo swimming back and forth under the boat “deciding whether he wants to upset the boat,” Walter said. “That’s when I started bailing too.”\n\nUltimately, they were able to jam a pair of shoelaces into the crevice in the boat where the water was flowing in and safely dock the boat, he said. “It was pretty frightening because the hippo was getting angrier and angrier.”\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)\n\nContact reporter Krystal Nurse at knurse@USATODAY.com.

Rip currents are more deadly | Opinion", "text": "John McCarthy\n\nFLORIDA TODAY\n\nJuly 4, 2024, 5:01 a.m. ET\n\nEditor's note: This is a reprint of a cranky column that was published in 2015. The cranky writer's sentiments remain unchanged.\n\nThey are the silent killers of the ocean.\n\nThey are always there. Silent. Stealthy. Shifting from spot to spot.\n\nThey strike without warning. Swimmers rarely sense the pending predator until they are in its grips, being dragged away from the safety of the nearby sand.\n\nI am talking about rip currents, of course.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nDid you envision something else reading those first three paragraphs? Sharks, perhaps? If so, then you are not analyzing relative risks correctly.\n\nYes, sharks are dangerous. A bite from even a small one — the kind responsible for most \"attacks\" on humans around here — can cause nasty damage. And, yes, in rare cases, shark attacks can be fatal.\n\nBut your chances of being bitten by a shark are so infinitesimal as to be almost non-existent.\n\nAnybody who has worked with me for the past 20 years will tell you I roll my eyes whenever somebody brings up the possibility of doing stories about dangerous sharks. Mentions that \"Florida is the shark-bite capital of the U.S.\" give me fits. (For the record, of course there are more shark bites in Florida. That's because there are far more people in the ocean in Florida than anywhere else in the country).\n\nLet's put things in perspective here. According the International Shark Attack File at the University of Florida, there were 603 shark attacks in Florida between 1959 and 2010. Nine of those were fatal.\n\nIn comparison, Florida is also the pedestrian traffic fatality capital of the United States too. According to one study, 5,189 pedestrians died in traffic accidents in Florida from just 2003 to 2012. You are far more likely to get run over crossing State Road A1A on your way to the beach than get killed by shark while in the ocean.\n\nYou are also far more likely to die from some other type of freak accident than to get \"eaten\" by a shark:\n\n•Between 1948 and 2005, eight people were killed by sharks in Florida. Seventeen were killed by alligators.\n\n•Between 1959 and 2010, nine people in Florida were killed by sharks. Lightning killed another 459.\n\n•Between 1990 and 2006, 11 people nationwide were killed by sharks. Sixteen were killed when a sand hole they were playing in at a beach collapsed on them.\n\nI could go on, but you get the idea.\n\nIf you're still terrified of swimming in the ocean because you are afraid of sharks, you're not alone. An article in the January 2008 edition of Psychology Today details how humans are terrible at analyzing risk. For ancient man, it points out, split-second emotional reaction to predators was necessary for survival. Our brains are still hard-wired that way.\n\nAdding to the problem, the article says, is that the drama and excitement of improbable events make them appear to be more common than they really are. The intensive media coverage of things like airplane crashes or, ahem, shark bites only heightens the effect.\n\nSo while it is probably a wise idea to get out of the water if you happen to spot a shark fin, you would be better advised to watch out for rip currents and swim near lifeguard stations. And if you get caught in a rip current, don't fight it but swim parallel to the shore until you are out of it.\n\nSo, by all means, go enjoy a day at the beach. Just be careful when digging holes.\n\nMcCarthy is the editor at FLORIDA TODAY in charge of saying \"pshaw\" to silly story ideas.

The drownings happened on the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf coasts, as well as along the Great Lakes.\n\n“People consider the ocean a swimming pool and not a very dynamic, turbulent place,” said Francis Smith, a research scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. But nothing could be further from the truth, he said. “It’s powerful.”\n\nMore people die from surf zone incidents than any other single weather-related cause except flooding. Between 2014 and 2018, flooding killed 549 people. Currents, high surf and surprise waves killed 510, weather service records show. Nearly two-thirds of them were caught in rip currents.\n\nIn Florida, 102 people have drowned in the surf zone since 2014, including 27 in 2018 and 28 so far in 2019.\n\nThe 2014-2018 deaths, which span the entire United States and its territories, are greater than the combined number of fatalities by lightning, tornadoes and hurricanes over the same five years.\n\nThe count is a minimum, the weather service said, and may not include every death.\n\nBeachgoers face a far greater risk of drowning in a rip current than they do being bitten by a shark, said Stephen Leatherman, a professor in the Department of Earth and Environment at Florida International University.\n\nAnd yet, Leatherman said the death toll “almost seems like a secret to some degree.”\n\n“People see one shark and everybody goes nuts,” he said. But twice as many people are killed by currents and waves in the U.S. than are bitten by sharks.\n\nLeatherman, also known as Dr. Beach for his annual ranking of the nation’s best beaches, calls the ocean’s strong currents “silent killers.”\n\nRECENT VICTIMS\n\nThe National Weather Service posts warnings about dangerous conditions in an effort to prevent such deaths. It did so throughout late September as Hurricane Lorenzo churned the waters from Florida to North Carolina.\n\nOn the morning of Sept. 30, it advised beachgoers in Duck, N.C., that the risk of rip currents was high: “It is recommended that you stay out of the water.”\n\nBut Bill Lapenta did not heed the warning. Rescue personnel pulled NOAA’s director of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction from the ocean unresponsive and could not revive him. “Surf conditions and a rip current in the area were likely a factor” in his death, according to a town news release.\n\nLapenta’s death was especially discouraging, Leatherman said.\n\n“Here’s a trained meteorologist, a leader who understands weather and waves, and yet he didn’t recognize them and got swept offshore and drowned,” he said. “If he’s that knowledgeable, what chance does the average person have who doesn’t have that training or background?”\n\nJohn and Suzi Merical know the answer to that question all too well. Their only child, Paige, was pulled out to sea in a rip current on April 19 during a beach trip to Emerald Isle, N.C.\n\nShe had been at the beach just 45 minutes when a stranger used Paige’s phone to call her mother to relay the horrific news. Although Paige was rescued and taken to the hospital, she died a week later from her injuries.\n\nA friend with Paige, Ian Lewis, was also swept away in the current and died.\n\n“It is the greatest nightmare I will ever experience,” said John Merical. “I’ve cried more tears in the last five and a half months than I have in my entire life.”\n\nThe two athletic teenagers were in water below their knees when the rip current knocked them down and pulled them out, he said. Paige, who started swimming at age 2, had been taught if she became trapped in a current to swim parallel to the shore, advice long given to swimmers.\n\nFLIP, FLOAT AND FOLLOW\n\nBut now the Mericals believe their advice was wrong. They are among a growing group of community organizations and researchers working to change the message.\n\nSwimmers should “flip, float and follow,” said Jamie Racklyeft, executive director of the Great Lakes Water Safety Consortium. Flip onto their backs, float with the current and follow the path of least resistance.\n\nRip currents form when water piles up on the shore and rushes to the lowest point to return to the sea. The water finds an existing channel or carves out a channel in the sand beneath the water’s surface, perpendicular to the beach.\n\nMany beachgoers have never heard of a rip current, said Leatherman, who’s working with his son to develop videos with drones and environmentally safe dyes to help people visualize the danger. The currents can be deceptive or hard to see, even for experts.\n\nMany swimmers aren’t strong enough to swim out of a rip current, Leatherman said. Drowning can happen quickly.\n\n“When you panic,” he said, “your brain stops working.”\n\nWhen a swimmer starts swallowing water, it immediately attacks the air sacs in the lungs, said Smith, the University of California scientist and former lifeguard. “Your body just shuts down,” he said. “You don’t get the oxygen you need, especially to your brain.”\n\nSwimmers who can flip over and float give themselves time to control their panic, breathe and make themselves more buoyant by filling their lungs with air. Once they’re calm, they can get themselves to shore or wait for rescue.\n\nThe drownings in North Carolina also have prompted renewed calls for additional lifeguards and other safety measures.\n\nIn Florida, which leads the country in surf zone drownings, only a fraction of the state’s 825 miles of beaches have lifeguards. But Leatherman points to the success of lifeguard programs like the one in Volusia County, Florida, home of Daytona Beach.\n\nOn Oct. 6 the county’s lifeguards rescued eight people from Lorenzo’s rough surf, including two later hospitalized as a precaution.\n\n“We’d like to see lifeguards everywhere,” Leatherman said, “but it’s expensive.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/06/19/shark-attack-hilton-head-sea-pines-beach/84274292007/", "title": "Shark attack reported in Hilton Head, victim suffered major leg injury", "text": "June 19, 2025 Updated June 20, 2025, 9:22 a.m. ET\n\nA beachgoer in South Carolina suffered serious injuries in what local first-responders are calling a suspected shark attack.\n\nThe incident, in which local officials said the victim suffered major injuries to her leg, happened in waters off the south end of Hilton Head Island, a local dispatcher confirmed to USA TODAY Thursday, June 19.\n\nThe island is about 45 miles northeast of Savannah, Georgia.\n\n\"The incident involved a patient with a leg injury consistent with lacerations typically associated with a shark bite,\" a Hilton Head Island Fire Rescue official wrote in press release obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nCrews responded at 12:07 p.m. on Tuesday, June 17, to a medical emergency near beach mile marker 24 in Sea Pines Beach, according to the release.\n\nLifeguards and firefighters treated the victim at the scene before she was transported to Hilton Head Island Airport, the release continues, where a medical helicopter flew her to a Savannah facility for further treatment.\n\nThe victim's age, name and condition were not immediately known on Thursday, June 19, but first-responders at the scene determined the injuries to be non-life threatening.\n\nShark siting: Massive great white shark resurfaces off North Carolina coast\n\nHilton Head Island shark attacks\n\nThe incident marked the first reported likely shark bite of Hilton Head’s summer season, Shore Beach Service director Mike Wagner told USA TODAY.\n\nThe agency, which provides year-round beach patrol for 13.5 miles of the island's beaches according to its website, also responded to assist the victim.\n\nLocal charter captain Chip Michalove, The Island Packet reported, said Hilton Head beaches see two or three shark attacks each year, \"occasionally seeing spikes of up to a half-dozen.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Hilton Head fire officials for more information.\n\nStay safe this summer: Sign up for USA TODAY's Travel newsletter.\n\nNorth Carolina suspected shark attack: Warning issued toa beach visitors\n\nShark bite could mark state's first encounter of 2025\n\nIf confirmed, the attack could be the state’s first reported shark encounter with a human in 2025.\n\nAccording to the International Shark Attack File (ISAF), 47 people were bitten in unprovoked attacks last year.

Instead, he looked down to see a great white shark taking a bite out of his boat.\n\nSome 400 miles south, another shark attacked and almost killed a mother of three a few months earlier.\n\nSuch high-profile incidents along with hundreds of sightings have made this the summer of sharks for beachgoers in California.\n\n\"It's too close for comfort,\" said Adriana Razo, of Long Beach, Calif., who brought a carload of children to a nearby shore, where shark advisories have been posted periodically this summer. \"You bring your kids to the beach and you want them to have fun, but you're scared at the same time.\"\n\nThe number of shark attacks in California has steadily increased since the 1990s. Between 1990 and 1999, there were 28 reports of sharks making aggressive contact with swimmers, surfers or boaters, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. In the past seven years, that number has risen to 40. The reports include any attack, regardless of whether it resulted in injury or death.\n\nThe phenomenon is not new on the East Coast. The number of shark sightings off Massachusetts are also on the rise, but beachgoers there have paid attention to what may be lurking in the waters since Jaws thrust great whites into the national consciousness a generation ago.\n\nChatham, a small town in southern Cape Cod, has even become known for its shark sightings, and people flock to its shores in the hopes of getting a glimpse of the creatures.\n\n\"Many of their shops are selling shark stuff, from mugs to T-shirts,\" said Gregory Skomal, senior fisheries scientist for Massachusetts Marine Fisheries. \"There’s been an economic boom from the presence of these sharks. This is in the absence of a fatal attack. That might change things.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nWhy great white sharks keep coming close to California beaches\n\nKatharine the shark may be coming of age\n\nCalifornia woman 'fighting for her life' after shark attack\n\nFor Californians, increased shark sightings are largely a new deal.\n\nHome to the nation's entertainment industry, some have even viewed the finned, toothy visitors for their filming potential more so than potentially dangerous animals. In Long Beach, lifeguards confronted film crews in June for baiting the water with bloody fish guts to attract the sharks in hopes they would gather for a Hollywood moment.\n\nWhile sightings are difficult to track, lifeguards and city officials say this summer has been unprecedented.\n\nKayaker Steve Lawson wasn't injured in the July 11 attack in Santa Cruz, a beach town 75 miles south of San Francisco. But Santa Cruz Fire Chief Jim Frawley called the attack \"extremely rare,\" and closed all beaches within one mile of where the incident happened for four days.\n\n“The shark came from below, grabbed the front of his bow, lifted it up and out of the water along with him and dumped him out,” Frawley said. “Nobody in recent history can think of an attack to this degree in the area in the last 80 years.”\n\nMonths earlier, a shark attacked Leeanne Ericson on April 29 as she swam at San Onofre State Beach near San Clemente, Calif., her family said. The mother of three lost half her right leg in the attack and remained in the hospital for more than a month.\n\nAt Capistrano Beach, a popular spot in Dana Point south of Los Angeles, almost 40 shark sightings have been logged since May, with one resulting in a beach closure for the day. The beaches have been under shark advisories almost every day for the past two months, said Jason Young, chief lifeguard in Orange County. This year has been the most active for shark sightings in the two decades he's worked the beaches, he added.\n\nIn Long Beach, shark sightings were practically absent until last summer, said Cameron Abel, captain of the Long Beach Marine Safety Division. Now, they’ve peaked to their highest ever. So far, Long Beach has posted signs 11 times warning about the presence of sharks after the animals have been spotted near the coast.\n\nScientists, meanwhile, are thrilled. They say a rebound in sharks is good news for oceans — even if it's met warily by people.\n\nShark protections have increased for the past 20 years and now their populations are finally coming back, said Chris Lowe, director of the California State University-Long Beach Shark Lab.\n\nIt's been illegal to hook a great white in the state since 1994, and populations of sea lions and other species that provide a ready source of food for sharks have risen in the past couple decades as well.\n\n\"The minute you say the word 'shark' they think, 'oh, dangerous animal,' \" Lowe said, \"but the reality is that thousands use Southern California waters, and they are amongst those sharks all the time, but we just don't see people being bitten by sharks all the time.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/25/who-is-riger-natural-maker-of-dietary-supplement-reumofan/2843161/", "title": "Maker of dangerous pain pills is 'ghost' that can't be found", "text": "Alison Young\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSept. 25, 2013 Updated Sept. 27, 2013, 11:23 a.m. ET\n\nReumofan dietary supplements contain hidden%2C dangerous medications\n\nFDA has received dozens of adverse event reports%2C including bleeding%2C strokes and deaths\n\nProduct labels say Reumofan is made in Mexico by Riger Natural %u2014 but the company may not exist\n\nSome Reumofan pills are stamped with an %22M%22 logo that is the same as one used by Laboratorios Marcel\n\nGUADALAJARA, Mexico — A Mexican dietary supplement called Reumofan has gained a loyal following in the United States as a \"100% natural\" treatment for arthritis and joint pain. It's supposedly made by a company called Riger Natural from ingredients such as shark cartilage, white willow and glucosamine, or so the labels say.\n\nBut consumers who buy Reumofan products are risking dangerous side effects and trusting their lives to a company that uses fake addresses, lies about the ingredients in its products and may not even exist, a USA TODAY investigation has found.\n\nThe newspaper set out to find Riger Natural and the people responsible for producing and selling the supplement, searching corporation records and visiting addresses in Mexico where it had been listed on the Web as having a lab. Those addresses are fake and there's no evidence the company ever had facilities in the locations. Some Mexican retailers who once distributed the product say their contacts have simply disappeared. Even Mexican health authorities have been unable to track down the company.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. consumers — desperate to curb arthritis and joint pain — continue to buy Reumofan over the Internet and by crossing the border. They are running a high risk: Dozens of Reumofan users have suffered serious and sometimes life-threatening health effects after taking the pills, including liver injury, strokes and severe episodes of bleeding, according to federal records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. Three reports involve deaths, though the full toll of those injured will never be known because most adverse events involving supplements and drugs are never reported to the FDA.\n\nLab tests by U.S. and Mexican health authorities have detected up to three powerful and potentially dangerous prescription drugs hidden in Reumofan products. While government officials have warned the public of this finding, they haven't revealed anything about the company behind the products, other than its name. And nobody has been able to explain how a mysterious \"M\" logo identical to one used by a Mexican pharmaceutical company has ended up on at least some batches of the pills.\n\n\"We've made more than eight visits to addresses for which we've had intelligence and we've not located the business,\" Alvaro Perez Vega, commissioner of health operations at Mexico's federal commission for the protection against sanitary risk (Cofepris), said through an interpreter. The agency issued its first public warning about Reumofan in May 2012.\n\nThe FDA declined to discuss what it knows about Riger Natural.\n\n\"As an open investigation, there's not much we can really say about who actually was responsible for putting the product into commerce,\" said Daniel Fabricant, director of FDA's dietary supplement division. The FDA has issued several warnings about the product since June 2012.\n\nThousands of Americans have bought Reumofan from one small U.S. reseller that conducted a recall. But the full scope of Reumofan usage is impossible to gauge because of the shadowy nature of the product's maker and the multiple Internet and Mexican border stores that have sold it over the years.\n\nFabricant and other experts said that Reumofan is indicative of larger problems in the $30 billion supplement industry, where limits on federal regulation make it easy for almost anybody to sell products that claim to be all-natural remedies — even if they aren't. More than a dozen times each year, the FDA's limited testing finds that potentially dangerous pharmaceuticals are being used to secretly spike products sold as dietary supplements. It also can be difficult to locate companies selling risky and questionable products.\n\n\"It can be more challenging than people think. There isn't product registration. So products can come in and out of the market without FDA having knowledge of it,\" Fabricant said. \"It's pretty easy to open up one website and shut it down the next day. ... It's kind of like one big game of Whack-A-Mole.\"\n\nMore than 85,000 supplement products are estimated to be on the market, Fabricant said.\n\nAlthough the FDA has no authority to require registration of individual products, federal law requires supplement companies to register their facilities so the FDA can quickly contact them in an emergency. Yet 28% of companies selling a sampling of weight-loss and immune support supplements had failed to register any facilities with the FDA, federal auditors found last year. Among those that registered, 72% failed to provide complete and accurate location and contact information.\n\nDietary supplements — such as vitamins, minerals, herbal extracts and protein powders — are taken by an estimated half of U.S. adults and are regulated as a type of food because they are supposed to contain only natural nutrients. Although they often are marketed as health remedies, the FDA does not have the authority to require pre-market testing for safety or effectiveness as it does with medications prior to sale.\n\nSupplement industry officials maintain that supplements like Reumofan represent a \"few bad actors\" and that most firms sell safe products that enhance consumers' health.\n\nThe Reumofan case \"is a classic example of a company masquerading as an industry player taking advantage of consumers selling a dangerous product,\" said John Shaw, CEO of the Natural Products Association, a supplement trade group.\n\nAdds Cara Welch, a senior vice president with the association: \"These are straight-up criminals. I don't know that adding regulation to the responsible industry will solve the problem.\"\n\nLike many Reumofan users, Deanna Bertrand and Lyman Dye don't speak much Spanish and it didn't matter to them that much of the product's label was written in that language.\n\n\"It works. So long as it works, I don't care what it is,\" says Bertrand, 74, a court clerk in rural Clay County, Ga.\n\nBefore she began taking Reumofan about a year ago for knee pain, climbing the steep stairs at the historic courthouse was slow torture. Now she goes up and down with ease. \"You're not in pain. You can do whatever you want to do. And it doesn't cost you an arm and a leg to take it,\" she said.\n\nDye, 80, who lives in Ucon, Idaho, says Reumofan has allowed him to enjoy an active life — working on old cars, climbing mountains — despite \"bone on bone\" scraping in his shoulders. \"It immediately eased the pain,\" he said.\n\nSilvano Marangone, 81, of San Gabriel, Calif., was suffering from hip pain until he heard about Reumofan two years ago. Like most Reumofan users interviewed by USA TODAY, Marangone started taking the product based on the recommendation of a trusted friend or relative. \"I took the pill and within one day, all my pain was gone. I said, my gosh, this is a miracle.\"\n\nMarangone said he stopped taking Reumofan after the FDA issued warnings. Hip surgery has since ended his pain and his need for any pills.\n\nBut Bertrand and Dye are among consumers who continue to take the pills. Both noted that plenty of FDA-approved drugs also have the potential for serious and sometimes deadly side effects. \"I'm not really concerned about it,\" Dye said.\n\nLast summer, the FDA began issuing a series of safety alerts after tests found hidden pharmaceutical ingredients in Reumofan products. One version of the pills, Reumofan Plus, contained three medications: dexamethasone, a corticosteroid; diclofenac sodium, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; and methocarbamol, a muscle relaxant. Reumofan Plus was also sold in bottles repackaged as a product called WOW, the FDA said.\n\nThe FDA's tests of another version of the pills, called Reumofan Plus Premium, found it contained two of the drugs: diclofenac sodium and methocarbamol.\n\nThe corticosteroid is of particular concern because it carries life-threatening risks if it is used long term then stopped abruptly. Symptoms of this withdrawal syndrome include fatigue, nausea, low blood pressure, low blood sugar levels and dizziness. Dexamethazone can also reduce the body's ability to fight infections, raise blood-sugar levels, and cause bone and muscle injuries and psychiatric problems, the FDA said.\n\nThe anti-inflammatory drug can increase the risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, as well as serious gastrointestinal problems, including bleeding, ulcers and fatal tears of the stomach and intestines. The muscle relaxant can cause drowsiness, dizziness and low blood pressure.\n\nThe FDA's Fabricant said Reumofan was of significant concern to the agency because so much of the product was being sold. \"The product had three drugs we hadn't seen before in terms of spiking supplements. And they have a very dangerous safety profile, usually the types of drugs that are only used under the care of a physician,\" he said.\n\nHistorically, drug-tainted supplements have been found most often among pills and powders sold for bodybuilding, weight loss and sexual enhancement. But the FDA says it is seeing the dangerous practice showing up in supplements used by the growing population of aging Americans.\n\nIn July, the FDA issued warnings about more than a dozen firms selling natural remedies for the estimated 26 million Americans who have diabetes. Its tests showed some of the pills contained one or more pharmaceutical ingredients found in prescription drugs to treat type 2 diabetes.\n\n\"What I think that Reumofan and some of the other ones teach us is that it's a moving target,\" Fabricant said.\n\nThe FDA received two initial reports of adverse events involving Reumofan Plus in November 2011. A dozen more came in during April and May 2012, before the agency issued its first alert, records show.\n\nA family physician who had treated two Reumofan users, told the FDA: \"It is alarming to see this product otc [over the counter] in the marketplace.\" One patient had developed a dangerous adrenal suppression syndrome \"even though the Internet claims it does not contain [a] steroid. The patient's back pain felt so much better I was suspicious,\" said the doctor, whose name was redacted by the FDA for privacy reasons. The second patient, a diabetic, developed sudden worsening of glucose control.\n\nAround the same time, poison control centers were getting calls from both patients and doctors about Reumofan. \"It was the same underlying theme: My patients or my friend is just swearing by it, it works fantastic … what's in it?\" said Keith Boesen, director of the Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center.\n\nAfter searching the Web and reading consumer testimonials about fast relief of arthritis symptoms and pain, the center's staff suspected the product contained a steroid. \"It seemed to make sense from the stories people were telling,\" he said. Steroids can make people feel better quickly, Boesen said, but because of their risks, they should be used only selectively and under a physician's care.\n\nSo far, the FDA has received more than 60 reports of consumers suffering adverse health events while taking Reumofan products, including 28 categorized as serious, seven as life-threatening and three involving deaths, records obtained under the FOIA show.\n\n• A 76-year-old woman who had been taking three Reumofan Plus tablets daily for arthritis suffered from acute psychosis and other symptoms consistent with corticosteroid use, her doctor reported. After multiple clinic visits, she required inpatient treatment in a psychiatric ward.\n\n• An 83-year-old woman with arthritis died of an infection after developing severe colitis. She was taking Reumofan Plus, \"which we believed suppressed her immune system,\" her doctor told the FDA in a Jan. 2, 2013, report. The woman's husband, who also was taking Reumofan, developed C. difficile colitis and died in April 2012, the doctor reported.\n\n• A Reumofan Plus user suffered life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding that required a transfusion, a doctor reported.\n\nJuana Anguiano, a 64-year-old retired county worker in Santa Barbara, Calif., took Reumofan for about 10 months for knee pain until she heard about FDA's health alerts last summer and stopped taking it — unwittingly triggering a dangerous steroid withdrawal syndrome that increasingly devastated her body's ability to function. \"She was vomiting, getting very sick,\" said her lawyer, Wendy Behan. \"It affected her kidneys and liver.\" Anguiano declined to be interviewed.\n\nWhen people take corticosteroids for more than a few weeks, the body's adrenal glands decrease production of natural steroid hormones critical to the production of blood-sugar and helping the body respond to inflammation, infection and trauma. Anguiano was hospitalized for seven days last September, where doctors put her on prednisone, another corticosteroid, and then weaned her off of it over three months, Behan said.\n\nSEARCHING FOR RIGER NATURAL\n\nSo where is Riger Natural? And who are the people behind the production of Reumofan?\n\nSeeking answers, USA TODAY traveled to Mexico where government officials, retailers and others familiar with the product are based.\n\nThe first location visited was in Puebla, about a two-hour bus ride from Mexico City, where Riger laboratories was listed in a Mexican phone directory. The listed address was fictitious. The closest building was an animal hospital where a veterinarian said he'd never heard of the supplement maker.\n\nA company called \"Riger\" had registered its name and a business address in another part of Puebla with Mexico's trademark office. But there was no laboratory there, either — just a giant wholesale grocery store that says it has nothing to do with the supplement maker Riger Natural.\n\nRicardo Hernandez, the person in charge of the store, said he tried to find Riger Natural two years ago to possibly pursue a trademark infringement case over the supplement firm's use of a similar name.\n\n\"I went to look, but I never found this business. It's a fictitious business. A ghost,\" Hernandez said. \"Obviously there's no one to complain to or talk to about regarding the use of the name, nothing.\"\n\nUSA TODAY also visited an area along an industrial stretch of highway near Guadalajara's airport, where the website RigerNatural.com had listed its \"Planta Jalisco\" in Tlajomulco de Zuniga, according to an archived version of the now defunct website from January 2012. But there was no trace of the company there, either — just a nursery selling plants and a huge, gated complex for international technology manufacturer Sanmina.\n\nDomingo Carrasco Trejo, whose family has owned a natural-products store in Guadalajara since 1981, used to sell Reumofan — before the Mexican government issued its health warnings last year. He first met a Reumofan distributor at a trade show.\n\n\"At the show it was an elite product,\" he recalled. \"On the Internet, you would have this distributor who obviously didn't have a telephone number. But you would have a contact, then you deposit [money] into a certain account.\"\n\nBut it was unclear exactly where the product was coming from, Carrasco said. \"I don't know where the supplier bought it from. They talked about it being from Veracruz. Another story was that it was from Nayarit.\"\n\nThe distributor has since disappeared. \"We have lost all contact,\" Carrasco said.\n\nMexican health officials said they also have been unable to find Riger Natural. So far, if they've found anything at addresses associated with the company, it's been only distributors or storage facilities.\n\n\"The company that was responsible for the commercialization and production … up to this moment we have not found it,\" said Perez, the official at Cofepris, the federal agency that oversees drugs and supplements.\n\nPerez said regulators' actions seizing Reumofan products and publicizing the product's danger are making a difference. \"We're financially damaging the company,\" he said.\n\nBut does Riger Natural even exist? \"We still can't affirm that,\" he said.\n\nA POSSIBLE CLUE\n\nAt a pharmacy in the Mexican border town of Los Algodones, near Yuma, Ariz., USA TODAY bought a bottle of Reumofan Plus this past summer. The purple pills inside are stamped with a stylized \"M\" logo. The same imprint is on some of the pills purchased by Deanna Bertrand, Lyman Dye and other U.S. consumers.\n\nThe logo is the same as one used by a Mexican pharmaceutical company: Laboratorios Marcel, which until December had operated a manufacturing plant in Guadalajara since 1954. Marcel made a medication called Rumoquin N.F. that on some bottles lists the same three-drug combination the FDA has found in Reumofan Plus: dexamethasone, diclofenac and methocarbamol.\n\nWhen shown a photo of one of the \"M\" pills found in a bottle of Reumofan during an interview in Mexico City, Perez, the Mexican health official, said he doubted that a pharmaceutical would be repackaged as a supplement. In recent e-mails, Perez has further disputed any connection between Laboratorios Marcel and Reumofan pills bearing the company's logo.\n\nPerez said that Laboratorios Marcel has registered only one version of Rumoquin with his agency and it contains phenylbutazone, a pain-killing ingredient not found when regulators tested Reumofan supplements. He said he had no information about the second version of Rumoquin — without phenylbutazone — that USA TODAY found being sold that matches the combination of drugs found hidden in Reumofan Plus.\n\nPerez said the Reumofan pills seized by Mexican regulators do not have the \"M\" logo on them and that \"the confidentiality of Laboratorios Marcel's information is appreciated since there is no evidence to date of a link between the products.\"\n\nPerez said Cofepris has an open investigation involving Marcel, but that he can't provide details until it is concluded.\n\nIt's unclear how pills with Marcel's logo ended up in bottles of Reumofan. Did another company stamp Marcel's logo on the pills? Did someone possibly repackage Marcel's pills as Reumofan? Repackaging has already occurred in the U.S., the FDA has warned, when Reumofan was repackaged and sold as a product called WOW.\n\nAfter 58 years in business, the family that has run Laboratorios Marcel closed the company late last year and sold its factory in Guadalajara. At the same location, a member of the same family opened a different pharmaceutical manufacturer under the name: Laboratorios Schoen.\n\nMarcel officials, including shareholder and board member Vanesa Garcia Mendez Sereni, say their company has nothing to do with Riger Natural and they don't know how pills with Marcel's logo got into some bottles of Reumofan.\n\nBut before giving any substantial answers to USA TODAY's questions, they initially provided vague and misleading information about the Garcia Mendez family's involvement with both Marcel and the new pharmaceutical company at the same location.\n\nCHASING DOWN THE LEADS\n\n• After initially not returning calls, Elena Hernandez, a spokeswoman for Laboratorios Schoen, said in an e-mail there is no commercial relationship between her company and Marcel. When asked for the contact information of any former Marcel officials, Hernandez responded Sept. 4, \"Regrettably, we don't have the contact information for anyone.\"\n\n• Vanesa Garcia Mendez Sereni, whose e-mail address — but not her corporate title — was listed in a Marcel trademark document for Rumoquin, referred USA TODAY to a longtime lab employee when asked for the name of someone in charge at the company. That employee, Maria Silvia Chavez, said in an e-mail she was a health official at Marcel for about 15 years and there was no connection between the lab and Reumofan. When asked for the names and contact information of Marcel officials, she said: \"I lost contact with them.\"\n\nYet when USA TODAY checked corporation records filed with the public registry in Guadalajara, they showed that Vanesa Garcia Mendez Sereni and members of her family were Marcel board members and shareholders for years.\n\n• Corporation and marriage records also show that one of Laboratorios Schoen's shareholders, Sandra Julieta Villasenor Moreno, is a member of the same family. She is the wife of Marcel shareholder and board secretary Esteban Garcia Mendez Sereni. In state records, Laboratorios Schoen is misspelled as \"Shoen.\"\n\nEsteban Garcia Mendez Sereni could not be reached for comment and refused to accept a message sent to him by USA TODAY on Sept. 9 through the business networking site LinkedIn, then deleted his online account.\n\nLaboratorios Schoen shares the last name of a founder of Laboratorios Marcel: Esteban Szerenyi Schoen was listed as the majority shareholder in Marcel when it was incorporated in 1954. Hernandez did not reply to follow-up questions seeking clarification of her statements that there's no relationship between the two companies. Chavez also didn't respond.\n\n• After being presented with the information from public records, Vanesa Garcia Mendez acknowledged a family relationship among shareholders in both Marcel and Schoen and said none of Marcel's owners wanted to appear in this article for \"security\" reasons, \"given the situation of violence and insecurity that prevails in Mexico.\"\n\nShe did not respond to questions about why answering USA TODAY's questions posed a greater security risk than the family's regular appearance in photos in a society supplement to the Guadalajara newspaper Mural. Also left unanswered: questions about why there were two versions of Marcel's Rumoquin medication on the market — and why one of them wasn't registered with Mexican health officials.\n\n\"Marcel closed operations by virtue of some of the partners deciding to undertake an internal restructuring,\" Garcia Mendez said. She did not respond to questions about whether Marcel's \"M\" logo appearing on pills in some bottles of Reumofan played a role in the family's decision to close Marcel after nearly six decades in business.\n\n\"We think that it is out of proportion and far from reality to involve [Laboratorios Marcel] in a topic related to a laboratory that we don't know anything about,\" she said in her Sept. 17 e-mail. She added that Marcel officials feel they \"are victims of a forgery.\"\n\nTHE U.S. SELLERS\n\nIn the U.S., federal regulators pursuing Riger Natural also have nabbed only a few small players in the story. None appears to have any direct link to the product's purported maker, Riger Natural.\n\nSamantha Lynn Inc., which the FDA announced was recalling Reumofan in August 2012, was just an Internet business run from a kitchen table by stay-at-home mom Patricia Kovacevich, according to Tony Thomas, the Norwalk, Calif., company's accountant who was handling the recall, told USA TODAY earlier this year. The family put up a website and tries to identify products to sell by watching talk shows and monitoring other media. The goal was to try to make money \"on the spread between what she could buy it for and what she could sell it for.\"\n\nThomas said he thinks Kovacevich, who he said declined to be interviewed, bought Reumofan somewhere in Mexico. Just over 6,000 customers bought Reumofan from her website and were notified of the recall, Thomas said.\n\nThe FDA publicly cited a natural-products website run by Brower Enterprises of South Dakota in a December health alert about Reumofan sold as WOW. \"I don't really want to have any comments,\" said Stan Brower, when reached by phone recently. \"We were importing it from a company in California and they would never give us the name of the manufacturer.\" He then abruptly ended the call.\n\nIn February, the FDA issued an alert that another Web-based business enterprise — Reumofan Plus USA LLC and Reumofan USA LLC — was recalling the pills.\n\nThe websites were owned by Joseph McLean, a retiree from Pennsylvania who says he was new to the supplement business. McLean started selling Reumofan in 2012 to earn some extra money after trying the product for his tendinitis at the suggestion of a golf pro during a vacation in Mexico, he said.\n\nIt worked great and after sharing it with friends at his local golf course, he created a website to sell it online \"thinking all along it was an all-natural product.\"\n\nMcLean declined to say who sold Reumofan to him. \"I was just buying it from someone who was getting it out in California.\"\n\nWhen the FDA contacted him, McLean wondered why they were going after him and not the manufacturer: \"They're the culprits on the matter here.\"\n\n\"What are they worrying about a little guy like me for selling it?\" he said. \"Probably 100 people, maybe more than 100 people, resold the product. … It was all over eBay and Amazon.\" McLean said the FDA told him they hadn't been able to locate the manufacturer and they weren't even sure Riger Natural existed.\n\nAfter hearing the findings of USA TODAY's investigation, Deanna Bertrand said she's reconsidering whether she'll continue using Reumofan. Lyman Dye said he may continue to take the risk, because he uses it only occasionally and it gives him such relief.\n\nThe FDA spotlight has made Reumofan more difficult to find in the U.S., but consumers are still buying it from a variety of sources online and by crossing the border into Mexico.\n\nDeanna Bertrand has been ordering her pills in recent weeks from Farmacia del Nino, an online Mexican pharmacy.\n\nKarla Rivera, a customer service representative at Farmacia del Nino said the pharmacy began selling Reumofan about a year ago in response to consumer demand — much of it from the United States.\n\nWhere is the pharmacy getting its Reumofan? She wouldn't say.\n\nContributing: David Agren, Alicia Calderón, Lauren Kirkwood, Robert Hanashiro and Alan Gomez\n\nFollow USA TODAY investigative reporter Alison Young on Twitter: @alisonannyoung\n\nRead other articles in the Supplement Shell Game series at: supplements.usatoday.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/04/10/hawaii-shark-attacks-honolulu/11636223002/", "title": "Shark attacks in Hawaii, Honolulu surfer bitten off south Oahu coast", "text": "Updated April 10, 2023, 4:59 p.m. ET\n\nA Hawaii surfer was hospitalized Sunday after a shark attacked him and bit his leg just off the coast of Honolulu in Oahu, officials said.\n\nHonolulu Emergency Medical Services were alerted around 7 a.m. for a man who was bitten by a shark off the Kewalo Basin, just north of the popular tourist location of Waikiki, Shayne Enright, spokesperson for the Honolulu Emergency Services Department, told USA TODAY.\n\nBefore emergency services responded to the scene, people surfing with the man \"placed a tourniquet\" on his right leg and assisted him to shore, Enright said.\n\nThe man, only identified as a 58-year-old local resident, was given advanced life support by paramedics and transported to a local emergency room in serious condition.\n\n\"He was awake, conscious, breathing the entire time,\" Enright said.\n\nShark attacks and bites dropped again in 2022: Experts explain why\n\nWhite sharks like Florida waters: Here's 11 things to know, including who's out there now\n\nWhat kind of shark attacked the man?\n\nEnright said it was reported a 8-foot tiger shark bit the man.

The new plates are for the Alabama Poultry Foundation, Sickle Cell Awareness and Troy University, according to AL.com. Also available on Feb. 1 will be an Alabama Audubon “Protect Our Birds” tag. Most of the proceeds of the tag - $41.25 of its $50 cost – will go to Alabama Audubon to support bird conservation. Discontinued are the Rotary International, Civitan International and Square/Round Dancing plates.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: Police are investigating vandalism at a Russian cemetery in Sitka. Police are investigating vandalism at the Russian Cemetery. About 20 headstones were knocked over or damaged and Russian Orthodox crosses were broken and left the ground, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reported. Police were informed of the vandalism Friday by the cemetery’s caretaker, Bob Sam, who had last checked the cemetery a week before. Wooden crosses were destroyed, numerous cement headstones were pushed off their bases, statues on top of headstones were toppled and glass vases were broken, Sitka Police Department spokesperson Serena Wild said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Phoenix Public Transit Department has received a $920,000 grant to manage the planning of 11 stations along a 5-mile streetcar route that would connect four activity centers in Mesa. The money from the Transit-Oriented Development Planning grant will be used to conduct extensive planning efforts, determine design guidelines and establish economic strategies, according to Mesa officials. The route would connect Riverview Marketplace, Asian District, Fiesta District and downtown Mesa when it’s completed, the officials said. The Valley Metro Tempe Street Car Project was allocated $17.4 million last June under the American Rescue Plan to advance the 3-mile streetcar plan with 14 stations and six vehicles.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: A University of Arkansas professor pleaded guilty Friday to lying to the FBI about patents he had for inventions in mainland China. Simon Saw-Teong Ang pleaded guilty in federal court in Fayetteville to one count from a 58-count federal indictment. Prosecutors said 24 patents bearing Ang’s name were filed with the Beijing government but that he failed to report the patents to the university and denied having them when questioned by the FBI. The university requires disclosure of all faculty patents, which the university would own. The plea deal called for a one-year prison sentence, but the crime could be punishable by up to five years in prison. The 64-year-old Fayetteville resident was suspended from the university faculty when he was initially indicted in July 2020. The university website no longer lists him on its faculty directory.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The descendants of Native American tribes on the northern California coast are reclaiming a bit of their heritage that includes ancient redwoods that have stood since their ancestors walked the land. Save the Redwoods League planned to announce Tuesday that it is transferring more than 500 acres on the Lost Coast to the InterTribal Sinkyone Wilderness Council. The group of 10 tribes that have inhabited the area for thousands of years will be responsible for protecting the land dubbed Tc’ih-Léh-Dûñ, or “Fish Run Place,” in the Sinkyone language. Priscilla Hunter, chairwoman of the Sinkyone Council, said it’s fitting they will be caretakers of the land where her people were removed or forced to flee before the forest was largely stripped for timber. The transfer marks a step in the growing Land Back movement to return Indigenous homelands to the ancestors of those who lived there for millennia before European settlers arrived. The league first worked with the Sinkyone council when it transferred a 164-acre plot nearby to the group in 2012. The league recently paid $37 million for a scenic 5-mile stretch of the rugged and forbidding Lost Coast from a lumber company to protect it from logging and open it to the public.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Student enrollment has continued declining across Colorado public schools, with the state counting about 1,200 fewer students in kindergarten through 12th grade this fall than last year, when enrollment in preschool through high school plunged by about 30,000 students. State officials largely attributed last year’s enrollment slump – which was the first of its kind reported in more than 30 years – to parents’ pandemic-driven decisions. Many held off on enrolling kids in preschool and kindergarten and other families switched to homeschooling or online education programs. And the Colorado Department of Education, which on Wednesday released enrollment numbers from a count conducted in October, expected that enrollment numbers would increase again within the next few years. But the dip in K-12 students this year points to an underlying issue that has nothing to do with the pandemic: declining birth rates. Declining numbers could spell financial trouble for some school districts, because district budgets are largely determined by pupil counts.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Three Connecticut breweries have closed or announced closings within the last month because of the pandemic, and a fourth announced it is leaving its current space and assessing options for the future. It’s a blow to an industry that has been thriving in the state in recent years and it reflects a nationwide trend. Sales of craft beer dropped more than 9% in 2020, according to the Brewers Association. Brewery owners told the New Haven Register they faced challenges from an overall decline in taproom business to having to comply with the state’s post-lockdown requirement that they also serve food. 30 Mile Brewery, which opened in 2016, announced it is closing recently on its Facebook page. Better Half Brewing of Bristol closed on Dec. 31 and Shebeen Brewing Company in Wolcott also is closing its taproom, the Register reported. Taproom sales are especially important for small breweries that might not be able to make enough money from selling their products wholesale, William da Silva, a founder of Derby’s Bad Sons Beer Co., told the Register.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Surf-fishing permits for 2022 will got on sale starting Feb. 1 after a nationwide supply chain disruptions pushed back the sale dates, which are usually around the winter holidays, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control said. Sales for surf-fishing permits will begin at 10 a.m. Feb. 1, and annual passes for the Delaware State Parks will go on sale at 10 a.m. Feb. 15. The annual passes allow visitors to access the parks for the entire fee season from March 1 to Nov. 30, and surf-fishing permits allow people to drive onto designated sections of Delaware State Parks beaches for fishing. An annual pass costs $35 for a Delaware registered vehicle and $70 for an out-of-state vehicle. A Delawarean can get an annual surf-fishing permit for $90, and an out-of-state angler can get it for $180. First-time permit holders must also obtain a surf-fishing plate on which they will affix their surf-fishing permit decal. Beyond drive-on beach access, the decal grants entrance into the other state parks without paying the daily entrance fee.

Keepers at the National Zoo’s small mammal house reported for duty on Jan. 4 to discover Beatrix had given birth overnight. Now 2 weeks old, zoo staff said the prickly little one is doing well. The porcupette has bonded with its mom and is nursing well and gaining weight, keepers said. “Our team is looking forward to learning if the newborn will take after Beatrix, who is relaxed and easy-going, or be more active and curious like Quillbur,” the zoo said in a social media post. It’s not known whether the new bundle of spiny joy is a boy or a girl. Newborn porcupettes look anatomically similar until they are about 6 months old, staff said. Keepers sent quill samples to scientists at the Zoo’s Center for Conservation Genomics for DNA analysis. They should know the newborn’s sex in a few weeks. Quillbur and Beatrix gave birth to their first offspring back in 2019, soon after Quillbur came to the National Zoo. After a naming contest that year, the son was named Quilliam. Quilliam and this newborn porcupine are the fourth generation of this family to live in the small mammal house\n\nFlorida\n\nGainesville:Data released by the International Shark Attack File said Florida ranked No. 1 in the world for unprovoked shark bites in 2021. Florida had 28 unprovoked bites last year, compared to 19 in the rest of the U.S. and is consistent with Florida’s most recent five-year annual average of 25 attacks. Of Florida’s 28 unprovoked bites, 17 were in Volusia County, which includes Daytona Beach. Researchers with the ISAF, which is a division of the University of Florida’s Florida Museum of Natural History, scour media reports for news of shark bites, include reports from field researchers and verify with medical personnel the veracity of the information. “Unprovoked attacks” are defined as incidents in which a live human is bitten in the shark’s natural habitat with no human provocation of the shark, according to the report. “Provoked attacks” occur when a human initiates interaction with a shark in some way, including spearfishers, divers that harassed or tried to touch sharks, people that tried to feed, unhook or remove sharks from a fishing net.\n\nGeorgia\n\nGriffin: A pastor has denied he was holding people against their will in an unlicensed group home. However, police have charged Curtis Keith Bankston and his wife, Sophia Simm-Bankston, with false imprisonment in connection with the operation. Police said the couple at times locked as many as eight people in the basement, seizing control of their finances. Police said earlier this week city firefighters responded on Jan. 13 to a report of a person having a seizure at the location and found people were in a deadbolted basement, with paramedics climbing through a window to reach a patient. Police said they found the residents were all mentally or physically disabled and the Bankstons also controlled their medications and had denied medical care to residents. Dexter Wimbish, Curtis Keith Bankston’s attorney, told local news outlets on Thursday that his client hadn’t committed a crime. Police said the couple disguised the home as a ministry of Bankston’s church called One Step of Faith 2nd Chance. Investigators said the couple locked residents in the basement during parts of the day. Police said all the residents were moved to new homes.\n\nHawaii\n\nKahului: A reinforced fence has been installed around Kahului Airport on Maui after a deer blocked a runway earlier this month. Vinyl fencing now overlaps an existing wood fence surrounding the airport to prevent deer from squeezing through, Maui District Airports Manager Marvin Moniz told The Maui News. The added barrier installed for an estimated $100,000 will prevent a “small kitten” from getting through, Moniz said. Workers also cut brush growing along the fence to make it less appealing for hungry deer, Moniz said. Tens of thousands of invasive axis deer roam Maui. At one time, up to 700 axis deer were spotted around the perimeter of the airport fence, Moniz said, but that number has since reduced to about 300 as they move more north seeking greener pastures and water. Deer herds have also trampled trees and brush around the Molokai Airport. Gov. David Ige recently extended through March 7 an emergency disaster declaration for Maui County so the state can take measures to reduce and control the deer.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin asked legislative budget writers for $29,000 in taxpayer money to cover legal fees incurred after she lost a public records lawsuit. The Idaho Press Club sued McGeachin in July after several journalists said she wrongly denied public record requests for materials relating to her new Education Task Force. McGeachin lost the lawsuit, with the judge saying she acted in “bad faith” in denying access to the public documents. He ordered her to release the records and pay the Idaho Press Club’s legal fees, which came in just below $29,000. McGeachin hired a private attorney to represent her in the case rather than using the Idaho Attorney General’s office. That work cost her an additional unknown amount in legal fees, but she told the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee on Wednesday she was still “auditing” that bill, the Idaho Statesman reported.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man known as the “Dreadhead Cowboy” has pleaded guilty to animal cruelty in connection with a rush-hour horseback ride he took along Chicago’s Dan Ryan Expressway in 2020. Adam Hollingsworth pleaded guilty Friday to aggravated animal cruelty and was sentenced to a year in prison by a Cook County judge, court records showed. With credit he earned while on electronic home monitoring as his case was pending, Hollingsworth could be released from the Cook County Jail as early as Monday. Hollingsworth was arrested in September 2020 after disrupting traffic on the Dan Ryan Expressway while galloping his horse, Nunu, amid rush hour traffic in an act of civil disobedience he said was intended to draw attention to gun violence against children. Hollingsworth’s ride resulted in extensive delays on the expressway, with traffic backed up for miles. Officials initially said the horse was so severely injured by the 8-mile ride on asphalt that it might have to be euthanized, but Nunu was later reported to have significantly recovered.\n\nIndiana\n\nPeru: A historic barn that once housed elephants and tigers from well-known circuses and now is home to the International Circus Hall of Fame museum is in need of emergency repairs. Bob Cline, treasurer of the nonprofit hall of fame, said volunteers discovered in December that a main beam supporting an upper wall of the structure had rotted completely and given way, the Kokomo Tribune reported. The barn was built in 1922 by the American Circus Corporation. It is among several structures located east of Peru, in northern Indiana, that once served as the winter quarters for the world’s largest circuses, including Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey. The hall of fame has been working for years to preserve the structures. Cline said the $4,200 to repair the barn’s beam is just the “tip of the iceberg” of what needs to be done. The group is seeking donations to help cover costs for the project.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The Red Bull Soapbox Race – an extreme soapbox derby for adults – will make its Iowa debut this summer. Red Bull promotes several extreme sports to publicize its energy drink line and give consumers “wings.” Its soapbox race is similar to the traditional version for children in that carts coast downhill, but the Red Bull Soapbox Race challenges “the most fearless, fun-loving and foolhardy teams to prototype and create the wackiest of rides” using homemade carts, according to its website. Sponsors include West Des Moines-based Hy-Vee and Ankeny-based Casey’s. Casey’s plans to set up a committee that will look for the best “hometown racers” celebrating where racers are from and what they love about Casey’s. Winning hometown racers will receive free Casey’s pizza for a year. The Des Moines event will take place June 18, with the course running along East Walnut Street just south of the state Capitol, from East 12th to East 7th streets. Those interested in entering a cart for the race can apply now.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:Clipeez salon is catering to the needs of children and parents, with child-friendly salon chairs that look like firetrucks, airplanes and more. Owner Amanda Rice, who has been a stylist for almost a decade, said she has dreamed of opening a business like Clipeez since she was in beauty school. Rice said she has learned tricks over the years to help children feel at ease while getting their hair cut. With two children of her own, she knows haircuts can be a stressful experience for some children. Rice’s small customers also are greeted with a play area that includes a chalkboard wall for drawing, child-sized tables and chairs, and a variety of toys and activities to keep them busy while they wait. Although Clipeez is a child-focused salon, Rice said customers of all ages are welcome. Parents can schedule a haircut for themselves, knowing their child will be entertained during the appointment. Rice is the only stylist taking appointments at Clipeez but is in the process of hiring additional help. She said she hopes to add five to six stylists to her team so Clipeez can offer walk in appointment options in the future.\n\nKentucky\n\nLivermore: This city in western Kentucky has become certified as the 25th trail town in the state, officials said. Livermore in McLean County received its certification from the Kentucky Department of Tourism, officials said in a statement. The tourism and economic development program provides a strategic plan for communities, which commit to sharing outdoor opportunities, culture, history and stories with visitors looking for adventure, the Kentucky Department of Tourism said. Livermore offers paddling on the Rough and Green rivers and cycling on three new routes, officials said. “There are thousands of miles of trails and waterways throughout the commonwealth,” Department of Tourism Commissioner Mike Mangeot said. “These trail towns offer the perfect destination for long-distance adventures or day trips and we are excited to have Livermore join the other 24 destinations who have received this designation.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A worker on a crew replacing corroded grating on an oil platform wasn’t wearing his safety lifeline when he fell to his death off Louisiana in May 2020, the federal offshore safety agency said. The man stood on grating after he and another worker had cut through its metal crossbars so it could be removed in sections, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said. He died after falling 50 feet. The job safety plan said such cutting, called ripping, should be done in sections but the crew “proceeded to rip the entirety of the work area,” weakening it, according to the report. Workers had set out the safety gear called a self-retracting lanyard but didn’t put it on, the report said. The rig operator and the man’s supervisors also contributed to the accident, the agency said. The man was not identified. His employer, Fluid Crane and Construction Co. of New Iberia, had no comment. The rig’s operator, Fieldwood Energy LLC, is reorganizing under a bankruptcy court administrator. Its website shows only the administrator as a contact. Neither the administrator nor Fieldwood’s bankruptcy attorneys responded to emails requesting comment.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Maine wildlife managers will soon start accepting applications for the 2022 moose hunt, which will follow a year in which hunters had limited success. Tens of thousands of hunters typically apply for a spot in the state moose permit lottery. The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife said it will start accepting applications in February. The lottery typically happens in June and then the hunt is in the fall. The wildlife department said 68% of hunters killed a moose during the 2021 hunt. That was the third-lowest success rate in the four-decade history of the modern hunt, the Bangor Daily News reported.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:New housing in Ocean City is scheduled to be built at Philadelphia Avenue and Dolphin Street. On Friday, SVN Miller announced that Dolphin Street Development has purchased the corner parcel and plans to build 22 “upscale townhomes” on the property. Dolphin Street Development Owner Jeff Thaler isn’t a stranger to Ocean City development and has completed numerous projects in the area. SVN Miller’s release did not say when construction would begin. This announcement came a month after the Ocean City Town Council approved conceptual plans to build workforce housing between Somerset and Dorchester streets.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMethuen: The city’s first female firefighter has been promoted to captain after a state board ruled in her favor, saying she was passed over for a promotion because of her gender and favoritism in the department. City officials approved Tracy Blanchette’s promotion to captain of the Methuen Fire Department at the request of Fire Chief Tim Sheehy, The Eagle-Tribune reported Friday. The promotion followed the Civil Service Commission’s ruling in November that stated Blanchette was passed over for a promotion from private to captain because of her gender. According to Blanchette and witnesses who testified before the commission, the department fostered an environment of “mutual back-scratching employment culture” among male firefighters. The commission also ruled that Blanchette receive back pay at a captain’s salary dating back to February 2019, when she was passed over for the promotion. Blanchette also filed a sexual discrimination suit against the city in November 2020, seeking $2.75 million in damages, the newspaper reported.\n\nMichigan\n\nSt. Clair Shores: It’s rusty and no longer needed, but a 165-foot water tower still has fans in a Detroit suburb. St. Clair Shores City Council member David Rubello wants to save the tower, which stands at the city’s golf course, The Macomb Daily reported. The tower was built in the 1920s to improve water pressure in the community but now is obsolete. To some, it’s a local landmark that deserves love. “I hate to see any part of the history of St. Clair Shores destroyed,” Rubello said. “If the people of our community can come together and save this tower, that would be amazing and a win.” He has proposed finding a company that would pay to repair it in exchange for placing advertising on the tower. It could cost roughly $400,000 – 10 times the cost to demolish it. Tall structures can be converted into wireless phone towers, but the area appears to be covered. “It has become part of the landscape. Sadly, demolition looks to be the proper choice,” said Chris Rayes, community development and inspections director. The council voted to table the issue for six months.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A state appeals court on Monday issued a mixed opinion in a complicated case contesting one of the key permits that a St. Paul-based company needs to build what would be the state’s first copper-nickel mine. The Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed a decision by regulators to issue the PolyMet Mining Corp. a water quality permit for the project. It now goes back to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to determine whether any pollution discharges from the mine into groundwater would violate the federal Clean Water Act. However, the three-judge panel rejected several other arguments from PolyMet’s opponents. Among them, there was a demand for more stringent limits on the treated wastewater that’s discharged from the mine and a call for a contested case hearing to gather more evidence and testimony on certain aspects of the permit before a neutral judge, Minnesota Public Radio News reported.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:Parts of Mississippi’s capital city have had little or no water pressure in recent days because of broken pipes and problems at a water treatment plant. Areas with higher elevation in south Jackson have been most affected. Problems started Thursday after a major water main broke, and other water lines have broken since then, the Clarion-Ledger reported. On Monday, low water pressure forced four Jackson public schools to have classes online instead of in person and students from four elementary schools were sent to other campuses. City engineer Charles Williams told news outlets he expected crews to make significant progress in restoring service this week. “We are seeing improvements and will continue to see those improvements over the next couple of days,” Williams said during a news conference Monday. “We just ask for patience from our residents. We know they’re frustrated with this, especially in south Jackson.” Multiple pipes broke when temperatures dropped below freezing. The city had problems with a membrane system at a treatment plant, which delayed the crews’ ability to fully restore water pressure to all residents, WAPT-TV reported.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: Eastern Missouri prosecutors have refiled a felony terrorist threat charge against a man accused of livestreaming threats to bomb and kill people while he was dressed as the Batman villain known as The Joker. St. Louis County prosecutors refiled the charge Friday against Jeremy Garnier, 50, of University City, a day after a judge dismissed the case because prosecutors could not produce a key witness for the grand jury, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Garnier was arrested in March 2020 in a University City restaurant in the midst of his livestream. In it, prosecutors said, he was dressed as The Joker and ordered a soda in the restaurant, saying: “I can’t be inebriated when I’m planning on, you know, killing a bunch of people.” Garnier’s costume and alleged threats were reminiscent of a 2012 shooting in Aurora, Colorado, in which 12 people were killed and dozens injured during the showing of the Batman movie “The Dark Knight Rises.” Shooter James Holmes, who was dressed as The Joker during the shooting, received multiple life sentences after a jury couldn’t agree unanimously on a death sentence.\n\nMontana\n\nRonan: The Flathead Water Compact officially got in gear managing one of the Flathead Indian Reservation’s most valuable assets, water rights on the 1.3 million-acre reservation. On Thursday, four new board members took their seats and outlined the rules for granting, managing and enforcing the water rights, which include drinking-water wells, irrigation water, river flows, wetlands, high-mountain lakes, and some of the reservoir behind Hungry Horse Dam. “This is a landmark day for the tribes and the state,” board member Teresa Wall-McDonald said. “With continued cooperation, we can work through any challenge that presents itself.” The CSKT Tribal Council appointed Wall-McDonald, head of the Tribal Lands Department, and Tribal Services Director Clayton Matt to the board, the Missoulian reported. Gov. Greg Gianforte appointed geologist Roger Noble and attorney Ken Pitt. Their first job was to pick a fifth member, which they agreed to choose from a list of five people put forth by the CSKT and governor’s office, at their next meeting. The U.S. Interior Department will also appoint a sixth, nonvoting member to the board. The second, and much larger, task is to set up staff to redo all the previous water rights and get future allocations going. That includes hiring a lead water engineer and a team of five technicians, along with record-keepers and other staff.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Contract talks between the biggest freight railroads and unions that represent 105,000 employees are headed to mediation this week after the unions declared an impasse following more than two years of negotiations. The unions said Monday the contract talks had deadlocked because the railroads are still seeking concessions, even after workers remained on the job throughout the pandemic and endured significant staff cuts in recent years as the railroads overhauled their operations. Michael Maratto, general counsel of the National Railway Labor Conference that represents the railroads, said it is routine for federal mediators to get involved in contract talks, and the railroads welcome their help in reaching an agreement. The NRLC group is negotiating on behalf of more than 30 railroads, including Union Pacific, BNSF, Norfolk Southern, CSX and Kansas City Southern. Since 2017, the major freight railroads have collectively cut more than 20% of their staff as the industry adopted a new operating model called Precision Scheduled Railroading. It calls for running fewer, longer trains with a mix of freight to reduce the number of crews and locomotives needed to deliver millions of tons of goods nationwide. Unions have said the widespread cuts have spread employees thin, raising concerns about whether defects that could cause derailments will be missed during inspections or allowed to linger in the rail network because routine maintenance has been delayed.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Hard Rock International, owners of the Mirage Hotel & Casino, said it plans to demolish the property’s iconic volcano as part of a major renovation plan, KLAS-TV reported. Hard Rock International Chief Executive Officer Jim Allen confirmed plans to rebrand the resort and get rid of the entire front area. A guitar-shaped hotel will take over, according to a recent rendering. MGM Resorts International, the previous owner, said in a statement it will license The Mirage name and brand to Hard Rock for the next few years while the rebranding process continues. Some are not happy with the decision to do away with the volcano. An online petition on change.org to save the Mirage volcano had gathered more than 1,500 signatures as of Monday.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRye: A flock of 10 loons rescued on frozen Lake Winnipesaukee was released Monday into the Atlantic Ocean. WMUR-TV reported the 10 adult loons trapped on Lake Winnipesaukee were rescued Saturday by members of the New Hampshire’s Loon Preservation Committee. “It could just be that they stuck around a little bit too long because the lake was still open, the fishing was good, and then they molted those flight feathers and as the water started to come in it was too late for them to be able to leave,” said the committee’s Carolyn Hughes. Loons commonly spend the summer and fall months on inland lakes where they breed and raise their young. Loons typically spend the winter on the ocean. The birds were examined on Sunday and found to be in good health.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy has tapped Sarah Adelman, the acting head of the state Department of Human Services, to become the commissioner of the state agency. Murphy said Adelman has successfully led the department since taking over on an interim basis in January 2021. She stepped in after Commissioner Carole Johnson left Murphy’s Cabinet for the Biden administration, where she was tapped to oversee COVID-19 testing. Adelman previously served as a deputy commissioner at the department, overseeing a number of divisions, including one that oversees NJ FamilyCare, which is the state’s program to provide health care for children and lower-income residents. She also has served on the board of the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, and before joining the Murphy administration was an executive at the New Jersey Association of Health Plans. The Human Services Department is one of the state’s biggest agencies, with 7,400 employees and a $20 billion budget, which includes state and federal funds. Adelman’s nomination is subject to confirmation by the state Senate.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Two COVID-19 testing sites that were not on the list of facilities approved by state public health officials have closed indefinitely. The Santa Fe New Mexican reported the New Mexico Attorney General’s Office said in a statement it will investigate the Illinois-based operator, Center for COVID Control. The operator ran roughly 300 testing sites nationwide, including one in Santa Fe and one in Albuquerque. According to its website, sites are closed so that all staff can undergo more training. Center for COVID Control has been riddled with allegations, including falsely billing the federal government for tests for people who had health insurance, falsifying test results and being unhygienic.\n\nNew York\n\nLake George:Ice Castles, a new winter attraction in Lake George that features a wintry playground of tunnels, slides and sculptures all made from ice, opened Sunday. In early December, ice artisans began growing and harvesting icicles to create the frozen attraction that is expected to draw tens of thousands of visitors. Each day, they harvested and hand-placed up to 10,000 icicles to build the acre-sized winter experience. About 25 million pounds of ice went into the creation. The frozen playground includes ice-carved slides, tunnels, fountains, crawl spaces, caverns, and intricately carved ice thrones. At night, color-changing LED lights embedded in the ice create a beautiful glow. Tickets, which range from $15 to $27 a person, are on sale at www.icecastles.com/new-york.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The Department of Natural and Cultural Resources said a record 22.8 million visitors entered the system’s 41 parks, recreation areas and natural areas in 2021, WRAL-TV reported. That’s a 15% increase from the 19.8 million visitors in 2020, when visits surged as more people sought outdoor activities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Jockey’s Ridge State Park was the most visited park in 2021 with more than 1.8 million visitors, about 100,000 fewer than in 2020. The second-most frequented park, Jordan Lake State Recreation Area, saw the largest growth, up 84% from the nearly 877,000 visitors in 2020. Falls Lake State Recreation Area came in third and saw 46% growth last year. Nearly 1.5 million people traveled to the Wake Forest location, up from the 1 million visitors in 2020.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Officials said a produced water spill at an oil well near Watford City Sunday was the result of vandalism. North Dakota Oil and Gas Division officials said valves were opened on the location, leading to a spill of more than 18,000 gallons. Most of the wastewater had been recovered by vacuum trucks, officials said. Produced water is a mixture of saltwater and oil that can contain drilling chemicals. It’s a byproduct of oil and gas development. A state inspector has been to the Abraxas Petroleum Corp. site and will monitor the cleanup.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohio has settled an environmental lawsuit with Volkswagen over the company’s 2015 emissions scandal for $3.5 million, state Attorney General Dave Yost said. As that scandal unfolded, the automaker was found to have rigged its vehicles to cheat U.S. diesel emissions tests. and ultimately paid more than $33 billion in fines and settlements. The Ohio Attorney General’s Office also sued the company, alleging Volkswagen’s conduct – affecting about 14,000 vehicles sold or leased in Ohio – violated the state’s anti-air pollution law. The Ohio Supreme Court ruled in June the federal Clean Air Act did not preclude Ohio from seeking its own compensation against Volkswagen. In November the U.S. Supreme Court turned away Volkswagen’s appeals. In settling the lawsuit, Volkswagen did not admit liability. “This agreement fully resolves Ohio’s legacy claims and puts this matter behind the company as we focus on building a future of sustainable mobility,” Volkswagen said in a statement.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The Cherokee Nation Film Office has unveiled plans for a new incentive program offering up to $1 million in annual funding for productions filmed within the Cherokee Nation in northeastern Oklahoma. The 7,000 square-mile Cherokee Nation spans all or parts of 14 Oklahoma counties: Adair, Cherokee, Craig, Delaware, Mayes, McIntosh, Muskogee, Nowata, Ottawa, Rogers, Sequoyah, Tulsa, Wagoner, and Washington. The specialized film incentive is devised to generate economic development and jobs in the Cherokee Nation, as well as to help Oklahoma’s burgeoning film industry continue to grow, the tribe announced Tuesday in a virtual news conference. Plus, the new incentive will provide additional funding for employing Native American citizens and using Native-owned businesses. It is billed as the first tribal film incentive program in the United States. The tribal film office will begin accepting applications for the tribe’s film incentive on March 1. The base incentive offers a cash rebate for qualified production expenses. Prequalified productions filming anywhere in Cherokee Nation are eligible for the rebate.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Supreme Court has OK’d a proposal that would give would-be lawyers the option to skip the bar exam and instead become licensed to practice law through experience or supervision. The state’s highest court in a unanimous vote “expressed approval in concept” to two alternative pathways designed for law students and postgraduates seeking admittance to the state bar, according to draft minutes from the court’s Tuesday business meeting. The court disbanded a previous task force and ordered the Oregon Board of Bar Examiners to convene new committees to further develop the proposals, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. Brian Gallini, dean of the Willamette University College of Law, said one proposed alternative would allow Oregon law school students to become licensed attorneys after completing a standard curriculum and likely a capstone project. The other proposed alternative is tailored for out-of-state applicants and would require would-be lawyers to spend 1,000 to 1,500 hours with a licensed Oregon attorney. Many attorneys-in-training would likely continue to take the arduous bar test, as students who score high enough on the uniform exam can be admitted to practice law anywhere in the state.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State authorities said Scranton has been removed from a program for financially distressed municipalities after three decades. The Department of Community and Economic Development said Tuesday the decision was made after “a thorough review” of city audits and financial data, as well as the record from a November public hearing. Secretary Dennis Davin credited “years of hard work and collaboration” on the part of residents, businesses and others. Scranton was designated as distressed in 1992 under the Municipalities Financial Recovery Act or Act 47 following “years of recurring deficits, ineffective financial management practices and unfavorable socioeconomic and demographic trends,” the department said. State officials credited the mayor and city council for working together to help the city “prepare and follow realistic budgets and find ways to improve services while cutting costs.” Monetization of the sewer authority also provided funds to address pension shortfalls and pay off punitive loans, officials said. Officials said Scranton is the 16th municipality to exit the Act 47 program enacted in 1987 to provide fiscal management oversight, technical assistance, planning and financial aid to municipalities experiencing severe fiscal distress.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has reached a settlement of more than $114 million with an opioid manufacturer and three distributors, most of which will go directly to fighting the crisis and helping people with addiction, state Attorney General Peter Neronha said. The settlement includes $21.1 million from Johnson & Johnson and an additional $90.8 million from AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson, he said at a news conference. The money is an addition to a $2.6 million settlement reached with McKinsey & Co. last year. Rhode Island’s settlement is separate from a $21 billion global settlement proposed for other states. Rhode Island was not satisfied with how much it would have received under the global settlement and did better this way, Neronha said, noting the state did better than other New England states that signed onto the global settlement.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster is considering whether to sign into law a bill that would make it easier for businesses that recycle plastic by melting it to open in the state. The bill passed both chambers of the General Assembly on Thursday after a group of House and Senate lawmakers worked out a compromise. Supporters said recycling plastic this way is a safe business and good for the environment because it reduces trash in landfills. Opponents of the bill said melting plastic to recycle it is an unproven industry and it’s not enough to require firms that use the technique to pay a bond to promise to clean up any excessive pollution for five years after the law goes into effect. The five-year bond requirement was a compromise after the bill’s original three-year requirement stalled the proposal in 2021. A spokesman for the governor said McMaster is reviewing the bill.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: A state House committee approved a proposal to prod school districts to use most of their boost in state funding for teachers’ salaries. The Republican-dominated committee approved the bill on an 8-6 vote, sending it to debate on the House floor. Lawmakers were also considering whether to approve a historic 6% boost in state funding for schools to keep up with inflation. In recent years, South Dakota has been trying to climb up the rankings of states with the lowest average teacher pay in the country. But even as a 2016 sales tax hike channeled more money to school districts, South Dakota’s average teacher pay has remained among the lowest in the nation. Republican Rep. Hugh Bartels is championing the bill, which would extend for three years a requirement that came with the 2016 tax plan. It would require school districts to use at least 85% of their funding increase for teachers’ salaries and benefits. School districts would risk losing funding if they don’t at least match average teacher compensation from 2017, but they could also apply for a waiver if they fail to.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Security officers at Tennessee’s major airports found more than 280 guns in passengers’ carry-on luggage in 2021, a significant increase from prior years, officials said. The 283 guns found last year at security checkpoints in airports in Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga and the Tri-Cities area surpassed the 162 weapons discovered in 2020 and exceeded the total of 181 guns found in 2019, Transportation Security Administration spokesman Mark Howell said in a news release. Nashville International Airport led with 163 firearms found in 2021, more than the total found at the other four airports. The TSA screened about 10.7 million departing travelers at the five airports, an 88% increase over the number screened in 2020, the news release said. Travelers face criminal and civil penalties for bringing firearms to a security checkpoint. Guns can be transported on a commercial aircraft only if they are unloaded, packed in a locked, hard-sided case and placed in checked baggage, the TSA said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:An 812-acre fire that ignited Jan. 18 and caused at least 250 families to flee from their homes in central Bastrop County after officials said a prescribed burn in Bastrop State Park grew out of control, was 100% contained Monday night, the Texas A&M Forest Service said. “The fire received beneficial rainfall today,” the forest service said Monday. Bastrop County Judge Paul Pape told the Advertiser on Friday that the fire management team’s strategy going into the weekend was to let the fire burn itself out within its footprint and to maintain security around the fire’s perimeter.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar Hills: A teenager was seriously injured in a sledding accident just as health officials were giving out helmets and warning of the sport’s potential hazard’s at a nearby safety event. The accident – at a popular sledding site known as “the Bowl” in American Fork Canyon south of Salt Lake City – came as doctors in the area have reported more serious sledding accidents and a doubling in head injuries, KSL-TV reported. The 16-year-old injured on Saturday was airlifted to a hospital in stable condition after receiving a serious cut to the head. Medical workers and first responders nearby had been seeking to raise awareness about safety and encouraging the use of helmets.\n\nVermont\n\nElmore: The city is asking the U.S. Postal Service to renew a contract with a local store to retain an outpost where people can collect their packages and mail. The post office at the back of The Elmore Store serves fewer than 1,000 people and could close as early as February, New England Cable News reported. The store was taken over by new owners at the beginning of January, according to its Facebook page. In a statement, the Postal Service told New England Cable News: “The business that runs this unit has recently been sold and the Postal Service is in the process of negotiating a contract with the new owner. If there is any change to service there, Post Office Box customers will be given advance notice.” If the post office closes, free mail delivery would be available to residents, but some do not want their packages left outside in the weather, or for other reasons prefer to rent a post office box at the store.\n\nVirginia\n\nHampton: A newborn husky stolen from an eastern Virginia pet salon has been found and reunited with her mother, but the dogs’ owner said two more puppies from the litter of six are still missing. Bandi Murdock, who owns the dogs and the Critter Cleaners pet salon in Hampton, said the female puppy was returned Sunday, the Virginian-Pilot reported. The six puppies were stolen from the pet salon early Friday, but three were recovered quickly. Hampton police announced Saturday a homeless man had been charged with breaking into Critter Cleaners, animal larceny and other crimes in connection with the theft of the puppies, each about 2 weeks old. Officers and the business owner said someone entered through a window and took money and the puppies early Friday. There was surveillance video. Police found two puppies in the home of an acquaintance of the suspect, according to Murdock, who said she reimbursed a woman who returned a third dog she bought for $100. On Sunday, a woman contacted police to report that her boyfriend bought the fourth puppy and she wanted to return the puppy to her owners, Murdock said. Officers met the woman and Animal Control checked the puppy. Murdock said she and her husband gave the woman a $100 reward, then rushed the puppy to her mother, Nala. “Everybody’s doing great,” Murdock said of the recovered puppies and their mother. “They were all very hungry, but they’re all doing good.” The puppies must be nursed by their mother until they’re at least 4 weeks old, so it’s critical to return them to Nala, Murdock said. Anyone with information about the remaining two puppies is asked to contact Hampton police.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: Flights departing and arriving at Paine Field in Everett were canceled Tuesday morning, as foggy weather and new 5G restrictions hampered the airport’s operation. The Seattle Times repotred all commercial flights out of the small airport were canceled on Monday. On Tuesday morning, the first four outgoing flights were also canceled, according to flight trackers, as were the morning’s first arrivals. Alaska Air, whose regional carrier Horizon Air is the only commercial airline operating out of Paine Field, warned that cancellations could continue for several days and was offering some accommodations to affected travelers. Ticket-holders can reschedule their flights for later this week at no additional cost, or try to reschedule their trips to depart from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. The Federal Aviation Administration has imposed limitations on low-visibility flying to avoid 5G interference with cockpit instruments. That has created a problem specific to the Embraer E175 regional jets that operate out of Paine Field and to certain airports, including Paine Field and Portland International Airport.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Signaling an eagerness to diversify its energy offerings, coal-dependent West Virginia would eliminate a ban on nuclear power plants under a bill that passed the state Senate on Tuesday. The bill was approved on a 24-7 vote. Three senators did not vote. A similar bill is pending in the House of Delegates. The state’s ban on nuclear plants was enacted in 1996, but nuclear power has in recent years gained support as a tool to keep climate change under control, with proponents noting that it emits few planet-damaging emissions and is safer on average than nearly any other energy source. “All this bill does is simply says we’re open to discussion. That’s it,” said Kanawha County Republican Sen. Tom Takubo, the bill’s sponsor. “We’re not close-minded. “I think it’s important for West Virginia to be looking forward to the future, looking forward to diversify, and simply say to the rest of the world we are open for discussion should this technology come to our mountain state.” West Virginia is the nation’s second-largest coal producer, behind Wyoming, and accounted for 5% of the nation’s total energy production in 2019, ranking fifth among the states, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But West Virginia has lost thousands of coal jobs in the past decade as companies and utilities explore using other energy sources such as natural gas, solar and wind.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans who control the state Assembly were set to approve bills Tuesday that would require employers to count a prior coronavirus infection as an alternative to vaccination and testing and prohibit vaccine passports. Both measures would face a likely veto from Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. The governor last year vetoed a GOP bill that would have barred public health officials from requiring people get vaccinated. Republican backers maintain natural immunity is at least as effective as being vaccinated. Similar bills passed in Florida and Arkansas last year. A number of Wisconsin medical groups, including the Wisconsin Medical Society, oppose the measure, arguing vaccination is the best way to protect against COVID-19 and it’s not known how long natural immunity lasts. Data from the state health department showed unvaccinated people are hospitalized at a rate nearly 11 times higher than fully vaccinated people. No groups have registered in support the proposal.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Wyoming’s first Black sheriff last year fired a white deputy who is accused of tormenting a Black subordinate for years with racist name-calling that led him to quit, a new federal lawsuit revealed. Albany County Patrol Sgt. Christian Handley once drove past and yelled a profanity and the N-word at Cpl. Jamin Johnson while Johnson and his wife and children were walking out of their home, according to one example of racism alleged in the discrimination lawsuit filed last week. “Mr. Handley later apologized for having not realized that Mr. Johnson’s family was present, as if his vile racism was otherwise acceptable,” the lawsuit said. Johnson is suing Handley, seeking a jury trial if necessary and damages for the years of racism that he said led up to his decision to quit in 2017. The allegations put a new spotlight on the sheriff’s office in Laramie, the Albany County seat known for the murder of gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard in 1998, a crime that drew unprecedented attention to LGBTQ rights and hate crimes. The racism allegations came after Sheriff Aaron Appelhans’ appointment as Wyoming’s first Black sheriff in the wake of an outcry in Laramie over a deputy’s 2018 shooting of an unarmed man who had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Handley used racial slurs to refer not only to Johnson but to Black citizens he came in contact with on the job, including four University of Wyoming students who were in a vehicle he once pulled over, according to Johnson’s lawsuit against Handley, filed Jan. 18 in U.S. District Court in Cheyenne. The suit didn’t provide the reason for the stop. Handley declined to comment when reached by phone and asked about the lawsuit Monday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2024/08/05/florida-shark-attacks/74522397007/", "title": "Florida shark attacks: How bystanders saved two lives", "text": "Aug. 5, 2024 Updated Aug. 21, 2024, 12:40 p.m. ET\n\nSOUTH WALTON BEACH, Fla. – On a bright blue day at the end of May, Andrew Cady dropped his Sea-Doos into Lake Powell in the Florida panhandle, and he and his two daughters gunned them toward the ocean.\n\nThe lake is separated from the salt water of the Gulf of Mexico by a narrow strip of brilliant white sand called Inlet Beach. Cady and his daughters, 11 and 16, were locals from nearby Watersound and knew how to pick their way out of the lake past the beaches filled with vacationers.\n\nThree months earlier, a team with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had dredged open the silt-filled inlet, allowing a stream of fresh lake water, along with its fish and marine life, to pour through the barrier island and into the Gulf.\n\nAs the two watercraft idled through the pass, Cady had a bird’s-eye view of the white sand on either side of them and the blue-green water that surged below. Then, a dark shadow raced past.\n\nAs one of his daughters filmed the scene with a camera from one of the skis, Cady looked at the families splashing along the sand on either side and began shouting.\n\n“Shark!” he yelled. “Out of the water!”\n\nThe video shows the dark figure racing along the shore, so fast it looks more like flying than swimming.\n\nA man carrying a young girl stumbled onto the beach as the shark darted toward him, making it out of the water just in time. Then the dark shadow wove between the two Sea-Doos and along the sand.\n\nCady and his daughters watched as the dagger-shaped shadow disappeared. He wouldn’t post the video to Facebook until two weeks later when his hometown was suddenly a national headline.\n\nOn June 7, another day’s blue sky stretched across the beaches that skirt the stretch of Florida coast known locally as “30A,” for the county highway that backs the dunes. Scores of sunbathers splayed on towels or under beach tents.\n\nWatersound Beach, a few miles west of the Lake Powell inlet, is a private stretch accessible only to one nearby community. That day, the two sandbars off its shore, at 30 and 60 yards out, were dotted with bodysurfers and swimmers.\n\nAmong them were Elisabeth Foley, 50, on vacation from Virginia with her husband, Ryan, and their three children, Dominick, 13, Lyla, 15 and Laurel, 17, who splashed happily in the shallow waters of the first sandbar.\n\nKeith Harrison, 53, a neuropathologist visiting with his family from Birmingham, Alabama, was also at the first sandbar with his two sons, ages 9 and 12, bodysurfing the short waves. They were at the tail end of a weeklong family trip, and for the first few days, the water at Watersound had been a little murky. But on Friday, it was crystalline, and they planned to enjoy it.\n\nThen, screams.\n\nHarrison at first thought they were from kids playing. But as he turned toward the commotion, he saw a plume of blood spreading in the water. He left his kids to his wife and ran toward it. As he arrived, he saw Elisabeth Foley emerging from the water – half of her left forearm and her hand were missing. Flesh from her buttocks hung in ribbons and blood poured from her pelvis. Her three children wailed around her. Her husband, Ryan, held her up.\n\nJust behind them, Harrison saw a shadowy figure lurking in the water, keeping strangely still in the crimson-tinged tide. Another witness, an avid diver in the region, identified it as a bull shark.\n\nHarrison grabbed Elisabeth from her husband and carried her toward shore, as Ryan wrangled the kids. As he clamped his hand around Elisabeth’s left brachial artery – the vessel that supplies blood to the arm – he took in the scene. A word sprang into his mind: “horrific.”\n\nRylee Smith, Bailey Massa and Abby Juedemann had spent all morning at Watersound Beach, swimming and sunbathing. The three of them, plus a fourth friend, had driven all night from Columbia, Missouri, for a girls’ beach weekend.\n\nAll were friends from their medical jobs – Smith, 22, was a paramedic; Massa, 23, an emergency room nurse; Juedemann, 22, was a nurse for a medical specialist. Earlier that day, they had picked up mahi mahi sandwiches for lunch. Under their beach tent, they marveled at how blue the sky and water were.\n\nThe screams jolted them out of their Friday laze.\n\nSmith looked out at the water and saw it turn red. Shark attack, she thought instantly. Her paramedic instincts surging, she jumped out of her beach chair.\n\n“You guys ready?” Smith asked her friends.\n\n“For what?” one of them replied.\n\nShe flung off her sunhat, grabbed a towel and ran toward the shoreline. Her friends followed close behind.\n\nIn the water, the two men neared the sand. Elisabeth was in their arms, and she was dying.\n\nMore people, more sharks\n\nShark attacks remain a statistical rarity.\n\nFor the more than 7 billion people in the world – about half of whom live within about 100 miles of the ocean – the number of shark attacks is vanishingly small: about 60 bites and an average of six fatalities per year. You’re more likely to die from a lightning strike than suffer a serious shark attack.\n\nStill, Florida leads the world in shark attacks. The state, with more than 8,000 miles of coastline, saw 16 unprovoked attacks last year – putting it higher than California (2), Hawaii (8) and all of Australia (15), according to the International Shark Attack File at the Florida Museum of Natural History.\n\nThe sheer number of people wading into Florida waters – the state welcomed 140 million visitors last year, with about 40% of them hitting the beach – also helps make attacks more likely in the state. The east coast, from Miami to St. Augustine, has denser coastal populations and sees the majority of Florida’s shark attacks.\n\nFew moments etched the idea of shark attacks into the American experience more than the 1975 blockbuster movie “Jaws.”\n\nThough the hit movie focused on great white sharks, it helped spur an interest in the human pursuit of sharks of all varieties, said Cassidy Peterson, a researcher at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, who has studied shark population trends.\n\n“That actually had a big impact on recreational shark fishing,” she said.\n\nGlobal trade relations, though, had perhaps the bigger impact.\n\nIn 1979, after the U.S. and China normalized trade relations, Peterson said, American fisheries rushed to harvest sharks for fins and other parts that served as delicacies in China.\n\nAs shark populations plummeted, the federal government stepped in. Starting in 1993, a series of management plans and regulations by NOAA helped the populations rebound, Peterson said.\n\nDean Grubbs, director of Florida State University’s Coastal & Marine Laboratory, has conducted surveys of coastal sharks in the Gulf of Mexico for more than a decade and has seen NOAA’s management efforts help shark populations slowly return to pre-1970s levels.\n\n“You now have relatively healthy shark populations in the U.S.,” Grubbs said, whose teams survey sharks from Apalachicola Bay on the Florida panhandle to Tampa.\n\nMarine life is not the only population surging along the Florida coast.\n\nThe number of yearly visitors to the state was 82 million in 2010. Last year, that number nearly doubled, according to the state tourism agency. And the percentage of visitors spending time at the beach or waterfront doubled in that time, from 20% in 2010 to nearly 40% – or 56 million people – last year.\n\nThe results seem inevitable, said Gavin Naylor, who directs the Florida Program for Shark Research at the Florida Museum of Natural History and oversees the International Shark Attack File.\n\n“As you have more and more people using those areas for recreation,” he said, “then, absolutely, we can expect there's going to be more interactions between people and sharks.”\n\nThe two populations live separately – one in the ocean, the other on land – until that moment they interact. Usually, that moment happens along a line of sparkling white sand, like the one along State Road 30A.\n\nOn June 7, those panhandle beaches were full of people, and families like Elisabeth Foley’s. Even as the people around her struggled to pull her from the water, other swimmers just down the coast waded into the water, unaware of what was coming.\n\n‘She is losing blood fast’\n\nHarrison, the specialist doctor, and Elisabeth’s husband carried her to shore and set her down on the sand. There, Harrison met Smith, the paramedic, Massa, the nurse, and another man who identified himself as a Navy SEAL. Smith dropped to her right side and pushed a towel on her mauled pelvic area. She closed her hands into fists and pushed down with all her might on the crevice where Elisabeth’s right leg met her waist, leaning on the severed femoral artery to try to stanch the bleeding.\n\nMassa called 911 and relayed details of the injuries. The sailor put pressure on the other femoral artery, while Harrison’s sister-in-law, Amy Jones, wrapped what was left of Elisabeth’s left arm in a towel. Juedemann tried to keep Elisabeth awake. Ryan, her husband, knelt at her side, telling her how he loved her and praying with her.\n\nHarrison continued squeezing down on the brachial artery in the arm, trying to control the bleeding. He tried to tourniquet the arm at the armpit, first with a wet towel then a Croakies sunglass strap. Nothing worked. He continued pressing the brachial artery against the humerus bone in her upper arm. The bleeding slowed but the towels became saturated with blood. All around them, people, including Elisabeth’s children, screamed.\n\nPhone calls poured into the county’s emergency call center. A log of those calls captures the chaos of the scene:\n\n13:21:26: SHARK ATTACK\n\n13:22:07: SCREAMING IN BACKGROUND\n\n13:23:07: HAND MISSING\n\n13:23:13: PEOPLE ARE YELLING\n\n13:29:01: SHE IS LOSING BLOOD FAST\n\n“Everyone was focused on what was in front of them,” Harrison recalled later. “But it was utter chaos.”\n\nAlyssa Huffman was in waist-deep water with her sister and 14-year-old nephew when they heard the screams. She raced toward the shoreline and Elisabeth. Huffman, 44, founder and chief executive of a spine and orthopedic implant company in Springfield, Missouri, grew up vacationing on the same stretch of coast and had trained as a lifeguard. She knew the beaches well.\n\nHuffman ran toward the screams and was immediately struck by how ashen Elisabeth was. Her skin had drained of nearly all its color and her lips were white. She was still conscious but losing a lot of blood and dangerously close to slipping into shock. Huffman dropped next to her and cradled her head in her hands.\n\nShe asked Elisabeth if she wanted to pray. Elisabeth nodded. The two recited the Serenity Prayer: Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Each time she noticed Elisabeth nodding off, Huffman rubbed sand on her cheek to keep her awake.\n\n“Your children are here watching,” she told Elisabeth. “I need you to remember what it was like the last five minutes of delivery, remember how miserable that was. This is your marathon … This is going to go on for a while. The one thing you can do to show your kids how strong you are is breathe.”\n\nHuffman led Elisabeth through a series of breathing exercises: four seconds in, four seconds out. Slow, steady.\n\n“You have to be strong and you have to breathe,” she told Elisabeth. “And we’re going to pray together.”\n\n‘Where’s the cavalry?’\n\nJacob Cherry was at the community swimming pool on the other side of the dunes when his mother-in-law called. There was some commotion on the beach, perhaps a medical emergency.\n\nCherry, a certified registered nurse anesthetist also from Springfield, Missouri, figured it was someone fainting from the heat. Still, he headed down to the beach to see if he could help.\n\nIt was a quarter-mile jog on the boardwalk over beach dunes, then down a flight of steps, and then another 100 yards on the sand to reach the scene.\n\nThough he was barefoot, as he got nearer, his jog grew to a sprint.\n\nCherry edged his way through the crowd and knelt next to Elisabeth and took over the duties of leaning on one of the severed femoral arteries. He adjusted the towel on Elisabeth’s left arm and for the first time saw that it had been bitten clean off.\n\n“That’s when it hit me,” he said. “This is like a movie. This is a real, real situation.”\n\nAt 1:30 p.m., nine minutes after the initial 911 call was placed, Walton County Sheriff’s Deputy Chris Webster arrived at the scene carrying two bags of medical supplies.\n\nOn Webster’s bodycam video, he’s seen handing a tourniquet to the team working on Elisabeth and asking about the extent of her injuries. Smith cuffed the tourniquet high on Elisabeth’s left arm, just under the armpit, and ratcheted it tight with the attached stick. Massa noted the time – 1:32 p.m. – a common practice when applying tourniquets; leaving it on too long could cause irreversible damage.\n\nAmid the crowd on the beach, as trained volunteers mixed with stunned bystanders, the energy intensified. At one point, Webster barked, “Forget about gauze and all of that. Just put that tourniquet on as hard as you can!”\n\nOne of the volunteers already working on Elisabeth barked back: “Every single person here is medical!”\n\nSmith dug into Webster’s bag and pulled out a roll of bandage, which she used to wrap the end of Elisabeth’s severed arm. They asked for an IV to replenish Elisabeth’s blood loss, but Webster didn’t have one.\n\nAs he applied pressure to the femoral artery, Cherry wondered if a medivac helicopter would land on the beach to ferry Elisabeth away. Instead, at 1:34 p.m. – 13 minutes from the initial 911 call – two emergency medical technicians arrived in a white South Walton Fire District pickup truck. They also didn’t have an IV.\n\n“Where’s the cavalry?” Cherry asked.\n\nThe emergency responders looked at one another. “There is no cavalry,” one of them said. “This is it.”\n\nCherry was told a helicopter couldn’t land on the beach. It dawned on him that they would somehow have to carry Elisabeth across the boardwalk, back the same way he had come.\n\n“It baffled me how long it took EMS,” Massa would later recall. “And then, when they showed up, how little supplies they had and how little prepared they were for the injuries that occurred.”\n\nThe team lowered a flexible stretcher and, together with the medical bystanders, rolled Elisabeth onto it. Then, as Cherry and others maintained pressure on the femoral arteries, they lifted he and placed her in the bed of the pickup. They drove the 100 yards to the boardwalk, then removed her, carried her up the steps and down the boardwalk – trotting about a quarter mile, hauling a grown woman who was near death. Cherry, Smith, Massa and others seared their bare feet on the walkway’s hot wood.\n\nAt a boardwalk entrance, they commandeered a golf cart and ferried Elisabeth to a waiting ambulance.\n\nShe was rushed to a nearby fire station and later airlifted to Destin, Florida. Total time from when the first call came in to when the medivac helicopter landed: 39 minutes, according to log records.\n\nTo the bystanders who tried to save Elisabeth Foley’s life, it felt like an eternity.\n\nNo double red flags\n\nThe South Walton Fire District oversees 15 lifeguard towers to monitor its 26 miles of beaches. It uses a four-flag warning system, raised at different beach access points to warn beachgoers of any dangers in the Gulf: a purple flag depicts “Dangerous Marine Life,” usually abundant jellyfish or stingrays; a yellow flag is “Medium Hazard,” the county’s lowest risk; a single red flag means “High Surf and/or Strong Conditions,” and swimmers are urged to use caution but could still swim; and a double red flag means the water is closed to the public.\n\nThe flags are mostly used to describe surf conditions and rip currents but can be used to close the beach in an emergency.\n\nFor most of the day on June 7, the flags had flown yellow, reflecting the Gulf’s calm surf and good conditions, and purple, indicating possible jellyfish or stingrays in the water.\n\nAs Elisabeth was being carried to the ambulance, South Walton Fire District Beach Safety Director David Vaughan was making phone calls to county officials, including Walton County Sheriff's Capt. Scott Hogeboom, to determine how and when to change the flags.\n\nDuring the discussions, Hogeboom called Sheriff Mike Adkinson to fill him in on the incident.\n\n“Hey, let’s close it all,” Adkinson says he told Hogeboom, referring to closing all 26 miles of county beaches. But he also deferred to the beach team’s thinking, calling it a “scientific decision.”\n\nCounty incident reports show Vaughan and Hogeboom chose to follow protocols laid out by the United States Lifesaving Association and their own county guidelines for what to do in the event of a severe shark attack and close beaches only in the general vicinity of the attack.\n\nAt 1:38 p.m., Vaughan and Hogeboom agreed to “maintain localized area closure,” according to the reports.\n\nIt’s not clear what stretch of beach was immediately considered to be closed, though Adkinson said he believed they intended to close 5 miles in either direction from the attack. South Walton Fire District Chief Ryan Crawford declined to be interviewed for this story and did not respond to specific questions from USA TODAY about the incidents.\n\nVaughan called other county officials, including the sheriff’s public information officer and the Walton County tourism director, to alert them of the decision.\n\nFor much of South Walton's coastline, yellow flags flew in place.\n\nSightings mount\n\nFor the people who live and work on the panhandle beaches known as the Emerald Coast, the rising shark population is not an esoteric figure.\n\nJudah Barbee, who has captained a 52-foot charter fishing boat out of Destin since 2005, ferries families out into the Gulf to fish for snapper, mackerel and, occasionally, sharks. When he first started, he could troll for hours without getting a shark to bite, he said.\n\nStarting a few years ago, he began seeing more sharks, including a lot of bull sharks, Barbee said. His charters began catching around 20 a year. In recent months, Barbee said, it’s hard to pull up a fish without a shark taking a chunk out of it.\n\nThis summer alone, his customers have caught more than 50 bull sharks, he said.\n\n“There’s definitely a lot more of them right now for some reason,” Barbee said.\n\nYet encounters with sharks remain a statistically low probability, said Demian Chapman, director of the Center for Shark Research at the Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium in Sarasota.\n\nUnlike crocodiles, who have evolved to attack and eat primates, sharks have not, he said. If they were inclined to bite humans, he noted, “they would have millions of opportunities per day to do it.”\n\nShark bites are so statistically rare that there is not enough data to comprise meaningful strategies for prevention, he said.\n\nStill, communities elsewhere are taking steps. For more than a decade, researchers at the nonprofit Atlantic White Shark Conservancy in Massachusetts have been attaching sensors to sharks in the region and tracking them around Cape Cod using the Sharktivity app. The app shows where more than 300 tagged white sharks lurk on any given day and encourages users to report shark sightings – a sort of Waze for sharks.\n\nIn Padaro Beach, just outside of Los Angeles, researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara’s Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory (BOSL) are using drones and artificial intelligence to spot great white sharks offshore and alert nearby lifeguards and businesses.\n\nDrones could be an equally effective tool for monitoring sharks off Florida’s coast, said Naylor, the Florida shark tracker.\n\nPhil Asselin, 55, a Gulf Coast native, has been surfing the area around Panama City Beach for decades and runs a private Facebook surfing group, Emerald Coast Surfers. Sharks are a common sight, he said, when he surfs and paddleboards just offshore.\n\nOnce, a bull shark got tangled in his surfboard leash as he crashed into a wave. It just swam away. And a hammerhead once circled his paddleboard menacingly before swimming out to sea. Asselin said he’s never been attacked by a shark, nor has anyone he knows.\n\n“This is an extremely healthy marine environment,” he said. “Pretty much every time we go out on the water, we see sharks out there, especially once summer starts. It’s something we’ve learned to live with.”\n\nSecond shark attack\n\nFour miles east from where rescuers were rushing to help Elisabeth, Delanie Quinnelly led her soon-to-be sister-in-law’s bachelorette party up the boardwalk stairs at Seacrest Beach and into the dazzling beach day.\n\nShe and nine other women had arrived at Seacrest Beach the night before to celebrate the impending nuptials of Kylie Kulinski, her brother’s fiancée.\n\nThey had planned a busy weekend that included a pontoon trip to Crab Island, a sunset beach dinner and a pajama party with board games. On June 7, they got a late start and arrived at the beach at around 1 p.m. Quinnelly and the rest of the party wore matching blue bathing suits; the bride-to-be wore white.\n\nQuinnelly, 23, a maternity nurse at the University of South Alabama’s Children’s & Women’s Hospital in Mobile, Alabama, had vacationed at that stretch of beach growing up and explained to the group the meaning of the yellow and purple flags flapping over the boardwalk. Yellow means relatively calm surf, she said, and purple means “marine life.”\n\n“Like a shark?” one of the women asked.\n\nQuinnelly laughed. More like jellyfish, she said. Maybe a stingray.\n\n“I’ve never seen a shark out here,” she told them.\n\nThe beach was packed that day so Quinnelly and the group waited for a spot to open up. As they waited, at around 1:20 p.m., a white South Walton Fire District pickup truck sped west along the beach toward Watersound, its lights flashing. Beyond the boardwalk, Quinnelly heard the sudden wail of sirens.\n\nLikely a heart attack or someone caught in a rip current, she thought.\n\nA spot opened up on the beach and the group settled in. They spent the next few hours splashing in the clear, waist-high surf or sunbathing.\n\nNot far from where Quinnelly and her crew bathed, Lulu Gribbin, 15, her identical twin sister, Ellie, and other friends splashed in the surf. The sisters, a family friend, McCray Faust, 17, and other friends had traveled to Seacrest Beach from Mountain Brook, Alabama, a Birmingham suburb, a few days earlier for a mother-daughters beach trip.\n\nEarlier that day, Lulu and Ellie had ridden their bikes from their beach condo to Playa Bowls for açai mango bowls, then came out to the beach with the other girls, according to an online account posted by Ellie. There, they swam, collected sand dollars and hit around a volleyball. At just before 3 p.m., Lulu, Ellie and McCray went into the water, made friends with some boys and hunted for more sand dollars.\n\nSuddenly, a shadow moved through the thigh-high water. “Shark!” one of the girls yelled.\n\nEllie and some of the others raced to the shore. Behind her, Lulu yelled, “Stay calm!” Then, screams punctured the air. Ellie, reaching shore, turned and saw blood spreading through the water. In the middle of the large cloud of blood stood her sister, screaming.\n\nSteven Beene, 57, who was staying in nearby Inlet Beach, was in the water and heard the screaming. He made his way toward Lulu and pulled her away from the shark, according to an incident report. As others helped bring her to shore, Lulu was carried face down, arms outstretched, as if flying over the waves. Half of her left arm was missing.\n\nThe most threatening species\n\nOf all the sharks swimming in the Gulf, bull sharks, experts and biologists said, are among the most threatening. Bull sharks are large, reaching up to 10 feet in length, with a short, blunted snout, from which they derive its name. Their upper jaws are lined with large, triangular, serrated teeth, used to pull and tear flesh from larger animals.\n\nAs apex predators, they eat smaller fish but also larger prey, such as dolphins, manatees and other sharks. When they clamp down on prey, bull sharks thrash their head and tear off chunks, much like a pit bull terrier, according to the nonprofit Shark Research Institute.\n\nUnlike a blacktip shark, which eats smaller fish whole and would likely leave just small puncture wounds on a human, bull shark bites are typically much more severe, said Grubbs, the Florida State University expert.\n\n“If it results in a loss of a limb or loss of life, most often it seems to be a bull shark,” he said.\n\nBull sharks display an aggressive, almost territorial behavior not commonly seen in other sharks. Grubbs said he’s pursued bull sharks in his boat, and they’ve turned and attacked the boat. He referred to it as their “personal space issue.”\n\n“They have their personal space, and they don't want you invading it,” he said. “And if you unknowingly do so, you might get bit.”\n\nBull sharks are unique among most sharks in that they’re euryhaline, or able to survive in both fresh and salt water. Bull sharks have been fished out of Lake Nicaragua, a freshwater lake in Central America, and discovered deep in the Amazon River. In 1995, a fisherman caught a bull shark in the Mississippi River near Rush Island, Missouri – more than 700 miles from the Gulf.\n\nThis trait makes them unafraid to venture deep into river mouths and estuaries – and closer to shore – for food, said Stephen Kajiura, a biologist at Florida Atlantic University who studies shark migratory patterns.\n\n“Bull sharks are notorious for going up into fresh water,” he said. “There, they have an opportunity to hunt where they don’t have competition from other sharks.”\n\nResearchers at Texas A&M University at Galveston recently documented a fivefold increase in the number of baby bull sharks in Mobile Bay, Alabama, and a similar spike in Texas estuaries.\n\nFrom Pensacola to Apalachee Bay, the Florida panhandle is similarly studded with estuaries, inlets and bays that push fresh water out into the Gulf.\n\n‘She’s going to bleed out’\n\nDelanie Quinnelly, standing in chest-high Gulf water, not far from where Lulu and her friends were, heard the screams.\n\nPeople ran out of the water in a panic, while others screamed or cried. Some vomited on the shoreline and at least one person fainted, she said.\n\nQuinnelly’s mind raced to a course she had taken last year at Coastal Alabama Community College called “Stop the Bleed,” where the instructor had trained students on how to use tourniquets in emergencies. She began yelling directions at the crowd, ordering bystanders to make room for the girl. The amount of blood in the water – it had spread to cover a space the size of a swimming pool – told her the next few minutes would be crucial.\n\n“I need shirts! I need towels!” Quinnelly bellowed. “I need anything that you can tie around this girl!”\n\nPeople began tossing T-shirts, towels, and boogie board strings in her general direction. When Lulu finally got to the sand, Quinnelly saw where most of the blood was coming from: Her entire right thigh was gone. Her femur glistened in the sunlight and blood gushed from a severed femoral artery.\n\n“Oh my gosh,” Quinnelly thought. “She’s going to bleed out.”\n\nNearby, Mohammad Ali and Ryan Forbess had been standing in waist-deep water, helping their young kids ride boogie boards, when the screams blared.\n\nAli, 45, an interventional radiologist who lives in Jackson, Mississippi, and Forbess, 46, a family doctor from Orange Beach, Alabama, have been friends for decades, dating back to when they were medical school graduates and roommates in Hawaii. They vacationed together, alternating between Florida beaches and Tennessee mountains.\n\nAli and Forbess carried their kids out of the water, then hurried over to where Lulu was being brought ashore. Ali – a hulking figure at 6 feet, 2 inches and 280 pounds who enjoys spending time in the gym – knelt next to Lulu and leaned his weight on her femoral artery, cinching it closed. A bystander handed him a ratchet strap used to hold beach chairs together and he wrapped it tight around Lulu’s upper leg, leaning back in the sand and using all his weight to clamp down on the artery.\n\nOther bystanders ran up, offering to help: an ER nurse, an emergency medical technician, and an anesthesiologist.\n\nForbess checked Lulu’s pulse and listened to her heartbeat, ready to start CPR and chest compressions if her heart gave out. Lulu’s face was ashen and her lips had turned white, as she flitted in and out of consciousness.\n\n“Stay with us, stay right here,” Forbess told her. “Help is coming.”\n\nAs the doctors worked on Lulu, Quinnelly turned to a man next to her and pulled the drawstring from his bathing suit. She knelt next to Lulu and wrapped the drawstring around her upper arm, pulling it tight. Lulu’s eyes widened with pain.\n\n“Sweet girl,” Quinnelly told her, “I'm so sorry. I know this hurts. It has to hurt in order for it to work.”\n\nEllie, Lulu’s twin, also knelt next to her sister. She held Lulu’s right hand and told her she was doing great and that everything would be OK. Then, their mother, Ann Blair Gribbin, who had been further down the beach, walked up. She saw Lulu’s leg and screamed. Several bystanders had to pull her away.\n\nAs Lulu slipped in and out of consciousness, Quinnelly tried to keep her awake.\n\n“Sweetheart,” she asked, “what’s your name?”\n\nThe girl replied, in barely a whisper, “Lulu.”\n\nClosing the beach\n\nAccording to incident reports, the first emergency response teams to Lulu’s scene began arriving at 3:01 p.m., or six minutes after the initial 911 call. Quinnelly and others on the scene claim it was longer – around 12 to 15 minutes – before help arrived.\n\nA white South Walton Fire District truck – the same type of truck Quinnelly saw speeding toward Watersound earlier – backed up on the sand. Someone handed Quinnelly an oxygen mask, which she gently slid over Lulu’s face. Paramedics asked her to let go of the towels and drawstring Quinnelly had wrapped around Lulu’s arm so they could place proper tourniquets around her arm and leg. For the first time since Lulu emerged from the water, Quinnelly let go of her arm.\n\nThen, they rolled Lulu onto a board, loaded her in the bed of the truck and drove a short distance to the boardwalk. From there, EMS teams carried her up three flights of stairs, across the boardwalk and to a waiting ambulance. McCray, Lulu’s friend who was with her in the water, was bitten on the foot by the shark. The wound was bandaged at the scene and she was transported to a hospital in Panama City Beach. She was released later that day.\n\nAs Lulu was carried up the stairs and toward the waiting ambulance, Quinnelly rejoined her friends. A group of teenage girls walked up and asked if they could all pray for Lulu. The girls, Quinnelly and the bachelorette party held hands in a circle and prayed that Lulu would make it to the hospital alive. Then, Quinnelly walked over to the edge of the dunes and threw up.\n\nA few minutes later, she offered to give a statement to a sheriff’s deputy. As they walked over to his truck, the deputy mentioned the first shark attack nearly two hours earlier.\n\nQuinnelly stopped abruptly. “What?”\n\nThe deputy described the shark attack involving Elisabeth in Watersound earlier that day. Cold chills slid down Quinnelly’s spine, followed by a surge of anger. She looked up at the flags: They were still flapping yellow and purple.\n\nAt the same time paramedics began to respond, sheriff’s officials were also in motion.\n\nTwo minutes after the initial call came in reporting Lulu’s attack, Vaughan, the beach safety director, was on the phone again with Hogeboom, the sheriff’s captain.\n\nCounty officials say they made the decision at that moment to close the beaches. All 26 miles of South Walton beaches should switch to double red flags.\n\nThe decision came at 2:57 p.m. – 97 minutes after initial reports of the first shark attack in Watersound, according to incident reports. Thirteen minutes later, text message alerts pinged into the cellphones of subscribers to the South Walton Fire District’s beach flag alert system: “Double Red Flags – Water Closed to Public.”\n\nAt a news conference later that day, Adkinson praised the bystanders who helped Elisabeth and Lulu, as well as the fire district’s response.\n\nCrawford, the fire district chief, reiterated the challenges of closing all county beaches at once.\n\n“There’s 26 miles of beaches in Walton County,” he said at the press conference. “Traversing that 26 miles and physically changing the flags takes some time.”\n\nIn after-action reports, officials note they followed both county guidelines and United States Lifesaving Association protocols by not closing all beaches until there was a second severe attack.\n\nFire district officials also noted that both attacks occurred far from any lifeguard tower, slowing response.\n\n“Noteworthy that both incidents took place in tertiary zones – miles from nearest tower locations …” one incident report said.\n\nNaylor, the shark researcher, also praised the actions of county officials in the wake of the attacks. “Given the circumstances,” he said, “I can’t think of a better-compromised decision than the one they made.”\n\nQuinnelly, who helped save Lulu, said she and others at the scene were stunned to hear of the first attack.\n\n“Had I known that there was a shark attack at that beach, I would not have been in the water,” she said later. “And I guarantee you Lulu wouldn't have been either.”\n\nAt around 4 p.m., Quinnelly and her friends gathered their things, trudged up the boardwalk stairs and started the long walk back to their rental. A few families were still heading toward the beach, unaware of the drama that had just unfolded there.\n\n“They’re closing the beach,” Quinnelly told them. “Someone just got bit by a shark.”\n\n‘I made it!’\n\nElisabeth was stabilized at HCA Fort Walton-Destin Hospital, and then airlifted to a hospital in Richmond, Virginia, closer to her home in Ashland. She’s had 18 surgeries, including plastic surgery, and will likely have more, according to an online post.\n\nOn July 24, she began rehab, “where they will focus on her amputated arm and her walking,” it said.\n\nA GiveSendGo page started by the family to help with medical expenses has raised less than half of the stated goal of $250,000.\n\nLulu underwent a series of emergency surgeries and procedures at Ascension Sacred Heart Hospital in Pensacola. She had lost two-thirds of her blood and her right leg was amputated midway between her hip and knee, but she, too, survived. When they removed her breathing tube the following day, she looked up at her family and whispered, “I made it!” Later, she was airlifted to a hospital with double-amputee specialists, where she continued to recover.\n\nThanks in part to a series of detailed online postings by her mother, Ann Blair Gribbin, Lulu’s recovery has reached near-celebrity status. Luminaries including former Alabama football coach Nick Saban, former NBA legend Charles Barkley and country music stars Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood have posted get-well videos to her newly created Instagram site, which has gained more than 151,000 followers. Pictures of Lulu – smile beaming, hair up in tight braids – show her playing cards with siblings or trying out a new prosthetic leg. A line of hats and T-shirts was also created to help raise money for ongoing medical care.\n\nHer story also caught Washington’s attention.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., announced she was introducing legislation – known as “Lulu’s Law” – that would urge local, state and federal agencies to transmit localized “wireless emergency alerts” to people’s cellphones following shark attacks, the way it does for extreme weather, missing children or wildfires.\n\n“We are eternally grateful that Lulu survived the shark attack on June 7,” Ann Blair Gribbin and her husband, Joe, said in a statement. “However, we remain in disbelief this accident occurred. This was the second attack that day in close proximity, and it could have been prevented with a better alert system.”\n\nAdkinson, the sheriff, said he was pained to learn of the extent of the injuries of all three victims that day. “It’s just a terrible, terrible situation,” he said. “These are life-changing, catastrophic injuries.”\n\nHe said he would like to try to improve the way the county reacts to traumatic events on the shoreline, including finding ways to move victims off the beach faster. Florida officials should also consider passing statewide guidelines on how to respond to severe shark attacks, rather than leaving it up to communities, Adkinson said.\n\nMeanwhile, he said, keeping sharks and swimmers apart remains a challenging – if not futile – goal.\n\n“There’s no way that anything either the South Fire Walton District or the Walton County Sheriff’s Office can do that would prevent that from happening again tomorrow,” Adkinson said. “No more than I can prevent a tornado or a hurricane.”\n\nBack to the beach\n\nThe day after the attacks, South Walton downgraded to single red flags, and beaches again filled with visitors, including Watersound and Seacrest beaches.\n\nOn Sunday, two days after the attacks, Andrew Cady got back out on his Sea-Doos, this time with his son, Brandon, 22, and his son’s girlfriend, Elizabeth, 19.\n\nThey motored about 100 yards offshore, marveling at the manatees, stingrays, tarpon and sea turtles. Near Grayton Beach, a 7-foot bull shark bumped Cady’s Sea-Doo repeatedly, swam under Brandon’s Sea-Doo, then burst out of the water between the two watercraft. Cady caught the encounter on his GoPro and posted it to his Facebook site, along with the earlier brush with the shark at Inlet Beach.\n\nAgain, he raced to the nearby beach, warning swimmers of the shark.\n\nFor now, Cady said he won’t let his kids back in the water until he better understands what’s happening with the sharks.\n\n“There’s something going on in the population of sharks in the area we’re just not comfortable with,” he said.\n\nSince the June 7 attacks, there have been at least eight more shark attacks in Florida and Texas, including four in one day off South Padre Island, Texas.\n\nOn June 10, three days after the 30A attacks, Seacrest Beach, the site of Lulu’s encounter, was a sea of blue and pink beach umbrellas, with hundreds of visitors arriving early to sunbathe or splash in the surf.\n\nAt about 9:30 a.m., several people claimed to have spotted a shark in the shallows. Bathers rushed out of the water and stood on the shoreline, pointing, as a large, shadowy figure cut through the clear water.\n\nBehind them, yellow and purple flags fluttered in the breeze over the boardwalk, welcoming more visitors to the beach.\n\nJervis is an Austin-based national correspondent for USA TODAY.

Both the Hoosiers and Hurricanes are long-standing adidas partners, Miami since 2015 and Indiana since 2004.\n\nIt will mark an important moment for the German shoe giant, which has waded into deeper water in college football lately.\n\n“Having two adidas schools in the championship, and knowing an adidas partner will win a national title for the first time in the CFP era, is incredibly special for us,” Chris McGuire, vice president of sports marketing with adidas North America, told IndyStar. “First and foremost, it’s a historic moment for whichever university wins. Our focus will be on making sure those athletes and that school feel fully celebrated — from providing immediate, world-class championship gear to online and in-person support that will hopefully make this an even more incredible experience for Indiana and Miami fans.\n\n“At the same time, it’s a milestone for our brand. We want our partners to look back on this run and feel that adidas was the best, most supportive partner they could have had on the journey to a national championship.”\n\nadidas deals with Tennessee, Penn State show brand's growth in college sports\n\nNike has long been an apparel leader in the college football space, with a number of major brands still wearing the Swoosh. Among others, Michigan, Ohio State, Alabama, Georgia and, of course, Oregon remain in Nike’s portfolio.\n\nBut within the last year, that portfolio has scaled down, as adidas has pushed competitively into the college football space.\n\nBoth Penn State and Tennessee announced during summer they would leave Nike for adidas on lucrative partnerships that begin with the new athletic year in July. Now, adidas will count two schools facing off for a national title.\n\n“Expanding our footprint with partners like Tennessee and Penn State isn’t just about seeing the three stripes on more jerseys,” McGuire said. “We’ve shown these universities what adidas is capable of in the new era of college athletics as a truly comprehensive apparel partner that is seeing success on the biggest stages, as you see with Indiana and Miami.”\n\nOne, Indiana, has never won a national championship in football, and would be the sport’s first first-time champion since Steve Spurrier’s 1995 Florida team, and important feat for one of adidas’ longest-tenured major collegiate partners.\n\nThe other, Miami, is a restored powerhouse that wore the Nike Swoosh the last time it won it all in 2001. Now, the Hurricanes would hoist a trophy in the Three Stripes.\n\nCouple that to burgeoning athlete relationships in the name, image and likeness space — including Michael Penix Jr., Rome Odunze, former Miami quarterback Cam Ward and IU football players Fernando Mendoza and Elijah Sarratt — and McGuire said adidas feels an escalating sense of “momentum” in college football.\n\n“We’re experiencing unprecedented momentum in college football right now, and an all-adidas championship game is a powerful signal of where that strategy is taking us,” McGuire said. “I wouldn’t say we ever expected this specific outcome, but we absolutely believed in the trajectory we were on. This is a clear validation of our long-term strategy in college football, from deep investment in our university partners to the way we’ve approached NIL, and product innovation.”\n\nIU football CFP bonuses from adidas partnership\n\nThe game could also prove even more lucrative for Indiana than the Hoosiers’ playoff run to date has been.\n\nPer the terms of a contract extension signed in 2024, adidas will owe IU at least $375,000 in bonuses following the conclusion of this season:\n\n$100,000 for the undefeated 2025 regular season,\n\n$25,000 non-cumulatively for Curt Cignetti’s national coach-of-the-year awards, and\n\n$250,000 for advancing as far as the CFP semifinal.\n\nIndiana would be owed another $250,000 if it wins Monday night.\n\nFor McGuire, who played at Indiana for legendary men’s soccer coach Jerry Yeagley, the Hoosiers’ rise has been both exciting and impressive.\n\n“As an IU grad myself, it’s really a dream to be in this position and to see the growth of the athletic department,” he said. “There’s an energy around the overall athletic program that I haven’t seen in a long time, going back to the days of coach (Bob) Knight, who was a big adidas supporter and really at the center of our relationship with Indiana in the ’80s and ’90s.”\n\nUltimately, McGuire said, adidas will be energized by whatever outcome Monday night delivers, the result of the CFP title game motivating his company to expand its footprint in a sport whose popularity remains ticking steadily upward.\n\n“An all‑adidas championship game shows that our approach is working, but we see it as a starting point, not a finish line,” McGuire said. “Our university partners will always be our priority, and as we continue to invest in them and in high‑impact NIL partnerships across the country, I fully expect you’ll see even more adidas representation in the CFP in the years ahead.”\n\nWant more Hoosiers coverage?

That’s why you’ve seen so many lists in the Tribune and other publications in recent weeks.\n\nBut when I decided to pick the top 10 quarterbacks in Notre Dame football history, the task became intimidating.\n\nThere are far too many great Irish quarterbacks to fit into a list of 10. That much was clear. As I dove into media guides for bios, records and recaps, I started to realize that my list would exclude Heisman Trophy winners, national champions and first-round NFL Draft picks.\n\nAll three of those honors would be important categories for evaluating each résumé, but they represented only a fraction of the subjective formula.\n\nWhen working through which quarterbacks to leave off my list, I decided to put stock in repeated success. That put John Huarte, despite his phenomenal 1964 Heisman season, on the chopping block. I also didn’t want to give a player credit for the impact he made playing other positions. That’s part of why the versatile Paul Hornung, also an elite kick return and safety, became a cruel cut from the list.\n\nSo what did I put stock in? Not all categories were given the same weight, but I tried to account for various honors (Heisman voting, All-American status, NFL Draft pick), winning (career wins, winning percentage, national titles) and statistics (completion percentage, passing yards and touchdowns, rushing yards and touchdowns).\n\nConsider this a warning for Joe Montana’s place on the list: A quarterback’s professional accolades did not hold any value. I only went as far as a player’s NFL Draft selection as another way to measure how that quarterback compared to his peers.\n\nIn order to balance the statistics of quarterbacks from vastly different eras of college football, NCAA statistical rankings from specific seasons were also considered. That combined with national honors should have leveled the playing field a bit.\n\nBut that’s enough explaining. I can almost guarantee you’re going to disagree with my list. I’m ready to hear your complaints. I want to see your top 10 lists too.\n\nI’ve put this off for long enough. Let’s get to the list.\n\n1. Johnny Lujack (1942-43, 46-47)\n\nThe length of Lujack’s résumé was too much for any other quarterback to overcome. He won three national championships, became a two-time unanimous All-American and took home the 1947 Heisman Trophy.\n\nAs a sophomore in 1943, Lujack was given the reins of coach Frank Leahy’s T formation when the Marine Corps called quarterback Angelo Bertelli into service for World War II with four games remaining in the season. Lujack stepped up to lead the Irish to victory over three Top 10 teams. A loss in the season finale to Great Lakes didn’t prevent Notre Dame from being crowned national champions.\n\nLujack left Notre Dame to serve in the Navy, but he returned in time for the 1946 season. In his final two seasons, Lujack never lost a game on his way to winning two more national titles. His 20-1-1 record as a starting quarterback remains the program’s best in winning percentage (.932).\n\nLujack capped his Notre Dame career with a Heisman season in which he completed 56% of his passes (61-of-109) for 777 yards and nine touchdowns and rushed 12 times for 139 yards and one touchdown. The Chicago Bears selected Lujack with the fourth overall pick of the 1948 NFL Draft.\n\n2. Brady Quinn (2003-06)\n\nNotre Dame’s 2019 media guide listed Quinn with at least a tie for first place in 30 different individual program records. He holds the season and career marks in completions, passing yards, touchdown passes and points responsible for, which combines passing and rushing touchdowns.\n\nHead coach Charlie Weis poured rocket fuel on Quinn’s career when he took over the Irish in 2005. Quinn finished his junior season in 2005 ranked fifth in the country in total offense (334.1 yards per game) and seventh in passing efficiency (158.4).\n\nQuinn continued to light up box scores in his senior season. He was named the Maxwell Award Winner (player of the year) and finished third in Heisman voting after throwing for 3,426 yards and 37 touchdowns. Quinn also set the program record for consecutive pass attempts without an interception with 226 passes between interceptions thrown against Michigan State in game 4 and Army in game 11.\n\nBut Quinn’s inability to consistently win big games kept him from receiving the top spot on this list. The Irish nearly beat No. 1 USC in 2005. Quinn also lost at No. 3 USC in 2006 and suffered bowl losses to No. 4 Ohio State (Fiesta Bowl) and No. 11 LSU (Sugar Bowl).\n\nThe Cleveland Browns selected Quinn with the No. 22 overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft’s first round.\n\n3. Angelo Bertelli (1940-43)\n\nIt took Bertelli only six games of his senior season to win the 1943 Heisman Trophy. The Marines called him into World War II duty in November after Bertelli already had completed 25 of his 36 passes (69.4%) for 512 yards and 10 touchdowns. Lujack took over the No. 1 Irish offense to complete the national championship season.\n\nBut Bertelli established himself as the cog in Notre Dame’s offense before winning Notre Dame’s first Heisman. In 1941, Bertelli played his sophomore season as a single-wing tailback in the box offense, but he still handled most of the passing responsibilities. He led the country in completion percentage (56.9%) on 70-of-123 passing for 1,027 yards and eight touchdowns and finished second in Heisman voting.\n\nLeahy installed his T-formation offense ahead of the 1942 season with Bertelli as its quarterback. His accuracy dipped (72-of-159, 45.3%), but he still threw for 1,039 yards and 10 touchdowns and finished sixth in Heisman voting.\n\nIt’s too bad the two-time All-American quarterback couldn’t finish out the 1943 season on the field. The Boston Yanks selected Bertelli with the No. 1 overall pick in the 1944 NFL Draft, but he ended up playing in the All-America Football Conference in 1946 for the Los Angeles Dons following his military service.\n\n4. Joe Theismann (1967-70)\n\nTheismann’s rhyming Heisman campaign fell just short in 1970. He placed as the runner-up behind Stanford quarterback Jim Plunkett after throwing for 2,429 yards and 16 touchdowns on 155-of-268 passing (57.8%). Theismann also finished second in the country in total offense (281.3 yards per game).\n\nTheismann capped his career with a 24-11 win over Texas in the 1971 Cotton Bowl in which he accounted for all three touchdowns (two rushing, one passing). The year prior, the Irish lost 21-17 to the Longhorns. Theismann put Notre Dame up 17-14 with a 24-yard touchdown pass to Jim Yoder with 6:52 left in the 1970 Cotton Bowl, but Texas milked the next 5:39 off the clock for the game-winning touchdown.\n\nWhen Theismann finished his Notre Dame career, he held the Notre Dame career records for passing yards (4,411) and passing touchdowns (31). He also became just the second Irish player to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a career as a quarterback behind only Paul Hornung.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins selected Theismann in the fourth round of the 1971 NFL Draft with pick No. 99.\n\n5. Tom Clements (1971-74)\n\nClements cemented his spot in Notre Dame lore with a third-down completion from the end zone in Notre Dame’s 1973 Sugar Bowl victory over No. 1 Alabama. With the Irish holding a 24-23 lead, Clements hit backup tight end Robin Weber for a 35-yard completion on third-and-8 to allow Notre Dame to run out the final two minutes of the game and secure a national championship.\n\nClements was named the Sugar Bowl MVP with 7-of-12 passing for 169 yards and 15 rushes for 74 yards. As a senior in 1974, Clements received a pair of All-American nods and finished fourth in Heisman voting for a season in which he completed 122 of his 215 passes for 1,549 yards and eight touchdowns.\n\nClements set the Notre Dame record for career wins as a starting quarterback with 29 victories in 34 starts. Both Ron Powlus and Brady Quinn have since tied Clements with 29 wins, but Clements did so in 12 fewer games.\n\nDespite his accolades, Clements was not selected in the 1975 NFL Draft and instead played in the Canadian Football League.\n\n6. Tony Rice (1986-89)\n\nRice’s career passing numbers look more like Lujack’s and Bertelli’s than Quinn’s and Theismann’s, but that doesn’t prevent him from claiming a spot near the middle of this list. Rice proved he belonged in Notre Dame’s 1988 national championship season.\n\nRice played arguably his best season in ‘88 as a junior. He finished 70-of-138 passing (50.7%) for 1,176 yards and eight touchdowns and rushed for 700 yards and nine touchdowns. He wrapped up the national championship for the undefeated Irish with an Offensive MVP performance (288 total yards and two passing touchdowns) in the 34-21 win over West Virginia in the 1989 Fiesta Bowl.\n\nIn Rice’s senior season, Notre Dame extended its winning streak to 23 games in 1989 until eventual national champ Miami delivered a 27-10 defeat in the regular season finale. The loss to Miami likely ended Rice’s shot at winning the Heisman too. He threw two interceptions and managed only 50 rushing yards on 20 carries in a losing effort. Rice still finished fourth in 1989 Heisman voting and received the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award as the top senior quarterback in college football.\n\nRice, who was not selected in the 1990 NFL Draft, continues to hold Notre Dame’s quarterback rushing records for yards in a season (884 in 1989) and a career (1,921). He recorded more rushing touchdowns in a career (23) than any Notre Dame player since 1940. He also sits in second for career passing yards per completion (17.12).\n\n7. Rick Mirer (1989-92)\n\nMirer follows Rice on this list just as he did in his career. Though Mirer had a much better career as a passer than Rice, his teams couldn’t quite reach national title contention in late November.\n\nWhen Mirer took over as the starter as a sophomore in 1990, he registered 10th nationally in passing efficiency (138.8) after completing 110 of his 200 passes for 1,824 yards and eight touchdowns with six interceptions. The road wasn’t easy with wins against five teams that finished in the final AP Top 25.\n\nMirer bumped up his passing efficiency even higher in 1991 (No. 8, 149.3) as a junior with a stat line that included 132-of-234 passing for 2,117 yards and 18 touchdowns with 10 interceptions.\n\nMirer’s signature moment came in the 1992 Snow Bowl victory over Penn State. He completed a comeback victory in Notre Dame Stadium by throwing a three-yard touchdown pass to Jerome Bettis with 20 seconds remaining. Then Mirer scrambled to find Reggie Brooks in the end zone for a two-point conversion and a 17-16 win.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks selected Mirer with the No. 2 overall pick in the 1993 NFL Draft.\n\n8. Joe Montana (1975-78)\n\nI can already see my email inbox and Twitter mentions lighting up as a result of this decision. When I asked my Twitter followers for their nominations for best Notre Dame quarterback ever, Montana received the most submissions by a large margin. But I couldn’t convince myself to put him higher on the list based on his college résumé alone.\n\nMontana offered a glimpse of what his NFL career would become when he led Notre Dame’s 1979 Cotton Bowl comeback against Houston. He seemed to have a knack for comebacks throughout his college and pro career. The Irish trailed 34-12 midway through the fourth quarter, but still managed to win.\n\nMontana, who earlier threw four interceptions, set up the game-winning extra point with a dart to wide receiver Kris Haines for an 8-yard touchdown pass as time expired. Montana won bowl MVP honors in the 35-34 victory.\n\nThe Cotton Bowl was a fitting location to end Montana’s Notre Dame career. The year prior, Montana and the Irish earned a national championship by defeating No. 1 Texas. Montana started the season as the third-string quarterback before finding his way into the lineup.\n\nMontana, who finished his Notre Dame career 268-of-515 passing (52%) for 4,121 yards with 25 passing touchdowns, 14 rushing touchdowns and 25 interceptions, was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the third round of the 1979 NFL Draft with the No. 82 pick.\n\n9. Jimmy Clausen (2007-09)\n\nClausen’s 2009 season might be the best statistical season for a quarterback in Notre Dame history. He set the program record for 300-yard passing games in a season with seven, tied Bob Williams for the best passing efficiency mark (161.4) in a season, and he threw 160 passes in between interceptions against Washington and Navy, the second-longest streak in school history behind Quinn's 226.\n\nClausen’s 2009 numbers also stacked up well against his peers with his passing efficiency ranking third in the FBS and his total offensive yards per game (302.3) ranking eighth.\n\nBut wins were hard to come by for Clausen. He’s the only quarterback on this list with a losing record (16-18) as a starter. His monster 2009 season was wasted by a dreadful defense and ended with Weis being fired.\n\nClausen, who also holds program records for completions per game in a career (19.9) and lowest career interception percentage (2.432%), was selected by the Carolina Panthers in the second round of the 2010 NFL Draft with pick No. 48.\n\n10. Bob Williams (1947-50)\n\nLeahy sure knew how to use quarterbacks, huh? Williams, who was on the freshman squad when Notre Dame won its national championship in 1946, led the Irish to a title in 1949. He did so by setting program records in passing yards (1,374) and passing efficiency (161.4).\n\nWilliams’ passing yards record stood until John Huarte blew by it in 1964 with 2,062 yards. Williams’ passing efficiency mark has been matched only by Clausen in 2009.\n\nTeammate Leon Hart won the 1949 Heisman as Williams finished sixth in the country in total offense with 1,437 yards. The 1950 Irish didn’t successfully defend their title, but Williams was 10th in the country with 99 completions as he registered his second All-American honor.\n\nThe Chicago Bears selected Williams with the No. 2 overall pick in the 1951 NFL Draft.\n\nDon't miss any of our Notre Dame football coverage.

For that reason, declaring how many titles a team owns is not as straightforward as one might think.\n\nIn Ohio State's case, following Monday's College Football Playoff win over Notre Dame, the Buckeyes claim nine national championships — 1942, 1954, 1957, 1961, 1968, 1970, 2002, 2014 and 2024. The Dispatch counts seven of these, omitting 1961, when the Buckeyes were awarded the national championship by the Football Writers Association of America, and 1970, when they were honored by the National Football Foundation.\n\nThe 1961 Buckeyes finished 8-0-1 and ended up No. 2 in the final Associated Press and United Press International polls behind undefeated Alabama (11-0). The NFF also declared the Crimson Tide to be the top team in the country.\n\nIn 1970, OSU went 9-1, and while the NFF named the Buckeyes co-national champions alongside Texas (11-1), UPI gave the nod to Texas. The AP honored Nebraska (11-0-1), which received 39 of 52 first-place votes. Notre Dame (10-1) received eight first-place votes, Texas three and Ohio State none. The FWAA awarded the MacArthur Bowl Trophy to the Longhorns.\n\nFor the seven years that The Dispatch recognizes, Ohio State either won the designated national championship game (2002, 2014, 2024) or it was voted No. 1 in either the AP or UPI polls.\n\nThis has long been the Dispatch's policy.\n\nHere, for instance, is what the paper said after the 2014 team won the title:\n\nSay it slowly and let it sink in. It really happened. You aren't dreaming. The Ohio State Buckeyes, counted out so many times this season, are the kings of college football. This resilient 2014 team, a combination of 1968 youth and 2002 grit, overcame four turnovers to roll over Oregon 42-20 in the championship game of the inaugural College Football Playoff at AT&T Stadium last night. Counted out after losing Braxton Miller before the season and falling to Virginia Tech in their second game, the Buckeyes (14-1) won their sixth national championship in school history in front of a mostly Ohio State crowd of 85,689.\n\nAnd consider what the paper wrote on Jan. 4, 2003:\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. — Cie Grant delivered the final uppercut for Ohio State last night in what will go down in history as one of college football's great upset knockouts. The senior linebacker forced a bad pass by Miami quarterback Ken Dorsey on fourth down from the 1-yard line in the second overtime. That made Maurice Clarett's 5-yard touchdown run moments earlier the game-winner in a 31-24 victory over the heavily favored Hurricanes. And it made the Buckeyes the national champions. \"It was two great heavyweights slugging it out and our guys came up with the win,\" coach Jim Tressel said. The rest of the Buckeyes and many of their fans charged the field and locked in a jubilant throng that enjoyed fireworks, confetti and hugs throughout. The rest of the predominantly OSU crowd of 77,502 in Sun Devil Stadium rocked in the glow of the school's first national championship since 1968 and fifth overall\n\nBut whether you argue Ohio State has won seven championships or believe the number is nine, there is no debate that Monday's 34-23 win over Notre Dame was a victory fans will remember.\n\nGet more Ohio State football news by listening to our podcasts", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2026/01/19/national-championship-score-indiana-vs-miami-live-updates-cfp-college-football-playoff-2026/88248052007/", "title": "Indiana outlasts Miami to win first national championship: Reaction ...", "text": "Jan. 19, 2026 Updated Jan. 20, 2026, 12:56 a.m. ET\n\nIndiana football is the national champion.\n\nThe No. 1-ranked Hoosiers defeated No. 10 Miami 27-21 in the 2026 College Football Playoff national championship game on Monday, Jan. 19, from Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\nWith the win, the Hoosiers (16-0) finished off the worst-to-first story with the program's first championship in program history.

It won't be easy for Indiana. Miami is playing its best football at the right time and has the most ferocious pass rush in the sport, holding Ole Miss' high-powered offense to two touchdowns in the Fiesta Bowl. Ultimately, I trust Indiana's veteran roster, along with Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza, who has the edge over opposing quarterback Carson Beck. Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor will make things tough for the projected No. 1 overall pick, though.

Shocker, I know. But with a roster that features not a single five-star recruit, the Hoosiers have looked like the most all-around complete team this postseason, and it would take a complete clean game (including no self-inflicted penalties) from Miami to pull off the upset. That is not to say the Hurricanes will cause the Hoosiers some trouble, because I think they will. Where I can see this happening is with what got them to the championship game, and that is dominating the line of scrimmage on both ends of the ball. Fernando Mendoza will deliver a late fourth-quarter, game-winning drive to ride off into the sunset (i.e., the NFL) with his storybook ending in front of the hometown crowd in Miami.

The Hurricanes’ pass rush will be the key because Fernando Mendoza has been absolutely surgical in two CFP games: eight touchdowns, five incompletions. Read that again. Eight touchdowns. Five incompletions. Miami’s run game should be able to keep the Hoosiers' offense off the field, but Indiana’s efficiency doesn’t really rely on them needing the ball too much.

In all seriousness, though, Miami faces a massive challenge, but not an insurmountable one. The Hoosiers are the best team in the country and have looked like it throughout the season, particularly in two playoff games they’ve won by a combined score of 94-25. Still, there’s a path for a Hurricanes victory, narrow as it might be. Miami is one of the few teams in the sport that can match Indiana’s excellence on both lines of scrimmage. Though it didn’t always look the part on a slippery field at the Fiesta Bowl against Ole Miss, it’s got the nation’s most ferocious pass rush with Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor, a duo that could cause some issues for Fernando Mendoza and the Hoosiers’ prolific passing attack. As they’ve done in the past two wins, the Hurricanes’ offense has the potential to mount long, sustained drives that keep Mendoza off the field. There are countless other factors, matchups and scenarios that could lead to the Hoosiers completing their improbable journey to a national title. An Indiana run defense that’s allowing fewer than three yards per carry this season may very well bottle up Mark Fletcher Jr. Carson Beck could revert to the worst version of himself and turn the ball over at will, especially against a Hoosiers defense that made life hell for Oregon’s Dante Moore. For all of Miami’s pass-rushing prowess, Mendoza is as well-equipped as anyone to handle it. But, hey, it’s the last game of the year. Can’t hold anything back now — especially when there’s the chance to pick an upset. - Craig Meyer, USA TODAY\n\nWhat time does the national championship game come on tonight?

His family and Hamilton coach Brian Grabinski were in the stands along with others from the Hamilton and Holland area who made the trip across the state.\n\nMeanwhile, Saugatuck native Blake Dunn started the season on the roster of the Cincinnati Reds, making it the first time multiple area players have been in the majors the same season.\n\nGVSU women's basketball claims NCAA title\n\nAll season the Grand Valley State women's basketball team thought it would finally be their year.\n\nThe Lakers were in the Final Four a couple of years ago, still on their rise, then lost their starting point guard to injury last year.\n\nThis year, everyone was healthy and the team embraced the team having 11 starters and used that depth and talent to claim the NCAA Division II national championship.\n\nThe Lakers defeated Cal State-Dominguez Hills 70-58 March 28 in Pittsburgh to finish the season 38-2 an earn the program's first NCAA title since 2006 in women's basketball and 30th overall, making Allendale a pretty good title town.\n\n\"It is such an awesome feeling. This is the ultimate end goal for any team. I am so proud to be a part of this team,\" GVSU senior Rylie Bisballe said.\n\nCalvary wins first ever state title; HC cross wins too\n\nA few years ago, Holland Calvary started its latest wave of runners.\n\nIt was a pack of eighth graders who ended up running at the state tournament.\n\nThree years later, the junior-led Crusaders made history by winning the first state championship in school history.\n\n\"This state title means a lot to our small community. It’s our first state championship in our schools history. We really focus on process-related goals rather than outcome-related ones, so seeing that our process-driven approach can lead to a state title is incredibly encouraging. Everything we do in sports is an extension of what we do in our school every day, all day long, which makes it easy for the kids to understand the direction we want to take with our program,\" Calvary coach Richard Laninga said. \"Things really started to take off when this junior class fully bought into that idea, when they were younger. They began running more, which allowed us to do more in our training. That buy-in has inspired others in the program, even our current younger runners, to improve and push themselves.\"\n\nCalvary won the Division 4 boys state championship on Saturday, Nov. 1, at Michigan International Speedway, scoring 110 points to hold off Maple City Glen Lake by 21 points for the title.\n\nThe Crusaders were not the only team to claim a state title from the Holland area, which had 10 teams qualify.\n\nThe Holland Christian girls won the Division 2 state title.\n\nThe Maroons scored 116 to hold off Otsego by just six points.\n\n\"It means so much to our team,\" sophomore Avery Engbers said. \"We have been working hard not only this season but throughout the whole summer together and to finally do what we have been working do hard for felt so good.\"\n\n4 iconic coaches retire\n\nFor two decades, the Zeeland West program has been a constant playoff presence and state title contender.\n\nJohn Shillito has been the only head coach that the Dux have ever known in program history and has led Zeeland West to five state titles behind the vaunted Wing-T offense.\n\nYes the Dux have won a state title in 20% of their football seasons and made the playoffs 18 of their 20 years, winning at least 10 games eight times.\n\nMeanwhile, Holland Christian boys swim coach Todd Smeenge has also retired.\n\nHe led the Maroons to multiple state championships and has been a mainstay on the deck for the past three decades.\n\nLater in the year, Zeeland East track and field coach Ralph Neal announced his retirement. He led the Chix to multiple MHSAA and MITCA team state championships and the throws expert produced a record number of all-state athletes in the shot put and discus.\n\nWest Ottawa soccer coach Brent Wyckoff also stepped down after nearly a quarter century leading the Panthers. He guided several players to the NCAA Division I level.\n\nIsabel Anaya goes undefeated, wins first girls wrestling title\n\nIn the past four years, girls wrestling has gone from is infancy to the fastest growing sport in the state.\n\nWest Ottawa's Isabel Anaya has been the leading trailblazer in the area.\n\nShe was the first girls all-state wrestler in the area, the first two-, three- and four-time all-state wrestler in area history. She was the first female wrestler to reach 100 wins and the first to reach a state final.\n\nAnaya saved the best for last. She is the first girls wrestler in area history to be a state champion - and finish a season undefeated.\n\n\"It happened so fast and I saw my coaches celebrating and that is when I knew. It honestly means so much to me. I would come to state earlier in my career and feel like that was never going to be me. But this year, I was so excited and I knew this was going to be my year,\" Anaya said. \"It hasn't really settled, but I am proud to have set a standard that other girls will be able to reach.\"\n\nTrack state titles abound, swimming too\n\nAs Emma Gunnett made her move, the West Ottawa girls 4x800 relay team could start to feel it.\n\nGunnett passed Oak Park on the third leg and handed to Collette Wierks who kept the pace on the first lap, then left the field behind on the second lap as the Panthers repeated as Division 1 state champions in the 4x800 on Saturday, May 31, at East Kentwood.\n\n\"The girls took care of business. It takes all four and we have the depth,\" West Ottawa coach Kyle Barnes said. \"This is a really big deal for the program. We thought we could win last year and pulled kind of an upset, and thought we could this year. Hopefully, we can win again next year.\"\n\nCollette Wierks also won the 800 meters state title, while Helen Sachs won the 3,200 meters and was second in the 1,600 meters.\n\nIn swimming, Zeeland's Owen Stevens and Holland Christian's Camryn Siegers each won a pair of individual state championships in the pool and Hamilton's Josi Popma and Holland Christian's Parker Schut each won diving state titles.\n\nGVSU claims NCAA title in women's track and cross\n\nThe Grand Valley State women's track and field team proved that every point counts this weekend as the Lakers claimed the NCAA Division II national championship by a single point.\n\nGVSU scored 60 points to hold off Adams State (59) and the rest of the field.\n\n\"This team goes beyond just putting points on a scoreboard,\" Erika Beistle said. \"All of the laughs, struggles and memories made a long way certainly top everything. We all did our part to etch our names into GVSU history. This had been something we've all wanted to accomplish since day one, and to finally achieve that goal is something so very special.\"\n\nAfter Erika Beistle won the discus and Maggie Stevenson was second, Shelby Ulven took second in the hammer throw and Alaina Diaz was second in the long jump earlier in the week, the Lakers earned some more trophies on the final day.\n\nThe Lakers also won the NCAA title in women's cross country in the fall.\n\nHope football hosts NCAA playoff game for second time\n\nThe Hope College football team knew it had done enough to make the playoffs.\n\nIt turns out, it was enough to earn a bye - and host a second-round game.\n\nThe Flying Dutchmen will host the University of Wisconsin–La Crosse in an NCAA Division III second-round playoff game at noon Saturday, Nov. 29, at Ray & Sue Smith Stadium.\n\nHope (9-1) and Wisconsin–La Crosse (7-2) of the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference both received at-large bids and first-round byes in the 40-team field.\n\nWhitecaps win Midwest League title\n\nThe West Michigan Whitecaps are the Midwest League champions for the first time in a decade.\n\nThe Whitecaps defeated the Cedar Rapids Kernels 3-1 in Game 2 on Tuesday, Sept. 16, to claim their first Midwest League title since 2016, sweeping the best-of-three series.\n\nThis year has been like no other in the entire Tigers organization.\n\n\"I have never seen anything close to this - nothing close,\" Whitecaps manager Tony Cappuccilli said. \"That is the best part for us. We have relationships with players starting in spring training. Being able to follow that success with them and other coaches and see that success is so much fun. We have had guys have career-type years. It has made it a fun vibe in the clubhouse.\"\n\nGulker leads Ferris State to national title\n\nZeeland West graduate Carson Gulker has been a part of an NCAA Division II dynasty.\n\nThe H-back was pivotal in Ferris State's 42-21 win over Harding in the Division II championship game on Dec. 20. It is the fourth national title in five years for the Bulldogs.\n\nGulker, a former all-state quarterback, had three catches for 52 yards and a touchdown.

But we didn't give up and that is a tribute to what they have done all year. I am so proud of this group. I don't think anyone had Elite Eight on their goal list, though we knew we were capable of it. This is our team that has improved the most from beginning to end.\"\n\nContact sports editor Dan D’Addona at Dan.D’Addona@hollandsentinel.com.
