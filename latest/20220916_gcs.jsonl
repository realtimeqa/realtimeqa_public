Not like his mother\n\nWho is King Charles III of the United Kingdom?\n\nBorn, Nov. 14, 1948, Charles Philip Arthur George Windsor is the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II and her late husband, Prince Philip. Upon the death of the queen on Sept. 8, 2022, Charles, formerly known as Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, became king of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nKing Charles is known for his previous marriage to the late Princess Diana. The couple had two children, Prince William and Prince Harry.\n\nMore Q&As:King Charles III succeeds Queen Elizabeth. What to know about British royal line.\n\nWhen will Charles be crowned?\n\nLegally, Charles became king from the moment of the queen's death, meaning he is head of state for the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a dozen other countries. He's also the titular head of the Church of England, head of the military and the judiciary, and carries a host of other royal titles and duties.\n\nThe name he chose as his regnal, or reign, name is his own first name, Charles, and it is followed by the Roman numeral III because he is the third king Charles in British history.\n\nIn the days following the queen's death, Charles was formally proclaimed as monarch in an accession ceremony and gave his first formal address as king.\n\nCharles will likely be crowned within the year; the ancient ritual of the coronation requires advance planning, although a lot of that has already been done. But there hasn't been a coronation since June 1953 when the late queen was crowned.\n\nKing Charles speech:Read the full transcript from his first national address following queen's death\n\nHow old is King Charles III?\n\nHe is 73, the oldest monarch to ever take the British throne.\n\nSurvival of the monarchy:Why Queen Elizabeth II's funeral is more than just ceremony\n\nWho is first in line to become king after Charles?\n\nPrince William, King Charles' elder son and formerly the Duke of Cambridge, is next in line for the throne under the British line of succession.\n\nCharles named William, 40, the new Prince of Wales in an announcement on his first full day as king. As a result, William's wife Catherine, or Kate as she is widely known, also 40, became Princess of Wales. She is the first to hold that title since the death of Princess Diana in 1997.\n\nAfter Prince William, the line of succession turns to Prince William and Princess Kate's children. The succession is as follows:\n\nPrince William, the Prince of Wales (Charles and Diana's first-born son) Prince George of Wales (Will and Kate's first-born son) Princess Charlotte of Wales (Will and Kate's second-born daughter) Prince Louis of Wales (Will and Kate's third-born son) Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex (Charles and Diana's second-born son)\n\nMore:What happens to the other royals under King Charles III and his new slimmed-down monarchy?\n\nIs King Charles married?\n\nCharles is married to the former Camilla Parker Bowles, who was known as Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. She is now the Queen Consort.\n\nLegally, Camilla was the Princess of Wales when she married Charles in 2005 but it was decided at the time she would assume one of the Charles' lesser titles instead. Diana long blamed Camilla for the breakup of her marriage to Charles and public fury remained when Camilla and Charles married eight years after Diana's death in a car crash in Paris.\n\nWhen did Charles marry Camilla?\n\nCharles married Camilla in 2005 in two ceremonies in Windsor. Right after the reception for 800 guests at Windsor Castle, the couple left for a honeymoon in Scotland.\n\nFew Brits thought the wedding would actually happen. A future king had never married a divorced woman. Plus, Camilla was once the most despised woman in Britain, the alleged home-wrecker who broke up the marriage of Charles and Diana.\n\nBut by the couple's 10th wedding anniversary, public perception of Camilla began to change as the royal family, including the queen, embraced her. Charles once said she would never be called Queen Camilla when he assumed the throne. His wishes on that later changed, and the late queen made if official in February 2022 when she announced she wanted her heir's second wife to be known as Queen Consort.\n\nWhen were Prince Charles and Princess Diana married?\n\nCharles was first married to Lady Diana Spencer, later known as the beloved Princess Diana. They were married for 15 years from 1981 to 1996. Diana was 20 and Charles was 32 at the time of their nuptials. The wedding was billed as a fairy tale, but their married life was not.\n\nAs the public would learn later, Charles had always been in love with Camilla, a woman he’d met over a decade prior in 1970. During the marriage of Charles and Diana, there were affairs on both sides.\n\nThe royal couple separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.\n\nDiana, Charles and Camilla:The love triangle of the century\n\nWhat will Camilla be called now?\n\nPeople could call her just Queen Camilla, but her official title is Queen Consort Camilla, or Camilla, the Queen Consort.\n\nThe vexing question of what to call her once Charles assumed the throne was resolved when the late queen announced during festivities marking her seven decades on the throne that the then-Duchess of Cornwall should be known as Queen Consort, as opposed to Princess Consort, when Charles became king.\n\n\"Queen Consort\" is the fancy name for the wife of a reigning king. In general, a queen consort's job is to support the king in any way she can. As with the first lady of the United States, there's no job description, no official duties and no salary. But there's high visibility, high pressure and high expectations from the public whose taxes pay for the monarchy.\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nIf King Charles dies, will Camilla be queen?\n\nWhile we call her Queen Camilla, she will never be the reigning queen. Only members of the royal family who are born in the direct line of succession can become the monarch.\n\nWith Prince William and his son Prince George, 9, the next two in line for the throne after King Charles, a reigning queen is unlikely to come anytime soon. (There have only been six reigning queens in British history since 1066.)\n\nWho are King Charles’ siblings?\n\nKing Charles has three siblings: From oldest to youngest, Princess Anne, The Princess Royal, 72, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, 62, and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, 58. They are all children of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.\n\nCharles' only sister, Princess Anne, is a full-time working royal, currently 16th in line for the throne. She appears in line after her younger brothers because she was born before the Succession to the Crown Act of 2013, which ended the system of male primogeniture.\n\nBefore the rules changed, younger sons would displace an elder daughter in the line of succession. Now the succession is based on birth order, not gender: Thus, Princess Charlotte, 7, is now third in line and ahead of her younger brother Prince Louis, 4, who is fourth.\n\nPrince Andrew is eighth in line for the throne despite his scandal-ridden history. He's been under fire in Britain since at least 2011 for his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted American sex offender who died in jail in 2019. After a disastrous 2019 TV interview about his relationship with Epstein, Andrew officially stepped back from public duties and as a senior working royal.\n\nEarlier this year, Andrew settled a lawsuit with an American sexual assault accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who had been airing allegations against him publicly since 2015.\n\nCharles' youngest brother, Prince Edward, the Earl of Wessex, is a full-time working royal and is 13th in line for the throne.\n\nWhat is King Charles III known for?\n\nBeyond his role in the royal family as William and Harry's father, the queen's son and the new king, Charles is known for his long and steady service as the Prince of Wales, as he carried out his official and ceremonial duties and established more than 20 charities, including The Prince's Trust, The Prince's Foundation and The Prince of Wales’s Charitable Fund.\n\nAs Queen Elizabeth's mobility waned in the months before her death, Charles stepped in for the monarch, including standing in for her for the first time at the state opening of Parliament this year, when he delivered what has long been called \"the Queen's Speech.\" Now it will be called \"the King's Speech.\"\n\nWhat are King Charles' interests? Did he serve in the military?\n\nKing Charles has shown keen interest in environmental causes including organic farming, architecture and urban planning, and fighting climate change. He served in the military, the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy in the 1970s, and will no doubt be on hand for many military parades and events during his reign.\n\nAs king, Charles is expected to \"slim down\" the monarchy – reduce the number of working senior royals supported by taxpayers – and reduce the overall multimillion-pound annual cost of the royal show.\n\nMore:How much power did Queen Elizabeth II actually have? And will King Charles III have more or less?\n\nContributing: Maria Puente, Marco della Cava, Andrea Mandell", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/09/08/queen-elizabeth-who-succeeds-more-answers-health-monitored/8020850001/", "title": "King Charles III succeeds Queen Elizabeth. What to know about ...", "text": "After 70 years on the throne, Queen Elizabeth II died Thursday at Balmoral Castle in Scotland.\n\nUpon her death, her eldest son and heir, King Charles III, immediately became king and his wife became Queen Consort Camilla.\n\n\"The death of my beloved Mother, Her Majesty The Queen, is a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family,\" King Charles said in a statement. \"We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished Sovereign and a much-loved Mother. I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world.\"\n\nStill, there are plenty of questions surrounding the queen's reign, what happens after her death and what her death means means for the British monarchy.\n\nHere is everything we know.\n\nOBITUARY:Queen Elizabeth II dies at 96; King Charles III takes the throne\n\nHow did the queen die?\n\nThe queen was 96 years old and while she remained active for a long time, in recent months her health declined. She struggled with mobility issues, causing her to skip events and postpone meetings at the suggestion of her doctors.\n\nOn Thursday, Queen Elizabeth's doctors said they were \"concerned for Her Majesty's health.\"\n\nThe news came a day after the queen postponed a meeting of senior governmental advisers known as the Privy Council. A few days prior, she decided to skip the Braemar Gathering, a popular Highland Games event she loves and attends every year. Prince Charles, now king, who normally accompanies the monarch to the Highland Games, attended in her stead.\n\nLast week, the monarch also decided to formally appoint Britain's new prime minister at Balmoral Castle rather than make the more than 800-mile round trip to London for the traditional ceremony at Buckingham Palace.\n\nIn February, the queen contracted COVID, during which the palace said she experienced \"cold-like symptoms.\"\n\nUPDATES:Queen Elizabeth II dies 'peacefully' under medical supervision: William, Harry traveled to be by her side\n\nWho succeeded the queen?\n\nWith Queen Elizabeth II's death, Charles is king and his wife, Camilla, formerly the Duchess of Cornwall, becomes the Queen Consort, a request made by Queen Elizabeth. (Charles was previously married to the late Princess Diana.)\n\n\"It is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service,\" the queen said on the eve of the 70th anniversary of her accession to the British throne, according to the statement issued by Buckingham Palace.\n\nAfter Charles, the line of succession turns to his older son, Prince William, followed by Will and Duchess Kate's children. The succession is as follows:\n\nPrince William, The Duke of Cambridge (Charles and Diana's first-born son) Prince George of Cambridge (Will and Kate's first-born son) Princess Charlotte of Cambridge (Will and Kate's second-born daughter) Prince Louis of Cambridge (Will and Kate's third-born son)\n\n► Royal news right in your inbox:Subscribe to Keep Calm and Carry On, a newsletter answering all of your questions about the royal family following Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nWhat is a queen consort?\n\nIn general, a queen consort's job is to support the king in any way she can. Among her duties are opening hospitals, cutting ribbons, planting trees and unveiling official plaques. As queen consort, she will never, ever get involved in politics.\n\nCamilla is not the reigning queen, nor will she ever be. Only members of the royal family who are born in the direct line of succession can become the monarch, so a reigning queen is unlikely to take the throne anytime soon. (There have only been six reigning queens in British history since 1066.)\n\nCamilla's future title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nHow old is King Charles?\n\nCharles is 73. He is the oldest-recorded person to become a British monarch: King William IV was 64 when he was crowned in 1830.\n\nOpinion:After Queen Elizabeth II's death, Britain is now facing the unthinkable\n\nWhere is Balmoral Castle?\n\nBalmoral Castle was the queen's privately-owned residence in a remote highland area of Scotland. Queen Elizabeth spent much of her past two years at Windsor Castle, west of London, but usually spent about two months on holiday at Balmoral.\n\nWhat is Operation London Bridge and Operation Unicorn?\n\nDetails of Operation London Bridge, as the queen's funeral plan is known, first leaked in The Guardian in May 2017, describing what would happen during the 10-day period from the day after the death and the funeral at Westminster Abbey followed by interment in St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nBut another set of plans kicks into gear because the queen died at her beloved estate in Balmoral, Scotland. Dubbed Operation Unicorn, those plans, reports say, include having the queen's body remain in Scotland for a number of days before eventually being transported likely by plane to London. There, the queen will lie in the throne room at Buckingham Palace overlooking the northwest corner of the Quadrangle interior courtyard.\n\nThe state funeral will be at Westminster Abbey, where the queen will lie in state. There will be a committal service in St. George’s Chapel, followed by burial in the royal vault's King George VI Memorial Chapel, where the queen will join her parents and sister, and be reunited with her beloved late husband.\n\nOperation Unicorn:From funeral plans to processions, what happens now that Queen Elizabeth II has died?\n\nMore details on what is set to happen:\n\nAt the moment of the sovereign's death, her eldest son and heir, Prince Charles the Prince of Wales, instantly becomes Britain's 42nd monarch since William the Conqueror in 1066.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new king will receive Parliament's motion of condolence at Westminster Hall, then depart on a tour of the kingdom to meet his people.\n\nThe procession of the coffin from Buckingham Palace to the Palace of Westminster will take place, followed by a service in Westminster Hall.\n\nThe queen lies in state at Westminster Hall.\n\nThe queen's state funeral will be at Westminster Abbey. The day will be declared a Day of National Mourning and two minutes of silence will be marked across the nation.\n\nHow long was Elizabeth queen?\n\nOver the summer, the U.K. celebrated Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee, honoring her unprecedented 70 years on the throne.\n\nTIMELINE:Queen Elizabeth II dies at 96: Her life, royal reign\n\nWho was Queen Elizabeth's husband?\n\nThe queen was married to Prince Philip for more than 70 years before he died April 9, 2021, at 99 years old. Their love story spanned decades and garnered public interest.\n\nPhilip was a steady presence behind the queen at thousands of public events, becoming as familiar to the British people as Elizabeth, if not always as beloved. British historians and commentators often say Philip was one of the keys to the queen's enduring success as a monarch. She famously described him as her \"strength and stay\" at the couple's golden wedding anniversary in 1997.\n\nWho was Prince Philip? What to know about Queen Elizabeth II's late husband\n\nHow old was Queen Elizabeth when she became the queen?\n\nThe former Princess Elizabeth was 25 years old when she became queen. It was not expected she would inherit the throne but that changed in December 1936 when her uncle, King Edward VIII, abdicated the throne. Her father, Prince Albert, the former Duke of York, became king and she, as his elder child at age 10, became the next in line.\n\nWhen he died, she was in Kenya and instantly became the reigning monarch, although the news did not immediately reach her in an era of more primitive communications technology.\n\nWho are the queen's children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren?\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip had four children, eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. Their children are Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales; Prince Andrew, the Duke of York; Princess Anne, the Princess Royal; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.\n\nHer grandchildren include Prince William, Duke of Cambridge (Duchess Kate); Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex (Duchess Meghan); Princess Eugenie (Jack Brooksbank); Princess Beatrice (Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi);Peter Philips; Zara Philips Tindall (Mike Tindall); Lady Louise Windsor; and James Viscount Severn.\n\nHer great-grandchildren include William and Kate's sons Prince George, 9, and Prince Louis, 4, and daughter Princess Charlotte, 7; Harry and Meghan's son Archie, 3, and newborn daughter Lilibet, 1; Eugenie and Jack's son August Philip, 1; Beatrice and Edoardo's newborn daughter Sienna Elizabeth Mapelli Mozzi, who turns 1 Sept. 18; Zara and Mike's daughters Mia Grace, 8, and Lena Elizabeth, 4, and newborn son Lucas, 1; and Peter and ex-wife Autumn's daughters Savannah, 11, and Isla, 10.\n\nContributing: Maria Puenteand Naledi Ushe, USA TODAY; and The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/world/royal-family-line-of-succession/index.html", "title": "The British royal family line of succession explained - CNN", "text": "(CNN) Charles has become Britain's new King following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II , at the age of 96.\n\nThe Queen became the sixth female to ascend to the British throne in February 1952, after the death of her father, King George VI.

While having fewer working royals on the payroll may appeal to republicans, such a skeleton crew may inherently detract from the pomp and circumstance that gives this centuries-old institution its magical appeal.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II dies at 96: Prince Charles takes the throne as king\n\n“We’ll likely be seeing a smaller group representing the crown, and there will be pros and cons to that,” says Carolyn Harris, historian at the University of Toronto and author of “Raising Royalty: 1,000 Years of Royal Parenting.”\n\nOn the con side, Harris foresees less frequent and shorter visits to the 54 Commonwealth countries, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which could lead to those nations debating whether to remove the British monarch as head of state. The Caribbean nation of Barbados already has.\n\nOn the pro side: “There will be a stronger line between who is representing the country and who is simply related to the royal family,” says Harris. “That’s in contrast to Queen Elizabeth, who brought in many cousins to help with tours and events as she oversaw a transition from empire to commonwealth.”\n\n►Royal news right in your inbox:Subscribe to Keep Calm and Carry On, a newsletter answering all of your questions about the royal family following Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nSo who’s in and who’s out?\n\nRoyal watchers agree Charles is not likely to corral extended relatives into the crown’s affairs as his mother did with her cousin the Duke of Kent, most famous for his role handing out trophies to the victors at Wimbledon.\n\nRather, his tapered vision of the monarchy certainly will center on himself and his wife Camilla, who the queen decreed on the 70th anniversary of the accession in February is to be called Queen Consort.\n\nThe world reacts:King Charles III expresses 'greatest sadness' over mother Queen Elizabeth II's death\n\nThe elevation in stature of Camilla – who when she wed Charles in 2005 it was announced she would be Princess Consort – is an acknowledgment of the way she has exercised her duties alongside her husband over the decades. That decorum included taking the title of Duchess of Cornwall, a purposeful avoidance of repeating the Princess of Wales title that had become so associated with the late Princess Diana.\n\nThe other key figures in Charles' tight circle are likely to include Charles’ son William and his wife Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge; and Charles’ sister Princess Anne and his brother Prince Edward, along with his wife Sophie, Countess of Wessex. As for William and Kate’s three children, Prince George, 9, Princess Charlotte, 7, and Prince Louis, 4, they also are likely to play active roles as they get older.\n\nA royal love story: Look back at Prince Philip's 73-year marriage to Queen Elizabeth II\n\nThose not likely to represent the crown include Prince Andrew, Charles’ scandal-ridden brother, and Charles’ son Prince Harry, who famously pulled back from royal duties and lives in California with his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex and their two children.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen if Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, Andrew’s daughters with ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, get called upon, the list isn’t likely to extend much beyond immediate family, says Nicoletta Gullace, associate professor of history at the University of New Hampshire.\n\n“Metaphorically, heads may roll under the new king,” says Gullace, who specializes in British history. She says royals such as Prince Michael of Kent, another of the queen’s cousins on her father’s side, who lives on royal grounds and recently was in the news after being accused of selling access to the Kremlin, “could be out in the cold.”\n\nBut the downside of having just a few royals available for events is “there’s less fairy dust, less majesty,” Gullace adds.\n\nBritish royal family tree:A look at the family tree, spanning four generations\n\nThere’s also the sheer impossibility of a small cadre of trusted royals handling all that is traditionally required of the monarchy. Charles himself will be fully occupied with meetings with foreign leaders and his own prime minister, leaving Camilla and William to take up the slack.\n\nHow to maintain an 'air of majesty'\n\n“Everyone is going to be working hard and walking a fine line in any slimmed-down monarchy,” says Victoria Arbiter, longtime royal watcher and daughter of Elizabeth’s one-time press liaison, Dickie Arbiter.\n\nArbiter says a looming concern is “maintaining an air of majesty” while at the same time addressing issues ranging from politics to climate change. “And if there are only a few people doing all that, it’ll be easy for constituents and nations to feel slighted,” she says.\n\nAnother factor is age. Charles is 73, and his wife is 75. Although Elizabeth and her mother were vibrant into their 90s, it is unknown how active the new monarchy is apt to be. That will place more pressure on younger members of the royal family to be included, says Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine.\n\n“Maybe in the end what the royal family can even be expected to do needs to be streamlined,” he says. “There are only 24 hours in their days.”\n\n'I remain committed to serving you':Queen Elizabeth II's most memorable, poignant quotes\n\nLittle says another critical factor is the difference between when Elizabeth assumed the throne and when her son did: In 1952, the world looked on in awe as a 25-year-old mother of young children suddenly became the sovereign. Charles' rite of passage has been decades in the waiting and happened at a time when the institution itself is being scrutinized like never before.\n\n\"The problem for the monarchy is Charles can never be his mother, and besides this is a much more challenging job for him in these fraught political times,\" says Anna Pasternak, veteran royal observer and author of \"The American Duchess: The Real Wallis Simpson.\"\n\nCharles' ascension plays into the hands of \"today's woke culture that sees him as an older white man of privilege.\" Adding to the troubles facing his reign, she says, is the possibility of more broadsides from Harry and his wife, who leveled charges of racism against royal family members during their TV interview with Oprah Winfrey.\n\nElizabeth was my father's 4th monarch:After Queen Elizabeth II's death, Britain is now facing the unthinkable\n\nThe ideal situation, says Pasternak, would be Charles deciding to abdicate in order for his more popular son and daughter-in-law to take over at a time when the monarchy needs stability and not more controversy. \"He knows he has a limited window in which to prove to a modern world that he has credentials to take the country forward,\" she says.\n\nBut abdication is unlikely, considering Charles' apparent eagerness for the role after waiting so long. There is also the specter of that very traumatic event back in 1936, when the newly crowned King Edward decided mere months into his reign that he wanted to marry divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson and renounced the throne, paving the way for Elizabeth's father to become king.\n\nCharles will have his challenges. The sense that he will be ruling in a potentially crippling time for the House of Windsor is shared by royal watchers.\n\n“There’s still some relevance, but the age of deference is long gone,” says Little. “There was some thought a while ago that the king could rely on his children to help him. But with Harry and Meghan pulling back and moving away, clearly, a rethinking is in order.”\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nIn keeping with a smaller monarchy, royal experts do not expect Charles to dispense titles with abandon. He may choose to bestow some of the late Prince Philip’s titles on his brother Edward to bolster his status when executing royal duties.\n\nBut he is unlikely to offer titles to Harry and Meghan’s young children, given the rift between father and son. “I think it’s doubtful Charles will automatically make any of (Harry and Meghan’s) children princes or princesses,” says Christopher Andersen, author of several royal biographies including \"The Day Diana Died\" and \"William and Kate: A Royal Love Story.\" There is \"simply too much bad blood on both sides.”\n\nAnd even if the gesture were made, Harry and Meghan could well choose to reject it.\n\n“Princess Anne said no thank you when titles were offered to her two children by the queen,” says Arbiter. “Similarly, Harry and Meghan could say ‘No thank you, we’re doing our own thing.’ ”\n\nAnd there's always the Diana factor\n\nCharles’ reign may well last a while, given his family’s good genes. But royal experts say some of the problems he is facing as he assumes the throne would likely have been skirted altogether if – and ultimately when – William became king.\n\nWilliam and his wife are relatively popular and seem to have “more of that majesty about them,” says Gullace. “And they already seem to be grooming their son George to be a future leader.”\n\nAnd then there is the once and future king’s connection to the late Princess Diana, who continues to hold powerful sway over public consciousness, as evidenced by her story’s retelling in both Netflix's “The Crown” and the film “Spencer.”\n\n“Diana respected her mother-in-law and the institution of the monarchy,” says Arbiter, who knew Diana. The Princess of Wales' family had served monarchs for years and she was proud her son would one day be king. \"She was angry with Charles, for sure, but she wouldn’t have wanted to see the monarchy destroyed.”\n\nThat seems to be the challenge looming for the less-than-adored Charles III: keep a storied global institution going so that his popular son can one day ascend the throne. It may prove to be as deft a political feat as any monarch has been asked to pull off.\n\nContributing: Maria Puente", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/09/08/camilla-queen-consort-meaning-explained/8028017001/", "title": "Queen Consort meaning: Camilla's new royal title, explained", "text": "King Charles III now presides over the British monarchy.

In the 20th century, there were two: Queen Mary, wife of King George V, and Queen Alexandra, wife of King Edward VII (Queen Elizabeth II's grandmother and great-grandmother, respectively).\n\nHandy hint: Here's how you can tell the difference between the two Elizabeths: Queen Elizabeth II had a Roman numeral after her name, signifying her as the second sovereign of that name, not a consort.\n\nAlso for the record, there have been only six British or English reigning queens among the 41 monarchs since 1066 – Mary I, Elizabeth I, Mary II, Anne, Victoria, Elizabeth II – so it's easier to tell them apart.\n\nThe queen of corgis:Photos show Queen Elizabeth's love of dogs since she was a kid\n\nWhat does a Queen Consort do?\n\nAs with the first lady of the United States, there's no job description, no official duties and no salary. But there's high visibility, high pressure and high expectations from the public whose taxes pay for the monarchy.\n\nIn general, a queen consort's job is to support the king in any way she can. Job No. 1 is to birth heirs, but that isn't an issue for Charles, 73, and Camilla, 75, who each have children from their previous marriages. The royal succession is set for three more generations: After Charles comes his elder son, Prince William, 40, and after that William's elder son, Prince George, 9.\n\nAs the wife of the Prince of Wales for the past 17 years, Camilla has already been doing what a queen consort would do: She is a royal patron to scores of charities and good causes, accompanies her husband on royal tours, meets thousands of people every year, and is gracious and charming with everyone.\n\nOne no-no: getting involved in political matters.\n\nThe world reacts:King Charles III expresses 'greatest sadness' over mother Queen Elizabeth II's death\n\nKing's first speech:Full transcript of King Charles' first national address following queen's death\n\nWho could be a model for Queen Camilla?\n\nQueen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, who became queen consort after her brother-in-law King Edward VIII abdicated in 1936, helped save the British monarchy by steeling her husband, who was nearly undone by the pressures of being an unexpected king, especially during World War II.\n\nShe went with him everywhere, visiting bombed-out Londoners in the East End and spreading her brand of royal magic that people remembered fondly many decades later. When Buckingham Palace was bombed in 1940 and the king and queen narrowly escaped harm, she said she was glad because it \"makes me feel I can look the East End in the face.\"\n\nWhen she died in 2002 at age 101, an estimated 200,000 people filed past her casket at the Palace of Westminster over three days. The line stretched more than a mile along the River Thames.\n\nTo the point: Operation London Bridge and Operation Unicorn explained following Queen Elizabeth's death\n\nDo we have to call her 'Queen Consort Camilla'?\n\nNo, Queen Camilla will do. It's nicely alliterative and the \"consort\" part is understood.\n\nThe official palace press operation will always refer to her as \"Her Majesty\" in any news release, but American media rarely use HM or HRH, for \"Her Royal Highness,\" in referring to Camilla now.\n\n► A newsletter fit for a king:Subscribe to Keep Calm and Carry On, a newsletter answering all of your questions about the royal family following Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nWhy isn't Camilla the Princess of Wales?\n\nBecause of Diana, the late Princess of Wales, who long blamed Camilla for the breakup of her marriage to Charles (even though that wasn't all Camilla's doing) and because public fury at Camilla remained when she and Charles were married in 2005, eight years after Diana's death in a car crash in Paris.\n\nAt the time, it was decided that Camilla would take one of Charles' lesser titles, Duchess of Cornwall, to help soothe public feelings.\n\nHow come men married to sovereign queens aren't called 'King'?\n\nBecause by sexist definition, a king outranks a queen, and if she is the heir – the elder daughter of a king – and she has no brother, as in the case of Elizabeth II, then she is the sovereign and not her husband. He has to walk a few paces behind her for the rest of their married life.\n\nThat's especially true if he's foreign-born, as was the case for Prince Philip.\n\nNow begins the reign of King Charles III:What kind of sovereign will he be?

The most important head at any coronation is that of the sovereign, but the queen consort is crowned, too.\n\nAnd according to The Mail on Sunday, Camilla will be crowned with the Queen Mother’s platinum and diamond tiara, created for George VI’s coronation in 1937. The crown features thousands of diamonds, including the infamous 105-carat Koh-i-Noor diamond from India, which came into British hands and the British Crown Jewels by murky means in the colonial era. It was last seen in public resting on the Queen Mother's casket at her funeral.\n\nBy contrast, when Elizabeth II was crowned in Westminster Abbey in June 1953, she was alone on the throne above the Stone of Scone, and she alone received St. Edward's Crown from the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nKing Charles III succeeds Queen Elizabeth:What to know about British royal line", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/09/08/queen-elizabeth-ii-dies-britain-longest-reigning-monarch/6353505001/", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II dead at 96, Prince Charles takes throne as king", "text": "Maria Puente and Jeff Stinson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe longest-ever reign of Queen Elizabeth II, the only monarch most of her subjects have ever known, is over. Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor died Thursday at Balmoral Castle, her estate in Scotland. She was 96.\n\nThe palace issued a black-bordered statement about 6.30 p.m. local time: \"The Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon. The King and The Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow.\"\n\nHer eldest son and heir, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, 73, immediately became King Charles III upon her death.

She increasingly handed over duties to Charles, from the recreational to the constitutional. Last week, she couldn't attend the annual Highland Games, the Braemar Gathering, which she never missed throughout her reign.\n\nOn Tuesday she presided over the transition of one prime minister to a new one, a constitutional duty as head of state which took place at Balmoral for the first time in her reign.\n\nBut on Wednesday, the palace announced she would not be able to attend via Zoom the meeting of the Privy Council, the standing committee of senior governmental advisers, after doctors' orders to rest.\n\nShe also missed significant appearances in June during the four days of celebration of her Platinum Jubilee of 70 years on the throne.\n\nThe world reacts:King Charles III expresses 'greatest sadness' over mother Queen Elizabeth II's death\n\nIn February, two weeks after marking the 70 anniversary of her ascension to the throne in 1952, the palace announced she had tested positive for COVID-19. During an audience in mid-February, the queen mentioned to her visitors that she had difficulty \"moving,\" leading to \"ongoing mobility\" issues, as Buckingham Palace put it, that prevented some appearances, including the State Opening of Parliament on May 10.\n\nShe had missed this important head-of-state role only twice before during her reign, both for pregnancies, but for the first time she officially delegated Charles to stand in for her, accompanied by his elder son, Prince William.\n\nShe was preceded in death by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, her husband of 73 years, who died April 9, 2021, at Windsor Castle at age 99, just short of his 100th birthday. He was Britain's oldest and longest-serving royal spouse in 10 centuries.\n\nHis funeral yielded poignant pictures of the queen, alone and masked, in St. George's Chapel at Windsor for a sublime service attended by only 30 members of his family amid COVID-19 restrictions.

Sign up here.\n\nThe death of a monarch is followed by a flurry of rituals, including an address to the nation by the new king and by the prime minister, followed by long-established funeral plans carried out with military precision.\n\nFor now, however, Britain prepared to mourn.\n\nThe plans include a funeral worthy of the devout and dutiful woman who pledged herself at age 21 in service to her nation and never wavered as the living symbol of the British people.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's historic reign\n\nShe reigned, never ruled, as Britain's head of state and constitutional figurehead for decades. She acceded to the throne on Feb. 6, 1952, when her father, King George VI, died at age 56. She was just 25.\n\nHaving celebrated her Diamond Jubilee of 60 years on the throne in 2012, she was the U.K.'s oldest monarch ever, and the longest-serving, surpassing her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria, who reigned 63 years and died in 1901.\n\nMore than half the people alive in Britain today have known no other monarch on their throne, their coins, their bank notes and their stamps. A modest, even shy girl, she became the most famous woman in the world, the most photographed and depicted human being in history, who met and shook hands with an estimated 4 million people or more during her reign.\n\nShe inherited a sun-never-sets empire just starting to disintegrate, then presided over its final collapse into a Commonwealth of nations that looked to her as its leader, and to which she was deeply committed to the end. She was Britain's stiff upper lip during the 20th-century post-World War II recovery, the last gasps of the empire, the Cold War and the war on terrorism.\n\nIn her colorful hats and her sturdy sensible shoes, her ever-present handbag on her arm, she was a constant through kaleidoscope changes as the 20th century roared into the 21st: the growth of television, Beatlemania, Britain's demographic transformation to a multi-ethnic society, and the rise of a celebrity culture that ensnared nearly every member of her family.\n\nShe adapted to changing times by changing – and yet not changing on the important things, such as maintaining a dignified silence – while embracing the internet age with a palace website, Facebook and Twitter accounts, and even a royal channel on YouTube.\n\nShe was stoic and carried on through the antics and scandals of members of her family. Most recently, she had to weather the public downfall of her son Prince Andrew for his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which later led in an embarrassing civil lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse. And her grandson Prince Harry's decision to move to America with his wife, Meghan, and leave royal life behind resulted in months of recriminations further inflamed by accusations of racism (hotly denied) in the royal family.\n\nWhen it was necessary, she shed her usual reserve. She presided over the heart-rending 1997 funeral of her former daughter-in-law, Princess Diana, the \"people's princess.\" She did it – despite her desire to protect Charles and Diana's two sons – to save the standing of the monarchy from a grief-maddened populace enraged by what seemed to be royal coldness and detachment in the wake of Diana's death in a car crash in Paris.\n\nIf the queen seemed occasionally out of step with the accelerating changes, she redeemed herself and the monarchy by adjusting, and she gained new popularity and admiration in her later years. Always deeply respected, she was beloved by the time she reached 80, helped partly by the release of the film \"The Queen.\" Dame Helen Mirren's transcendent performance as Her Majesty won her the Academy Award for best actress in 2007, and her tribute in her acceptance speech is as apt a eulogy as any.\n\n\"For 50 years and more, Elizabeth Windsor has maintained her dignity, her sense of duty – and her hairstyle,\" Mirren said in her acceptance speech. \"She has had her feet planted firmly on the ground, her hat on her head and her handbag on her arm. She has weathered many, many storms. And I salute her courage and her consistency.\"\n\nWhat happens to the monarchy after Queen Elizabeth's death?\n\nBiographers point to the queen's devotion to duty as her most important personal and professional characteristic, raising questions about whether the monarchy can survive long without her. Even foes of the monarchy, known as republicans in Britain, acknowledged they admired her. They see the monarchy as a hereditary institution wrapped in wealth and privilege that has no place in a modern democratic society; they credit her with not only saving it but making it more popular than ever.\n\nKing Charles III takes over:What happens to the other royals under new slimmed-down monarchy?\n\n\"She will be remembered for keeping the British monarchy going through the 20th and into the 21st century – and for leaving it in better shape,\" says Robert Lacey, the British historian and biographer who has written four books on the queen. \"She was imbued with a great sense of duty and responsibility. In the long run, that would be a strength and her charm.\"\n\nElizabeth's sense of duty was established early in her life during the monarchy's worst modern crisis: the abdication of the throne by her uncle, King Edward VIII, in 1936. The abdication shocked Britain, especially after the government and palace had kept the crisis out of the headlines until almost the day it happened. From the perspective of commoners and dukes alike, the former king was seen as shirking his duty and turning his back on his country.\n\nThe profound effect on 10-year-old Elizabeth, Lacey says, is that from then on duty was her watchword. Unlike Edward, the queen swore to never abandon the role she was thrust into by chance of birth and thus throw the monarchy and nation into crisis.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's early life\n\nShe was unlikely to be queen when born the first child of Prince Albert (Bertie) and the former Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the Duke and Duchess of York, on April 21, 1926, at her parents' townhouse in London. Her father's eldest brother, known in the family as David, was the Prince of Wales and heir to the throne after his father, and her grandfather, George V. Although single when he became Edward VIII in January 1936, he was still young enough to marry and have children.\n\nElizabeth spent her early years in quiet family life, largely at family estates in the country, where she developed a lifelong affinity for horses and dogs, especially Welsh corgis. That bucolic life was shattered after Edward quit the throne in December 1936 to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American.\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nThe abdication thrust Elizabeth's father to the throne as George VI (he took the name to honor his father), which made Elizabeth heiress presumptive and the likely next monarch. So she became a queen in training under the tutelage of her father and her austere paternal grandmother, Queen Mary.\n\nShe made her first public speech at age 14 in 1940 on BBC Radio, speaking to children, like her, who were being evacuated to safety from the London Blitz in World War II. Two years later, she got her first military appointment, colonel-in-chief of the Grenadier Guards.\n\n'I remain committed to serving you':Queen Elizabeth II's most memorable, poignant quotes\n\nOver the years, her official duties increased, giving her a taste of what was expected of her in charitable work and as figurehead of the British government and military. She became head of children's hospitals. She toured Scotland with her parents. She even became a licensed military driver in 1945 toward the end of the war.\n\nAlthough she and her younger sister, Princess Margaret Rose, spent much of the war years in the safety of Windsor Castle, they and their parents helped rally the British in the brutal effort to win the war against the Nazis. When Britain succeeded, the country was nearly bankrupt but also deeply bonded to the royal family for their roles.\n\nOn her 21st birthday, during a visit to South Africa, then still part of the empire, Princess Elizabeth addressed the British people by radio, vowing that her life, \"whether it be long or short,\" would be dedicated to serving the nation and the imperial family, now known as the Commonwealth. In 1977, celebrating her Silver Jubilee of 25 years on the throne, she told the nation that though her vow was made \"in my salad days, when I was green in judgment, I do not regret nor retract one word of it.\"\n\nFamily life was at times tumultuous\n\nIn 1947, Elizabeth married her distant cousin, Philip (she was the first British monarch to celebrate a diamond wedding anniversary), the exiled Greek prince raised mostly in Britain who was an officer in the Royal Navy and with whom she had been in love since she was 13 and he was 18.\n\nIn contrast to the 1981 fairy-tale extravaganza wedding of Charles to the former Lady Diana Spencer, Elizabeth's wedding was simple. With the country still recovering from the war, she collected ration coupons for her dress like other young brides of the time, which further endeared her to the public.\n\nThe wedding in Westminster Abbey helped lift some of the gloom that fell over London after the war, and soon there were two children to celebrate: Charles, the heir, and Princess Anne, now the Princess Royal. Her early years as a wife and mother were her happiest; then her father died in his sleep while she was on holiday in Kenya. She flew home a queen, somber but composed.\n\nShe was crowned a year later, on June 2, 1953, by this time royally trained for her job, ready for the responsibilities, accepting of the fact that her life and her family's life would never be the same again.\n\nAs a queen, Elizabeth has been an unqualified success. As a mother, not always. She suffered grief and ridicule as head of a modern, often dysfunctional royal family trapped in public expectations of Victorian-era values.\n\nCharles was born in 1948, followed by Anne in 1950. Andrew and Edward came much later, in 1960 and 1964.\n\nThe queen always wanted a large family but put it off because duty came first, biographer Lacey says. Hers was never a warm and fuzzy persona, he says, and her cool aloofness may have carried over into family life.\n\nCharles told his biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby, in 1994 that the queen was an absentee mother. She was off being queen and he was left with nannies, he said. Andrew and Edward, however, insisted they weren't starved for motherly attention. \"They made it clear they thought their mother had been absolutely marvelous,\" Lacey says.\n\nStill, her children were the chief source of distress in the most painful year of her life, 1992, what she called her \"annus horribilis,\" when the marriages of three of her children collapsed, accompanied by reams of scandalous tabloid headlines.\n\nThen, on Nov. 20, 1992, the queen's beloved Windsor Castle burned for 15 hours; 100 rooms were damaged or destroyed. \"It was symbolic of what was happening to the house of Windsor,\" Lacey says.\n\nTaxes paid to restore the castle because it was state property but Elizabeth opened parts of Buckingham Palace to the public the following year, and tourist receipts helped offset the costs.\n\nThen, things got worse. The death of the then-divorced Diana in a car crash in Paris on Aug. 31, 1997, threatened the queen's standing and that of the monarchy more than any time of her reign.\n\nWhile the queen's weeping subjects piled flowers waist-high outside Buckingham Palace and Diana's home at Kensington Palace in London, the royal family kept their grief under wraps as they holed up on their annual summer holiday at Balmoral, their estate in Scotland.\n\nThe queen's instinctive need to grieve privately was seen as out of sentimental step with a nation that wanted an unprecedented public display of sorrow and respect. At that moment, the queen's renowned sense of public sentiment eluded her. Her stiff upper lip, and the monarchy, seemed frozen in a distant time.\n\nOn the advice of then-new but savvy Prime Minister Tony Blair and others, the queen was persuaded to return to London to speak to the nation in a rare televised address. At the funeral the next day, when Diana's casket passed her standing outside the palace, she bowed her head.\n\nWith that simple gesture, the queen began turning public opinion.\n\nEsteem for the queen grew as years passed and a lifetime of official engagements stacked one on top of another. By the time of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012, according to Buckingham Palace, she had conferred more than 404,500 awards and honors; hosted 1.5 million people at garden parties and another 50,000 people a year at banquets, lunches, dinners and receptions; met 11 U.S. presidents (13 as of 2021); hosted 102 state visits in London; traveled on 325 overseas visits, including 96 state visits, to 150 countries; sent more than 540,000 telegrams to couples in the U.K. and Commonwealth celebrating a diamond wedding anniversary; served as patron to more than 620 charities or organizations; sat for 129 official portraits; and launched 23 ships. She also owned 30 corgis since 1944, and her horses won nearly every major race in Britain.\n\nDespite her calculated royal distance from the public – she never gave an interview, and people who met her were encouraged not to divulge what she said, which was usually innocuous anyway – the queen had become a familiar mother figure to her family of subjects.\n\n\"I think it's because we are comfortable with her,\" says Ingrid Seward, a veteran royals observer, biographer and editor of Majesty magazine, as the queen's popularity soared in her later years. \"We can sympathize with all that she has gone through. We know that the queen is always looking out for us. We really respect her.\"\n\nDuring her later years, foes of the monarchy acknowledged they would never be able to abolish the throne as long as the queen was alive. Public admiration for her was just too great, conceded Graham Smith of Republic, Britain's loudest advocacy group for scrapping the monarchy.\n\nThat's because the queen went about her job and avoided controversy, Smith says. Although every prime minister starting with Winston Churchill briefed her nearly every Tuesday during her reign, Elizabeth stayed above politics, never giving a hint of her political leanings or signaling publicly which prime minister she liked best.\n\nSerious debate about getting rid of the royals will come only under a monarch less astute, less admired and more gaffe-prone than Elizabeth on the throne, Smith says. \"Her most enduring quality was her ability to hold onto power.\"\n\nLacey considers that a fitting tribute to a woman who devoted her life to performing a role she didn't choose.\n\n\"In the end,\" Lacey says, \"she triumphed.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/09/12/do-queens-kings-monarch-have-any-power-fact-check/8050686001/", "title": "Fact check: Did Queen Elizabeth II have any power? Does King ...", "text": "Centuries ago, British monarchs lorded over their lands far and wide with absolute control, often to the detriment of the empire's far-flung subjects.\n\nSo what sort of power does a king or queen have in 2022? While the pomp and circumstance that are still associated with the monarchy remain impressive, from imposing palaces to shiny crowns, the reality is the role is largely ceremonial, experts say.\n\nThat may in fact be increasingly the case as King Charles III takes over for his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who died Thursday at age 96, and aims for what many royal watchers expect to be a more stripped-down monarchy.\n\nPrince Harry gives touching tribute:The Duke of Sussex honors his 'Granny' and her 'infectious smile'\n\nA British monarch reigns, but does not rule\n\nKing Charles III, much like his mum before him, does not rule, he reigns. The key difference: He cannot issue decrees or anything that remotely resembles an edict. Rather, he is seen as a figurehead whose behavior reflects suitable decorum and grace.\n\nThe monarch remains the titular head of the Church of England and the armed forces. As described on the king's official website, royal.uk, the main task of the monarch is to undertake constitutional and representational duties developed over 1,000 years of British history. In sum, lots of ribbon-cutting.\n\n\"Although The Sovereign no longer has a political or executive role, he or she continues to play an important part in the life of the nation,\" the site says.\n\n\"The Sovereign acts as a focus for national identity, unity and pride; gives a sense of stability and continuity; officially recognizes success and excellence; and supports the ideal of voluntary service. In all these roles The Sovereign is supported by members of their immediate family.\"\n\nWhy some find it difficult to grieve:The complexity of mourning Queen Elizabeth II\n\nThe monarch's reserve powers are rarely invoked but remain on the books\n\nIn 1689, Great Britain officially became a constitutional monarchy. That means the power to pass legislation resides with an elected body known as Parliament.\n\nQueen Elizabeth (and now King Charles) possessed so-called reserve powers, also known as prerogative powers or personal prerogatives.\n\nAs the keeper of the nation's Constitutional flame, the monarch can use said powers to appoint and dismiss ministers; to summon Parliament, and give royal assent to bills passed by Parliament. Notably, the king or queen can remove a prime minister who will not resign, despite losing the confidence of Parliament's House of Commons.\n\nWhile those powers seem vast, they come with asterisks. The royal assent to bills is considered automatically granted when it passes both Houses of Parliament, and any summoning is typically done on the advice of ministers, advice that is expected to be followed by the sovereign.\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nLeading the Church of England is an important if ceremonial position\n\nAt her coronation in 1953, Queen Elizabeth, who drew comfort from her Christian faith, took an oath to \"maintain and preserve inviolably the settlement of the Church of England, and the doctrine worship, discipline, and government thereof, as by law established in England.\" It is expected that Charles will carry on this tradition.\n\nSince 1970, Elizabeth addressed a convocation of Church of England leaders, a body known as the General Synod, and continued to do so every five years for the rest of her reign, according to royal.uk.\n\nAnother of her traditions was distributing coins to pensioners every Maundy Thursday, the day Christians commemorate the Last Supper of Jesus. She did so at churches and cathedrals through the realm.\n\nAll the queen's corgis: Family tree shows Elizabeth's lifelong passion for signature dogs\n\nThe sovereign presides over the armed forces but defers decisions to professionals\n\nThe king or queen is the titular leader of the British Armed Forces, and military members – who over the years have included many members of the House of Windsor – swear allegiance to the sovereign.\n\nBut in terms of the actual ability to deploy military forces, that power is transferred from sovereign to the prime minister and secretary of defense, who in turn, much like in the U.S. system of government, pass those responsibilities on to career officers.\n\n\"Years ago, the monarch certainly had broad powers, but now that's delegated to people who are elected,\" says Myko Clelland, Scotland-based royal historian with genealogy website MyHeritage. \"A monarch today could declare war and peace, but that's happening on the advice of government.\"\n\nKing Charles III, who served in the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy in the 1970s, will no doubt be on hand for many military parades and events, and will likely continue his mother's tradition of handing out the Elizabeth Cross, given to families of those killed as a result of military operations or terrorism.\n\nA look at the royal succession:Who ascends to the throne after the queen's death?\n\nMonarchs interact with elected officials while skirting politics\n\nQueen Elizabeth met with newly elected Prime Minister Liz Truss just two days before her death. The meeting, which traditionally is held at Buckingham Palace, is an opportunity for the sovereign to officially ask the incoming prime minister to form a government in her or his name.\n\nThe sovereign also officially dissolves previous governments ahead of national elections. But he or she will steer far clear of political opinions.\n\n\"The queen notably had no official opinion on Brexit,\" the successful vote that saw England leave the European Union, says Clelland. \"The monarchy is still here precisely because they've remained above those kinds of decisions.\"\n\nFor decades, the queen served as a trusted adviser to prime ministers dating back to Winston Churchill, offering a unique sounding board to them all.\n\n►Royal news right in your inbox: Subscribe to Keep Calm and Carry On, a newsletter answering all of your questions about the royal family following Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nThe British monarch is head of state in increasingly fewer countries\n\nWhere there once was a far-flung and often exploitative British Empire, today there is a Commonwealth of Nations, 56 independent countries that were part of that empire.\n\nMany of those have broken entirely from the monarchy, most recently Barbados, which last fall, with then-Prince Charles present, became a republic. Instead of being tied to the British king or queen, they elect their head of state but remain as members of the Commonwealth.\n\nBut Canada, Australia and New Zealand, among a dozen other nations, still consider themselves constitutional monarchies. While the king is regarded as head of state there, the sovereign’s role remains largely symbolic.\n\n\"The queen embraced this idea of a family of nations, a way to essentially keep the notion of an empire while preserving effective ties to ex-colonial subjects,\" says Nicoletta Gullace, associate professor of history at the University of New Hampshire.\n\nWhat's next for the young royals? King Charles names Will and Kate the Prince and Princess of Wales\n\nWill the powers of a monarch shrink more during King Charles III's reign?\n\nThe upheavals faced by the monarchy during Queen Elizabeth's 70-year reign were significant. Personal scandals coupled with a growing sentiment that questioned the purpose of a monarchy suggest that King Charles may well look to further scale things back, perhaps limiting key engagements to himself and the heir apparent, Prince William, experts say.\n\n“We’ll likely be seeing a smaller group representing the crown, and there will be pros and cons to that,” says Carolyn Harris, historian at the University of Toronto and author of “Raising Royalty: 1,000 Years of Royal Parenting.”\n\nOn the con side, Harris foresees less frequent and shorter visits to the Commonwealth countries, which could lead to more nations becoming republics.\n\nOn the pro side: “There will be a stronger line between who is representing the country and who is simply related to the royal family,” says Harris. “That’s in contrast to Queen Elizabeth, who brought in many cousins to help with tours and events as she oversaw a transition from empire to commonwealth.”\n\nThe next generation:Could Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan's children gain royal titles now?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/09/09/prince-harry-meghan-children-royal-title-questions-king-charles/8032555001/", "title": "Will Prince Harry, Meghan's kids get royal titles from King Charles?", "text": "Queen Elizabeth II's death Thursday brought – among many things – a new title for her son, formerly Prince Charles. Will the reign of now-King Charles III bring new titles for Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan's children, too?\n\nIt could, if tradition continues. But ultimately, it's Charles' decision now – and if he were to sign off, Harry and Meghan would still need to agree, too.\n\nAnd lately, they have not been on good terms.\n\nWhen Harry and Meghan welcomed their first-born, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, in 2019, the current royal rules stated that he would not automatically receive a title, with the understanding that that could change once Charles ascended the throne.\n\nBut as the couple laid out in their tell-all Oprah Winfrey interview last year, the lack of title presented greater issues, because it meant their children – the first Black descendants of the royal family – could not, as a consequence, get royal security coverage despite intense media attention.\n\nRead the obituary:Queen Elizabeth II dies at 96; King Charles III takes the throne\n\nNow begins the reign of King Charles III:What kind of sovereign will he be? Not like his mother\n\n\"If he’s not going to be a prince, it’s like, 'OK, well, he needs to be safe, so we’re not saying don’t make him a prince.' … But if you’re saying the title is what’s going to affect their protection, we haven’t created this monster machine around us in terms of clickbait and tabloid fodder,\" Meghan told Winfrey of her frustrations with the palace. \"You’ve allowed that to happen, which means our son needs to be safe.\"\n\nUnder the King George V Convention, a legal document from 1917 that expresses the royal will, the children and grandchildren of a monarch should be dubbed prince or princess. As the closest descendants most likely to ever assume the throne, they are usually given those titles at birth.\n\nThe monarch could also decide to extend those titles to great-grandchildren. Thus, Prince William's children – Prince George, now second in line; Princess Charlotte, third in line; and Prince Louis, fourth in line – were granted their titles at birth by their great-grandmother, the late queen.\n\nWhen his children were born, Harry was sixth in line to the throne. Now he is fifth, Archie is sixth and Lilibet is seventh. The queen's other great-grandchildren (there are 12 in total) behind the Sussex children in the line of succession were not given prince or princess titles, either.\n\nBut even with tradition, Charles and Harry's relationship could complicate things: Harry told Winfrey last year that his father \"stopped taking my calls\" amid their decision to step back as senior members of the royal family. And given that decision and their subsequent move to California, Harry and Meghan could also choose to turn down the titles they once sought for their children.\n\nQueen Elizabeth updates:King Charles makes William, Kate Prince and Princess of Wales\n\nThe palace has not released any new information about title changes for the royals. The official website of the royal family has been updated to note that Prince William is now first in the line of succession, though no names down the line have been changed.

At age 73, he is the oldest monarch to ever take the British throne.\n\nNot since 1952 when Charles' grandfather, King George VI, died and his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, took the throne at the age of 25, has a sovereign died and a new sovereign succeeded.\n\nCharles will be crowned probably within the year; the ancient ritual of the coronation requires advance planning, although a lot of that has already been done. But there hasn't been a coronation since June 1953 when Elizabeth was crowned.\n\nThe queen died Thursday at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, at age 96 after 70 years on the throne. Her funeral is set to take place at Westminster Abbey, where most important royal ceremonies take place.\n\nThat will be followed by a committal service in St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where she will be buried in the King George VI Memorial Chapel alongside her beloved late husband, Prince Philip, and her parents and sister.\n\nThe world reacts: King Charles III expresses 'greatest sadness' over mother Queen Elizabeth II's death\n\nWhat happens next after the death of Elizabeth?\n\nMost people in the U.K. have never lived through such a momentous event as the death of a monarch, so they have nothing to compare it to. But there's little puzzlement in the royal palaces, in Parliament or the British government, and almost certainly none in Charles' mind.\n\nWhat happens next has been carefully planned out decades in advance, based on combining ancient funeral and coronation traditions with practical measures to cope with such modern realities as instant communication, traffic control, social media and the vestiges of a killer pandemic.\n\nWhat kind of sovereign will Charles be? That's a different question. But we can make some guesses based on what he's said and done at least since his investiture as Prince of Wales in an elaborate (and largely modern-invention ceremony) in July 1969 at Caernarfon Castle in Wales, when he was 20.\n\nLegally, he became king from the moment of the queen's death, meaning he is head of state for the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a dozen other countries. He's also the titular head of the Church of England, head of the military and the judiciary, and a host of other royal titles and duties.\n\nCharles, like his mother, will likely take the religious significance of his coronation very seriously, as a man long interested in philosophy and religious thought.\n\n\"He won’t really be king (in his mind) until he's consecrated with the holy oil, makes the sacred oath and has the crown on his head,\" says his American biographer Sally Bedell Smith. \"That moment when he is a 'transcendent being,' in a way, is really, really crucial.\"\n\nWhat happens now that Queen Elizabeth II has died?From funeral plans to processions\n\n► Stay up to date with the latest on King Charles III and the royal succession with our newsletter Keep Calm and Carry On. Sign up here.\n\nWhat is Charles' legacy as Prince of Wales?\n\nJust as the queen was the longest-serving monarch in British history, Prince Charles has been the longest-serving Prince of Wales in history – but not just that, says Bedell Smith.\n\n\"His record as Prince of Wales, in its breadth and depth, will be his real legacy,\" Bedell Smith says. \"He was the most innovative prince of Wales ever – he was an activist in a way no other heir to the throne ever has been.\"\n\nPart of the impetus for doing all he did, including his philanthropy, his entrepreneurial initiatives, the institutions and traditions he helped to preserve, demonstrate \"his wish to prove himself worthy of being king,\" Bedell Smith says.\n\n\"As prince of Wales, he had the freedom to do all these things, and he sometimes crossed the line of constitutional propriety, but as prince of Wales he was not bounded by it as the queen was.\"\n\nQueen Elizabeth II dies at 96:King Charles III takes the throne\n\nCamilla and the shadow of Princess Diana\n\nThe first potential problem of Charles' reign – what to call his wife – has been mostly resolved by his mother: On the eve of her Accession Day, Feb. 6, 2022, she declared publicly in a message to her people that it was her \"sincere wish\" that Charles' second wife Camilla, 75, then the Duchess of Cornwall (instead of Princess of Wales), should be known as Queen Consort when her son succeeds.\n\nIt was what Charles had wanted from the day he married the former Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005 when it was announced that she would be known as Princess Consort when he became king. It was a gesture to the many still-angry partisans of the late Princess Diana, who blamed Camilla for breaking up her marriage to Charles.\n\nBy law and custom, Camilla would be Queen Consort anyway, and legislation would be required to go against Charles' wishes as king. But his mother provided for a smooth transition and reduced public carping by making clear her wishes in advance.\n\nThe late queen's endorsement of Camilla was crystal clear by January 2022 when she \"graciously\" appointed Camilla a Royal Lady of the Order of the Garter. Founded by Edward III in 1348, the prestigious Order of the Garter is the oldest and most senior British order of chivalry; the appointment was an unmistakable sign of the top royal's approval.\n\n\"It paves the way for the duchess to become not only queen by right when Prince Charles succeeds to the throne, but queen by name,\" wrote royal biographer Hugo Vickers in The Daily Mail at the time. \"There is no greater honor or better indication of the respect in which she is held by the queen.\"\n\nIt also means that Camilla will be crowned alongside Charles at his coronation.\n\nBut will Charles' low popularity ratings, still influenced in some quarters by his contentious 1996 divorce from Diana, the so-called \"War of the Waleses,\" hobble him? Unflattering pop-culture portrayals such as \"The Crown\" and \"Spencer\" don't help, says Bedell Smith.\n\n\"There will be a lot of people in media and on social media who want to undermine him,\" she says. \"The shadow of Diana, shockingly, hasn’t diminished in all these years. It will plague him for the rest of his life; it's baggage he's carrying unfairly but it’s there. The only thing he can do is sail on and do his job and try not to let it get to him.\"\n\nWhat happens to the other royals?King Charles III promises a new slimmed-down monarchy\n\nWhat are Charles' plans?\n\nCharles has made no secret of his desire to \"slim down\" the monarchy – reduce the number of working senior royals supported by taxpayers – and reduce the overall multimillion-pound annual cost of the royal show. There has been talk that he will perhaps open Buckingham Palace to paying tourists year-round (it's only open during the summer now) or by turning private royal residences, such as Balmoral Castle in Scotland, into museums.\n\nHis many causes (organic farming, architecture and urban planning, fighting climate change, to name a few) will not be abandoned but at least initially he will be too busy with routine matters, such as weekly meetings with the prime minister and going through the multiple red boxes of government documents he must read daily, Bedell Smith predicts.\n\nKing Charles III succeeds Queen Elizabeth:What to know about British royal line\n\n\"He will be more voluble in those meetings than his mother, he will offer more opinions which, fortunately, (ministers) don’t have to do anything about,\" Bedell Smith says. \"He will be less reserved in his meetings than his mother was but he won’t try in any way to directly influence government policy because the (unwritten British) constitution prohibits that.\"\n\nOf course, there is incremental change and then there is big, honking, alarm-bell change, and the difference is in the eye of the beholder.\n\nCharles, whose interest in religions other than the Church of England, once mused about altering his role as \"Defender of the Faith\" to \"Defender of Faith,\" to acknowledge the diversity of religions in modern Britain.\n\nBut that would require legislation in Parliament and would likely send the British establishment up the wall. After all, since 1701 it's been illegal for a British sovereign or spouse to be a Roman Catholic.\n\nInstead, Charles might choose a less controversial gesture, such as a more inclusive and ecumenical coronation featuring a more visible presence of other faiths, suggests Bedell Smith, who describes Charles as a \"spiritual questor\" since his school days in Scotland.\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nCan Charles toe the line as a 'constitutional' king?\n\nMost of the speculation about the new king has focused on whether Charles would violate those prohibitions by being outspoken about political and other matters of public debate in a way his mother carefully avoided.\n\nAs prince of Wales, Charles was not always as scrupulous as his mother was, says Clive Irving, a longtime British journalist (former managing editor of the Sunday Times in London) and author of \"The Last Queen,\" a biography of Charles' mother that questions whether the monarchy can survive after her.\n\n\"She has always been neutral and apolitical, no one has caught her out on her political views and that is the difference between her and Charles – he can't help himself,\" says Irving. \"We know nothing about her views, we know an incredible amount about Charles' views. It's incredibly difficult to step into the shoes of (the queen's) kind of monarch.\"\n\nStill, says British journalist and royals commentator Anna Pasternak, Charles has learned important values from his mother, including deep loyalty to the monarchy and an \"unshakeable sense of duty.\" But she was no-nonsense and unemotional; he's more passionate, Pasternak says.\n\n\"One thing I’ve observed is that the more impassioned members of the royal family don’t tend to fare well,\" Pasternak says. \"If you have the stoicism that the queen (had), you do better, you’re able to put the role before your own character and your personal needs. Charles hasn’t been able to do that.\"\n\nWhat's the critical take on Charles?\n\nA frank critic of Charles, Irving describes him as a \"self-centered and narcissistic,\" having lived a coddled, entitled and privileged existence, an \"archaic-looking figure\" out of step with the times, and unused to being challenged.\n\n\"How can that kind of psychology possibly adapt to a completely different responsibility as head of state?\" Irving says. \"The magic of monarchy means something different to him, he interprets it through his own psychology.\"\n\nIrving predicts that the first year of Charles' reign will see the monarchy head \"over a cliff very fast\" amid disillusionment with the new king. \"She was brilliant at projecting classlessness – how can he possibly share the realities of our lives if he's never lived those realities?\"\n\nHowever privileged his upbringing, Charles has gone out of his way to demonstrate he cares about the less fortunate, especially through his charities, such as the Prince's Trust, which he founded in 1976 to help disadvantaged youths. The trust claims to have provided support to more than 1 million youths over the years.\n\nLast month, Charles served as editor of a special edition of the British African-Caribbean newspaper The Voice, the only national Black British newspaper operating in the U.K., which is marking its 40th anniversary this year. According to the palace, his edit celebrated the achievements of the Black community and reiterated Charles' collaborations with Black leaders and the work of his charities in those communities. (Charles' charities, his vast Duchy of Cornwall, and a host of other prince of Wales duties and activities will be taken over by his heir, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and other members of the family.)\n\nCharles also has attempted to push back against the criticism that he is too much a meddler to be a constitutional king. In an interview with the BBC for a documentary when he turned 70 in 2018, Charles made it clear he knows the rules and will follow them as king.\n\n\"I'm not that stupid,\" he snapped in the interview. \"I do realize that it is a separate exercise being sovereign, so of course, I understand entirely how that should operate.\" He should: He's been in training for this job since he was 4.\n\nCharles faces rare challenges\n\nCharles faces a challenge few other succeeding monarchs in British history have ever faced, a challenge not alleviated by his lower popularity ratings compared to his mother's, says Carolyn Harris, a historian and teacher at the University of Toronto and author of \"Raising Royalty: 1000 Years of Royal Parenting.\"\n\n\"When there is a long reign, the monarchy and the person as the monarch come to be seen as the same,\" Harris says. \"For many people, the queen is the only monarch they've ever known, so they closely associate the monarchy with her. The challenge is to step into that role when there's been a successful monarch in that role for decades.\"\n\nIrving says this transition could have been ameliorated had the queen abdicated or stepped aside before her death, allowing Charles to serve as prince regent for a period. But the queen promised she would never abdicate and she kept her promise.\n\n\"It would have been an entirely different piece of chemistry there, the country would have had the chance to get used to him, it would be easier than a sudden switch,\" Irving says.\n\nLong may he reign?\n\nCold life-expectancy calculations suggest Charles's reign will not come close to matching his mother's in years. He's more likely to echo the experience of one of his ancestors, Edward VII, who waited almost 60 years to succeed his mother Queen Victoria in 1901, and then reigned for only nine years.\n\nChristopher Andersen, author of multiple royal biographies (including his latest, \"Brothers and Wives: Inside the Private Lives of William, Kate, Harry and Meghan\"), thinks Charles could still enjoy a longish reign given his parents' longevity. (His father, Philip, died just short of his 100th birthday.)\n\n\"He has been waiting his entire life to do the job he was born to do, and will rush to make his mark on the monarchy,\" Andersen predicts. \"Given his mother's immense popularity and his lackluster standing in the polls, Charles would be wise to go slow, but he won't.\n\n\"Charles is not by nature a patient man; he is used to getting his way,\" Andersen says. \"Now that he no longer has Mama to answer to, that's not likely to change.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/09/uk/royal-family-king-charles-iii-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Royal family: As King Charles III takes the throne, big changes lie ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGod save the Queen, long live the King.

With him were his son Prince William and his wife Camilla, the Queen Consort. Prev Next\n\nThe moment Elizabeth II died, her eldest child, Charles, automatically became monarch. As sovereign, he has chosen to take the name King Charles III.\n\nAll rights and responsibilities of the Crown now rest with King Charles III.\n\nHe becomes head of state not just in the UK but in 14 other Commonwealth realms including Australia and Canada. He will become head of the 56-member Commonwealth, although that is not a hereditary position, after his succession to the role was agreed by Commonwealth leaders at a meeting in London in 2018.\n\nHe has become head of the British Armed Forces, the judiciary and the civil service, and he is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. He is the Fount of Honour, which means all honors, such as knighthoods, will now be given in his name.\n\nThe United Kingdom does not have a codified constitution, so the role of monarchy is defined by convention rather than law. He has a duty to remain politically impartial, which means he will come under greater scrutiny if he continues to express the views he is known for.\n\nHe has championed alternative medicines and organic farming techniques. In 1984, he hit out at the “glass stumps and concrete towers” of modern architecture. He has spent decades warning of the dangers of climate change. In the so-called “black spider” memos, he raised the issues he was concerned about directly with ministers.\n\nIn a BBC documentary to mark his 70th birthday, Charles acknowledged having ruffled feathers with his past interventions. But he promised not to meddle in controversial affairs once sovereign, saying he would operate within “the constitutional parameters.”\n\nElizabeth stayed “above politics” and never expressed herself in any way on any issue and as a result she rarely divided opinion. She managed to retain popular support and cross-party support in parliament, which was the one body with the power to dethrone her.\n\nWe will never know what she discussed in her regular audiences with her prime ministers, beginning with Churchill, but Charles is a more outspoken character. Will he go quiet on policy matters in public but continue to lobby in private? Will the prime minister act on it?\n\nThe prime ministerial audiences are one of several constitutional duties to which King Charles III will be expected to step up and they will bring him in regular contact with policymakers. He appoints the prime minister, opens parliamentary sessions, approves legislation and official appointments, receives the credentials of foreign ambassadors and hosts world leaders on state visits.\n\nCharles has also adopted the symbolic position as Head of Nation, meaning he becomes the symbol of national identity, unity, and pride. He represents continuity and celebrates excellence on behalf of the country. That’s why we see the monarch opening national events and leading commemorations.\n\nPeople would look to Elizabeth in times of crisis, but will they rally around King Charles III in the same way? He is more divisive not just because of his honest views but also because of the bad taste still left from his acrimonious divorce from his immensely popular first wife, Diana.\n\nAll the official royal residences including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle will now be under his control. There are also other residences such as Balmoral in Scotland and Sandringham in Norfolk which the Queen owned privately – and the nation will have to see to whom she leaves them in her will.\n\nEither way, Charles’ wealth has ballooned. By far the biggest slice of the family’s fortune, the £16.5 billion ($19 billion) Crown Estate, now belongs to him as reigning monarch. But under an arrangement dating back to 1760, the monarch hands over all profits from the estate to the government in return for a slice, called the Sovereign Grant.\n\nThe estate includes vast swathes of central London property and the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It has the status of a corporation and is managed by a chief executive and commissioners — or non-executive directors — appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the prime minister.\n\nThe grant, which covers the cost of his official duties and amounted to £86.3 million ($99.2 million) for the 2021/2022 financial year. He will take charge of the Royal Collection, which includes one of the most valuable art collections in the world. He also picks up the Duchy of Lancaster, a private estate dating back to 1265, which was valued at about £653 million ($764 million) according to its most recent accounts. Income from its investments cover official costs not met by the Sovereign Grant, and helps support other Royal family members.\n\nKing Charles III has become one of the richest men in England overnight.\n\nCamilla\n\nCharles and Camilla attend the Order of the Garter Service at St George's Chapel on June 13, 2022 in Windsor, England. Toby Melville/Getty Images\n\nFor years, the big question around Charles’ wife surrounded her title. At the time their wedding was announced in February 2005, the official statement said: “It is intended that Mrs Parker Bowles should use the title HRH The Princess Consort when The Prince of Wales accedes to The Throne.” That was a very clear signal that Camilla would not use the title of Queen. Her office at Clarence House distanced itself from that statement in the intervening years, however, saying it was a matter for the reigning monarch.\n\nThen, in February 2022, the Queen expressed her desire for her daughter-in-law to be known as Queen Consort when Charles became King in a message marking the start of her platinum jubilee year – a statement that appeared to resolve the issue for good.\n\nThe Queen’s wishes were welcomed by the couple themselves. That same weekend, a statement released by a spokesperson said they had been “touched and honoured by Her Majesty’s words.”\n\nWhere will the couple live? Well, traditionally the new monarch would move into Buckingham Palace but in 2011, the BBC reported that Charles was considering moving his entire court to Windsor and turning Buckingham Palace into an events center. That would be a dramatic and controversial shift but might also assert King Charles III as the new boss.\n\nWilliam and Catherine\n\nWilliam and Catherine are pictured with their children, George, Charlotte and Louis, and the Queen, Charles and Camilla at Buckingham Palace during platinum jubilee celebrations on June 5, 2022. Toby Hancock/CNN\n\nUp until now, Charles has been responsible for covering the costs of his heir, Prince William.\n\nWilliam has now inherited his father’s titles of The Duke of Cornwall, which comes with an estate which last year delivered an income of £23 million ($26 million). That money now goes straight to William and he becomes independently wealthy.\n\nHis new title is HRH The Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge and tradition dictates that, as first in line to the throne, he also becomes Prince of Wales. And Catherine becomes Her Royal Highness, The Princess of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge.\n\nWilliam and Catherine will be able to solidify their own independent court, which is currently based at Kensington Palace in west London, in an apartment that was refurbished shortly after their marriage. It seems unlikely that William would want to move, so the King’s former residences, including Clarence House and Birkhall in the Scottish Highlands, will likely remain vacant until Charles offers them to other members of the family, or finds an alternative use. The family resides at Adelaide Cottage in Windsor during school term time.\n\nPrince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis will follow their parents’ titling. They are now Their Royal Highnesses Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis of Cornwall and Cambridge. Colloquially they are likely to be known as George, Charlotte and Louis Wales.\n\nHarry and Meghan\n\nMeghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry react as they attend the annual One Young World Summit in Manchester, north-west England on September 5, 2022. Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt’s unlikely that Charles’ second son, Harry, will be offered a royal office unless he and wife Meghan return to their royal duties, and the King would also need to confirm that they can continue to use Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate, which is part of the royal estate. They currently live with son Archie and daughter Lilibet in California but were allowed to continue using Frogmore as their official residence during the Queen’s reign.\n\nWhen Harry and Meghan announced in early 2020 that they were stepping back from royal duties, they said they would “work to become financially independent.” The terms of the split stipulated that while the pair would always remain part of the family, they would no longer use their HRH titles.\n\nAs grandchildren of the monarch, Archie now automatically becomes Prince Archie of Sussex while Lilibet will be Princess Lilibet of Sussex. Whether they use those titles will only become known the first time their parents refer to them publicly.\n\nPrince Andrew and other family members\n\nKing Charles III also becomes responsible for distributing roles, responsibilities and resources to other members of the royal family.\n\nCharles has never been close to his brother Andrew, who stepped back from royal duties over his links to the late disgraced financier, Jeffrey Epstein. In January 2022 he was stripped of his HRH title, as well as others associated with the military and charity roles. That raises the question of whether the new King continues to allow Andrew to use his Buckingham Palace apartment and offers financial support.\n\nThen there are his other siblings, Princess Anne and Prince Edward, and more distant relatives such as the Gloucesters and Kents who retain royal residences at Kensington.\n\nPrincess Anne attends a service at St Giles' Cathedral on June 30, 2022 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nCharles will need to decide how much family support he needs to carry out his duties and who he wants to offer it. Then he can reveal what support he offers in return. Many of these decisions would already have been taken and the first telling signs of where his loyalties lie will be seen in who gets to keep which residences and especially who gets an upgrade.\n\nAnne and Edward, and his wife Sophie, The Countess of Wessex, are expected to continue with their public duties following decades of dedicated service but the new King needs to balance that against pressure for a slimmed down monarchy in austere times.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}]}

Virginia announced Thursday that the case in its state is a woman\n\nWalensky called for an approach \"guided by science, not by stigma.\"\n\n\"This is a community that has the strength and has demonstrated the ability to address challenges to their health by focusing on compassion and science,\" she said in an apparent reference to the AIDS epidemic.\n\n\"While some groups may have a greater chance of exposure right now, infectious diseases do not care about state or international borders. They're not contained within social networks, and the risk of exposure is not limited to any one particular group,\" she warned.\n\nWalensky implored Americans \"to approach this outbreak without stigma and without discrimination.\"\n\n'We shouldn't be surprised to see more cases'\n\nThe CDC is working to learn more about the outbreak: Samples from the nine identified cases were sent to the agency for additional confirmatory testing and genomic investigation, Walensky noted, and there are efforts to learn how each person contracted the virus.\n\nSome of the nine cases have a recent history of international travel to areas with active monkeypox outbreaks, she said, but others do not.\n\nOfficials expect more cases to be diagnosed as the CDC has urged doctors and Americans to be on the lookout for symptoms.\n\n\"We shouldn't be surprised to see more cases reported in the US in the upcoming days. It's actually a sign that Americans are remaining vigilant, and health care providers and public health workers are doing their job,\" said Dr. Raj Panjabi, White House senior director for health security and biodefense.\n\nAs part of this outbreak, the CDC has been tracking multiple clusters of monkeypox that have been reported in early- to mid-May in several countries that don't normally report such infections, including regions in Europe and North America.\n\nMonkeypox is rare in the United States, and the virus does not occur naturally in the country, according to the CDC. After the virus jumps from an animal to a human, human-to-human transmission can happen through close direct contact, such as via large respiratory droplets or lesions on the skin.\n\nMonkeypox symptoms can include fever, headache, muscle aches and swollen lymph nodes. A characteristic of the disease is that it can cause lesions or pustules and a rash on the body, including the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.\n\nUS plans to move vaccine to states that need it most\n\nThe US has mobilized vaccine for monkeypox to states that have reported cases and plans to move the vaccine where it may be needed, Walensky said Thursday.\n\n\"The US has the resources we need to help us respond to monkeypox in this country right now. We've been preparing for this type of outbreak for decades,\" she said.\n\nThe US has two preventive vaccines and two antiviral treatments that can be used for orthopox, the family of viruses that includes monkeypox.\n\n\"One of these vaccines, with the trade name of Jynneos, is approved for the prevention of monkeypox disease in adults 18 years of age and older,\" Walensky said. \"CDC has mechanisms in place to move these products around the country so that they can be used for prevention or treatment for people who may benefit, wherever they may be.\"\n\nPanjabi said that vaccination against monkeypox has been offered to health care workers in Massachusetts, where the first US case in this outbreak was identified last week.\n\n\"In Massachusetts, they got it as the Jynneos vaccine as of Sunday, and we're offering it to health care providers who've had high-risk exposure or are eligible according to the state and CDC guidance,\" Panjabi said.\n\nCDC officials are recommending vaccination for people at highest risk of infection due to direct contact with someone who has monkeypox.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Right now, while we are in the early phase of investigating this, we know that those at highest risk for infection are those who had contact with a known monkeypox patient, with the kind of contact that would facilitate spread. So those are the individuals we're really focusing on recommending vaccination for right now: post-exposure vaccination,\" said Dr. Jennifer McQuiston, deputy director of the CDC's Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology.\n\n\"We continue to watch what is happening and think about whether wider vaccination recommendations would make sense, but at this time, we only have nine known cases, and we have contacts that we've identified associated with those cases that would likely most benefit from vaccines,\" McQuiston said. \"And so that's where we're focusing our energies right now.\"", "authors": ["Betsy Klein", "Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/08/02/monkeypox-cases-state-numbers-outbreak/10210682002/", "title": "How many monkeypox cases in my state?

The outbreak, first spotted in Europe in late April, has reached 103 countries – the vast majority in nations that hadn't previously had significant caseloads of the rare, viral infection.\n\nIn addition to the California death, the CDC has confirmed that 18 people outside the U.S. have died of the disease in 2022. Still, the world's largest monkeypox outbreak belongs to the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. had reported 22,774 confirmed monkeypox/orthopoxvirus cases as of Wednesday, per the CDC.

The patient was severely immunocompromised and had been hospitalized, officials said.\n\nIt's possible that this marks the first recorded U.S. death from monkeypox, but health officials are also investigating whether monkeypox contributed to the August death of a Texas adult.

This came days after the Biden administration announced a nationwide public health emergency.\n\nAs of Sept. 8, more than 460,000 doses have been given, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the deputy coordinator of the White House national monkeypox response, said last week.\n\nThe administration has also promised to ramp up vaccination offerings at large LGBTQ events, like Pride festivals, around the country in the coming weeks.\n\nMonkeypox is not a gay disease. But LGBTQ leaders say they need more help for gay men and everyone else\n\nRepeating history:After repeating early COVID mistakes, US now has the world’s biggest monkeypox outbreak\n\nMonkeypox does not usually cause serious illness – however, it can result in hospitalization or death. The virus is spread through close, physical contact. The current outbreak is primarily affecting men who have sex with men (93% of U.S. cases), but health officials stress that the virus can infect anyone.\n\nHowever, experts have also stressed concerns of worsening racial disparities in the reported cases.

We don't know the scope and the potential of it yet, but we have to act like it will have the capability of spreading much more widely than it's spreading right now,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN on Saturday.\n\nFormer US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb warned that it may be too late to control and contain the virus.\n\n\"I think the window for getting control of this and containing it probably has closed. If it hasn't closed, it's certainly starting to close,\" Gottlieb told CBS' Margaret Brennan on Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nMonkeypox has been detected throughout most of the US, except for a handful of states, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The states with the most cases include New York, California, Illinois and Florida.\n\nThe latest data shows that the CDC has tracked at least 1,814 probable or confirmed cases in the US, as of Friday, and a total of 12,556 confirmed cases in 68 countries.\n\nFauci, who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, told CNN's Laura Coates that the numbers are \"very likely an undercount.\"\n\n\"Whenever you have the emergence of something like this, you are always probably looking at what might be -- might be, we don't know -- the tip of the iceberg, so that's the reason why we've got to get the testing out there in a much, much more vigorous way,\" Fauci said.\n\nGottlieb echoed the need for testing.\n\n\"We're probably detecting just a fraction of the actual cases because we had, for a long time, a very narrow case definition on who got tested and by and large, we're looking in the community of men who have sex with men and at STD clinics. So we're looking there, we're finding cases there, but it's a fact that there's cases outside that community right now. We're not picking them up because we are not looking there.\"\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that there have been eight cases of monkeypox diagnosed among individuals who were female at birth and that no cases have been reported in children or adolescents.\n\nGottlieb told Brennan that he believes monkeypox \"has spread more broadly in the community\" and that he would not be surprised if there are \"thousands of cases right now.\"\n\n\"Now this is firmly embedded in the community. And while it's not going to explode because it's harder for this virus to spread, it's probably going to be persistent. You'll have this as a sort of a fact of life, maybe spreading as a sexually transmitted disease but also breaking out of those settings,\" he said.\n\nThe former FDA commissioner compared the response to the monkeypox virus with the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, saying the US is making \"a lot of the same mistakes,\" such as a lack of testing early on and not enough vaccines distributed to the community.\n\n\"We could have gotten control of this if we had been more aggressive up front,\" Gottlieb said.\n\nThe CDC is working with five commercial laboratories to expand testing capacity, expanding capacity from an initial 6,000 up to 80,000 specimens per week.\n\nGottlieb also criticized the CDC for its response to the virus.\n\n\"The White House has intervened to take more control of the response away from CDC. This can't be our response every time, that when CDC drops the ball, the White House and the political leadership need to step in,\" Gottlieb said. \"That's what's happened here. It happened in Covid. We need to fundamentally reform how we respond to these crises.\"\n\nGottlieb's interview was \"misinformed and off base,\" the CDC said Monday.\n\n\"It is true that we have work to do -- here and internationally -- and are likely to see more monkeypox cases in the near term, but it is possible to significantly decrease the number of cases and contain the current monkeypox outbreak through education and increased testing and access to vaccines -- all priorities we've made dramatic progress on,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nThe CDC said it has expanded the monkeypox case definition to encourage health care providers to test for the virus, and it's ramped up communications on the outbreak. Federal health officials have also \"dramatically increased availability of vaccines, with more than 130,000 doses already delivered and thousands more on the way.\"\n\n\"We continue to update the public, partners, and the community about how to protect themselves through daily outreach on our website, media briefings, and partner calls,\" which involve \"90+ partner organizations, including state, tribal, local or territorial partners, public health organizations, clinical, community, LGBTQ+ organizations that forward to their members,\" the CDC said.\n\nMonkeypox is a poxvirus, related to smallpox and cowpox. The virus generally causes pimple- or blisterlike lesions and flu-like symptoms such as fever, the CDC explained.\n\nThe lesions typically concentrate on the arms and legs, but in the latest outbreak, they're showing up more frequently on the genital and perianal area, which has raised some concerns monkeypox lesions may be confused with sexually transmitted disease.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe virus spreads through close contact, including direct physical contact with lesions as well as \"respiratory secretions\" shared through face-to-face interaction.

The demand for vaccines is outpacing the supply. There are nearly 2 million courses the highly effective TPOXX antiviral sitting in the Strategic National Stockpile, but many health care providers are still having a hard time getting the medication for their patients.\n\nWe are one of the wealthiest countries in the world, spending more than $4 trillion dollars a year on health care, more per person than anywhere else. With all those resources and technology, it’s not as if the United States is incapable of mounting a significant response to an emerging outbreak. And there is little doubt we will eventually do what should have already been done: declare monkeypox a public health emergency, appoint a national coordinator and mount a more significant response. But why do we wait so long, drag our feet and endure so much suffering in the meantime?\n\nAs I have learned over the past few years, there is a significant difference between preparedness and response, even though the two are often conflated. The United States is extraordinarily prepared, ranked No. 1 for pandemic preparedness in the 2021 Global Health Security Index.\n\nInstead, we are leading in a different way. As of today, we have the most confirmed cases of monkeypox on the planet, more than 5,000. That is almost 25% of the global numbers, even though we are just under 5% of the world’s population.\n\nIt is now clear: Preparedness alone does not guarantee a rapid response. With Covid-19, and now monkeypox, we were too slow to respond. It was as if we are sitting in a turbo-charged Ferrari, capable of massive acceleration, but instead only idling in the driveway.\n\nCavalry culture\n\nOver the past three years, we have witnessed something counterintuitive. It was predominantly wealthy countries that were hit hardest during the Covid-19 pandemic. They had some of the highest death rates, despite their enormous resources.\n\nWhile there are many reasons for this, including misinformation, lack of public trust, and the entangling of public health and politics, I think there is something else, as well: We have adopted what I call a “cavalry culture.” We wait for the cavalry to ride in and rescue us, instead of taking smaller preventive steps – such as establishing modern and reliable data systems, mastering our supply chain along the way, and acting early to head off the outbreak in the first place.\n\nIf that sounds familiar, it’s because we too often do the same with our personal health matters. According to research published in The Lancet Public Health, nearly half of chronic disease in the United States is mostly preventable, with lifestyle changes. Even knowing that, however, the medical system is set up for the cavalry to come in with expensive medications and high-tech interventions, instead of providing equitable access and incentives for preventative care.\n\nThere are a couple of important axioms in public health. One is, by the time you think you must act to contain an outbreak, it is already too late. And, if you think you are overreacting, you are probably reacting just the right amount. In the case of Covid, and now monkeypox, we seem to have forgotten those basic public health principles. And, the real question now seems to be: When will the government finally hit the gas pedal on our highly tuned Ferrari?\n\nI don’t want to suggest any of this is easy. There are significant issues of uncertainty and unpredictability. Much like a hurricane forming at sea, we often don’t know exactly where or how hard it will hit. We want to be measured, calm in our response and to cause as little disruption as possible. We want to be thoughtful and gather as much information as is available.\n\nAnd therein lies one of our biggest problems: basic data. I have often wondered, how is it that a numbers-driven, high-tech country like the United States can’t get basic data right?\n\nData disaster\n\nAs long as I’ve been reporting on the Covid pandemic, I have always had to offer the caveat that case numbers are probably off, sometimes wildly so. We have probably never had a clear vision on just how widely the virus was spreading at any given time in the United States, and going into the fall 2022, the situation isn’t really any better.\n\nIn early July, the Institute for Health Metrics, a research center at the University of Washington, released a model suggesting that actual Covid-19 cases are seven times higher than reported cases. At times, it seems the tech platforms for Snapchat and Twitter offer more data analytics than the patchwork of state and federal systems that underpin the public health of our country.\n\n“First, there’s a lack of data access needed to understand where disease outbreaks are spreading. This is due to data collection limitations that Congress needs to fix,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives and a former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHe said there is also a need to update analog systems and connect them to each other – getting them to speak the same language. Right now, it’s the Tower of Babel.\n\n“Second, we lack sufficient numbers and, in some cases, skills of people and systems at the federal, state and local levels that can deliver services and communicate effectively with communities. Finally, we are in perpetual panic and neglect funding cycles,” he said.\n\nAs a result of all of the things Frieden is describing, our current data collection and reporting system leaves important information fractured into dozens of states and territories, and thousands of county pieces for the CDC to puzzle together.\n\n“I have been struck as we at CDC are now conquering another public health challenge – monkeypox – as to how little authority we at CDC have to receive the data,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told the Washington Post.\n\nWalensky is talking about basic data, like where the vaccine has gone, who has been vaccinated, whether the vaccine is working, and even monkeypox case data like who is getting infected, their age and race/ethnicity. Why might this be so?\n\n“States don’t routinely share vaccine doses administered data with the federal government – Covid was really the first time that we were able to successfully put data use agreements in place,” Claire Hannan, the executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, told CNN. Part of the reason is because “states have laws in place to protect identifiable information.”\n\nSome information has been getting to the CDC, but it is challenging to get and incomplete. The CDC director told the Washington Post, “We have been speaking to our state and local partners probably at least three times a week, all of them. … That is not how you synthesize data. We need … standardization of those data, and we need to have those data come to us in a standardized fashion so that they can be connected, we can compile them and rapidly report them out. We cannot at CDC collect the data and make informed decisions by calling 64 jurisdictions, and honestly, 3,000 counties.”\n\nThe CDC is currently working on agreements that would broaden the agency’s access to states’ data, as they successfully did with Covid. Hannan explained, “The need to quickly get the [monkeypox] vaccine out left no time to get data sharing agreements in place.”\n\nBut even if those agreements were in place, it still doesn’t mean the states’ ability to actually obtain vaccine doses would be made any easier. That’s because the states wouldn’t be using the same data system for ordering and tracking doses they generally use. Because the US Department of Health and Human Services and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response are in charge of monkeypox vaccine distribution, there would be yet another data system involved.\n\n“They were asking states to request the vaccine using paper forms and email,” said Hannan. “They were asking states to complete forms [with fillable fields] on those who were receiving the vaccine and return these forms to the federal government.”\n\nThe problem was there weren’t even the right fields for the specific questions being asked, such as reason for vaccination or type of exposure or risk, Hannan said. It wasn’t that the necessary forms weren’t being filled out, it was that they couldn’t be filled out because of disparate data platforms.\n\nIt is a baffling level of bureaucracy in the middle of an unfolding outbreak.\n\nTesting, vaccines, therapeutics\n\nAs things stand now, the issues with data collection, testing, vaccines, treatments and communication are sounding a lot like the ones we experienced with Covid-19.\n\nBut, to be clear, monkeypox is not that much like Covid. For now, it seems to spread primarily through sores or lesions during close, personal touch and shared objects like towels and linens, as well as respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact.\n\nThe monkeypox outbreak is also different for another fundamental reason. Unlike with Covid, which was caused by a novel virus, the basic tools already exist either for monkeypox or its close relative, smallpox. We didn’t have to build them from scratch. That means we could have had them or put them to better use by now.\n\nTake testing. At the start of the outbreak, testing capability was capped at about 6,000 tests per week, which meant that doctors really had to ration them to a narrow group of people – primarily a subset of men who have sex with men. Since then, the CDC has partnered with five labs to scale up our capabilities and we should soon be able to process up to 80,000 tests a week. But the tests are being underutilized, according to CNN reporting. Experts blamed the low uptake on several factors, including a lack of awareness among doctors about the virus and the fear of stigma among patients.\n\nSo, just as with Covid, the real scope of the monkeypox outbreak is probably underappreciated. Confirmed or probable cases stand around 5,000, according to CDC data, but the number could be several fold higher.\n\nAnother tool that could be tremendously helpful is testing of wastewater. As we have seen with Covid, it can better define the scope of the outbreak and where it will emerge next. Two months into the outbreak, we still aren’t doing this widely for monkeypox.\n\nAnd then there are vaccines. Unlike Covid, where we spent upward of $20 billion to develop, test and distribute vaccines, we already have a vaccine specifically approved for monkeypox.\n\nSupplies were limited and the initial US vaccination strategy focused on known monkeypox cases and their immediate contacts. But the outbreak continued to grow, and the strategy had to change. The count of people eligible for the two-dose Jynneos vaccine has now expanded to an estimated 1.5 million.\n\nWith that same cavalry culture, we are woefully behind in getting those doses to people who want them. At this time, only 336,710 doses have been shipped to states. Ordering only just began for about 800,000 more doses. This scarcity has created long lines in monkeypox hotspots like New York City, which has the highest number of cases in the country.\n\nIt also means that the vaccine, which can be given within 14 days of exposure (but preferably within four) to prevent or reduce the severity of disease, is currently being used more as a treatment – a post-exposure prophylaxis – rather than as a real preventive measure.\n\nAs National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said on CNN, that focus will have to shift.\n\n“It’s very clear with the spread of this that there now has to be a balance between vaccines available for those who clearly have been exposed, as well as those at risk,” Fauci said. “What you want to do is a balance between vaccinating those who clearly have had an exposure but go well beyond that.”\n\nIt’s a missed opportunity that won’t be rectified immediately, even with the soon-to-arrive 786,000 doses announced by HHS this week. Needs will still outstrip supply.\n\nFinally, there is the issue of treatment. The CDC has made the antiviral smallpox treatment tecovirimat, called TPOXX, available to monkeypox patients who have or are at high risk of severe disease under an “alternate regulatory mechanism.”\n\nThere are 1.7 million courses of TPOXX stockpiled. But once again, getting the medication to patients who could immediately benefit has proven to be bureaucratically burdensome for both patients and providers.\n\n“You’re talking about a five, six-day time lag to get that medication to you at a local doctor’s office, no matter where you are. And the paperwork, and all of the bureaucracy to make that happen is very cumbersome, takes a few hours of your time. And that’s the barrier,” Dr. Stacy Lane, founder of the LGBTQ-centered Central Outreach Wellness Center in Pittsburgh, told me recently.\n\nFortunately, those rules were loosened somewhat last week, allowing patients to get treated more quickly and reducing the amount of documentation needed. The CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration are working to further streamline the process.\n\nIn the meantime, though, patients are suffering. Even though most cases are “mild,” they are still uncomfortable, or downright painful, depending on where sores appear. Plus, there is a risk of long-term complications if the pox lesions develop in areas around the eye or GI tract.\n\nAll of these gaps have the hardest hit community on edge.\n\n“Largely public health officials know how this has spread. They know how to vaccinate people … we know how to treat it, and we know how to prevent it,” says Samuel Garrett-Pate, managing director of external affairs of Equality California, the largest statewide LBGTQ+ civil rights organization.\n\n“It unfortunately seems that despite two years of building up our public health infrastructure to prevent what happened with Covid-19 from ever happening again, despite the fact that we are better prepared in terms of already having a vaccine available, the CDC and FDA seem to be caught flat-footed once again. And I think as a result, you’re seeing very real and understandable fear anxiety among the LGBTQ community.”\n\nIs it too late?\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, a former FDA commissioner and current board member of Pfizer, has been pessimistic about the trajectory of monkeypox in the United States.\n\n“We’re now at the cusp of this becoming an endemic virus, where this now becomes something that’s persistent that we need to continue to deal with. I think the window for getting control of this and containing it probably has closed and if it hasn’t closed, it’s certainly starting to close,” he said on Face the Nation on July 17.\n\nCDC’s Walensky pushed back on Gottlieb’s assessment calling it “misinformed and off base,” saying that while it’s true there is much work to do, the US has made dramatic progress on priorities like testing, vaccines and education.\n\nThere has been measurable progress in these areas, no doubt. But, I do worry that we once again waited too long. We sat idling in our Ferrari, perhaps not wanting to believe that somehow we had suddenly found ourselves in the middle of yet another outbreak.\n\nI remember when I first saw a case of monkeypox – it was in 2008, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, one of the handful of countries in Africa where the disease is endemic. To tell you the truth, I never thought I would see it in the United States. After all, it was a virus that hadn’t traveled much since it was first identified in DRC in 1970. My guess was that most of my medical colleagues in the United States would likely only see pictures of the distinctive pox lesions in textbooks.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe world, however, is changing, as we have been reminded of twice in the last few years.

Similar declarations were made for the Zika virus in 2016 in Latin America and the effort to eradicate polio, in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nGhebreyesus made the decision despite a lack of consensus among experts, calling himself “a tiebreaker.\"\n\nIt was the first time a U.N. health agency chief has unilaterally made such a decision without an expert recommendation.\n\nThere is \"a clear risk of further international spread,\" Ghebreyesus said in a statement.\n\n\"So in short, we have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly, through new modes of transmission, about which we understand too little,\" he said. \"For all of these reasons, I have decided that the global monkeypox outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern.\"\n\nBut some experts have argued that the disease isn’t severe enough to warrant the attention, in part because most people recover without needing medical attention, although the lesions can be excruciating.\n\nSymptoms of the disease begin to appear seven to 14 days after exposure and include fever, muscle aches, exhaustion and a rash that can appear on the body. So far, monkeypox deaths have been reported only in Africa, where a more dangerous version of the virus is spreading.\n\nA WHO emergency committee decided last month that the outbreak did not at that time represent a public health emergency of international concern, Ghebreyesus said in his statement.\n\nAt the time, 3,040 cases had been reported in 47 countries, he said. Since then, the outbreak has ballooned to more than 16,000 reported cases in more than 70 countries.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. reported its first two cases of monkeypox in children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nGRAPHIC BREAKDOWN:Rising reports of monkeypox cases in US and around the world raise concern\n\nMonkeypox a growing global concern\n\nThe virus has been found in parts of central and west Africa for decades, but monkeypox began to spread more widely in May as authorities reported dozens of outbreaks globally.\n\nAs a more dangerous version of the virus spreads mainly in Nigeria and the Congo, the only monkeypox deaths as of now have been reported in Africa, where it spreads mainly to people from infected animals such as rodents. But in Europe, North America and other regions, monkeypox is spreading from human to human without links to animals or travel to Africa.\n\nLGBTQ leaders say more testing kits, vaccines and additional health workers are needed to limit the outbreak, which is primarily striking gay and bisexual men.\n\nMonkeypox does not exclusively spread through sex, but some experts worry it could soon become an entrenched disease similar to gonorrhea, herpes or HIV.\n\nInforming men who have sex with men about the virus without causing stigma remains a balancing act, because the virus can affect anyone who gets in close contact with monkeypox, regardless of their sexuality.\n\nMonkeypox in the US\n\nThere were 2,891 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the U.S. as of Friday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. States reporting cases have received 370,000 vaccine doses.\n\nThe White House promised a robust strategy to combat the virus, including vaccines, testing, treatments and communication with areas where the virus has spread.\n\nSaturday's declaration \"is a call to action\" for health officials around the world, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement, adding, \"We are determined to accelerate our response in the days ahead.\"\n\nNew York has had the most confirmed cases of any state at 900. California, Florida, Georgia and Illinois each have more than 100 cases.\n\nIn New York and San Francisco, demand for vaccines has been exceeding the supply providers have available.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the Department of Public Health offers vaccine by invitation only to people who have a known exposure or are at high risk of one.\n\nThe federal government plans to release more than 1.6 million doses of the monkeypox vaccine Jynneos by the end of the year, but demand is so high that the 56,000 doses released in June have almost all been used.\n\nThe vaccine protects against monkeypox but can also be given after exposure to prevent illness, according to the CDC.\n\nOnly two U.S. cases have been reported among children, who are described as being in good health and receiving treatment, according to the CDC. How they caught the disease is being investigated, but officials think it was through household transmission.\n\nOlder adults who were vaccinated against smallpox as children probably have some protection against monkeypox, said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious disease physician at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.\n\nWHO recommendations\n\nIn Saturday's statement, Ghebreyesus stressed that countries like the U.S. experiencing human-to-human spread must try to stop that transmission and protect vulnerable groups.\n\nIdentifying cases of monkeypox through testing and then contact-tracing remains key to stopping community spread. Vaccines also are an important strategy, he said.\n\nAs with cases of COVID-19, people who have monkeypox should isolate for as long as they're infectious, the statement said.\n\nVaccines and personal protection equipment are also necessary to help prevent spread among health care workers.\n\nImmunosuppressed people, children and people who are pregnant may be at risk of severe monkeypox disease and should consider vaccines, according to the statement.\n\nGhebreyesus said anyone experiencing possible symptoms or anyone who was in contact with a monkeypox case should avoid all travel until they determine they can do so without possibly spreading the virus.\n\nExperts respond to global emergency declaration\n\nThough some experts questioned whether the declaration would help, others have pushed for the outbreak to be designated a global emergency, wondering why WHO hadn't made this decision earlier.\n\nMichael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at Southampton University, said the conditions for declaring monkeypox a global emergency were arguably met weeks ago.\n\n\"I think it would be better to be proactive and overreact to the problem instead of waiting to react when it's too late,\" Head said.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group, released a statement Saturday saying it commends the decision.\n\nThe designation is \"critical to rapidly increase testing capacity and vaccine distribution in order to reach communities most impacted by the virus, particularly gay and bisexual men and transgender women, who comprise the majority of current cases,” said Jay Brown, Human Rights Campaign senior vice president of programs, research and training.\n\nDr. Placide Mbala, a virologist who directs the global health department at Congo's Institute of National Biomedical Research, said efforts to stop monkeypox must be equitable, adding that vaccines should be sent to Africa and be made available to those at highest risk, such as hunters in rural areas.\n\n\"Vaccination in the West might help stop the outbreak there, but there will still be cases in Africa,\" he said. \"Unless the problem is solved here, the risk to the rest of the world will remain.\"\n\nContributing: Boris Q'va, Janet Loehrke, Sara Moniuszko, George Petras and Elizabeth Weise, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/health/california-newsom-state-of-emergency-monkeypox/index.html", "title": "California and Illinois declare states of emergency over monkeypox ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe governors of California and Illinois declared states of emergency to bolster their monkeypox vaccination efforts as the virus spreads nationwide.\n\nMonday’s declarations come as more than 5,800 probable or confirmed cases of monkeypox have been reported in the US. California had more than 800 cases Tuesday, while Illinois had more than 500, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWhile the World Health Organization has declared the monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, the Biden administration has not issued a nationwide public health emergency declaration.\n\nCalifornia is the third and largest state to issue a statewide declaration related to the disease. New York was the first to do so.\n\nCalifornia’s move allows emergency medical services personnel throughout the state to administer FDA-approved monkeypox vaccines, expanding the pool of people able to inoculate residents against the virus even as a vaccine shortage persists.\n\n“Expanding the pool of eligible vaccinators will substantially aid current efforts and support anticipated further vaccination efforts upon receipt of additional doses from the federal government,” the proclamation said.\n\n“California is working urgently across all levels of government to slow the spread of monkeypox, leveraging our robust testing, contact tracing and community partnerships strengthened during the pandemic to ensure that those most at risk are our focus for vaccines, treatment and outreach,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a news release.\n\nIllinois’ declaration also will make more resources available to combat the virus, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said. The Chicago and state public health departments announced Illinois’ first presumptive case June 2.\n\n“I am declaring a state of emergency to expand the resources and coordination efforts of state agencies in responding to, treating, and preventing the spread of MPV,” Pritzker tweeted. “In Illinois, we will ensure our LGBTQ+ community has the resources they need to stay safe while ensuring members are not stigmatized as they access critical health care.”\n\nMonkeypox is a poxvirus, related to smallpox, that usually causes pimple- or blister-like lesions, as well as flu-like symptoms such as fever, headaches, muscle aches, chills and respiratory symptoms, according to the CDC.\n\nThe virus can spread to anyone through close, often skin-to-skin contact, according to the CDC. It’s also possible for people to get monkeypox from infected animals.\n\nCalifornia has received more than 61,000 vaccine doses so far and distributed more than 25,000, according to the governor’s news release. Los Angeles County has received its own vaccine allocation, and state officials said California will make additional allocations in the coming weeks.\n\nLast week, San Francisco became the first major US city to declare a local health emergency on monkeypox.\n\n“We’ll continue to work with the federal government to secure more vaccines, raise awareness about reducing risk, and stand with the LGBTQ community fighting stigmatization,” the California governor said.\n\nCalifornia has been using testing, contact tracing and vaccine infrastructure built for the Covid-19 pandemic to respond to monkeypox outbreaks, Newsom’s office said.\n\nThe CDC has made the antiviral prescription drug tecovirimat available for monkeypox patients at risk of severe disease, but access is limited in California. Now, the treatment can be administered at more than 30 facilities and providers across the state, officials said.\n\nCalifornia has also expanded its monkeypox testing capacity and can process more than 1,000 tests a week, according to Newsom.\n\nThe state’s first case of monkeypox was reported May 21 and involved someone who had traveled abroad. Now, there are probable or confirmed monkeypox cases in 27 different local health jurisdictions, including a case involving a toddler.\n\nIn mid-July, California’s health department requested 600,000 to 800,000 additional monkeypox vaccine doses to help expand eligibility to both confirmed and probable exposures, as well as to high-risk individuals.\n\nThe health department is “hopeful the federal government will deliver additional vaccine to meet the state’s request,” it said in a news release Friday.\n\nPeople line up to receive the monkeypox vaccine at a vaccination site at the Balboa Sports Center in the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, on July 27, 2022.

Many of the cases in the latest outbreak appear to be connected to sexual contact, but monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease.\n\nA large number of cases in this outbreak have been in men who have sex with men, including gay and bisexual men, and public health officials are focusing their prevention efforts on this group. The virus is not unique to this community, but the nature of its close-contact spread has led to a disproportionate impact.\n\n“Our team is also committed to reducing stigma among the LGBTQ community, which has been singled out and treated unfairly because of this outbreak. No single individual or community is to blame for the spread of any virus. Monkeypox can affect anyone as it spreads by skin-to-skin contact, as well as from sharing items like clothing, bedding and towels,” California Public Health Officer Dr. Tomás Aragón said in a Friday statement.\n\nFollowing the emergency declaration in California, Equality California, a major LGBT rights nonprofit organization, applauded the governor’s move, noting in a statement that the virus “continues to disproportionately affect gay, bisexual and queer men here in California and across the country.”\n\nEarlier Monday, state Sen. Scott Wiener, who represents San Francisco, and members of the LGBTQ caucus called on Newsom to issue $38.5 million in an emergency budget appropriation to support local monkeypox response.", "authors": ["Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/05/18/monkeypox-virus-cases-outbreak-what-we-know/9832378002/", "title": "Monkeypox virus outbreak 2022: What is it? What are the symptoms?", "text": "The World Health Organization on Friday said it was stepping up efforts to understand and combat monkeypox as nearly a dozen countries are investigating \"atypical\" outbreaks. The organization said the ongoing situation is being discussed at several meetings.\n\n\"There are about 80 confirmed cases so far, and 50 pending investigations. More cases are likely to be reported as surveillance expands,\" the health agency said in a news release.\n\nThe spike in monkeypox cases in Europe and North America has perplexed public health professionals because the rare disease is typically found in central and west Africa — and human-to-human transmission is usually considered uncommon.\n\nThe U.S. has recorded two cases of monkeypox — in Massachusetts and in New York City.\n\nThe list of countries with at least one monkeypox case also includes: Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n\nThose at highest risk are people who closely interact with someone infected with the generally mild disease.\n\n\"This includes health workers, household members and sexual partners,\" WHO said.\n\nBut experts say the outbreak is not likely to evolve into a global health crisis because the disease is not easily transmitted and reported cases remain relatively low.\n\n\"It doesn't have that great a transmission ability,\" said Dr. Seth Blumberg, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nWATCH:Case of monkeypox reported in Massachusetts\n\n“Monkeypox usually does not occur globally,” Dr. Anne W. Rimoin, a professor of epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, told USA TODAY. Rimoin, who has extensively studied monkeypox and other infectious diseases in Central Africa, said such outbreaks are \"rare and unusual occurrence.\"\n\nAlthough most people recover from the virus, it can be dangerous and fatal, though typically far fewer than 1% of cases in areas with high-quality medical care, said Dr. Aaron Glatt, a fellow of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the disease:\n\nWhat is monkeypox?\n\nMonkeypox is a rare disease that comes from the same family of viruses as smallpox, which includes cowpox, camelpox, horsepox and others. The virus was first discovered in 1958 in colonies of research monkeys, according to the CDC.\n\nThe human first case of the virus was identified in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Most monkeypox infections today still occur there, but the disease has also been reported in several other central and western African countries, the CDC said.\n\nMONKEYPOX 101:Case confirmed in England, but risk to the general public is low\n\nHow does transmission occur?\n\nMonkeypox usually spreads to people from infected animals like rodents. Human-to-human transmission is possible but less common, the World Health Organization said. The virus can also spread through contaminated materials.\n\nThe main disease carrier of monkeypox is still unknown, although some experts suspect African rodents play a part in transmission, the CDC said.\n\nIn parts of central and west Africa, people can be exposed to the virus through bites or scratches from rodents and small mammals, preparing wild game, or having contact with an infected animal or animal products.\n\nThe virus doesn’t spread easily between people, although human-to-human transmission typically happens through large respiratory droplets. Those droplets typically can’t travel more than a few feet, so prolonged face-to-face contact is required to spread monkeypox, according to the CDC.\n\nBritain’s Health Security Agency said the country’s latest cases have been seen “predominantly in gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men.” Monkeypox is not known to be a sexually transmitted disease, but it can spread through close contact with infected people, their bodily fluids, clothing or bedsheets, according to the CDC.\n\nUSA TODAY FACT CHECK:Vaccination helped eradicate smallpox\n\nWhat are the symptoms of monkeypox?\n\nMonkeypox typically begins with flulike symptoms and swollen lymph nodes, the CDC said. Monkeypox symptoms are typically similar but milder than smallpox symptoms.\n\nEarly symptoms include fever, muscle aches, chills and fatigue. In more severe cases, a rash can develop, often on the face and genitals, resembling those seen in chickenpox and smallpox.\n\nPainful and itchy lesions can form across the body, before eventually becoming scabs and falling off.\n\nThose infected with monkeypox usually begin experiencing symptoms seven to 14 days after infection, the CDC said. The illness usually lasts several weeks.\n\nHow dangerous is monkeypox?\n\nMost people recover from monkeypox within weeks, but the disease can be fatal, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nScientists have identified two forms of the virus: the West African clade and the Congo Basin clade. The West African clade is less fatal, with deaths occurring in about one percent of infections. The Congo Basin clade can cause death in as many as 1 in 10 people who contract the disease, the World Health Organization said.\n\nWhile data is preliminary, Rimoin says the current outbreaks appear to be connected with the less-deadly West African clade.\n\nJimmy Whitworth, a professor of international public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told Reuters that the virus likely won’t reach the same level of infections and deaths COVID-19 has.\n\n\"This isn't going to cause a nationwide epidemic like COVID did, but it's a serious outbreak of a serious disease – and we should take it seriously,\" Whitworth said.\n\nRimoin cautioned against comparisons to COVID-19 – in part because monkeypox is not a novel virus: \"We’re not dealing with a completely novel pathogen that has never been studied before.”\n\nRimoin said monkeypox is generally thought to have a low reproductive number, based on previous outbreaks — meaning rapid spread is believed to be unlikely. But further study is needed because the spread of the virus can vary based on a wide variety of conditions.\n\n'NOT SEPARATE THINGS':Climate change pushing animals to migrate, increasing risks of new pandemics, study finds\n\nIs there a vaccine for monkeypox?\n\nYes. A vaccine developed against smallpox has been approved for monkeypox, and several antivirals also appear to be effective. But according to the CDC, there is no proven, safe treatment for monkeypox virus infection.\n\nRimoin said that the eradication of smallpox has left the globe vulnerable to outbreaks of related viruses, like monkeypox. Since smallpox vaccines aren't widely given, the immune protection they provide is lacking for billions around the globe.\n\nHave there been monkeypox outbreaks in the US before?\n\nThe CDC says monkeypox cases in the United States are rare. Wednesday’s case in Massachusetts is the first U.S. monkeypox case this year, according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.\n\nTexas and Maryland each reported a case in 2021 in people who traveled to Nigeria.\n\nIn 2003, health experts identified 47 confirmed and probable cases of monkeypox across six states – Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin – according to the CDC. Officials traced the cases back to pet prairie dogs that were infected after being housed near imported small mammals from Ghana.\n\nCOVID CASES ARE BACK IN THE RISE:There are 3 main reasons why.\n\nThe 2003 outbreak was the first time human monkeypox was reported outside Africa.\n\nNo deaths occurred as a result of that outbreak, Rimoin said.\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Public Health said Wednesday’s case poses no risk to the public. But Rimoin said the recent cases are an “important reminder that an infection anywhere is potentially an infection everywhere.”\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/health/monkeypox-vaccine-demand/index.html", "title": "Demand for monkeypox vaccine rises with case counts, but supply ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe number of monkeypox vaccine doses distributed across the United States has more than tripled since last week, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services, but supply falls far short of demand – and short of the levels that experts say will be needed to control the outbreak.\n\nMichael Austin Nicolo, a bartender in New York City, is one of more than a thousand people in the US who have been diagnosed with the virus this year. He’s also one of many more who have struggled to find an available vaccine.\n\n“I just first heard about monkeypox like everybody else, through the news, social media, the grapevine, and how it was becoming something we need to be worried about and how it was predominantly affecting gay men or men who have sex with men,” Nicolo said.\n\nIt was enough to send him in search of more information on how to protect himself.\n\n“At the time, there was little resources on finding the vaccine,” he said.\n\n“I had two friends reach out with links, and we clicked on them, and they are already completely like – they were gone immediately. There was no access to anything,” he said.\n\n“We just kind of kept an eye on the links and kept on living our lives. And then after Pride weekend is when I started to show symptoms of it – and that was too late.”\n\nWhere vaccines are going\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 1.5 million men who have sex with men are eligible for the monkeypox vaccine. Although monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, it spreads through skin-to-skin contact and in this outbreak, has mostly been spreading among men who have sex with men.\n\nMore than 132,000 doses of the Jynneos vaccine – a two-dose regimen manufactured by Bavarian Nordic – have been pulled from the national strategic stockpile and distributed nationwide, according to HHS data, but it hasn’t been enough to meet demand.\n\n“We got an allotment of 200 vaccines, and the appointments for that went in about an hour and a half,” said Dr. David Holland, chief clinical officer of the Fulton County, Georgia, Board of Health.\n\nThe CDC says decisions about how to allocate the limited vaccine supply are based equally on the number of cases and the population at risk in a specific area.\n\nThe Jynneos vaccine is available now for people at high risk of exposure: those who have been identified as close contacts of someone who has been diagnosed with monkeypox, those who have had sex with a partner diagnosed with monkeypox within the past 14 days, and those who have had multiple sex partners in the past 14 days in an area with monkeypox spread, according to the CDC.\n\nAs more vaccines become available, the agency will continue to evaluate the distribution strategy, a spokesperson said.\n\nThe District of Columbia has received the most vaccines per capita, by far, and the city has many more confirmed cases per capita than any state.\n\nBut as of Wednesday, two states with confirmed cases – New Mexico and South Dakota – have yet to receive any doses.\n\nAfter DC, New York has received the most vaccine doses per capita: more than three times the US average. About three-quarters of the state’s supply went to New York City.\n\nIn a letter on Tuesday, New York Mayor Eric Adams urged the Biden administration to increase the vaccine allocation, calling his city an “epicenter” of the virus in the US.\n\nWhite House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said Wednesday that additional monkeypox vaccine doses will be arriving within weeks from a plant in Denmark.\n\n“The issue is, we need to get more vaccines out there,” he said.\n\n“We are incredibly focused on making sure that vaccine doses get to the United States and get out to places like New York City. Do we wish we had more doses? Of course. We had a stockpile, and what we need is more. We are getting more.”\n\nDr. Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean at Emory University School of Medicine, says “the problem is, we simply don’t have enough vaccine. So we’re trying to play catch-up.”\n\nThere are also other issues to be considered, he said.\n\n“I think the challenge is that we need to make sure that the vaccine doesn’t go just to the people that are savvy and can get it quickly. We don’t want the vaccine only to go to white wealthy individuals.”\n\nCould a single-dose strategy be helpful?\n\nA full course of the Jynneos vaccine, as approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, requires two doses given four weeks apart. But some experts say that one dose might be enough for now – and that delaying second doses might be a way to address the discrepancy between supply and demand.\n\nIn his letter, Adams called for the administration to “consider alternative vaccine schedules, utilizing a longer interval between the first and second dose, that would allow more of the immediately available vaccine to be used for first doses.”\n\nBavarian Nordic CEO Paul Chaplin told Science in early July that “There are a lot of data to support a single shot.”\n\nChaplin said the second dose could be given two years later and still achieve the same immune response as the standard schedule, so countries have a long time to provide second shots if they decide to use single shots for now.\n\nHealth experts say providers are not expected to hold back doses right now.\n\n“From what we’ve been told, it’s: Give the doses you have, and in your later allocations, there’ll be additional doses that will cover second doses,” said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers.\n\nNot a sustainable strategy\n\nIf the virus isn’t contained as soon as possible, health officials fear, it could spread beyond the population groups that are now at high risk.\n\nJanet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, says the US must get past a vaccine strategy focused on high-risk post-exposure because “there is no vaccine-preventable disease that exists that can be controlled solely post-exposure when there is no prior immunity.”\n\nMonkeypox is endemic in parts of Africa, but it is essentially a new disease to the US, and there is no immunity built up in the population.\n\n“Everyone is susceptible at this point in time,” Hamilton said. “There’s no way we will ever be able to control this disease in a completely susceptible population without a pre-exposure vaccine strategy.”\n\nA need for more and easier testing\n\nIn the meantime, people affected by the virus say they need other resources, as well. The Biden administration has moved to expand testing, with the CDC announcing a collaboration with five private companies to double the nation’s testing capacity. Some of those companies have already begun offering testing. But that didn’t happen soon enough for some.\n\nNicolo said that when he first went to his doctor with monkeypox symptoms, they took a sample to test – but he learned days later that it had been discarded, untested.\n\nTwo days after that visit, his symptoms worsened, and he returned to the doctor. The second sample tested positive.\n\nChristian Redondo, a graduate student in Atlanta, noticed a sore and called his local board of health, which said it wasn’t doing testing and referred him to his primary care doctor.\n\nHis primary care doctor told him to go to the emergency room to get tested, but Redondo was able to contact a friend at his county health department who said yes, in fact, he would need to go there for a test.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“Then, I was in the waiting room for, I don’t know, something like four or five hours. It was a very long time. And when I was asking them about it, they said they had to wait for permission from the CDC to even test me for monkeypox,” he said.\n\nTesting is necessary to prevent further cases and learn more about the full scope of the outbreak.\n\n“I think one of the challenges that we have is that we’re simply not doing enough testing, so there probably are much more cases than we actually are currently registering,” Emory’s del Rio said.", "authors": ["Virginia Langmaid Deidre Mcphillips", "Virginia Langmaid", "Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/21/health/monkeypox-under-18-new-york-state/index.html", "title": "For the first time, monkeypox has been reported in a minor in New ...", "text": "(CNN) A minor in New York state has reportedly contracted monkeypox -- a first among children in the state and at least the third reported case of the disease among children in the US.\n\nThe child lives in New York but not in New York City, according to state health department data released last week.

Evidently a little bit more voting involved in our winning than Prince Charles,” Armstrong joked.\n\nThe former Prince of Wales became King following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, on Thursday.\n\nFellow Briton, actor Brian Cox – who plays the patriarch of the elitist Roy family, Logan – was heard commenting next to Armstrong: “Keep it royalist, keep it royalist.”\n\nArmstrong added: “I’m not saying that we’re more legitimate in our position than he is.

Who's hosting? All your ...", "text": "The 74th Primetime Emmy Awards are famously known as \"TV’s biggest night,\" but if you're not in the entertainment biz, you might be wondering a few things, like: \"Who's hosting the show?\" \"When do the awards take place?\" \"Is a Hollywood A-lister going to ask me to be their date?! If so, they need to hurry up and do it so I can figure out my outfit, ASAP!\"\n\nAt least two of those three questions (and more) are answered below. We’re crossing our fingers for you on the third. But back to the show. Here’s everything you need to know about the upcoming Emmy Awards.\n\nEmmy nominations 2022:How Zendaya, 'Abbott Elementary's Quinta Brunson made history\n\nThe full list: 'Succession,' 'Ted Lasso,' 'White Lotus' lead nominees for Emmys 2022\n\nWhere can I watch the Emmys?\n\nOn Sept. 12, television’s biggest names will arrive at Los Angeles’ Microsoft Theater for the show, kicking off at 8 EDT/5 PDT on NBC. The awards show will also stream on Peacock. Red-carpet coverage will air on E!\n\nBut not even the three-hour ceremony is enough to hand out all of the awards. Enter the Creative Arts Emmys recognizing the work of those on the production side – in categories of cinematography, lighting, sound, hairstyling and makeup – which took place on Sept. 3 and 4. Statuettes for outstanding television movie, host for a reality or competition program, animated program, and guest actor/actress in a comedy/drama are also handed out at these early ceremonies.\n\nWho is hosting the Emmys?\n\nNBC, the host network for this year's festivities, has tapped the longest-running cast member on \"Saturday Night Live,\" Kenan Thompson. This marks the 44-year-old former Nickelodeon star's first turn as host, but he's no stranger to the fête. Thompson has been nominated six times and won once, in 2018 for outstanding original music and lyrics for the \"SNL\" tune \"Come Back Barack.\"\n\nThompson received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame Aug. 11.\n\n'Ridiculously exciting':'SNL' star Kenan Thompson to host 2022 Emmy Awards\n\nKenan Thompson thinks 'SNL' could end in three years: '50 is a good number to stop at'\n\nWhy are the Emmys on a Monday?\n\nThat’s a great question! While the Emmys are typically held on Sunday, the ceremony is punted to Monday every four years, each time it's NBC's turn to host, to avoid a conflict with \"Sunday Night Football.\" (Sept. 11 features a faceoff between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Dallas Cowboys in the Lone Star State.)\n\nWho has the most Emmy nominations?\n\nPrograms that aired or streamed between June 1, 2021 and May 31 of this year are eligible. From those, it’s only fitting that HBO's \"Succession\" rose to the top of the nominations, announced in July. The family drama that follows the entertainingly dysfunctional Roy family's fight for corporate power leads the race with 25, including outstanding drama series. In 2020, the last year it was eligible, the series walked away with seven wins, including the Emmy for outstanding drama series.\n\nThere’s no doubt the \"Ted Lasso\" team is believing in a victory or two. The Apple TV+ comedy and HBO's social-satire limited series \"The White Lotus\" are tied with 20 nods apiece. Last year, \"Lasso\" racked up seven trophies.\n\nPrep for your Emmys watch party by checking out the full list of nominees.\n\nWhat stars and shows were snubbed for Emmy nominations?\n\nThe sad fact is not every actor or program can be nominated. So unfortunately Jennifer Aniston (“The Morning Show”), Selena Gomez (“Only Murders in the Building”) and Julia Roberts (“Gaslit”) have no chance of walking away with a statuette this year for their acting. Not an empath? Review the other heartbreaking snubs.\n\nWho won at the Creative Arts Emmys?\n\nBarack Obama picked up his first Emmy during the early Sept. 3-4 ceremonies. The former president earned a statuette for narrating the Netflix docuseries \"Our Great National Parks.\"\n\nLaurie Metcalf's role as tour manager Weed on HBO Max's \"Hacks\" earned \"The Conners\" actress an Emmy for outstanding guest actress in a comedy series. The comedy guest actor went to Nathan Lane for Hulu's \"Only Murders in the Building.\" The top honors for guest actors in a drama series went to Lee You-mi (who played Ji-yeong in Netflix's \"Squid Game\") and Colman Domingo (HBO's \"Euphoria\").\n\nAnd RuPaul Charles won another Emmy for outstanding host of a reality or competition program, VH1's \"RuPaul's Drag Race,\" his 12th trophy overall.\n\nContributing: Anthony Robledo\n\nEmmy snubs 2022:Julia Roberts, Jennifer Aniston among actors left off nomination list", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2022/09/12/emmys-2022-best-and-worst-moments/10362172002/", "title": "Emmys 2022: The best (and worst) moments of the night", "text": "The red carpet is rolled up, the gold statues have been given away and the speeches have been given. The 2022 Emmy Awards wrapped up with winners both predictable and surprising, from repeats like Jason Sudeikis (\"Ted Lasso\") and Jean Smart (\"Hacks\") to newcomers like \"Squid Game\" and \"Abbott Elementary.\"\n\nBut beyond the results, the 2022 Emmy ceremony, hosted by \"Saturday Night Live\" star Kenan Thompson, will be remembered for the moments, good and bad, that accompanied the winners. And there were some really wonderful moments Monday night, and some genuinely terrible ones.\n\nFrom the glorious Sheryl Lee Ralph to the awkward \"Brady Bunch\" break dancing, here is the best, and the worst, of TV's biggest night.\n\nWorst Emmy moment: Remixed TV theme songs\n\nThompson was doing great at the very top of the night, sporting a top hat and tails and dropping some sick burns on his fellow TV lovers. (I particularly enjoyed \"from Netflix and chill to Paramount+ and eating dinner alone\").\n\nFor some reason, the opening then devolved into a very strange dance recital from your nephew's high school. Well, at least that's what it looked like when a troupe of dancers offered some interpretive and hip-hop dances to electronic remixes of the theme songs to \"Friends,\" \"The Brady Bunch,\" \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Stranger Things.\" It was weird, it was dull, and it was so unnecessary. When Thompson came out later with more jokes at the expense of Netflix and Showtime, it was just another reminder that a simple opening monologue would have been just fine.\n\nKaley Cuoco talks 'love at first sight' with Tom Pelphrey as they make Emmys red carpet debut\n\nBest Emmy moment: Michael Keaton's speech\n\nBatman himself showed up to the Emmy awards in a sleek gray tuxedo, took the first Emmy of the night for Hulu's \"Dopesick\" and set the bar very high for acceptance speech of the night. After ribbing Oprah Winfrey, he told a touching, funny and earnest story about his family, thanking them \"for never making me feel foolish.\" He also expressed appreciation for his mistakes: \"I'm glad I've made a fool of myself over and over again.\"\n\nEmmys 2022:The 10 best dressed celebs from Amanda Seyfried to Zendaya\n\nBest Emmy moment: Sheryl Lee Ralph brings down the house\n\nOne of the stars of ABC's breakout sitcom \"Abbott Elementary,\" Ralph won the award for best supporting actress in a comedy series and was visibly shocked and shaken by the honor, her first Emmy. She walked up on stage and opened her mouth and belted out in song, Dianne Reeves' 1993 hit, “Endangered Species.” After singing her verses, Ralph reminded anyone who ever had a dream to keep holding on for someone like Quinta Brunson, the creator and star of \"Abbott.\" The genuine emotion, and the power of Ralph's singing voice and spoken words provided a moment unparalleled at almost any recent award show. The Emmys may be a celebration of the best of TV, but they don't really make great TV all that often. The awards clearly needed Sheryl Lee Ralph to come fix that.\n\n'This is what believing looks like':Sheryl Lee Ralph schools Emmys with 'Abbott Elementary' win\n\nBest and worst Emmy moment: Jennifer Coolidge's speech\n\nThe inimitable Jennifer Coolidge won for her universally beloved supporting performance in HBO's \"The White Lotus,\" and was struggling to get her words out when she took the stage. Just when she started to give thanks, the producers tried to play her off. Coolidge would not be stopped, shouting over the music that this was a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\" The music changed and got louder, unfortunately. But ever the performer, Coolidge simply started dancing. It probably wasn't the speech she wanted, but it was certainly memorable.\n\nEmmys 2022:Everything you missed\n\nBest Emmy moment: Lizzo and the 'Big Grrrls'\n\nIs she on her way to an EGOT? Pop sensation Lizzo won her first Emmy for her Amazon reality competition series \"Watch Out For the Big Grrrls,\" and her acceptance speech did not disappoint. \"When I was a little girl, all I wanted to see was me in the media. Someone fat like me. Black like me. Beautiful like me,\" she said. And the crowd went wild.\n\nBackstage at the 2022 Emmys, Quinta Brunson says she might 'punch' Jimmy Kimmel\n\nMost awkward Emmy moment: 'Succession' boss ribs the monarchy\n\nWhen HBO's media-empire drama \"Succession\" took home the biggest prize of the night (outstanding drama series), a repeat of its 2020 win, creator Jesse Armstrong took the opportunity to get in some barbs at his home country, the United Kingdom. \"Big week for successions,\" he said, referencing the death of Queen Elizabeth II and succession of her son, King Charles III. He did note that more people voted for \"Succession\" in the democratic Emmys than in the monarchy with Charles. \"I'm not saying we're more legitimate in our position than he is,\" he added. \"We'll leave that to other people.\" Series star Brian Cox advised his boss to \"keep it Royalist.\"\n\nIt's about damn time:Lizzo celebrates on-screen representation in Emmys acceptance speech\n\nWorst Emmy moment: Kumail Nanjiani's bartending bit\n\nOn a night when several speeches from winners were cut off, it was extra frustrating to see so many unfunny comedy bits and montages shoved into the long broadcast. Unfortunately, Nanjiani's bit with Thompson and Jason Sudeikis as a bad bartender should have been cut. It was only partially redeemed by the reunion of Thompson with his Nickelodeon co-star Kel Mitchell of \"Kenan & Kel\" fame.\n\nSee all the Emmy winners:'Ted Lasso,' 'The White Lotus'", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2022/07/12/emmys-nominations-2022-full-list/10018798002/", "title": "Emmys nominations 2022: Full list; 'Succession,' 'Ted Lasso' lead", "text": "'Succession,' 'Ted Lasso,' 'White Lotus' top Emmy nominees.\n\nHBO nabs 140 nominations to Netflix's 105.\n\n'Squid Game' is the first non-English language show nominated for best drama series.\n\nJust like Logan Roy (Brian Cox) himself, HBO's \"Succession\" once again comes out on top.\n\nThe show, which follows the dysfunctional Roy family's fight for corporate power, leads the 2022 Primetime Emmy Awards race with 25 nominations, including outstanding drama series.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Bryan Cranston share an intimate moment.\n\nIn 2014, the former \"Seinfeld\" actress snagged a win for her role in HBO's \"Veep,\" and on her way to accept the golden trophy was stopped by Cranston. The two shared a comically passionate kiss as cameras looked on.\n\n2. Nominees for lead actress channel Miss America.\n\nIn 2011, all the nominees for the Best Comedy Actress took the stage as their names were called, taking the audience by surprise and prompting quite a bit of laughter.\n\nMelissa McCarthy won, with all the actresses looking on, Miss America-style. She was even awarded a tiara by presenter Rob Lowe.\n\n3. Merritt Wever is at a loss for words.\n\nWhen Wever won the Emmy for supporting actress in a comedy series for her role on Showtime's \"Nurse Jackie\" in 2013, the actress was so stunned she could only muster a few thank you's to the audience before saying \"I gotta go, bye.\"\n\n4. Viola Davis becomes the first woman of color to win Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series.\n\nUpon winning her first golden statue in 2015 for her role in ABC's \"How to Get Away with Murder,\" Davis delivered a powerful speech, saying, \"The only thing that separates women of color from anyone else is opportunity.\" Davis went on to earn four more Emmy nominations.\n\n5. Fred Rogers delivers a sentimental speech.\n\nWhen Rogers won a lifetime achievement award at the Daytime Emmys in 1997, his words struck a chord with viewers.\n\nHe spoke with the same sing-song intonation he used for years on his PBS children's program, \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,\" and asked an emotional audience to think of all the people who had helped them become who they were.\n\n6. Glenn Weiss proposes to his girlfriend on stage.\n\nWhen Weiss won in 2018 for Outstanding Directing for a Variety Special, he saw an opportunity and seized it. Onstage, he got down on one knee and put a ring on longtime girlfriend Jan Svendsen's finger.\n\nAs far as public proposals go, this pretty much takes the cake.\n\n7. Jharrel Jerome pays tribute to the Central Park 5.\n\nJerome won the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or a Movie in 2019 for his role in \"When They See Us,\" a Netflix series portraying the wrongful conviction of the Central Park 5.\n\nAt the end of his acceptance speech, Jerome payed special tribute to the men whose lives were dramatized in the miniseries, saying \"most importantly, this is for the men that we know as the Exonerated Five. Raymond, Yusef, Antron, Kevin, and King Korey Wise. Thank you so much, it’s an honor, it’s a blessing.”\n\n8. Sean Spicer makes an appearance.\n\nIn 2017, when Stephen Colbert served as master of ceremonies for the awards show, he brought former White House press secretary Sean Spicer out to remark on the audience size, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the many false statements Spicer made about the size of the crowd at Trump's inauguration.\n\n9. Billy Porter makes history.\n\nPorter won in 2019 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a drama series for FX's \"Pose.\" He made history as the first openly gay Black man to win an Emmy in this category.\n\nIn his speech he remarked how overwhelmed he was to have lived long enough to see this day, and quoted James Baldwin.\n\n10. Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, and Steve Carell have a joyful moment.\n\nIn 2007 when Ricky Gervais won Lead Actor in a Comedy for HBO's \"Extras\" and was not there to accept his award, Stewart and Colbert gave it to their friend Steve Carell. Years later, Gervais made a show of demanding it back.\n\nYour comprehensive guide to the Emmys:Emmy nominations 2022: See the nominees in top categories\n\n11.

Kennedy Library and Museum that his goal is to cut cancer death rates by at least 50% in the next 25 years. The President also said he wants to \"create a more supportive experience for patients and families.\"\n\nThe President -- who lost his son to brain cancer -- spoke in personal, passionate terms about his goal, which he called \"bold, ambitious\" and \"completely doable.\"\n\n\"Cancer does not discriminate red and blue. It doesn't care if you're Republican or Democrat. Beating cancer is something we can do together,\" the President said discussing the administration's efforts to cut the number of deaths from cancer in the United States in half over the next 25 years.\n\nBiden's speech came on the 60th anniversary of Kennedy's original \"Moonshot\" speech, in which he unveiled his goal of landing a man on the Moon.\n\nJUST WATCHED Here's what's been accomplished since JFK's 'moonshot' speech Replay More Videos ...

And together, we can choose to move forward with unity, hope and optimism. And I believe we can usher in the same unwillingness to postpone -- the same national purpose that will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills to end cancer as we know it and even cure cancers once and for all.\"\n\nTo \"break the logjams\" in Congress, Biden said he would use his authorities as President to increase funding for cancer research.\n\nThe President also announced that Dr. Renee Wegrzyn will become the inaugural director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, which is a new agency that aims to \"drive biomedical innovation that supports the health of all Americans.\" He is also expected to sign an executive order that will launch a National Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Initiative, the White House said.\n\n'We're finally going to make infrastructure begin to work'\n\nThe midterm elections are less than 60 days away, and Biden's travel to Boston is his latest effort aimed at capitalizing on the political momentum spurred by recent legislative achievements and dropping gas prices.\n\nEarlier Monday, the President highlighted projects made possible by the bipartisan infrastructure law at Boston Logan International Airport's Terminal E. New spending from the infrastructure law, he said, will create more than 5,000 jobs and expand capacity and increase accessibility at the airport.\n\nBiden, at the airport, stressed the importance of competing with other countries like China in addition to rebuilding the nation's infrastructure.\n\n\"We risk losing our edge as nation to China, and the rest of the world is catching up. That stops now, with investments like we're celebrating here today,\" the President said.\n\nBiden said: \"Folks, America invented modern aviation.

It means commerce, it means income, it means security.\"\n\nThe investments in the airport include $50 million to modernize Terminal E and $12 million to improve roadways.

Over the same time, the inflation rate was just 16.3 percent.\n\nSeveral key factors generally affect food prices in the long run. High oil prices increase the cost of shipping; droughts and floods cause shortages of certain crops; and a growing appetite for more expensive food from an increasingly affluent world population drives up overall demand – and prices – of food.\n\nAmericans may also feel the effects of recently imposed tariffs on goods traded between China and the United States in the checkout aisle. This is particularly true of certain items like canned goods.\n\nIn the short run, the supply and demand of food is subject to factors such as weather, disease outbreak, and changing consumer preferences. In recent years, the California drought, the 2015 avian flu outbreak, and an increasing appetite for higher priced items such as organic foods in the United States and meat and dairy products in developing countries have caused some goods to appreciate in price far faster than most food items.\n\nDangerous trend:Pedestrian deaths hit 28-year high, suggesting SUV boom raises safety risks\n\nSweat equity:How a little home DIY can help you avoid a down payment\n\nTo determine the groceries driving up food bills the most, 24/7 Wall St. analyzed changes in the consumer price index from 2008 to 2018 for over 300 goods using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nTo avoid repetition, we excluded certain items from the list when a similar product had a larger increase. For example, two items classified on the CPI – uncooked ground beef and beef and veal – each had substantial price increases. Only beef and veal, which had the larger 10-year increase, remained on the list. The prices of 20 grocery items increased by at least 21 percent over the last 10 years.\n\nProperty crime:This is where shoplifting, burglary and car theft are highest in every state\n\nIncome inequality:States where the middle class is disappearing\n\n20. Rice, pasta, cornmeal\n\n10-year price increase: 21.5 percent\n\nMany crops are feeling the effects of climate change. Major heat waves across the world have made growing and harvesting crops like rice and wheat more difficult. The cost of rice has increased and, for the first time in six years, there was a global wheat deficit in 2018, according to Bloomberg. The price increase has likely had a profound effect on American grocery bills, as Americans consume 19.4 pounds of pasta per capita annually.\n\n19. Other fats and oils including peanut butter\n\n10-year price increase: 21.7 percent\n\nOne driving force behind the rising price of other fats and oils like peanut butter was likely the rising price of peanuts. As more farmers are switch from peanuts to more profitable crops like cotton, the amount of land used to grow peanuts in the United States shrunk by an estimated 18 percent in 2018. In recent years, peanut butter consumption has spiked in the United States. Partially as a result, In the last 10 years, the price of other fats and oils by climbed 21.7 percent.\n\n18. Bread\n\n10-year price increase: 22.4 percent\n\nA staple of the human diet dating back millenia, bread has become much more expensive over the past decade. Extreme weather across the world has affected wheat harvests. Major wheat producers like Australia and Russia have faced droughts and heatwaves. This has cut into supply, forcing bakeries to raise bread prices. In the last 10 years, the price of bread in the U.S. climbed 22.4 percent.\n\n17. Canned fruits\n\n10-year price increase: 22.5 percent\n\nThe yield of crops such as fruit, and therefore their price, is highly susceptible to unpredictable weather events like heatwaves and droughts. But canned fruits may be feeling the squeeze from newly imposed U.S. tariffs. New taxes on steel imported from China are raising packaging costs for makers of canned goods. In the last 10 years, the price of canned fruit climbed by 22.5 percent.\n\n16. Pet food\n\n10-year price increase: 23.0 percent\n\nOne of the likely contributors to the 23 percent spike in pet food prices is the greater demand for premium products. As millennials are delaying marriage and having children later in life compared to previous generations, they are getting pets instead and lavishing them with high-quality pet foods, according to a Business Insider report. Even though the total sales of pet food by volume declined in the U.S. from 2011 to 2016, the amount spent went up considerably.\n\n15. Bacon, breakfast sausage, and related products\n\n10-year price increase: 24.5 percent\n\nBacon and sausage is about 25 percent more expensive now than 10 years ago. As is the case for many food items on this list, the climb in the prices of breakfast meat is partially attributable to growing demand. Americans are projected to consume in 2019 an average of 52.3 pounds of pork, the most commonly used meat for bacon and sausage, up 7 percent from 48.9 pounds per capita in 2008, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nPork prices in the United States will likely be affected by the recently imposed Chinese tariffs. American pork is now subject to a 25 percent tax in China, which will likely reduce demand in that country and lower profits for American hog farmers. Where pork prices go from here remains to be seen.\n\n14. Frozen fish and seafood\n\n10-year price increase: 24.7 percent\n\nThe U.S. aquaculture industry largely consists of catfish, trout, salmon, tilapia, hybrid striped bass, sturgeon, walleye, and yellow perch. Shrimp, salmon, and canned tuna make up more than half of seafood consumed in the United States. The vast majority of seafood Americans eat is imported. The increase in the price of seafood likely stems from rising demand for fish worldwide, particularly in China.\n\n13. Sauces and gravies\n\n10-year price increase: 25.6 percent\n\nSauces and gravies cover a wide range of condiments that can go on anything from pasta to a sandwich. While prices for specific sauces and gravies may vary, on average, their prices have gone up by 25.6 percent over the last 10 years, faster than the 19.1 percent increase in prices across all grocery items.\n\nThe price increase is likely due in part to growing demand. Sauces and gravies are used to add flavor to food, and as such they are an unnecessary expense Americans today can better afford. Americans have more disposable income now than they did 10 years ago -- the beginning of the Great Recession.\n\n12. Fats and oils\n\n10-year price increase: 25.6 percent\n\nThere was a 25.6 percent increase in the price of fats and oils in the last decade. As is the case for many foods on this list, the climbing price of fats and oils was driven largely by growing demand -- particularly for olive oil. The United States consumed 339,512 tons of olive oil in 2015, up 250 percent from 1990. Over the same period, global olive oil consumption climbed by a lower 73 percent. Olive oil contains certain healthy dietary fats and antioxidants, it may lower the risk of heart disease. Because of its purported health benefits, consumption is projected to continue to climb in the future as Americans become increasingly health conscious.\n\n11. Canned vegetables\n\n10-year price increase: 25.7 percent\n\nCanned vegetables have a longer shelf life than fresh produce as well as lower shipping and handling costs. While these factors generally contribute to lower prices, the rising demand of canned vegetables seems to have contributed to rising prices. According to the USDA, canned vegetable consumption tends to rise with age. The considerable growth of the U.S. elderly population over the last decade likely led to an increased demand for canned vegetables overall, contributing to the product's sharp rise in the price.\n\n10. Fresh biscuits, rolls, muffins\n\n10-year price increase: 27.2 percent\n\nTraditional biscuits, rolls, and muffins share many of the same ingredients, but butter may be the one factor contributing most to their 27.2 percent price increase in the last 10 years. Over the last decade, butter prices have climbed 43.6 percent in the United States, driven by growing demand. Due in part to Americans' awareness of benefits associated with natural fats found in butter that are more healthful than those in margarine, butter sales climbed by an annual average of 7 percent in North America from 2012 to 2017.\n\n9. Cakes, cupcakes, and cookies\n\n10-year price increase: 27.6 percent\n\nThe price of cakes, cupcakes, and cookies rose slightly faster than the price of flour, which is a main ingredient in many of these baked goods. The rising cost of butter has likely contributed to the increase in baked goods prices. The price of butter rose by 43.6 percent over the last decade, more than nearly any other food item.\n\n8. Frankfurters\n\n10-year price increase: 27.6 percent\n\nPerhaps no food is as iconically American as the hot dog. According to the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council, Americans consume an average of 70 hot dogs a year -- despite the common belief that eating more than two per year is unhealthy.\n\nFrankfurters are one of several meats to rank on this list. In the last decade, the average price of a frankfurter climbed by 27.6 percent. Frankfurters are traditionally made from pork and beef, the former of which has surged in demand -- and price -- in recent years. What effect that will have on demand for frankfurters remains to be seen.\n\n7. Salt and other seasonings and spices\n\n10-year price increase: 31.5 percent\n\nOne factor contributing to the increase in the price of salt overall may be the rapid growth of the gourmet salt market, which includes products such as Himalayan salt, sel gris, and fleur de sel. While a rise in price can reduce demand for a consumer good, sodium consumption among Americans has remained largely unchanged over the past 10 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n6. Oranges, including tangerines\n\n10-year price increase: 37.6 percent\n\nOrange growers in Florida, the largest orange-producing state, have had to deal with several issues in recent years. The state was hit with an incurable disease in 2017 that depleted citrus trees. Hurricane Irma was also a destructive force that year. While Florida's crops are recovering, the state is also facing now international competition from countries such as Brazil.\n\n5. Prescription drugs\n\n10-year price increase: 39.1 percent\n\nDespite heavy competition, pharmaceutical companies have raised the prices of prescription drugs in recent years. The prices of four of the 10 most popular prescription drugs in the United States -- including arthritis drugs Humira and Enbrel -- have more than doubled since 2011. Despite the rising costs, demand for drugs has continued to grow in recent years. The share of Americans using at least one prescription drug a month has risen from approximately 38 percent two decades ago to nearly half of all Americans, according to the CDC.\n\n4. Beef and veal\n\n10-year price increase: 42.4 percent\n\nThere is currently no shortage of meat in the United States. Meat's high cost is primarily driven by strong demand, especially for beef and veal. Exports of these meats hit a record of 2.9 billion lbs in 2017 with Japan the top buyer. This demand has contributed to the increase of 42.4 percent in the price of beef and veal in the United States.\n\n3. Shelf stable fish and seafood\n\n10-year price increase: 42.5 percent\n\nOne factor affecting the cost of fresh fish is the rising cost of fishmeal, which has increased production costs of farmed seafood. Additionally, as the average consumer has become wealthier, demand for more expensive, high-end fish such as tuna and salmon increased, which drove the price of fresh seafood higher.\n\n2. Margarine\n\n10-year price increase: 50.2 percent\n\nWhile butter and margarine are considered substitute goods – increased in demand (in this case butter) for one often coincides with a decline in demand for the other – the prices of both rose in the past decade. The increase in margarine prices, however, outpaced the increase in butter prices over the past decade, spiking by 50.2 percent – faster than nearly any other grocery product.\n\n1. Tobacco and smoking products\n\n10-year price increase: 88.7 percent\n\nThe price of tobacco and smoking products in the United States nearly doubled in the past decade, rising by 88.7 percent from 2008 to 2018 – the largest increase of any grocery item in the country. The rise was largely because of a federal tax hike implemented on April 1, 2009, that increased the tax on cigarettes by 61.7 cents per pack. As a result, cigarette sales declined by 8.3 percent in 2009 alone – the largest decline in nearly 80 years.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

A lot more in many cases.\n\nMetro Detroit sees 10% hike in food\n\nGroceries in the Midwest were up 7.4% in the past year, far more than some parts of the country, including the Northeast, where grocery and food prices were up 4.9%, according to Paul LaPorte, economist with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Office of Economic Analysis & Information in Chicago.\n\nMetro Detroit even saw double-digit sticker shock where grocery prices, as measured by the CPI, were up 10%.\n\nThe grocery category includes cereal, meat, milk, fish, poultry, fruit, vegetables and other food at home.\n\nAnother spot for hefty price hikes: food away from home or or the cost of dining out, including takeout.\n\nIn the Midwest, the food away from home category was up 7.7% — up significantly from the West, which was up 5.5%, and the South, which was up 5.4%.\n\n\"The food categories are where we are feeling a bigger pinch in our wallets,\" LaPorte said.\n\nMore:Food prices soar as inflation sees biggest, fastest increase in decades\n\nMore:More than unemployment concerns, Americans are worried about rising prices\n\nWage hikes drive up prices on the shelf\n\nWhat's likely to be driving food prices up, though, continues to be higher wages in many areas, as well as higher costs for transportation and gas.\n\nThe labor shortage during the pandemic has many companies paying sign-up bonuses, including at restaurants, and raising hourly wages — costs that are being passed along to consumers.\n\nKurt Rankin, economist for the PNC Financial Services Group, said states throughout the Midwest region are seeing wage growth that is consistently outpacing the national average.\n\n\"Stronger wage growth is a prime contributor to inflation,\" Rankin said, \"as increased demand through higher incomes chases a limited supply of goods and services.\"\n\nMany people aren't returning to the workforce, driving some employers to need to raise wages and offer bonuses to attract a limited supply of workers.\n\n\"On this score, Michigan is one of the worst-off states in the region in terms of inflationary fuel. Michigan’s labor force is still 3.4% smaller than it was in February 2020,\" Rankin said.\n\nRankin said he would expect that Michigan and the Midwest as a whole will continue to see inflation that is above the national average.\n\nPNC forecasts that the national consumer price index will remain elevated in the first quarter of 2022, coming in at 7% year over year for January and 6.7% year over year for February. Yet PNC expects that pace to slow to an average of 3% for the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nHigher gas prices contribute to price hikes for groceries and other goods\n\nSupermarkets and other stores are likely passing along higher costs involved with transportation and supply chain disruptions, too.\n\nEnergy prices in the Midwest jumped 30.6%, largely the result of an increase in the price of gasoline.\n\nGas prices are up nearly 50% from a year ago in the Midwest, LaPorte said, which is about in line with other regions in the country.\n\nWe're paying nearly a buck more a gallon for gas at the pump than a year ago.\n\nIn metro Detroit, the average price for a gallon of gas was $3.22 on Wednesday, up from an average of $2.30 a gallon a year ago, according to GasBuddy.com.\n\nWe're not likely to see much relief at the pump in 2022, and we could even see steeper price hikes ahead, according to some forecasts.\n\nGasBuddy predicts that we could see a national average of $4 per gallon this spring, as the U.S. economy continues to recover from the pandemic.\n\nGasBuddy expects the yearly national average gas price to hit $3.41 a gallon in 2022, up from $3.02 for 2021.\n\n\"After a hot start to the summer, prices should begin to decline, falling back to potentially just under $3 per gallon by the holiday season,\" according to the GasBuddy outlook.\n\nThe average household is expected to see its gasoline spending hit $2,341 for the year, the highest since 2014.\n\nAnother big mover in the Midwest: the cost of natural gas.\n\nThe Midwest saw an uptick of 33.7% for natural gas prices in the past year through December — significantly more than the 19.3% gain in the South and the 21% gain in the Northeast.\n\nHow upset you are about price hikes, though, could depend a great deal on your own financial situation.\n\nRight now, the consumers who are being hit the hardest continue to be those making close to the minimum wage who do not have much in savings to cushion the blow of higher expenses.\n\nMany families benefited from one stimulus payment in 2021 and six advance monthly payments from July through December for the child tax credit. The extra cash eased some of the pain of higher prices. But no similar payments are currently in the works for 2022.\n\nIf inflation continues to heat up, we're going to hear more grumbling from many middle income and higher income households.\n\nWhere are signs of hope?\n\nCharles Ballard, professor of economics at Michigan State University, suggested that one might spot a hopeful sign if you look at the monthly changes for prices, instead of the year-over-year changes.\n\nThe big headline is the 7% CPI change year over year nationwide.\n\nBut Ballard pointed out that the month-to-month change from November to December was 0.5%, which was less than the type of shifts we saw in October (up 0.9%) and November (up 0.8%).\n\nIt's hard to build a forecast on a month or two of data. But it's also hopeful that gas prices have been trending down in the last month, he said.\n\n\"If energy prices stabilize, that will go a long way toward moderating the overall rate of inflation,\" Ballard said.\n\nYet he warned that inflation will continue to be part of the picture in 2022.\n\n\"Even if the overall rate of inflation moderates in the coming months, the year-over-year rate of inflation will almost certainly stay high,\" he said.\n\nWhen it comes to the Midwest, it is important to note that the CPI measures the direction of prices, not whether people who live in Michigan or elsewhere actually pay more for things like food, rent and transportation than they do in another part of the country.\n\nThe Midwest region is composed of Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\nIn general, the Midwest consumers have tended to benefit from a lower cost of living. Some businesses even may have more wiggle room to pass along their higher costs in the form of price hikes here — up to a point.\n\nRight now, though, many consumers in the Midwest can only hope that we don't turn into the leader for price hikes in 2022.\n\nContactSusan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

Average unleaded gas set a record $4.33 a gallon last month before easing to $4.11 by Monday, according to AAA. Pump prices are up 48% from a year earlier.\n\n2022 Tax guide:Key dates for filing and extensions, claiming credits and planning for refunds\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine stoked last fall’s inflation surge by reducing Russian oil supplies and intensifying supply chain bottlenecks, especially for energy, wheat and other commodities shipped from the region.\n\nMeanwhile, worker shortages in the U.S. are prompting companies to boost pay sharply to attract job candidates, leading them to lift prices to maintain profit margins.\n\nExcluding volatile food and energy items, so-called core prices rose 6.5% annually in March, the largest advance since August 1982.\n\nBut on a monthly basis, core prices increased 0.3%, the slowest increase in six months and a sign such prices may be easing, Contingent Macro Research says.\n\nStill, economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics says the report bolsters her view that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates by a larger-than-normal half a percentage point at both its May and June meetings. She figures inflation won't peak until May.\n\nBut Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics says further softening in core prices could cause the Fed to pull back to a quarter-point increase at the June gathering.\n\nIn March, used-car prices offered some relief, falling 3.8%. But that still left costs 35.3% higher than a year earlier.\n\nBut while prices for some goods are moderating, the cost of services is rising as the pandemic eases and consumers increasingly dine out, travel and do other activities. Airfares surged 10.7%, pushing the yearly rise to 23.6%. Hotel rates increased 3.3% monthly and 25.1% annually.\n\nWhy are food prices going up?\n\nGrocery prices increased 1.5% from the prior month and are up 10% over the past year. Ukraine accounts for about 8% of the world’s wheat exports, and war-related disruptions to shipments – or worries over such snags – appear to be pushing up the prices of wheat-related products, along with other commodities.\n\nBreakfast cereal prices rose 2.4% monthly and 9.2% from a year ago. Rice, pasta and cornmeal increased 2.8% monthly and 9.3% annually. And fresh biscuits, rolls and muffins rose 2.5% monthly and 10.8% from a year ago.\n\nAnd rent increased 0.4% from the prior month, and 4.4% annually.\n\nHow can we fix inflation?\n\nBoth Wells Fargo and Barclays reckon inflation likely peaked in March. A fading pandemic should help ease supply snarls and labor shortages this year, economists have said.\n\nBut don’t celebrate quite yet.\n\n“The descent in inflation is going to be painfully slow,” says Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard.\n\nAnd the war could extend the supply troubles and outsize price gains longer than expected, says Barclays economist Pooja Sriram.

Prices for poultry are predicted to increase by 6% to 7% and 2.5%-3.5% for eggs.\n\n\"An ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza could contribute to poultry and egg price increases through reduced supply or decrease prices through lowered international demand for U.S. poultry products or eggs,\" according to the report.\n\nCoin shortage 2022:Why is there a coin shortage?

Americans are eating at home more than they used to, especially since offices and some schools remain closed.\n\nWeather-related events, from snowstorms in the Northeast to wildfires in Colorado, also have impacted product availability and caused some shoppers to stock up more than usual, exacerbating supply problems caused by the pandemic.\n\nU.S. groceries typically have 5% to 10% of their items out of stock at any given time; right now, that unavailability rate is hovering around 15%, according to Consumer Brands Association President and CEO Geoff Freeman.\n\n►New Oreo flavor:Oreo releasing a limited-edition Chocolate Confetti Cake Cookie for its 110th birthday\n\n►Lettuce recall 2022:Dole recalls salad sold at Walmart, Kroger, Aldi, H-E-B for listeria risk\n\nPatrick Penfield, professor of supply chain practice at Syracuse University’s Whitman School of Management, recently told USA TODAY that cream cheese and international foods were among the food products in short supply.\n\n“As you walk through a lot of stores you won’t see the quantity and quality of items you are accustomed to seeing,” Penfield said, adding some shortages are regional due to labor and truck shortages.\n\nIn a recent study by business consultancy KPMG, 71% of grocery consumers said they were somewhat or very concerned about shortages or stockouts with 35% switching brands when their favorite items are out of stock.\n\nCostco limits purchases of some items\n\nSome retailers have been limiting purchases of select items, similar to policies implemented at the start of the pandemic.

Davey said some of the nation’s 10 largest retailers had more than 20% of baby formula out of stock the week ended Jan. 2.\n\nSome parents have been taking to social media to ask formula makers where they can buy products.\n\n“We are experiencing obstacles in the production and shipping of some of our products as the pandemic continues to cause issues with the supply chain. We appreciate your patience as we navigate this dynamic situation,” Enfamil said on Twitter Dec. 29 in responding to one parent’s plea for help.\n\nEnfamil also said parents can see real-time product availability at stores on its website.\n\nCream cheese shortage\n\nBagel shops have been struggling with the cream cheese shortage and Junior's Cheesecake had to stop production twice at its New Jersey-based facility because it didn't have enough cream cheese.\n\nBut cream cheese has also been missing at stores, particularly Philadelphia Cream Cheese.\n\nIn December, the Kraft brand offered consumers help paying for a replacement dessert, acknowledging the ongoing supply chain disruption of the key cheesecake ingredient.\n\nAndrew Tobisch, a spokesperson for Schreiber Foods, said every cream cheese provider has struggled to keep up with demand.\n\n\"While that demand has been steady, it’s really world events that are the biggest driver.

But the pandemic is only part of the problem.\n\nThe demand for can products accumulated for years according to a Quartz article. Canned drinks are cheaper to make and transport, and easier to market and design, initiating the highest prices for aluminum the market has seen in the past 10 years, senior analyst Salvator Tiano told Quartz.\n\nCat food, dog food shortages\n\nShipping woes and aluminum shortages have led to a scarcity problem for the pet food industry as stores throughout the country are unable to stock all their traditional brands and products.\n\nConsumers are also feeling the impact. Many USA TODAY readers said canned or wet cat food was one of the top items they have been struggling to find.\n\nThese shortages are impacting the movement of ingredients and finished products, the Pet Food Institute told USA TODAY. Along with labor and transportation shortages, pet owners are spending more time with their pets which can lead to increased feeding and more treating. The high demand has resulted in larger purchases.\n\nMarcie Rivera, a spokesperson for Wegmans told the MetroWest Daily News in Framingham, Massachusetts, part of the USA TODAY Network, that suppliers around the world \"are being faced with an array of challenges affecting their businesses, causing a domino effect on retailers and customers.\"\n\nChicken tender shortage\n\nChicken tenders may be the next casualty of supply-chain-generated shortages, according to a recent NBC News story. Chicken tenders require more processing and packaging, which makes them harder to find and more costly, the story said.\n\nMeat manufacturers have cited extreme weather, labor shortages and high demand among the reasons consumers are having trouble finding tenders.\n\nA spokesman for the National Chicken Council said products were taking longer than normal to get to their destinations but that does not constitute a \"shortage.\"\n\n\"There is no chicken tender shortage,\" said Tom Super, senior vice president of communications with the trade group. \"Like almost all goods right now, supplies are somewhat tight, but I would say it falls short of any 'shortage.'\"\n\n►Finger lickin' gone:Is a chicken tender shortage underway?\n\nLunchables shortage\n\nFor months, parents have reported trouble finding Kraft Heinz' Lunchables. The company told USA TODAY that it has been seeing double-digit growth for the first time in five years.\n\nHigh demand is one reason why it's harder to find these items.\n\n“Our entire supply chain continues to step up – taking actions that protect our business today, while working hard to not delay critical investments that set us up for the future,” Kraft Heinz said in the statement.\n\nToilet paper shortage\n\nIn spring 2020, demand for toilet paper skyrocketed as Americans were faced with a possibly lengthy stay-at-home future. Panic buying of bath tissue has returned at various times throughout the pandemic. This shortage stems from lumber's raw material, wood pulp, which is used to make toilet paper.\n\nChampagne shortage could impact celebrations for years\n\nThe nation is in the early stages of a Champagne shortage that is expected to last several years, according to Wine Enthusiast.\n\nDrizly, North America's largest alcohol e-commerce and on-demand delivery platform, surveyed 500 alcohol retailers and found 80% said they were at least slightly concerned about the champagne supply running short.\n\nEven with the shortages, Liz Paquette, Drizly head of consumer insights, said champagne and prosecco continue to be the top-selling sparkling wines with 63% and 18% of market share.\n\nBeer shortage\n\nHaving a hard time finding your favorite craft beer?

A look at the Top 20", "text": "Evan Comen, Thomas C. Frohlich\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nThe price of all food has risen 26.8 percent over the past 10 years, outpacing the 21.9 percent inflation rate over the same period.\n\nSeveral key factors generally affect food prices in the long run. High oil prices increase the cost of shipping; droughts and floods cause shortages of certain key products; and a growing appetite for more expensive food from an increasingly affluent world population drives up the overall demand — and price — of food.\n\nIn the short run, the supply and demand of food is subject to factors such as weather, disease outbreak, and changing consumer preferences. In recent years, the California drought, the 2015 avian flu outbreak, and an increasing appetite for higher priced items such as organic foods in the United States and meat and dairy products in developing countries have caused some goods to appreciate in price far faster than most food items.\n\nMore:Economic disadvantages: 5 reasons we don't want a trade war with China\n\nMore:In a trade war, it's American consumers who may lose the most\n\nMore:Homebuyers hit by lumber prices near record highs\n\n20. Flour and prepared flour mixes\n\n10-year price increase: 26.0%\n\nThe spike in the price of flour has been particularly hard on the baked goods industry, which is also struggling with the rapid increase in butter prices. The price of cakes, cupcakes, and cookies rose by 30.5% from 2007 to 2017, and the price of fresh biscuits, rolls, and muffins rose by 33.0%.\n\n19. Eggs\n\n10-year price increase: 26.4%\n\nRising demand for eggs is one reason for rising prices. Annual consumption has risen from 252 eggs per American in 2007 to 275 in 2017, and it is expected to continue grow. The spike in 2015 was largely the result of the worst outbreak of avian flu in U.S. history, which led to the deaths of approximately 10% of the egg-laying hens in the U.S. — and to a 40% increase in the price of eggs nationwide. In some parts of the country, egg prices more than doubled.\n\n18. Cheese and related products\n\n10-year price increase: 26.7%\n\nA shortage of cow milk and growing demand for dairy products contributed to rising prices of cheese. Rising grain and feed costs have forced many farmers to cut back on milk production. Meanwhile, demand has likely increased partially as the result of recent better perception of saturated fats often found in dairy products. There also has been an increased demand for organic cheese products, which are generally more expensive.\n\n17. Canned vegetables\n\n10-year price increase: 26.9%\n\nCanned vegetables have a longer shelf life than fresh produce as well as lower shipping and handling costs. While these factors generally apply downward pressure on price, rising demand seems to have contributed to the rising prices. According to the USDA, canned vegetable consumption tends to rise with age. The considerable growth of the U.S. elderly population over the last decade likely led to an increased demand for canned vegetables overall, contributing to the commodity’s sharp rise in the price.\n\nMore:Produce is less healthy than it was 70 years ago. These farmers are trying to change that\n\n16. Frozen fish and seafood\n\n10-year price increase: 28.7%\n\nThe U.S. aquaculture industry largely consists of catfish, trout, salmon, tilapia, hybrid striped bass, sturgeon, walleye, and yellow perch. Shrimp, salmon, and canned tuna make up more than half of seafood consumed in the United States. The vast majority of seafood American eat is imported. The increase in the price of seafood likely stems from rising demand for fish worldwide, particularly in China.\n\n15. Other poultry, including turkey\n\n10-year price increase: 30.2%\n\nOne reason for the price hike in 2015 may have been a supply shortage caused by the worst outbreak of bird flu in U.S. history. The loss of roughly 48 million birds to avian influenza in the summer of 2015 resulted in an estimated 20% increase in the price of turkey from the year prior.\n\n14. Cakes, cupcakes, cookies\n\n10-year price increase: 30.5%\n\nThe price of cakes, cupcakes, and cookies rose slightly faster than the price of flour, which is a main ingredient in many of these baked goods. The rising cost of butter may also have contributed to the increase in baked goods prices. The price of butter rose 42.1% over the last decade, more than nearly any other food item.\n\n13. Bread\n\n10-year price increase: 31.8%\n\nAmerican wheat consumption per capita has gradually declined over the last two decades as more consumers adopt low-carb diets and some phase bread out of their grocery lists entirely. Despite falling consumption in the United States, increased demand for expensive artisanal breads and consistent demand for bread in Europe and the rest of the world has driven the price of the commodity up over the past decade.\n\n12. Rice, pasta, cornmeal\n\n10-year price increase: 32.4%\n\nFor those watching both their weight and their wallet, now may be the perfect time to start a low-carb diet. The price increase likely did not go unnoticed by Americans, who consume an average of 19.4 pounds of pasta annually. Compare that to Italy, where citizens consume 51.8 pounds of pasta per capita each year.\n\n11. Fresh biscuits, rolls, muffins\n\n10-year price increase: 33.0%\n\nThe increase in the price of flour and butter over the past decade has had a substantial effect on the baked goods industry. The price of flour and prepared flour mixes increased 26.0% from 2007 to 2017, and the price of butter increased 42.1%. Over the same period, the price of fresh biscuits, rolls, and muffins rose 33.0%.\n\n10. Fats and oils\n\n10-year price increase: 34.9%\n\nOne driving force behind the rising price of fats and oils was likely the rising price of peanut butter. Peanut production fell by about 30% from 2008 to 2011, and peanut prices skyrocketed as a result. While peanut production has returned to normal levels, the price of fats and oils has remained largely unchanged over the past five years.\n\n9. Fresh whole chicken\n\n10-year price increase: 35.1%\n\nIn addition to rising feed costs, growing consumer demand, and the 2015 outbreak of the avian flu, another factor that has affected the price of chicken is a decline in fertility. According to the Wall Street Journal, the current hatch rate is the smallest since 2007. While there is currently little consensus as to what is causing the decline in hatch rate, some believe a genetic issue has left many breeder roosters susceptible to overfeeding, which reduces fertility.\n\n8. Salt and other seasonings and spices\n\n10-year price increase: 36.5%\n\nOne factor contributing to the increase in the price of salt overall may be the rapid growth of the gourmet salt market, which includes products such as Himalayan salt, sel gris, and fleur de sel. While a rise in price can reduce demand for a consumer good, sodium consumption among Americans has remained largely unchanged over the past 10 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n7. Uncooked beef steaks\n\n10-year price increase: 41.0%\n\nYears of drought in the country’s top cattle-producing regions have contributed to a beef shortage. The U.S. cattle inventory fell to a 50-year low in 2015 and remains relatively low. That, along with rising feed and energy prices, resulted in an increase in the price of fresh beef — which also has hurt demand. U.S. per-capita beef consumption fell by about 15% over the last decade.\n\nMore:A Foolish Take: America's favorite meat is beef, by far\n\n6. Shelf stable fish and seafood\n\n10-year price increase: 41.4%\n\nOne factor affecting the cost of fresh fish is the rising cost of fishmeal, which has increased production costs for farmed seafood. Additionally, as the average consumer gets wealthier, demand for more expensive, high-end fish such as tuna and salmon increases, which pushes the price of fresh seafood higher overall.\n\n5. Bacon and related products\n\n10-year price increase: 41.6%\n\nThe increase in the price of bacon has largely been due to growing consumer demand and a massive pork supply shortage. The U.S. supply of frozen pork belly fell to just 14.0 million pounds in January 2017, a 70% decline from 10 years ago and the lowest point since 1957, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\n4. Prescription drugs\n\n10-year price increase: 43.9%\n\nDespite heavy competition, pharmaceutical companies have raised the prices of prescription drugs in recent years. The prices of four of the 10 most popular prescription drugs in the United States have more than doubled since 2011. Despite the rising costs, demand for drugs has continuously grown in recent years. The share of Americans using at least one prescription drug a month has risen over the past two decades and now sits at nearly half of all Americans, according to the CDC.\n\nMore:CVS launches prescription delivery nationwide\n\n3. Uncooked ground beef\n\n10-year price increase: 52.5%\n\nThe increase in the price of ground beef has largely been the result of a beef supply shortage in the United States brought on by years of drought in the top cattle-producing regions of the country, as well as rising feed and energy prices. As the average retail price of fresh beef rose from $3.63 per pound in January 2007 to $5.68 in December 2017, consumption also declined. Over roughly the same period, per-capita consumption of beef in the U.S. fell by 15%.\n\nMore:Making cheeseburgers at home will cost you, data shows\n\n2. Butter and margarine\n\n10-year price increase: 54.9%\n\nWhile shortages and rationing of butter in WWII led Americans to consume more margarine by the mid-1950s, butter eventually reclaimed its placed as the country’s most popular spread by 2010. The relatively recent rise in demand for butter may be partially due to research that has helped reduce the negative perception of saturated fats found in butter and other dairy products. While butter and margarine are considered substitute goods — the increased demand for one often coincides with a decline in demand for the other — the prices of both rose in the past decade. The price of butter increased 42.1%, while the price of margarine climbed 62.1% over the past 10 years — each faster than nearly any other grocery product.\n\n1. Tobacco and smoking products\n\n10-year price increase: 92.2%\n\nThe price of tobacco and smoking products in the U.S. nearly doubled in the past decade, rising by 92.2% from 2007 to 2017 — the largest increase of any grocery item in the country. The rise was largely due to a federal tax hike implemented on April 1, 2009 that increased the tax on cigarettes by 61.7 cents per pack. As a result, cigarette sales declined by 8.3% in 2009 alone — the largest decline in nearly 80 years.\n\nMore:Taxing oxygen? It could happen. President Trump threatens wide-ranging tariffs on China\n\nTo determine the groceries driving up food bills the most, 24/7 Wall Street analyzed changes in the consumer price index from January 2007 to December 2017 for over 300 goods using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. To avoid double counting, only food items at the finest level of detail within the CPI food product taxonomy were included on this list.

At the grocery store, however, the price of basic food items such as eggs, meat, and bread have all increased by at least 40% in recent years, despite tame national inflation.\n\nNationwide, food prices, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), increased 31.5% from 2005 through 2015, faster than general inflation over that period. The price of eggs more than doubled over the period reviewed, by far the largest increase of any grocery item. Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), 24/7 Wall St. examined consumer price changes from 2005 through 2015 for more than 300 goods and services. These are the grocery items driving up your bill the most.\n\nSickness and disease of livestock are the primary reasons for many food price increases. An avian flu outbreak in August 2015 forced farmers to kill millions of egg-laying chickens, contributing to the 110% increase in the price of eggs in the 11 years through 2015. Similarly, a porcine epidemic diarrhea virus swept through the hog industry in 2013 and 2014, killing millions of pigs. Perhaps as a consequence, prices of bacon and sausage increased by 34.5%, and hot dog prices rose by 43.5%.\n\nThe Best (and Worst) States for Business\n\nParticularly dry or extremely rainy seasons in food growing regions can also have a significant impact on consumer food prices. For example, grain such as wheat is highly susceptible to flooding that can occur in Plains states where most of the U.S. crop is grown.\n\nRising food prices not only increase Americans’ grocery bills, but also can impact restaurants, which could be forced to amend portion sizes or entire menus to stave off shrinking margins. Restaurants may even decide to fire workers, forcing some service industry workers to contend not only with higher food prices, but unemployment as well.\n\nTo determine the grocery items driving up your bill the most, 24/7 Wall St., reviewed consumer price indices from 2005 through 2015 for over 300 goods from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Definitions for each food category also came from the BLS.\n\nThese are the groceries driving up your bill the most.\n\n1. Eggs\n\nEggs had by far the largest increase in consumer prices from 2005 through 2015, with prices increasing more than 110%. Prices peaked in August 2015 after an avian flu outbreak forced farmers to kill millions of egg-laying chickens. Even before the outbreak, the price of eggs had increased more than any food item. Still, egg prices fell 13.8% from their August high.\n\nCities Where Crime Is Plummeting\n\n2. Tobacco and smoking products\n\nConsumer prices of tobacco and smoking products — including cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco and some e-cigarettes, among other products — have soared 92% from 2005 through 2015, nearly triple the average price increase of all grocery products. The largest price increase occurred in early 2009 when the federal tobacco tax increased by 62 cents to $1.01. Cigarette prices may rise even further. President Barack Obama has proposed an additional 94 cent tax increase, though it has not garnered much support.\n\n3. Margarine\n\nRising margarine prices have been largely driven by the supply and demand for butter, a close substitute. According to one estimate, an average American consumes nearly 6 pounds of butter each year, up from 5 pounds in 2010. International demand for butter and margarine has also grown as many developing countries expand their food service industry. Meanwhile, since the recession, many dairy farmers have gone out of business due to low milk prices and droughts in California. This has significantly restricted the supply of dairy products, causing a price increase in butter, which potentially forced would-be-butter-users towards margarine.\n\n4. Uncooked ground beef\n\nConsumer prices of uncooked ground beef increased by more than 65% from 2005 through 2015, more than double the increase in food prices generally. The price of all beef and veal products increased by 56.2% over the same period. Severe drought throughout the U.S. in 2012 led to a spike in corn prices, the primary feed grain of cows and other animals. This induced many cattle farmers to bring a larger share of their herd to market to avoid higher feeding costs and drove the total number of cattle in the country to 87.7 million, the lowest since 1951.\n\n5. Shelf stable fish and seafood\n\nLike many of the grocery items with rapidly increasing prices, both supply and demand factors have influenced the price of shelf stable fish and seafood, which includes canned fish. According to the USDA, certain fish species — such as tilapia, salmon, and many shellfish — face increased demand, particularly from China. As is the case in other food markets, rising feed costs have also contributed to the decline of fish populations such as tuna and shrimp.\n\nSee the rest of the top 20 here:\n\n20 Groceries Driving Up Your Bill The Most\n\n24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

They are goods and services that millions of Americans regularly depend upon in their daily lives.\n\n► Inflation surges to 39-year high:How much more are you paying and what's the damage for Biden?\n\n► Why is everything so expensive?:A quick look at what 1982-level Inflation means in 2021\n\nEspecially hard hit are lower-income households with little or no cash cushions. For them, the acceleration of consumer prices has negated any higher wages they may have received. The price surge has also complicated the Federal Reserve’s plans to reduce its aid for the economy and coincided with flagging public support for President Joe Biden, who has been taking steps to try to ease inflation pressures.\n\nWhat's causing inflation?\n\nFueling the jump in inflation has been a mix of factors resulting from the swift rebound from the pandemic recession: A flood of government stimulus, ultra-low rates engineered by the Fed and supply shortages at factories. Manufacturers have been slowed by heavier-than-expected customer demand, COVID-related shutdowns and overwhelmed ports and freight yards.\n\nEmployers, struggling with worker shortages, have also been raising pay, and many of them have boosted prices to offset their higher labor costs, thereby adding to inflation. The result has been price jumps for goods ranging from food and used vehicles to electronics, household furnishings and rental cars. The average price of a used vehicle rocketed nearly 28% from November 2020 to last month — to a record $29,011, according to data compiled by Edmunds.com.\n\nThe acceleration of prices, which began once the pandemic hit as Americans stuck at home flooded factories with orders for goods, has spread to services, from apartment rents and restaurant meals to medical services and entertainment. Even some retailers that built their businesses around the allure of ultra-low prices have begun boosting them.\n\n► What is driving US inflation:The reasons and solutions are complicated\n\n► Investing in inflation:1 key indicator and 3 simple steps to help position your portfolio\n\nOver the past 12 months, the costs paid by a typical American family have surged by roughly $4,000, according to calculations by Jason Furman, a Harvard economist and former Obama White House aide.\n\nThough Americans’ overall income has also increased since the pandemic, a new poll found that far more people are noticing higher inflation than higher wages. Two-thirds say their household costs have risen since the pandemic, compared with only about a quarter who say their incomes have increased, according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nAmerican consumers concerned about price hikes\n\nAmong them is Karyn Dixon, who received a raise this year that hasn’t come close to covering her higher expenses. Dixon, 55, works as a materials handler at a warehouse near her home not far from Knoxville, Tennessee.\n\nLike many companies in recent months, her employer raised workers’ pay – in her case by $1.75 an hour. Yet that’s hardly enough to keep pace with higher health insurance costs and costlier food and gas.\n\nPricier gas “puts a damper on things, especially when you live in a rural area,” Dixon said. “If we need anything important, we have to travel to the next town over, or Knoxville. Our options are limited.”\n\n“There really hasn’t been much of a benefit from it,” she said of the raise. “You make the extra money, but you turn around and have to pay more for food and gas, just so you can get to work.\n\n► How to combat higher prices:Inflation rate increase means groceries and Christmas gifts cost moreSUBHED\n\nJames Lawson, who runs a pastry business in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, says skyrocketing food prices have forced him to reduce the number of croissants and wedding cakes he makes. Prices for his basic ingredients have spiked an average of 25% in the past six months, and Lawson says he can pass only some of the additional costs on to his customers. His business is down 30% to 40% from a year ago.\n\n“It’s stressful,” Lawson said. “There are nights you don’t sleep. I think it’s going to get worse before it gets better.”\n\nLawson used to buy 100 pounds of Kerry Gold butter for $300 for his business. Now, he said, it costs him $450 to $475. And he feels he can’t raise prices for his desserts enough to make up for his own higher expenses. So he’s had to absorb much of the cost himself, which means cutting back on his own purchases of food and clothing.\n\n“Instead of buying a gallon, you buy a quart and see how long that lasts,” Lawson said. “And then you don’t spend as much on your food.”\n\nStew Leonard Jr., who is president and CEO of a family-owned supermarket chain based in Connecticut and New York founded by his father, said that by sharing his higher costs with his suppliers, he’s managing to avoid raising prices drastically on his customers.\n\n►CPI report released:Consumer prices jumped 6.8% in November, the fastest inflation spike since 1982\n\n“We are absorbing a lot of costs,” Leonard said. “We are trying to hold our prices low, and we will get through it and see where it goes. It’s a very erratic market right now.”\n\nHis chain is avoiding raising prices for such staples as milk, butter and eggs. But it’s charging more for more discretionary items like lobster and filet mignon. A pound of lobster has gone from $8 to $11.\n\nThough some of Leonard’s customers are still buying those pricier items, lower-income shoppers are trading down from beef to chicken and from blueberries to bananas.\n\nInflation lasting longer than expected\n\nOutside the U.S., too, surging inflation is squeezing households and businesses. In Europe, energy costs have driven up consumer prices to the highest level since the euro launched more than 20 years ago. Annual inflation in the 19 countries that use the euro hit 4.9% in November, according to the European Union’s statistics agency. Inflation has gone much higher in some other European countries, with Poland close to 8%, Lithuania above 9% and Turkey at an eye-popping 21%.\n\nFor American consumers, the 6.8% jump in inflation for the 12 months that ended in November was the largest year-over-year increase since a 7.1% surge for the year ending in June 1982. That spike occurred at a time when the Federal Reserve had driven up interest rates to double digits in its effort to stem runaway inflation triggered by the oil price shocks of the 1970s.\n\nThe persistence of high inflation has surprised the Fed, whose chair, Jerome Powell, had for months characterized inflation as only “transitory,” a short-term consequence of bottlenecked supply chains. Two weeks ago, though, Powell signaled a shift, implicitly acknowledging that high inflation has endured longer than he expected. He suggested that the Fed will likely act more quickly to phase out its ultra-low-rate policies than it had previously planned.\n\n►Profit during inflation?:These 5 tips could help investors beat rising prices\n\nDoing so would put the Fed on a path to begin raising its key short-term interest rate as early as the first half of next year. That rate has been pegged at nearly zero since March 2020, when the coronavirus sent the economy into a deep recession. Borrowing rates would rise for some consumer and business loans.\n\nFinancial markets, which had largely anticipated Friday’s inflation figures, took them in stride. Treasury yields and stock prices held relatively steady, while a measure of fear on Wall Street eased. Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise, said the market response suggests that investors have become accepting of the reality that the Fed will accelerate its pullback of the emergency economic aid it supplied after the pandemic.\n\nSpeaking at the White House, Biden said of the inflation report, “I think it’s the peak of the crisis, and I think you’ll see a change sooner and more rapidly than most people think” to more moderate price increases.\n\nD’Innocenzio reported from New York.

The special master will be Senior Judge Raymond Dearie , who was put forward as a possible candidate for the role by Trump, who had sued in court to obtain the review. The Justice Department also endorsed Dearie's appointment . US District Judge Aileen Cannon also rejected the DOJ's bid to resume its criminal investigation into classified documents seized at Mar-a-Lago last month. The denial sets the stage for the department's dispute with Trump over the search to move quickly to an appeals court and potentially the Supreme Court.\n\n2. Alaska storm\n\nAlaska is bracing for what has been described by forecasters as the strongest storm to impact the state in more than a decade.

The National Weather Service in Fairbanks urged coastal residents to complete preparations for the storm by this morning, as conditions will begin to rapidly deteriorate later today.

Izium was subject to intense Russian artillery attacks in April and was taken back by Ukrainian forces on Saturday, delivering a strategic blow to Russia's military assault in the east. Separately, the White House announced a $600 million security package for Ukraine on Thursday, providing its military with another round of assistance during its ongoing counteroffensive against Russia.\n\nJUST WATCHED New images show alleged mass burial site in Ukraine Replay More Videos ...

View more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nIt turns out Olympic gold medalist Eileen Gu and I have something in common. We were both athletes at University High School in San Francisco.\n\nShe is one of the best skiers in the world and I was the backup first baseman on the varsity baseball team, so the similarity only goes so far. I don’t follow sports other than baseball, so I learned of Gu only a few days ago when I saw a picture of her on our shared alma mater’s Instagram page bidding her “good luck as she represents China in her first Olympic Games.”\n\nLincoln Mitchell Courtesy Lincoln Mitchell\n\nVery shortly after that, I began seeing articles about the controversy surrounding Gu’s popularity and stature – that she is representing China in the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics but was born and raised in the United States.\n\nGiven the nature of the China-US relationship at the moment, Gu’s decision was bound to generate some version of this response. Some in the United States have further criticized her for refusing to discuss politics or to speak out against China’s human rights abuses.\n\nThe irony of that criticism should not be lost on even the casual sports fan – because whenever athletes in the United States speak up about racism or other American problems, they are told by a large segment of the sports world some variation of “stick to sports” or, if they are basketball players, “shut up and dribble.”\n\nEileen Gu is also not the first American to compete for another country. It is not uncommon for American athletes to represent countries to which they have a family connection or ancestral tie in international athletic competitions, including in the Olympics, the World Cup and even the World Baseball Classic.\n\nMany American-born athletes who compete for other nations do so because it gives them a greater opportunity to make it to competitions like the Olympics. And almost none of them draws attention in the United States the way Gu has. In Olympic competition, examples abound, going back decades, of athletes from all over the world competing for other countries – some after defecting to the United States from behind the Iron Curtain before its fall, others because their nations have been broken by war, some because they’ve married and emigrated elsewhere and still others because they’re looking for an easier path, competition-wise, to their Olympic berth.\n\nCompare Eileen Gu’s experience to that of Team Israel from the 2017 World Baseball Classic. The team was very good and managed to defeat the Netherlands, South Korea, Taiwan and even Cuba, but they did that with a roster made up almost entirely of Americans, most of whom were not quite good enough to make the US team.\n\nGu is different, athletically and otherwise. First of all, she is obviously good enough to ski for the American team, but she chose China. Nobody besides Gu can know for certain why she did this, but it is clear from her public comments that Gu identities strongly with both countries and both cultures.\n\n“I definitely feel as though I’m just as American as I am Chinese. I am American when I am in the US, I am Chinese when I am in China. I’ve been outspoken about my gratitude to both the US and China for making me the person I am,” she said Tuesday at a news conference after she won gold in the freestyle skiing big air competition. (It’s worth noting that she said this in response to a reporter’s question about whether she’s still a US citizen, a question she did not address directly.)\n\nGiven that she was brought up in the United States by a mother who raised Gu as a single parent after emigrating from China, that is not altogether surprising.\n\nMore striking than Gu’s decision to ski for China is the scrutiny it has gotten here in the United States. Taking into account the intensity of competition between the two powers and acknowledging the legitimacy of the criticism of China for human rights abuses, that level of focus still reveals more about many of the scrutinizers than Gu herself. In this regard, Gu has become something of a geopolitical Olympic Rorschach test.\n\nFor some, Gu is just a young woman caught between two countries making a difficult decision. For others, it is hard not to see the financial side of this. Gu’s success has already added to her considerable popularity in China. For example, in the hours after winning her first gold medal, Gu and her accomplishment were by far the most talked about topics on Chinese social media.\n\nCritics on social media and commentary pages have framed the decision to ski for China as Gu turning her back on the country that raised her and casting her lot with an authoritarian regime. Media outlets have portrayed her as a bratty Gen Zer who is oblivious to the world around her. She may be a little bit of all these things, but she is also not entirely any of them. And many of these opinions seem to be grounded in America’s frustration with an ascendant China relative to the United States – something for which Gu cannot blamed.\n\nJust as it is not possible to understand the contretemps around Gu outside of the current geopolitical climate, it is similarly impossible to disaggregate it from the current racial climate in the United States. Increased violence against Asian Americans in the past year or two is related to efforts to blame Covid-19 on China and increased tensions between the United States and China. Criticism of Gu occurs in this context as well (though of course, Gu made her decision to compete for China three years ago, so while the criticism of her lives in that context, none of it likely influenced her choices). Central to much of this is the notion that Gu is somehow ungrateful for what the United States has given her.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.

Maybe instead of getting angry at an 18-year-old, albeit one who graduated from a very fine high school, more people should look inward at what is motivating that anger.\n\nWhile so much of the discourse around Gu here in the United States focuses on the politics, her citizenship and what she should or should not be discussing, in China, a teenager is being appreciated for her extraordinary athletic accomplishment and is rapidly becoming one of the biggest sports stars in the country.

He hadn’t expected to make the finals of the Olympic trials for the Tokyo Games, nor had he envisaged earning a place on the Australian team off the back of two years of training.\n\n“I didn’t ease into it really, we weren’t cautious about trying to build up slowly,” Simpson tells CNN Sport. “My coach had me doing things that I definitely wasn’t ready to do at the times I was doing them, but I just loved that grind.\n\n“It put me on a trajectory of rapid improvement because I just had to learn how to deal with it – whether that was throwing up at least twice a week for the first six months, just adapting to what I was trying to put my body through.”\n\ngetty/leah abucayan cnn illustration\n\nEarning a place on the Australian team for the Paris Olympics has been Simpson’s goal ever since he returned to swimming, but right now, he is preparing to compete in his first international event at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England, with his 50-meter butterfly heats slated for Friday.\n\nThe brutal training schedule and hours spent staring at the bottom of a pool seem a far cry from Simpson’s life as a pop star, which began when he started covering songs and posting videos to YouTube as a 12-year-old.\n\n‘First love’\n\nAs his music began to gain traction and his online following grew, he was “given opportunities I couldn’t turn down” and within a year had relocated to the US with his family.\n\nSince then, he has recorded four studio albums, played in venues around the world, collaborated with the likes of Justin Bieber and Flo Rida, dated high-profile celebrities – including Miley Cyrus and Gigi Hadid – starred on Broadway, and appeared on TV shows Dancing with the Stars and The Masked Singer Australia.\n\nBut throughout that whirlwind time, Simpson’s desire to return to swimming never left him. He had competed at a high level as a junior in Australia and even started looking for squads to join when he first moved to the US.\n\n“I think because I left it in a good place in my mind, the desire to swim again never faded,” he says. “The fire stayed softly burning within me until I had to pick it up.”\n\nSimpson trains in Winter Park, Florida, last year. Eve Edelheit/The New York Times\n\nThe 25-year-old Simpson was born into a family of swimmers, with his parents, Brad and Angie, both competing for Australia. He jokes that he could swim before he could walk and always envisaged a career in the pool before his music career took off sooner than expected.\n\n“I think everybody in their life has that moment in which they realize they have an ability for something or an affinity for something that maybe they don’t have for other things,” says Simpson, “and for me, that was swimming.\n\n“It was my first love, the first thing I ever remember loving to do. And that hasn’t changed, I suppose, to this day.”\n\nREAD: Meet the Black women pushing for equality in swimming\n\n‘Scratch the itch’\n\nSimpson says his parents never pushed him to take up swimming, and admits his mom, having experienced first-hand the demanding nature of the sport, even tried to dissuade him from making a return in 2019.\n\nBut in the end, the pull of the pool proved too strong.\n\n“It was a matter of not wanting to deal with any what-ifs in my life and having no regrets,” says Simpson, “and sort of owing it to myself to try and fulfill that unfinished business I thought I had in the pool – that untapped or unrealized total potential I thought I had.\n\n“And just to scratch the itch, really – it was getting too much to bear … I knew that music would always be there for me, and I can tour and I can do all those things until I’m an old man, but you can only swim for a certain amount of years. I wanted to see what I could do.”\n\nAmong those who have supported Simpson since his return to the sport are Australian swimming legend Ian Thorpe and 23-time Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps.\n\nCody Simpson competes in a men's 100m butterfly heat at last year's Australian Olympic trials. Brenton Edwards/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“To have people like that in my corner and to be able to call or text them and ask for things or advice is very special,” says Simpson, “especially because these are the guys who I had on my wall and on my computer screensaver and things growing up – Ian being one of them and also Michael being another.”\n\nTo be able to turn to Phelps for advice brings Simpson’s swimming journey full circle: during his first trip to the US, he made his dad drive from New York to Baltimore to try and meet Phelps at North Baltimore Aquatic Club.\n\n“We went around the time we thought he might be training,” Simpson recalls, “and next thing you know, he shows up.\n\n“I made him sign like 20 swimming caps; my dad took a picture of us together and I met his coach. I ended up actually getting in and doing a few sessions with the junior squad.”\n\nSimpson’s late arrival to professional swimming makes him an anomaly in a sport where most elite athletes have been training and competing intensely from a young age. He hopes to show people that it’s possible to thrive in the pool having not trained rigorously throughout his teenage years.\n\nAnd with a combined 17.4 million followers across Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, it’s likely he’ll bring more attention to the sport as he documents his swimming career on social media.\n\nSimpson performs in New York's Times Square in December 2010. Neilson Barnard/WireImage/Getty Images\n\n“I’d love to inspire more kids to get into it and show that it’s cool,” says Simpson. “I love the sport, so if that’s all I ever do for swimming is try and bring some more eyeballs to it, then I feel like I’ve done part of my job because I love it and I want more people to love it.”\n\nSimpson is scheduled to compete in the 50m and 100m butterfly competitions at the Commonwealth Games; reaching the final of one of those events, he says, would be “pretty special.”\n\nFor now, his music career is on hold, but it continues to play an important part in his life. Late last year, he took advantage of a lighter training week to record his fourth studio album, “Cody Simpson,” which was released in April.\n\n“I play guitar all the time,” says Simpson, “it’s one of the things that is kind of cathartic at this point. It’s something I do to wind down and it’s really nice to have something I love like that outside of the pool.”\n\nHe plans to return to music full time when his love for swimming begins to wane – but not anytime soon.\n\n“I’ll continue to write and cultivate my guitar playing and all that stuff and definitely jump back into it after swimming,” says Simpson. “The forefront of my mind is on what I’m doing in the pool now.”", "authors": ["George Ramsay"], "publish_date": "2022/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/sport/russia-valieva-figure-skater-doping-scandal-spt-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Kamila Valieva, Russian figure skater, breaks into tears after taking ...", "text": "(CNN) Russian figure skating star Kamila Valieva broke into tears after she posted an impressive performance in the women's short skating program in her first appearance since the controversial doping ruling allowed her to continue competing at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games.\n\nThere was a slight stumble on her opening jump, a triple Axel, but she held it together well until the end to post the top score of the women's short program: 82.16. The result means she qualifies for Thursday's free skate medal event.\n\nThe crowd were audibly getting behind Valieva, perhaps more so than any other skater, according to CNN staff in the arena.\n\nAs soon as she finished, she broke into tears on the ice as the emotions of the past few days appeared to catch up with her.\n\nA lot on her shoulders\n\nWhen Valieva first skated onto the Olympic ice at Beijing's Capital Indoor Stadium on Tuesday, she was carrying more than the usual pressure of a top-ranked athlete hoping to make the best of less than three minutes on the ice.\n\nat the center of a doping scandal that has of the Russian athletic establishment, pressed sports organizations and athletes around the world to call for reform, and seen the International Olympic Committee (IOC) The 15-year-old isat the center of a doping scandal that has inflamed mistrust ofthe Russian athletic establishment, pressed sports organizations and athletes around the world to call for reform, and seen the International Olympic Committee (IOC) postpone medal ceremonies for any event that could place Valieva on the podium.\n\nOfficials are still investigating whether Valieva or her entourage broke anti-doping rules, after a test she took in December was found to be positive for a banned substance\n\ncan On Tuesday, an IOC official said Valieva is blaming the doping violation -- in which she tested positive for a heart medication that experts saycan improve stamina -- on contamination from her grandfather's medication. Her coach, Eteri Tutberidze, told Russian state news agency Tass they are \"absolutely sure\" she is innocent.\n\nDespite the drug controversy, a top sports court on Monday cleared Valieva to participate in the women's singles competition, one of the most high-profile events of the Winter Olympics and one the young skater sees as a chance for solo gold.\n\nValieva will compete amid \"extraordinary pressure,\" according to Peter Terry, a professor of psychology at the University of Southern Queensland, who has worked with Olympic athletes at nine previous Olympic Games.\n\n\"She'd have been trained in relaxation techniques, in mindfulness training -- that's fairly standard for elite athletes, and she would be trying to normalize things as much as possible,\" Terry said.\n\nHow Valieva holds up against that pressure will determine whether she can continue to compete in the free skate portion of the event, scheduled for Thursday. For those who skate in that second, longer program, the combined scores determine who wins.\n\nEven before the competition, the IOC changed the rules in case Valieva is ultimately disqualified -- 25 skaters will go through to the longer program on Thursday, one more than the usual 24.\n\nThe entourage\n\nValieva is not the only member of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) under pressure.\n\nHer entourage is also being investigated under suspicion that the teenager, if guilty of taking a banned substance, was not acting alone.\n\nAs a minor, Valieva has \"protected\" status and the specific provisions for evidence in such cases was one reason the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld a decision by Russia's Anti-Doping Agency to lift a suspension on Valieva, allowing her to skate.\n\nA number of sports officials and athletes around the world have condemned the CAS decision.\n\nThe head of the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee said the group was \"disappointed\" by the message it sends to the global sporting community. But many of the same voices have defended Valieva as a victim of systematic failure.\n\n\"It is clearly a wish and a decision of the IOC but also WADA to examine all aspects of this case, including the situation of the entourage because of course you can imagine a girl of 15 would not do something wrong alone -- so yes, the entourage will be investigated,\" Denis Oswald, the Chair of the IOC Disciplinary Commission told reporters Tuesday.\n\nThat entourage includes one of Russia's preeminent skating coaches, Tutberidze -- a former ice skater with a reputation for raising champions, including medalists at the past two Winter Olympic Games, but who has also faced questions about her extreme coaching tactics.\n\nTerry, the psychology professor, said, while he could not speculate about whether Valieva was innocent or guilty, it was \"hard to imagine any 15-year-old taking an illicit substance of their own volition.\"\n\n\"The (adults around her) have a solemn responsibility to put her wellbeing before results because she's a child in their care. Now, whether they do or not is uncertain,\" he said.\n\nBut others see the situation as stretching further than one athlete and coach, in light of Russia's recent history of systemic, state-sponsored doping.\n\nPast infringements have seen the country's athletes barred from international competitions . Since 2019, they've only been able to participate as neutrals in the Olympics due to a WADA ban set to expire at the end of this year.\n\nOn Tuesday, WADA's founding president Dick Pound called for a \"time out\" for Russia's participation in the Olympics.\n\n\"This is going on too long, and it's too obvious. Maybe, it's time for a time out for Russia in the Olympics,\" said Pound, who is a senior IOC member and former Canadian athlete.\n\nBut the IOC's Oswald said this case may be different.\n\n\"My impression from what I've seen and heard is that there is no connection with the institutionalized doping we had in Sochi, it seems to be a totally different case,\" he said Tuesday. \"But again, it is difficult to have an opinion without all the details.\"", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/16/sport/red-bull-plane-swap-skydiving-luke-andy-aikins-spt-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Red Bull Plane Swap: Skydiving from one plane to another -- at ...", "text": "San Luis Obispo, California (CNN) Sometimes, the most mundane sounding sentences presage something anything but ordinary: \"All right, seatbelt is on tight? Here we go,\" skydiver Luke Aikins smiles from the pilot's seat of his Cessna 182. \"Brake coming down. Power off. Autopilot engaged.\"\n\nThe plane slows abruptly, then pitches down, steeper, then steeper still, settling into the most precipitous of dives, pointed directly at the ocean below. To the left of us, the door of the little Cessna has been removed. The wind rages past as the Pacific coast pulls ever closer into view.\n\nAikins laughs as he counts the altimeter down, his hands fully off the yoke. \"It's doing it all by itself! 7,000 feet, 6,000 feet, 5,000 feet ... recovery.\" The Cessna's engine restarts, and it eases back to a horizontal position.\n\nCNN Sport is flying high above the Californian coast town of San Luis Obispo with world famous skydiver Luke Aikins. A veteran of some 21,000 jumps, Aikins has worked as a stuntman and consultant on Hollywood blockbusters and trained US Navy SEALs.\n\nHe has just given CNN a taste of one key element of a stunt that he and his cousin Andy Farrington will be attempting on April 24. Set to be broadcast live on Hulu, the Red Bull Plane Swap will be among the most ambitious skydiving stunts ever attempted.\n\nFor Luke Aikins, the stunt will be the realization of a childhood dream.\n\n'I'm going to skydive into his; he's going to skydive into mine'\n\n\"In a nutshell, I'm going to take one plane, my cousin Andy's going to take another one, and we're going to fly up to 14,000 feet in formation,\" the 48-year-old explains.\n\n\"I'm in one plane, he's in the other one, nobody else. We put the planes in a dive, straight at the ground, and then I'm going to get out of my plane, he's going to get out of his plane, and we're going to swap planes mid-flight.\n\n\"I'm going to skydive into his, he's going to skydive into mine, I'll bring his plane back to land and he's going to bring mine.\"\n\nThe stunt will be in a 1964 Cessna 182 -- a classic workhorse plane renowned for its tough practicality.\n\nIt all sounds so simple, but this most extreme of stunts has been decades in the making. For Aikins, it will also be the realization of a childhood dream.\n\n\"When I was 16 or 17, there was a parachutist magazine that came out, and there was a picture of an old Stearman biplane in a dive, with a big parachute behind it slowing it down, and a skydiver in a yellow jumpsuit flying with that airplane,\" he recalls.\n\n\"I was so inspired by it, I thought it was so cool -- I'm getting goosebumps just talking about it -- and I thought, 'Someday, I want to do that.'\"\n\nBut Aikins wasn't satisfied with just copying the wild feat. \"As I got older, I'm like, I don't want to do what somebody else has done, I want to take it to the next level and do something more impressive and better than what I saw.\"\n\nDream to reality\n\nDreaming of the stunt and doing it were, however, two different things. Aikins knew he needed engineering expertise to design it. \"This airplane weighs 2,000 pounds, if we just put this plane in a dive, normally, it would go so fast it would rip the wings off and the airplane would just disintegrate.\"\n\nThe answer to the conundrum came at a Red Bull Air Race. \"I got talking to somebody, and I was telling him about this project that I really wanted to do, and they said, 'Oh, you need to talk to Paulo.'\"\n\nPaulo is renowned Brazilian aeronautical engineer Paulo Iscold, who was already aware of Aikins' reputation following a previous stunt, where the skydiver had landed in a 100x100-foot net after jumping from 25,000 feet without a parachute.\n\n\"I was actually working for Kirby (Chambliss), another Red Bull athlete,\" Iscold explains. \"They went to a race, and they said, 'Hey, the guy who jumped without a parachute is here and is a Red Bull athlete.' And I said, 'Well, I want to meet that guy because he is really crazy and brave.'\n\nThe two hit it off immediately.\n\n\"I sat down with Paulo at the lunch table, and told him I really didn't want to use a drogue chute (a type of parachute), I wanted to do something that had never been done before,\" Aikins tells CNN. \"I wanted the plane to seem normal. He drew -- on a napkin -- this crazy speed brake system, just sketched on a napkin.\"\n\nNo answers written anywhere\n\nLuke Aikins and Andy Farrington practice for their Plane Swap\n\nIscold knew that the project would be far more complex than the sketch suggested.\n\n\"This was different to other projects that I did where you can go to the book and find the answers in the book -- this project had no answers written anywhere.\n\n\"To find the parts and put them together to be able to do it, that's what caught my attention, and that's why it was a big challenge for me as an engineer, to do something that nobody had done.\"\n\nInspired by their first meeting, Aikins immediately set to work too. \"I went home after meeting with Paulo and I bought an RC plane,\" he recalls.\n\n\"I took Paulo's design of the speed brake on the belly, and I made one on an RC plane and started flying it. These actuators would push this brake down, and I would dive the plane at the ground, and we'd measure the speed, then we'd put the brake up and measure the speed.\n\n\"Paulo did the math, with the weight of this and the weight of the real plane, and scaled it out.\"\n\nThe result was a giant 21 sq. ft. speed brake, which Iscold's team worked to attach to a 1964 Cessna 182 -- a classic workhorse plane renowned for its tough practicality.\n\nIn the hanger where the Cessna is being prepared, Iscold walks CNN through the bizarre looking brake.\n\n\"It's composed of carbon fiber plates, which when deployed produce a lot of drag. The plates have holes in them: this is just an aerodynamic trick to reduce vibration.\"\n\n\"But the biggest problem that we had to solve was how to attach this to the airplane because this needs to carry pretty much the weight of the airplane. The landing gear is designed to take the weight of the airplane, so why not put the speed brake on the landing gear structure?\"\n\nThe Cessna is also filled with sensors and a complex vector navigation system, which enables Iscold to track and monitor every aspect of its flight -- crucial given that it will be flying without a pilot during the stunt.\n\nThe latest in a long line of skydivers and pilots, Aikins grew up around the sport.\n\n'Jumping out isn't the hard part'\n\nOnce Aikins and his cousin leave their planes, however, the rest is entirely down to their skill as skydivers.\n\n\"Jumping out isn't the hard part, the hard part is getting back in,\" Aikins explains. \"We'll fly in, chest to the ground, up to the plane, we'll grab the wing strut, and then we kind of walk our way right into the airplane.\n\n\"As soon as your body gets halfway into the door, there's no wind, it's all fine. You'll be able to flip the switches and recover the airplane, restart the engine, pull the speed brake up and bring it back around.\"\n\nThe latest in a long line of skydivers and pilots, Aikins grew up around the sport.\n\n\"My Dad learned to fly when he was 13, flying for my grandpa, skydiving for my grandpa,\" he says. \"My Dad flew C-130s in the Navy, we lived in Guam and Japan and kind of grew up all around the world like that. (He) taught us how to fly -- my brothers, my sister -- I have two brothers and a sister that have a pilots' license.\"\n\nAs a husband, and the father of a 10-year-old son, Aikins doesn't shirk from the fact that the life he has chosen is a dangerous one, a point underlined by the fact that his father lost his life in a plane crash in 2017.\n\n\"My wife and I we have all these conversations,\" he admits. \"We've talked about what happens if I die, what happens if this happens and, you know, we have all those hard talks, so I think that you have to have a partner, I mean, my wife goes into this with her eyes open.\"\n\n'I need to worry'\n\nIscold says part of his job is to worry. \"As the engineer, I need to worry about everything, that's how we make it safe.

At the same time, the athlete repeatedly passed doping tests before and after December 25, 2021, including while already in Beijing during the figure skating tournament.

It is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) banned list.\n\nHormone and metabolic modulators are a class of drugs banned by WADA due to evidence of athletes using them for performance enhancement, as they can increase blood flow and improve endurance.\n\nValieva was immediately given a provisional suspension by Russia's anti-doping agency, which automatically prohibits athletes from participation in all sports.\n\nThe figure skater challenged the suspension on February 9 and, at a hearing that same day, the Russian anti-doping agency decided to lift the provisional ban -- allowing her to continue competing at the Olympics, according to the ITA.\n\nAt 15, Valieva is a minor and therefore considered a \"Protected Person\" under the World Anti-Doping Code, which means her name does not need to be disclosed to the public.\n\nThe ITA said it released her identity following media reports naming her based on \"unofficial information,\" and the ITA said it \"acknowledges the necessity for official information due to heightened public interest.\"\n\nValieva of Team ROC skates during the women single skating free skating team event on day three of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games at Capital Indoor Stadium on February 07, 2022 in Beijing, China.\n\nIOC 'looking at the entourage'\n\nRussian athletes are unable to compete in the Olympics under their country's name due to sanctions from the IOC and WADA as a result of the country's \"systemic manipulation\" of anti-doping rules during the 2014 Sochi Games.\n\nSpeaking to journalists Friday, IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said the governing body wanted to \"expedite\" the case.\n\n\"We hope that the whole issue can be expedited in the interest of every athlete, not just the Russians, but also in the interest of all of the athletes competing,\" he said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Nathan Chen credits iconic figure skater for inspiration after winning gold Replay More Videos ...

His latest book is “The Fastest Game in the World: Hockey and the Globalization of Sports.” His next book is a history of the referee in world sports. The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nIn his address to members of the International Olympic Committee before the Beijing Winter Games, IOC President Thomas Bach asserted that the mission of the Olympics was to bring the world together in peaceful competition. “We can only accomplish this mission,” Bach stated, “if the Olympic Games stand above and beyond all political differences.”\n\nMarta Berglund\n\nMere weeks later, Bach’s statement already sounds like the last gasp of an outmoded ideal. For many years, the IOC and other governing bodies of world sport have insisted their competitions remain separate from international politics. But in many cases, this supposed neutrality ended up serving the interests of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who has used sports to solidify his position at home and present himself as a respectable world leader, even while attacking Russia’s neighbors.\n\nOnly now, in the aftermath of Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, are international sports organizations breaking ties with Putin’s Russia. Athletes from Russia will pay the price, but the steps are necessary to take away one of Putin’s most reliable political tools and further isolate him internationally.\n\nA number of world sports organizations have pulled events from the country or severed ties with Russian entities. The European soccer federation, UEFA, moved this year’s Champions League final from St. Petersburg to Paris, while Formula One canceled the Russian Grand Prix scheduled for late September. Other governing bodies, leagues and clubs followed suit. On Monday, UEFA and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) took the extraordinary step of barring the Russian national soccer team from the qualifying tournament for the 2022 World Cup.\n\nEven the IOC has changed course and joined the actions against Russia. On the day of the invasion, Bach condemned Russia’s “breach of the Olympic Truce,” a consensus resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in December 2021, which started seven days before the Beijing Winter Olympics and lasts until seven days after the Paralympics. On Monday, the IOC went further, recommending all sports federations ban Russian and Belarusian athletes (because of their country’s crucial enabling of Putin’s aggression) from competing in events.\n\nWhile the international governing bodies of various sports are now positioning themselves as taking the principled lead, many of the steps against Russia have come in response to outrage from within their sports.\n\nIn the case of soccer, the Polish, Swedish and Czech football federations refused to play Russia in the World Cup qualifying tournament. National team members were involved in each federation’s decision not to play, and some players publicly stated their support. “It is the right decision!” tweeted Robert Lewandowski, the Polish team’s top scorer.\n\nOther European federations joined the Poles, Swedes and Czechs in rejecting FIFA’s initial attempt to strike a compromise by allowing Russians to play as the “Russian Football Union,” without association to the country’s flag or anthem. Facing significant pushback, FIFA and UEFA then instituted a complete ban on Russia’s participation.\n\nIn hockey as well, Hall of Famers Wayne Gretzky and Dominik Hasek called for Russian players to be excluded from contests in North America. Gretzky said Russia should be banned from the world junior men’s championship, while Hasek, who grew up in Czechoslovakia when the country was occupied by Soviet troops, demanded that the NHL remove Russian players from its rosters. “The NHL must immediately suspend contracts for all Russian players!” he tweeted.\n\nThe athletes who have spoken out insist a ban against Russian participation in world sports is a necessary step. Having competed on the world stage, they understand that athletes inevitably serve as ambassadors of their nations. “Every athlete represents not only himself and his club, but also his country and its values and actions,” tweeted Hasek. Allowing Russian athletes to participate in sports can advance the image Putin wants to project to the world – all while Russian soldiers are striking Ukrainian civilians. It’s simply not acceptable.\n\nFrom a political standpoint, removing Russia from international sports is part of the broader strategy of isolating Russia from international finance, trade and travel. And it prevents Putin from using one of his most effective tools.\n\nSince he rose to power, Putin has used international sports events to restore his country’s global standing in the wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse. He played a direct role in lobbying members of the IOC and FIFA so Russia could host the Winter Olympics in 2014 and the Men’s World Cup in 2018. These successful bids were heralded as proof of Russia’s return to the top rank of advanced nations. “The decision shows that Russia is trusted,” Putin said in 2010 when FIFA announced his country would host the World Cup.\n\nInternational events enabled Putin to “sportswash” his government’s military aggression. In August 2008, Russia invaded neighboring Georgia on the same day Putin was in Beijing for the opening ceremonies of the Summer Olympics. In 2014, Russian troops began moving into Crimea on the final day of the Winter Games, and the crisis in that region escalated against the backdrop of the Winter Paralympics in Sochi.\n\nThe supposedly apolitical environment of the Olympics provided a shield against any criticism of these actions. “The Games are supposed to be outside politics,” said Aleksandr Zhukov, former head of the Russian Olympic Committee, when asked before the 2014 Sochi Games about Putin’s actions. “Those who try to pin some political tails on them are just being undignified.”\n\nLeaders of world sports organizations turned a blind eye and deflected questions. When FIFA President Sepp Blatter met Putin in Sochi in April 2015, Russian troops were occupying the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. “Some people are wanting the World Cup to be taken away from Russia,” Blatter said, “but we will give one answer to this – we are involved in football and we will not allow politics to get in the way.”\n\nBy summer 2018, when the World Cup opened in Russia, an international investigation had found Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine by a missile launcher from a unit of the Russian armed forces, causing the deaths of 298 people. And three months before the tournament’s start, more than 20 countries expelled over 100 Russian diplomats after a former Russian spy living in Britain was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok.\n\nAt the time FIFA President Gianni Infantino glossed over these incidents, saying, “There are many injustices in the world.” And instead of calling Putin out, Infantino declared, “This country, Russia, has changed … Everyone has discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, full of people who are keen to show to the world that what maybe is sometimes said is not what happens here.”\n\nAfter having been played for years by the Russian leader, the world’s “sportocrats” now look like stooges. Their insistence on the separation of sports and politics rings hollow.\n\nBy contrast, it’s the athletes who have stepped forward to assert that political events do matter in sports. Many of them acknowledge that banning Russian athletes is unfortunate. Still, action is necessary. “Russian footballers and fans are not responsible for this,” tweeted Lewandowski, “but we can’t pretend that nothing is happening.”\n\nThe athletes also remind us that sports have to be viewed in proper perspective. It seems the heads of international sporting organizations often have a single-minded view of their mission. They deflect any challenge to the prestige and profits their tournaments generate, and they cooperate with any world leader willing to advance their sports, no matter how odious that leader’s actions might be. In their calls to exclude Russia from international sports, athletes are rightfully pointing out that games cannot be sealed off and viewed in a vacuum, divorced from world events. It’s not possible to watch Russian troops shelling Ukrainian cities and then allow Russian athletes to represent their country in a soccer or hockey match.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nMany fans likewise see sports as a self-contained space, separate from the concerns of life. To them, sports are an escape – a form of entertainment – and it serves no purpose to mix them with politics. We see this view among hockey fans, angry that Hasek would demand the suspension of Russian NHL players.\n\nBut athletes like Hasek, who are calling for bans against Russia, argue that we have to view sports in a broader context – one that acknowledges the world’s outrage over events in Ukraine. “It is not an easy decision,” tweeted members of the Polish national team after deciding not to play Russia, “but there are more important things in life than football.”", "authors": ["Bruce Berglund"], "publish_date": "2022/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/europe/brittney-griner-trial/index.html", "title": "Brittney Griner: WNBA star sentenced to 9 years in Russian jail for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAmerican women’s basketball star Brittney Griner was convicted of deliberately smuggling drugs into Russia and sentenced to nine years of jail time Thursday in a case that has raised concerns she is being used as a political pawn in Russia’s war against Ukraine.\n\nJudge Anna Sotnikova of the Khimki city court delivered the sentence and fined Griner 1 million rubles, or about $16,400. She said the court took into account Griner’s partial admission of guilt, remorse for the deed, state of health and charitable activities. Prosecutors had asked that she be sentenced to 9.5 years in jail.\n\nPrior to the verdict, Griner apologized to the court and asked for leniency in an emotional speech.\n\n“I never meant to hurt anybody, I never meant to put in jeopardy the Russian population, I never meant to break any laws here,” Griner said. “I made an honest mistake and I hope that in your ruling that it doesn’t end my life here. I know everybody keeps talking about political pawn and politics, but I hope that, that is far from this courtroom.\n\n“I want to say again that I had no intent on breaking any Russian laws. I had no intent. I did not conspire or plan to commit this crime,” she added.\n\nAfter the sentence, Griner told a CNN producer as she left court, “I love my family.”\n\nThe verdict comes about six months after the 31-year-old was arrested at a Moscow airport and accused by Russian prosecutors of trying to smuggle less than 1 gram of cannabis oil in her luggage. The two-time US Olympic basketball gold medalist pleaded guilty to drug charges last month and said she accidentally packed the drugs while in a hurry.\n\nGriner’s lawyers, Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov, said in a written statement they will appeal the decision and criticized the court for ignoring their evidence. They have 10 days to appeal.\n\n“We are very disappointed by the verdict. As legal professionals, we believe that the court should be fair to everyone regardless of nationality. The court completely ignored all the evidence of the defense, and most importantly, the guilty plea,” they said in the statement. “This contradicts the existing legal practice. Taking into account the amount of the substance (not to mention the defects of the expertise) and the plea, the verdict is absolutely unreasonable. We will certainly file an appeal.”\n\nSpeaking outside court, Boykov said that the average time in jail for this type of crime is five years, adding that almost a third of those convicted get parole.\n\nGriner “is not doing fine today,” said Blagovolina, a partner at Rybalkin, Gortsunyan, Dyakin and Partners law firm. The defense team is hopeful that Griner will be able to talk to her family next week. Blagovolina added that Griner will return to the detention center where she is being held.\n\nSentence comes amid tense US-Russia relations\n\nPhotos: WNBA Star Brittney Griner Ned Dishman/NBAE/Getty Images Brittney Griner of Team USA looks on during the game against the Team Australia during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics on August 4, 2021.

Prev Next\n\nThe harsh sentence comes amid the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the country’s saber-rattling with the US and Europe. The US State Department maintains Griner is wrongfully detained, and US officials have offered a potential prisoner swap with Russia in an attempt to bring her home safely.\n\nCharge d’Affaires of the US Embassy in Russia, Elizabeth Rood, said the sentence was a “miscarriage of justice,” and US President Joe Biden said the lengthy sentence was “unacceptable.”\n\n“Today, American citizen Brittney Griner received a prison sentence that is one more reminder of what the world already knew: Russia is wrongfully detaining Brittney. It’s unacceptable, and I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends, and teammates,” Biden said in a statement.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken criticized the Russian legal system more broadly, saying the sentence “puts a spotlight on our significant concerns with Russia’s legal system and the Russian government’s use of wrongful detentions to advance its own agenda, using individuals as political pawns.”\n\nHe said the US is working to bring home Griner and Paul Whelan, an American citizen who has been held by Russia for alleged espionage since 2018. “This is an absolute priority of mine and the Department’s,” Blinken said.\n\nIt’s now “up to the Russian side” on whether Griner’s conviction opens new doors for negotiations of a prisoner swap, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said.\n\n“We’re still open to having our proposal seriously and positively considered, and if on the Russian side that means they feel like they’re more empowered to do that, then so be it,” Kirby told reporters in Thursday’s White House briefing.\n\nKirby reiterated the US position remains that it wants Russia to “take the deal on the table because it’s a good one, it’s a fair one, and it’ll help bring Paul and Brittney home.”\n\nCNN National Security Analyst Steve Hall said the harsh sentence was not a surprise and argued that Russia’s court proceedings are not legitimate.\n\n“This is all performance in Russia. There was never any doubt as to what was going to happen,” he said. “What Vladimir Putin is trying to do is basically drive up the bargaining price of Ms. Griner.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 02:21 - Source: CNN WNBA star's lawyers: cannabis was prescribed\n\nLast week, CNN reported that the Biden administration proposed a prisoner swap with Russia, offering to release a convicted Russian arms trafficker, Viktor Bout, in exchange for Griner and Whelan. Russian officials countered the US offer, multiple sources familiar with the discussions have said, but US officials did not accept the request as a legitimate counteroffer.\n\nThe Kremlin warned Tuesday that US “megaphone diplomacy” will not help negotiations for a prisoner exchange involving Griner. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow believes these talks should be “discrete.”\n\nGriner’s WNBA team, the Phoenix Mercury, played the Connecticut Sun on Thursday night. Before the game, the teams held a 42-second moment of silence as players linked arms. Near the end of the tribute, spectators started chanting, “Bring her home! Bring her home!” Griner, a six-time WNBA all-star, wears No. 42 for the Mercury.\n\nThe Mercury lost 77-64. Point guard Skylar Diggins-Smith, wearing a “We Are BG” T-shirt, said after the game the verdict was devastating.\n\n“Nobody wanted to even play today,” she told reporters. “How are you supposed to approach the game, approach the court and with a clear mind, and our whole group is crying before the game? Because you try to honor her and you try to come out and still play hard for her.”\n\nEarlier, the Mercury released a statement calling the verdict “a sobering milestone in the 168-day nightmare” of her detention.\n\n“We are inspired every day by BG’s strength and we are steadfastly committed to keeping her top-of-mind publicly until she is safely back on American soil. We will not allow her to be forgotten. We are BG,” the statement reads.\n\nHead coach Vanessa Nygaard told CNN the guilty verdict and Griner’s sentence is “unacceptable.”\n\n“It’s just heartbreaking,” the coach said. “To hear her words and her apologies. Just trying to send love, prayers and strength to her.”\n\nIn a joint statement, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver criticized the verdict and sentence as “unjustified and unfortunate, but not unexpected.”\n\n“The WNBA and NBA’s commitment to her safe return has not wavered and it is our hope that we are near the end of this process of finally bringing BG home to the United States,” they said.\n\nDefense asked for leniency in closing arguments\n\nThe court hearing Thursday began shortly after Griner arrived in handcuffs, escorted by Russian officers into the defendant’s cage. Once uncuffed, she spoke with her legal team and then held up a photo of the UMMC Ekaterinburg basketball team, the Russian squad she played for during the WNBA offseason.\n\nIn closing arguments, Blagovolina argued that Griner never used marijuana in Russia and that she never had the intention of doing so. She had no need to bring the vape cartridges to Russia, the lawyer added. All this confirms the complete absence of intent in her actions, Blagovolina argued.\n\nEven if Griner ever used medical marijuana, it was only at home back in Arizona, rare and only with a doctor’s prescription, she added. She couldn’t have known how strict the laws were in Russia, Blagovolina said.\n\nBoykov also argued Griner had no opportunity to properly examine the court documents. He said that the Russian constitution guarantees everyone the right to use their native language and the free choice of the language of communication.\n\nBoykov cited an instance when a language interpreter provided to Griner flipped through a lengthy document offered by an investigator for translation and then told Griner, “Basically, it means that you are guilty.”\n\nThroughout the trial, Griner’s attorneys have laid out arguments undermining the prosecution’s case and claiming her detention was not handled correctly after she was stopped February 17 by personnel at the Sheremetyevo International Airport.\n\nHer detention, search and arrest were “improper,” Boykov said last week, noting more details would be revealed during closing arguments.\n\nAfter she was stopped in the airport, Griner was made to sign documents that she did not fully understand, she testified. At first, she said, she was using Google translate on her phone but was later moved to another room where her phone was taken and she was made to sign more documents.\n\nNo lawyer was present, Griner testified, and her rights were not explained to her. Those rights would include access to an attorney once she was detained and the right to know what she was suspected of.

He was 91.\n\nSwiss news agency ATS quoted Godard’s partner, Anne-Marie Mieville, and her producers as saying he died peacefully and surrounded by his loved ones at his home in the Swiss town of Rolle, on Lake Geneva, on Tuesday.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to Godard as “the most iconoclastic of the New Wave directors” who “invented a resolutely modern, intensely free art form.”\n\nHe added: “We have lost a national treasure, the eye of a genius.”\n\nAnna Karina:Star of French New Wave film and muse of Jean-Luc Godard dies at 79\n\nGodard defied convention over a long career that began in the 1950s as a film critic. He rewrote rules for camera, sound and narrative.\n\nHis films propelled Jean-Paul Belmondo to stardom and his controversial modern nativity play “Hail Mary” grabbed headlines when Pope John Paul II denounced it in 1985.\n\nBut Godard also made a string of films, often politically charged and experimental, which pleased few outside a small circle of fans and frustrated many critics through their purported overblown intellectualism.\n\nCannes Film Festival Director Thierry Fremaux told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he was “sad, sad. Immensely so” at the news of Godard’s death.\n\nBorn into a wealthy French-Swiss family on Dec. 3, 1930 in Paris, Godard grew up in Nyon, Switzerland, studied ethnology at the Sorbonne in France’s capital, where he was increasingly drawn to the cultural scene that flourished in the Latin Quarter “cine-club” after World War II.\n\nHe became friends with future big-name directors Francois Truffaut, Jacques Rivette and Eric Rohmer and in 1950 founded the shortlived Gazette du Cinema. By 1952 he had begun writing for the prestigious movie magazine Cahiers du Cinema.\n\nAfter working on two films by Rivette and Rohmer in 1951, Godard tried to direct his first movie while traveling through North and South America with his father, but never finished it.\n\nJean-Paul Belmondo dies:'Breathless' star, French leading man was 88\n\nBack in Europe, he took a job in Switzerland as a construction worker on a dam project. He used the pay to finance his first complete film, the 1954 “Operation Concrete,” a 20-minute documentary about the building of the dam.\n\nReturning to Paris, Godard worked as spokesman for an artists’ agency and made his first feature in 1957 — “All Boys Are Called Patrick,” released in 1959 — and continued to hone his writing.\n\nHe also began work on “Breathless,” based on a story by Truffaut. It was to be Godard’s first big success when it was released in March 1960.\n\nThe movie stars Belmondo as a penniless young thief who models himself on Hollywood movie gangsters and who, after he shoots a police officer, goes on the run to Italy with his American girlfriend, played by Jean Seberg.\n\nLike Truffaut’s The 400 Blows, released in 1959, Godard’s film set the new tone for French movie aesthetics. Godard rejected conventional narrative style and instead used frequent jump-cuts that mingled philosophical discussions with action scenes.\n\nHe spiced it all up with references to Hollywood gangster movies, and nods to literature and visual art.\n\nThe 7 best (and worst) Oscar moments:Including Will Smith slapping Chris Rock, Beyoncé's 'Be Alive'\n\nGodard also launched what was to be a career-long participation in collective film projects, contributing scenes to “The Seven Deadly Sins” along with directors such as Claude Chabrol and Roger Vadim. He also worked with Ugo Gregoretti, Pier Paolo Pasolini and Roberto Rossellini on the Italian movie “Let’s Have a Brainwash,” with Godard’s scenes portraying a disturbing post-apocalypse world.\n\nGodard, who was later to gain a reputation for his uncompromising left-wing political views, had a brush with French authorities in 1960 when he made “The Little Soldier.” The movie, filled with references to France’s colonial war in Algeria, was not released until 1963, a year after the conflict ended.\n\nHis work turned more starkly political by the late 1960s. In “Week End,” his characters lampoon the hypocrisy of bourgeois society even as they demonstrate the comic futility of violent class war. It came out a year before popular anger at the establishment shook France, culminating in the iconic but short-lived student unrests of May 1968.\n\nGodard harbored a life-long sympathy for various forms of socialism depicted in films ranging from the early 1970s to early 1990s. In December 2007 he was honored by the European Film Academy with a lifetime achievement award.\n\nGodard took potshots at Hollywood over the years.\n\nHe remained home in Switzerland rather than travel to Hollywood to receive an honorary Oscar at a private ceremony in November 2010 alongside film historian and preservationist Kevin Brownlow, director-producer Francis Ford Coppola and actor Eli Wallach.\n\nHis lifelong advocacy of the Palestinian cause also brought him repeated accusations of antisemitism, despite his insistence that he sympathized with the Jewish people and their plight in Nazi-occupied Europe.\n\n'Don't believe any of that!':Steven Spielberg says 'The Fabelmans' isn't his swan song\n\nThough the academy received some complaints about Godard being selected to receive the award, academy President Tom Sherak said the director was recognized solely “for his contributions to film in the New Wave era.”\n\nIn 2010, Godard released “Film Socialisme,” a film in three chapters first shown at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nGodard married Danish-born model and actress Anna Karina in 1961. She appeared in a string of movies he made during the remainder of the 1960s, all of them seen as New Wave landmarks. Notable among them were “My Life to Live,” “Alphaville” and “Crazy Pete,” — which also starred Belmondo and was rumored to have been shot without a script. They divorced in 1965.\n\nGodard married his second wife, Anne Wiazemsky, in 1967. He later started a relationship with Swiss filmmaker Anne-Marie Miéville. Godard divorced Wiazemsky in 1979, after he had moved in with Miéville to the Swiss municipality of Rolle, where he lived with her for the rest of his life.\n\nContributing: Thomas Adamson, John Heilprin, The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}]}

Recipients will receive an alert that the original message was edited or deleted, and it only works if both parties are running iOS 16. Apple previously said this was among the most requested features among users.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest change is the interactive lock screen. It now features custom fonts, new photo effects, personalized wallpapers and widgets that add information at a glance.

Other rumors point to new TV OS features, which could tie into the smart home; an upgrade to Apple Watch OS that would boost the battery life; and a new MacBook Air.\n\nSome analysts arealso holding out hope thatcould offer an early look at a platform thought to be called RealityOS.The system could power the mixed reality headset — a wearable device that's said to be capable of both virtual and augmented reality — which Apple has been rumored to be working on for years.\n\nDaniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, has taken to calling the rumored hardware product \"Apple Glasses,\" in an apparent nod to Google's early and failed foray into smart glasses. In an investor note this week, Ives said he expects Apple to \"hit on a number of AR/VR technologies to developers that the company plans to introduce.\"\n\n\"Ultimately this strategy is laying the breadcrumbs to the highly anticipated AR headset Apple Glasses set to make its debut likely before holiday season or latest early 2023,\" he said.\n\nCook has long been vocal about Apple's vision to dive deeper into AR, calling it \"the next big thing\" and \"a critically important part of Apple's future.\" Whether this is the year Apple finally shows its cards for that future, however, is anyone's guess.\n\nApple's event will be livestreamed on its website, YouTube and other social media platforms. It is set to start at 10:00 a.m. PT/1:00 p.m. ET. Here's a closer look at what to expect:\n\nThe iPhone lock screen gets a refresh\n\niOS 16 features aren't expected to be game changers, but a few additions could breathe new life into the user experience. Similar to last year iOS 16 features aren't expected to be game changers, but a few additions could breathe new life into the userexperience.\n\nApple is expected to make messages more social and interactive and to rework the notification system and lock screen with a greater focus on widgets, according to Bloomberg\n\nRamon Llamas, research director at IDC Research, said Apple could create a valuable opportunity for developers by rethinking the real estate on the lockscreen to move away from static notifications of texts and emails and toward interactive experiences like schedules, weather and news.\n\n\"Think of all the things and widgets you could see just at a glance without having to open your iPhone,\" Llamas said. \"Now tie them to your homescreen. It's a part of the iPhone experience that has been mostly the same and would benefit from a refresh.\"\n\nUpdates to iPad and Mac software\n\nmore like a laptop and less like a phone. With iPadOS, meanwhile, Apple is expected to double down on multitasking features to play up its powerful in-house M1 processor. According to Bloomberg , the update could make the iPad feelmore like a laptopand less like a phone.\n\nApple is also expected to unveil its latest Mac OS, with the rumored name Mac Mammoth. It could offer refreshes to apps such as Mail, Notes and Safari, and similar social functionality in Messages to what's rumored to be coming to iPhones.\n\nApple may add home automation improvements to both its HomePod speaker and Apple TV, as well as its broader HomeKit ecosystem. It's also possible Apple could announce a refresh to Apple Watch OS, with the promise of new health features, workouts and watch faces.\n\nHardware improvements\n\nIf Apple's prior developer conferences are any indication, it's unlikely the company will unveil any major new hardware products at the event this year. But it's possible Apple could shine a spotlight on its next-generation M2 chip and discuss some developer opportunities around it. For example, Apple could unveil a new MacBook Air by showing what the system would be capable of with its latest in-house processor.\n\n\"Usually, new hardware comes out later in the year, so don't be disappointed if you don't see something,\" Llamas said. \"But even if Apple does, I think the bigger news is not the hardware itself, but Apple's own silicon that powers them.\"\n\nA look at the future of AR/VR\n\nThe big wild card at WWDC is whether Apple makes a splashy announcement around augmented reality or focuses on more incremental updates.\n\nRather than unveiling a mixed reality headset now, Apple may outline how developers could use its existing ARKit platform and its programming language, Swift, to create content for AR and VR broadly. (Apple's tagline for the event is \"Swiftly approaching.\" The company often hides clues in images and taglines of its events' invites.)\n\n\"It's quite possible the company will tease new AR/VR features without outright revealing a new device,\" said Eric Abbruzzese, research director at ABI Research. But, as he notes, it would be unusual for Apple to reveal a new software system for a hardware line it has yet to unveil.\n\n\"It'd be like revealing iOS before the iPhone was revealed,\" Abbruzzese added.\n\nWhile it's unclear if Apple will be laying the framework for a bigger push around AR/VR hardware in the pipeline, it's quite likely Apple executives will dedicate a good portion of its keynote presentation to software around those technologies.\n\n\"Apple's been building ARKit on the mobile device side for years,\" Abbruzzese said. \"Much of that will absolutely translate to their headsets.\"", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/06/tech/apple-wwdc-2022/index.html", "title": "Apple WWDC 2022: Revamped lock screen and big changes to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nApple kicked off its annual developer conference by unveiling its next-generation mobile software, iOS 16, with new features that will let users personalize their iPhone lock screens, change how they text friends through iMessage and deepen how its smartphones integrate with cars.\n\nThese and other updates, which were unveiled at its Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, show how Apple continues to push to ensure its devices – the iPhone in particular – remain central to our daily lives and the many products we interact with. But while these updates will likely appeal to many Apple device users, the event was also notable for what was not announced: a new product.\n\nIn recent days, some industry watchers had held out hope that Apple could offer an early look at a platform thought to be called RealityOS. The system, according to rumors, could power a mixed reality headset – a wearable device that’s said to be capable of both VR and AR – which Apple has been rumored to be working on for years.\n\nInstead, the focus was on a number of functional, if not sexy, product updates: more multi-tasking features on Mac software, the introduction of Apple’s Weather app on iPad and the unveiling of the company’s next-generation M2 chip.\n\n“While some may be disappointed at the lack of radical new hardware in areas such as AR, Apple’s investment in silicon will play a defining role in future product categories, such as a head-worn device, where power and performance must be finely balanced,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at market research firm CCS Insight.\n\nHere’s a closer look at some of the updates coming to Apple’s most important products. The updates are expected to be available to users in the fall.\n\nRevamping iMessage, the lock screen and notifications\n\nApple is breathing new life into some iOS tools that haven’t been updated in years.\n\nPerhaps the buzziest changes are coming to iMessage, including the ability to edit or unsend messages and to mark messages as unread. The company said these options are among the most requested features from users.\n\niOS 16 new lock screen Apple\n\nApple also teased several new options to better customize the lock screen and improve the notifications experience. iPhone users will be able to add widgets on the lock screen to get information at a glance, such as upcoming calendar events and the weather, and track “live” activities, including an Uber ride’s progress or updates on a sports game. And the software will offer more personalized wallpapers for the lock screen and the ability to shuffle options throughout the day.\n\nExpanded CarPlay options\n\nApple’s updates extended to its broader ecosystem of products and services, from payments and passwords to cars.\n\nThe newest version of CarPlay will be packed with customized widgets controlled by the iPhone and capable of running across all of a car’s screens, from the center screen to the instrument cluster behind the steering wheel. As with Apple’s other updates announced Monday, there will also be more support for widgets and more personalization options, including various gauge cluster designs.\n\nNew payment and health features\n\nApple said iOS users in the US will be able to spread payments over 8 weeks on Apple Pay, similar to a “buy now, pay later” service, tapping into a growing payment method for consumers.\n\nThe company also continues to bet on health features. The Apple Watch will soon support new custom workouts features, including heart rate zones and data on a runner’s stride. In addition, enhanced sleep tracking will monitor when a user goes in and out of light and deep sleep. A new medications app will let users track, manage and understand the medications people take and notifies users when to take them.\n\nApple also unveiled a tool called Passkeys, which is intended to replace passwords by using Touch ID or Face ID to authenticate across apps and devices.\n\nNew MacBooks and the M2 chip\n\nWhile the event focused on software, Apple did make some hardware announcements.\n\nApple introduced a thinner, lighter and faster MacBook Air designed around its new M2 in-house processor. The 13.6-inch MacBook Air is 25% brighter than before, supports MagSafe charging and features an enhanced front-facing camera with twice the resolution of the previous model. With an 8-core CPU, Apple said the M2 chip promises 18% greater performance than its M1 chip.\n\nNew MacBook Air Apple\n\nThe processor also comes with a 10-core GPU – double that of the M1 – along with 25% better graphics performance. The M2 is also coming to a new 13-inch MacBook Pro.\n\nThe MacBook Air starts at $1,099 and the MacBook Pro starts at $1,299.\n\nApple also teased its latest Mac software, called OS Ventura, which offers a handful of multi-tasking features, such as the ability to share Safari tabs with friends and family, hand off FaceTime calls to other devices, and use an iPhone as a webcam with a new product called Continuity Camera.", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/09/07/apple-event-updates-iphone-14/8009568001/", "title": "Apple event summary: iPhone 14, Apple Watch Ultra, new AirPods Pro", "text": "Behold the new symbols of fall: Pumpkin spice and a new iPhone.\n\nOn Wednesday, Apple unveiled its latest smartphone, the iPhone 14, during its annual September event from its California headquarters.\n\nThe new iPhone 14 Plus with a 6.7-inch display joins the iPhone 14, as well as the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.

The Pro models have surgical grade stainless steel, four colors: space black, silver, gold and deep purple. There's a new front design. And they ditched the bigger notch! Granted it's still there, but it looks more like a capsule.\n\nThis capsule can change shapes in a feature called the Dynamic Island. It provides subtle messages like your AirPods have connected or your phone is charging. It can also display background activity.

Preorders open Sept. 9, and the watch launches Sept. 16.\n\nApple Watch Series 8 starts at $399, or $499 with cellular\n\nThe watch will launch in multiple colors and styles, including midnight, starlight and product red for the aluminum models, and silver, gold or graphite for stainless steel models. Watches from brands Nike and Hermes will get updates too. It's available to preorder Sept. 9, and launches Sept. 16.\n\nApple Watch adds low power mode\n\nThe Apple Watch will get a low power mode to minimize battery-intensive features and add up to 36 hours of battery life. It's available for the Watch Series 4 or later through the WatchOS 9 update.\n\nApple Watch Series 8 Crash Detection\n\nThe new watch will add a feature that detects when you're in a severe car crash. Once detected, the watch automatically contacts emergency responders, sends off your location, then reaches out to emergency contacts. New tech can sense the force and timing of an impact to determine whether you've been involved in a front- or side-impact crash, a rear-end crash or a rollover.\n\nApple Watch Series 8 confirmed\n\nThe new Apple Watch Series 8 announced by COO Jeff Williams features a brighter, always-on display. It's also swim-proof and crack-resistant. Health sensors in the watch still include the ability to read blood oxygen levels and ECGs.\n\nThere's a new temperature sensor as part of advanced cycle tracking features for women's health. The sensor will provide an estimate of ovulation, as well as check nighttime wrist temperature to detect changes as small as 0.1 degrees Celsius. Apple notes all health data is encrypted end to end, controlled only by users.\n\nApple Watch as lifesaver\n\nBefore detailing changes to Apple Watch, the company plays a montage featuring users of the Watch and how it has impacted their lives. Most discuss the various health scenarios including falls and rapid heartbeats. In some cases, users dialed 911 to contact rescuers or family to seek help to save their lives.\n\nAll iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook begins the event, saying it will focus on three products: iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch. \"Together, they provide a magical experience,\" said Cook.\n\nSubscribe to your iPhone?\n\nOne hot rumor that could clear up after Wednesday's event: does Apple have plans to introduce a subscription option for iPhone? Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported Apple was working on a subscription service for the iPhone and other products, so much like Netflix, Apple TV+ or other monthly services, you would subscribe to your iPhone for a monthly fee.\n\nHow excited are iPhone owners for a new model?\n\nAbout 14% of iPhone owners plan to upgrade to the latest iPhone when it releases, says a survey from website Savings.com. By comparison, only 10% of iPhone owners had planned to switch to iPhone 13 when it launched last year.\n\nAmong participants who said they planned to upgrade, the feature they're most excited about is improved, faster processors, followed by better storage and an upgraded camera.\n\nThe online survey conducted last month is based on 1,504 iPhone users in the U.S. ages 18 and older.\n\niOS 16 release: When can we expect it?\n\nEven if you don't buy an iPhone 14, you can enjoy the illusion of getting a new phone with the arrival of iOS 16.\n\nThis year's iOS offers some pretty key features, including the ability to unsend messages or edit them after they're sent. Once someone has sent a message in the Messages app, they have 15 minutes to edit or unsend it. Important caveat: Both the sender and receiver of the messages must have iOS 16 installed to take advantage of the feature.\n\niPhone owners also can customize their lock screens with new fonts and smaller widgets similar to what's available on Apple Watch.\n\nApple confirmed following its event iOS 16 will launch on Sept. 12.\n\nHow will iPhone 14 affect older phone prices?\n\nWhile the arrival of a new iPhone and its features is a big deal, just as important is how will the new device affect how Apple prices all its older models.\n\nThe price of the iPhone should go up, especially for Pro models that will have better chip performance, said Thomas Husson, principal analyst at Forrester. With inflation rising and supply chain issues lingering, the pricing of older iPhones will be critical.\n\n\"The key point to look at is how Apple will evolve the pricing of the iPhone 13 and older ranges to maintain growth in a declining smartphone market and to keep the momentum in faster growing markets like India or Indonesia,\" said Husson.\n\nApple store: 'Be right back'\n\nAs is tradition ahead of an Apple event, the company's online store is down. \"Be right back,\" reads the message. \"We're making updates to the Apple store. Check back soon.\" Of course, you didn't want to buy an iPhone today any way.\n\nWhat time is Apple event?\n\nThe event starts at 1 p.m. ET, or 10 a.m. PT if you're on the West Coast.\n\nHow to watch Apple event live\n\nIf you want to watch it yourself, Apple will stream both on its website and through the Apple TV app. It will also stream on Apple's official YouTube channel.\n\nWhat products can we expect from Apple event?\n\niPhone 14. Obviously. Reports suggest the new phone will receive a big camera upgrade and an always-on display. No more waking your phone to check the time. The question is how many models? Last year, consumers chose between iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max.\n\nApple Watch Pro. The new smartwatch will have a bigger display and titanium casing, reports Bloomberg. It will also have a larger battery, said the report.\n\nAirPods Pro 2. An updated version of Apple's high-end earbuds are also anticipated, reports Bloomberg.\n\nWho is keynote speaker of Apple event?\n\nThink of Apple CEO Tim Cook as a ringmaster of the Apple event circus.\n\nCook guides viewers through the myriad of device updates across its portfolio, as other Apple executives and employees break down how these new gadgets will change your life.\n\nAnd don't be surprised if Cook thinks iPhone 14 is the best iPhone ever.\n\nWhen will the iPhone 14 go for sale?\n\nApple will reveal this Wednesday. But if history offers any clues, last year Apple launched iPhone preorders the Friday after the event, with phones officially going for sale the week after. If Apple follows this pattern, expect preorders to open Sept. 9 with the new iPhones going on sale Sept. 16.\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/09/02/iphone-14-apple-event-2022/7962596001/", "title": "Apple event today: What time (and where to watch) iPhone 14 launch", "text": "Next week kicks off an annual tech tradition: the launch of the next iPhone.\n\nApple will host an event from its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. on Sept. 7, where it is widely expected leaders will unveil the iPhone 14.\n\nAlthough Apple has not officially confirmed a new iPhone will appear in invites sent to media last week, the tech giant typically reserves September for launching its signature smartphone.\n\nThe event also kicks off a busy time in tech as companies roll out new devices and hardware in preparation for the holiday shopping season.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Apple's tech event next Wednesday.\n\nIt's about time:An edit button is finally coming to Twitter, but you'll have to pay for it.\n\nDon't buy an iPhone right now:Other do's and don'ts on eve of tech's hype-filled fall\n\nWhen does Apple event start?\n\nThe event kicks off at 1 p.m. ET, or 10 a.m. PT if you're on the West Coast.\n\nHow to follow Apple event live\n\nUSA TODAY's Tech team will provide live updates of the Apple event when it starts at 1 p.m. But if you want to watch it yourself, Apple will streaming both on its website and through the Apple TV app. It will also stream on Apple's official YouTube channel.\n\nWhat can we expect at Apple event?\n\nUnless Apple upends years of tradition, we're going to see a new iPhone. But Apple has also trotted out other gadgets in its portfolio, too. Last year, Apple unveiled a new Apple Watch, an updated version of its budget-friendly iPad, and a new iPad Mini.\n\nAs for what we might see added to iPhone 14, rumors suggest Apple could deliver an always-on display and significant upgrades to the phone's camera system.\n\nWhen will the iPhone 14 go for sale?\n\nApple will reveal this next week.

If Apple follows this pattern, expect preorders to open Sept. 9 with the new iPhones going on sale Sept. 16.\n\nHow excited are Apple fans for iPhone 14?\n\nMaybe not so much. Digital marketing firm Time2Play surveyed more than 2,500 iPhone users in the U.S. who own an iPhone X or later. Their results showed only 9.5% of respondents were definitely upgrading. However, 59% said they have no plans to upgrade. For those who aren't sure, they want to see a better camera, a larger battery, and USB-C charging, the survey found.\n\nWhat about iOS 16?\n\nLet's not forget all eligible iPhones will receive an update for the latest version of iOS. Last year, Apple launched iOS 16 the Monday before the iPhone 13 went on sale. If Apple follows that trend this year, iOS 16 would launch on Sept. 12.\n\nWhat features are on iOS 16?\n\nArguably the most important iOS 16 feature is the ability to unsend messages or edit them after they're sent. Once someone has sent a message in the Messages app, they have 15 minutes to edit or unsend it. iPhone owners also can customize their lock screens with new fonts and smaller widgets similar to what's available on Apple Watch.\n\nWhich iPhones support iOS 16?\n\nEvery iPhone model from the iPhone 8 and beyond will support iOS 16, as well as the second generation or later models of the iPhone SE.\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/tech/apple-event-iphones/index.html", "title": "Apple expected to unveil new iPhones at 'far out' event on ...", "text": "(CNN) Apple customers could soon get a look at the next generation of iPhones.\n\nApple sent out press invites on Wednesday for an event on September 7, where the company is widely expected to unveil the new iPhone 14 lineup.\n\nThe company's invite, which is always closely scrutinized for hidden meanings, features the night sky in the shape of the Apple logo and the tag line: \"Far out.\"\n\nThe event is set to be broadcast on Apple's website from Apple Park, the company's headquarters in Cupertino, California.

Well, if you’re Apple, you announce something most everyone expects you to do at a much different time than most people thought you would.\n\nNo, I’m not talking about the highly anticipated (but still only rumored) AR headset (that’s likely something for next year). This week’s announcement belonged to the new M2 chip-based MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops, which the company unveiled at its annual Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC). The WWDC event is usually focused almost exclusively on software advancements with things like feature updates to iOS, MacOS, watchOS, and iPadOS taking center stage.\n\nWWDC 22 recap: Apple unveils the MacBook Air 2022, iOS 16 during keynote\n\nIn fact, the company did address software updates this year, with iOS 16 promising features like lock screen customization and text message recall or post-send editing, iPadOS 16 offering significantly more Mac-like productivity features for collaboration and multi-app windowing, and MacOS Ventura (the next version’s name) scheduled to enable things like Continuity Camera for using a paired iPhone as a high-quality webcam and passwordless log-ins via new Passkeys.\n\nSo long, passwords? Portable digital identities may replace them\n\nIn addition to the expected software refinements, however, Apple also took the wraps off its highly anticipated second-generation M2 chip for Mac and the first two machines to support it – updated versions of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Even casual Apple observers all figured the company would eventually do this, but most everyone tracking the news from WWDC was surprised it happened now.\n\nWhat it illustrates is that Apple is moving forward even more aggressively on its roadmap for making custom Arm-based chip designs (at the heart of the M series processors) than many realized. At the same time, it’s becoming clear that Apple’s M line of silicon is quickly becoming a more complex and nuanced set of offerings than many had originally thought.\n\nAs you would expect based on the name alone, the M2 is a more advanced version of the original M1 chip first introduced about 20 months ago in previous versions of the MacBook Air, 13” MacBook Pro and the Mac Mini. It is not, however, expected to be faster or more capable than the M1 Ultra, M1 Pro, or M1 Max processors the company has debuted over the past year.\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nConfused? Well, what Apple is clearly signaling is that it will have a tier of performance levels within each generation of its M series line and, from generation to generation, those tiers are going to overlap. So, M2-based computers are expected to be 18% faster for computation and 35% faster for graphics than M1 machines, but not necessarily faster than something based on the M1 Pro or M1 Ultra. At the same time, it’s now fairly safe to bet that we’ll see an M2 Pro and M2 Ultra and that they will be faster than their predecessors.\n\niOS 16 release details: These are the six biggest updates coming to iPhones this fall\n\nWhat this also suggests is that, in some ways, Apple is using a page from an old Intel chip manufacturing strategy called “tic toc.” With this approach, one generation of chips provides refinements from an existing design as the M2 – seems to be doing versus the M1– and then the generation after that uses what’s called a different process node to manufacture the chip with small transistors.\n\nTech talk\n\nPractically speaking, what this means is that the M1 and M2 were made with 5 nm (nanometer) transistors, but the M3 is expected to be shrunk down to using 3 nm components. The only reason you should care is that these process node changes typically offer even greater performance boosts than design changes, meaning we could see even bigger performance jumps when Apple eventually moves to the M3.\n\nThe M2 looks to bring solid improvements versus the first generation M1 MacBooks. Even bigger news for the new M2-powered MacBook Air is a refined, slimmed down design that brings back the Magsafe power connector, improves the webcam to 1080P resolution and ups the screen size to 13.6 inches.\n\nAs I was able to witness first hand at the event, it’s a beautiful machine to see and hold, and it also now comes in four different metallic colors. The new design does come at a price, however, with the M2-based MacBook Airs starting at $1,199 when they’re available sometime next month, according to Apple. That’s $200 more than the M1 MacBook Air, which the company will continue to sell for $999.\n\nNew Apple Pay Later feature:Now you can buy that MacBook on the installment plan\n\nThe M2-based MacBook Pro starts at the same $1,299 price as the M1-based MacBook Pro (which it is replacing), though it maintains the same design and 13” screen size of the original.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nAs Apple likes to point out, the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro are the world’s two best- selling laptops (in part, because Apple offers significantly fewer different models than any other PC vendor), so changes and upgrades to them are going to impact and be noticed by a lot of people.\n\nThe M2 versions, particularly the newly designed MacBook Air, offer a lot of what most potential buyers will want in a notebook, including up-to-date performance, solid battery life and good designs. More importantly, they are clear representations of where Apple wants its computing business to go – full steam ahead.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/tech/att-3g-network-shutdown/index.html", "title": "AT&T is shutting down its 3G network. Here's how it could impact ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nTwenty years after 3G was first introduced in the United States, paving the way for a new generation of mobile apps, the network is officially being phased out.\n\nAT&T is set to pull the plug on its 3G network Tuesday, with other major US carriers expected to follow suit later this year. The move impacts everything from older phones to home alarm systems and roadside assistance systems.\n\nTo move its mobile customers over to 4G without service interruptions, AT&T (T), which owns CNN’s parent company, has been providing free replacement phones to many users with a 3G device. It has also been attempting to alert customers to the network changes through various methods.\n\n“For nearly two years, we’ve proactively sent numerous communications via direct mail, bill messaging, emails and text messages to help customers transition to next generation networks before 3G services end on February 22,” AT&T told CNN Business in a statement.\n\nAT&T is shutting down its 3G networks as part of a greater effort to re-use the spectrum for 4G and 5G — newer standards that are more efficient than 3G. T-Mobile (TMUS) will do the same in the third quarter and Verizon (VZ) will do so by the end of the year.\n\nHere’s what you should know about the 3G shutdown.\n\nWhat products will be impacted?\n\nThe shutdown will impact people still using 3G Kindles, 3G flip phones, the iPhone 5 and older models as well as various Android phones. It will also affect home alarm systems and medical devices such as fall detectors. Some in-car crash notification and roadside assistance systems like OnStar will need to be updated or replaced, too.\n\nIf you’re not sure which network your phone is on, open Settings, tap Network and Internet, and then select Mobile Network on Android devices. On iOS, choose Settings, Cellular and then pick Cellular Data Options. AT&T also has a dedicated webpage to determine if your device will be impacted by the shut down.\n\nIt can be harder to tell with other everyday products. If you’re not sure whether the device relies on 3G, you can call the manufacturer or car dealer.\n\nWhat can I do about it?\n\nFor those who don’t want to get rid of their 3G mobile devices, there are some workarounds. In theory, it will be possible to access a web browser via Wi-Fi or make calls over wireless on a 3G phone if the user has an app enabling voice-over-internet protocol, such as Facebook Messenger. Similarly, people with a 3G e-reader will still be able to download new books on the device via Wi-Fi.\n\nOther 3G products may be more complicated. My Alarm Center, a home security systems business, has warned customers that certain alarm systems will need to be replaced by a technician to avoid potential disruptions. “Even if your alarm appears to function, it will no longer communicate with our central service station to notify us that emergency services are needed,” the company states on its website.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM), which owns OnStar, started pushing over-the-air updates in October to vehicles released as far back as 2015, including models from Chevrolet, Buick and Cadillac, which may be impacted by the transition. As a general rule, most cars built in the last five years with connectivity are using 4G modems. If the car does run on 3G, the manufacturer may offer an upgrade program or the wireless carrier can provide an adapter with a modem that can be plugged into a vehicle.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nThe 3G network launched in 2002 and became the driving force behind the early App Store boom around the end of that decade. The wireless companies later moved on to 4G and more recently 5G networks.\n\nLast month, AT&T and Verizon turned on C-band 5G networks, an important set of higher radio frequencies that will supercharge the internet. The change will allow users to, for example, stream a Netflix movie in 4K resolution or download a movie in seconds. (Verizon said its C-band speeds reach nearly 1 gigabyte per second, about 10 times as fast as 4G LTE.)\n\nOnly a small portion of wireless customers are still using 3G networks. Verizon said in a blog post that 99% of its customers have already upgraded to 4G LTE or 5G, and AT&T said less than 1% of its mobile data traffic runs on 3G networks. T-Mobile did not respond to a request for comment about its 3G user base.", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/komando/2013/12/13/smartphone-battery-processing-display-camera/3921399/", "title": "10 smartphone must-have features", "text": "Kim Komando\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nDroid Maxx phone has 48 hours of battery life\n\nNokia Lumia 1020 has best camera phone\n\nHTC One%2C Samsung Galaxy have apps to control your TV\n\nAny new smartphone has a gimmick. Whether it's wireless charging, fingerprint scanning or even eye-tracking, there's always an amazing feature you \"can't live without.\" But let's be honest: many of those features you really can live without.\n\nOn the other hand, some of the futuristic technology available in next-generation smartphones is really useful. But which features do you need in your toolbox and which are just the icing on the cake? This definitive list ranks 10 useful features your smartphone needs to have.\n\n1. A long-lasting battery\n\nYour smartphone could have a shrink-ray or turn lead into gold and it would still be useless without juice. There are ways to boost the battery life of your gadget, but at the end of the day a larger battery is going to last you longer.\n\nThe Droid Maxx is the undisputed king of batteries. It will get you close to 48 hours of use. The Galaxy Note 3 has a respectable battery life at 12-16 hours of use, but it's still well behind the Maxx. The iPhone 5S is around 10 hours and the Samsung Galaxy S4 brings up the rear at 9 hours.\n\n2. Warp-speed processing\n\nSpeed is still the ultimate prize in the smartphone arms race. You notice when apps lag or when swiping takes an eternity.\n\nThe iPhone 5s is the fastest smartphone on the market. Its A7 chip is even light years ahead of blazing fast phones like the Samsung Galaxy S4 or the surprisingly quick Motorola Moto X. But don't despair if your phone feels a little sluggish — there are ways to speed it up.\n\n3. Crystal-clear display\n\nSmartphones are as much about enjoying media as they are about communicating. You watch movies, play games and view photos on your mobile screen and you want the crispest display around.\n\nIn this case that award goes to the Samsung Galaxy S4. It has the best resolution and most pixels per inch. The LG G2 and Nokia Lumia 1020 are close behind, but it's Samsung's super AMOLED display technology that sets it ahead.\n\nWhile the screen on the iPhone 5s and 5c can't match the size or pixel density of their competitors, it's still a solid high-resolution display and many people prefer it for its color accuracy.\n\n4. A great camera\n\nYou don't have to be a pro photographer to see the difference between modern phone cameras and the ones on your old flip-phone. A great camera is important for more than just great photos. You can use your camera for some surprising other things, like visual search.\n\nNokia's Lumia 1020 includes an elite ZEISS lens, image stabilization and a whopping 41 megapixels. It's clearly the best camera phone because it's more camera than phone!\n\nThe iPhone 5s and the HTC One are also very respectable shooters. Their image sensors have larger pixels, which gives you better color range and excellent low-light images.\n\n5. NFC\n\nNear Field Communications allows your smartphone to transmit data to other phones and tablets in the vicinity. It's really handy for sharing pictures and music. You can even use it to pay at stores and restaurants. Plenty of great Android and Windows phones offer NFC, but not Apple.\n\n6. Multiple windows\n\nYou'd never settle for seeing just one window on your computer, why would you on your phone? Samsung Galaxy phones, as well as LG's G2, Optimus and Enact are superb at letting you see multiple apps at once. Other Android phones and the iPhone stick to displaying a single app at a time.\n\n7. Plenty of storage space\n\nMost smartphones come with anywhere between 16 and 32 gigabytes of storage. Extra space is a nice luxury, but these days you'll be saving most of your media in the cloud.\n\n8. Infrared remote control\n\nHow cool would it be to control your TV with your smartphone? You'll never search for the remote again. Phones like the HTC One and Samsung Galaxy S4 include Infrared transmitters as well as apps to help you control your TV. Of course, there are third-party infrared add-ons for the iPhone and other Android phones.\n\n9. Fingerprint sensor\n\nApple's most gabbed-about feature on the new 5s was definitely the fingerprint sensor. It's not really any more secure than traditional lockscreen passcodes, but it does save you time. The HTC One Max Android phone also has one, but few other phones do at this time.\n\n10. Wireless charging\n\nThis is a handy feature for those of you who don't want to plug in your phone. Just set it down and it's charging. And don't worry; wireless charging is perfectly safe.\n\nKim Komando hosts the nation's largest talk radio show about consumer electronics, computers and the Internet.

The service is expected to roll out in November in the United States and Canada. The iPhone 14 will begin pre-sales on Friday and comes with a starting price of $799, Apple announced on Wednesday at its flashy annual event.\n\n“Unlike stationary cell towers, communication satellites are hundreds of miles above the Earth, and flying at over 15,000 miles per hour. To connect to these satellites, you need to be outside with a clear view of the sky. And the bandwidth is so limited that even sending a text message is a technical challenge,” Williams said. “Typically, the only way to tap into such a network is with an expensive device that uses a bulky external antenna.”\n\n“We knew that approach just wouldn’t work for iPhone,” she added. “So we invented another way.”\n\nThe iPhone 14 will have the built-in antenna required to communicate with satellites — and it’ll look nothing like the bulky satellite phones of years past.\n\nThe phone will come equipped with software that will show users where to point their phones in order to link up to a satellite when no other service options are available. Once connected, the phones will be able to send and receive information to get emergency help, according to Apple satellite specialist Ashley Williams, who spoke during the event. The company said it created a short text compression mechanism to condense messages such that they will take about 15 seconds to send if a user has a clear view of the sky. (It may take a few minutes longer if something like foliage is in the way.)\n\nThe service will work for text-based communication, she said, and can be used to communicate with emergency centers that only accept voice calls because Apple set up “relay centers” to pass the text along.\n\nThe tool can also be used in non-emergency situations, such as when a user is out for a long hike and wants to keep their family updated on their whereabouts.\n\nThe service will be offered for free for two years with an iPhone 14 purchase, according to Apple iPhone marketing vice president Kaiann Drance. She did not reveal how much the service will cost after that.\n\nAdding satellite service to new iPhones “should dominate the headlines,” according to Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight.\n\n“The investment to add satellite capability should not be underestimated. It will likely have taken Apple years to put all the pieces of the puzzle in place including a commercial agreement with satellite provider Globalstar and the creation of the infrastructure needed to pass messages to the emergency services,” Wood said.\n\nGlobalstar confirmed in a financial filing that it is the contractor for this project. Apple did not immediately respond to an email request for additional information.\n\nBut the news, with a release date expected for just next month, comes after T-Mobile announced similar plans to “eliminate dead zones” by using new SpaceX Starlink satellites for back-up service. It’s been marketed as a move to provide full high-speed internet service across the dead zones. The roll out of that service is not expected before the end of next year, though T-Mobile said that, once released, it should work with customers’ existing phones.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles Samantha Murphy Kelly", "Jackie Wattles", "Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}]}

In a statement posted on Columbia University’s Department of Mathematics’ website, Thaddeus noted that “few other top-tier universities have also improved their standings, but none has matched Columbia’s extraordinary rise.”\n\nThaddeus pointed to data submitted by the university to U.S. News & World Report in questioning Columbia’s seemingly meteoric rise in rankings.\n\n“Can we be sure that the data accurately reflect the reality of life within the university?” Thaddeus rhetorically asked. “Regrettably, the answer is no.”\n\nThe math professor then tabulated data on “undergraduate class size, percentage of faculty with terminal degrees, percentage of faculty who are full-time, and student-faculty ratio” submitted by Columbia University to U.S. News & World Report and compares the data “with figures computed by other means, drawing on information made public by Columbia elsewhere.”\n\nIn his findings, Thaddeus said there were “discrepancies sometimes quite large” which seemed to always work in Columbia’s favor.\n\nIn response to Thaddeus’ findings, Columbia University Provost Mary Boyce said in a June statement that the university would “refrain from submitting data to U.S. News and World Report” for consideration in the publication’s 2022 undergraduate college rankings.\n\n“On two of the metrics questioned by our faculty member [Thaddeus], class size and faculty with terminal degrees, we determined we had previously relied on outdated and/or incorrect methodologies. We have changed those methodologies for current and future data submissions, as reflected in the newly posted Common Data Sets,” Boyce noted in June.\n\nBoyce said starting Fall 2022, the university would start participating in the Common Data Set (CDS) Initiative, “a collaborative effort among data providers in the higher education community and publishers” to provide accurate information to students seeking information on institutions of higher education, according to the initiative’s website.\n\nThe CDS Initiative, represented by U.S. News & World Report, the College Board and educational services company Peterson’s, was launched in 1997 to provide institutions of higher education with “a set of standards and definitions of data items rather than a survey instrument or set of data represented in a database.”\n\nU.S. News Chief Data Strategist Robert Morse told CNN Monday that schools report most of the information for their Best Colleges rankings directly to U.S. News.\n\n“Each year, U.S. News sends an extensive questionnaire to all accredited four-year colleges and universities,” he explained. “U.S. News, a founding member of the Common Data Set initiative, incorporates questions from the CDS and proprietary questions on this survey. U.S. News relies on schools to accurately report their data.”\n\nCoupled with the commitment of participating in the CDS Initiative, Boyce also announced the launch of a new webpage providing detailed context and analysis of the Columbia University undergraduate experience.\n\nIn July, U.S. News & World Report unranked Columbia University “from a number of rankings in the 2022 edition of Best Colleges (first published September 2021)” saying that the university “failed to respond to multiple U.S. News requests that the university substantiate certain data it previously submitted,” according to a blog post by U.S. News. It is unclear whether Thaddeus’ publication of his investigation into the data that Columbia presented to U.S. News & World Report may have contributed to the university being unranked.\n\nIn Friday’s statement, Boyce said the university posted two Common Data Sets, one for the Columbia College and Columbia Engineering, and one for Columbia General Studies.\n\n“The information included in the two Common Data Sets reflects the University’s work in recent months to review our data collection processes, following questions raised by a faculty member regarding the accuracy of certain data the University submitted to U.S. News and World Report in 2021 for its ranking of undergraduate universities,” Boyce said.\n\n“U.S. News publishes annual rankings for more than 11,500 schools and hundreds of individual programs as part of the Best Colleges, Best Graduate Schools, Best Online Programs, Best Global Universities and Best High Schools rankings,” Morse said in a statement Monday.\n\n“To produce the rankings, U.S. News collects tens of thousands of data points from the schools themselves and other sources, including the U.S. Department of Education, state and local governments and higher education associations. A very small proportion of the total number of schools that are ranked – typically less than 0.1% each year – inform U.S. News that they have misreported data that were used to calculate their school’s ranking.”\n\nU.S. News & World Report released a breakdown of how their publication calculated the 2022-2023 Best Colleges Rankings in an article Monday.", "authors": ["Artemis Moshtaghian"], "publish_date": "2022/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/07/16/cost-college-top-universities-pay-off-most-stanford-princeton/1742297001/", "title": "The top 50 US colleges that pay off the most 2019", "text": "Abigail Hess\n\nCNBC\n\nEach year, high school students across the U.S. march through campuses on guided tours, pore over course catalogs, and frantically check mailboxes and inboxes for letters granting them admission to the next phase of life: college.\n\nMost are facing significant financial questions. Research consistently demonstrates that college graduates earn more than their peers without degrees. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Americans with a bachelor’s degree have median weekly earnings of $1,173, compared with just $712 a week for those who have a high school diploma. Still, experts urge high school students to think carefully before taking on significant amounts of debt to finance a college degree.\n\nDon't overpack:7 things college freshmen don't need – and 10 they do\n\nUgly is in:Crocs have taken over teen footwear\n\nCollege costs can be difficult to estimate, and even for college applicants with the foresight to research things like debt balances at graduation and average alumni salaries, outcomes can be challenging to quantify. Sticker prices published by universities do not include grants, scholarships or loans. Financial aid awards can change from year to year. Housing, travel, books and other personal expenses can add up quickly.\n\nAnd less than half, 41%, of first-time, full-time college students earn their bachelor’s degree in four years. Many of them end up paying for more than four years of college, driving up the cost of attendance significantly.\n\nCNBC Make It set out to capture the information students would need to balance these considerations. The result is our first list of the U.S. colleges that pay off the most, a ranking that spotlights 50 schools that provide students the highest average salaries for their tuition dollars.\n\nWe started by identifying the true net cost of each college for the typical American student — including tuition, fees, books, supplies and other expenses — after subtracting scholarships and grants. Using data from Tuition Tracker, a tool created by education-focused nonprofit news organization The Hechinger Report, we looked at the net cost for students from families making between $48,001 and $75,000, an income range established by the Department of Education. We chose to focus on this bracket because it includes the median U.S. household income, $61,372.\n\nWells Fargo:Earnings top estimates on strong consumer checking\n\nTesla:Employees say they took shortcuts to meet aggressive production goals\n\nThe Hechinger Report calculates net cost by subtracting federal, state, local and institutional grants and scholarships from the sticker price for first-time, full-time (and, at public universities, in-state) undergraduates based on data provided by the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nThen, using data from PayScale’s College Salary Report, we divided net cost by graduates’ expected annual earnings, which was calculated based on the median salary of graduates with less than five years of experience as well as those with 10 or more years of experience. The ranking gives greater weight to workers’ earnings in the years immediately after college, when individuals are the most impacted by college costs and student debt. (You can read our full methodology here.)\n\nWe excluded tuition-free institutions from the list, including military schools like West Point and U.S. Naval Academy, because the cost of post-college military service introduces an additional factor that’s challenging to measure against other schools.\n\nStanford University takes first place on the list. According to The Hechinger Report, the net cost for a student from a family that earns between $48,001 and $75,000 is $4,061 per year. Stanford graduates with more than 10 years of experience report average salaries of $143,100.\n\nAccording to PayScale, 51% of Stanford students major in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) field, a factor that contributes to high average salaries among graduates. And Stanford is known for providing robust financial aid. The average scholarship and grant total for students from families making less than $65,000 a year is $74,095 per year. Students from families making between $65,000 and $95,000 receive $65,050 on average in scholarships and grant aid.\n\nWhile Princeton, Harvard and Yale get top marks, a wide range of schools from across the U.S. are represented here. State schools like the University of Washington-Seattle, small liberal arts colleges like Pomona College and STEM-focused schools like MIT also appear on this list, indicating that you don’t have to attend the Ivy League to get a great return on your college investment.\n\nHere is CNBC Make It’s 2019 list of the top 50 U.S. colleges that pay off the most:\n\nThe top 25 private universities\n\n1.

Consider pursuing a degree in a high-paying field. Earning a degree in a STEM field can help students at any college prepare themselves for in-demand high-paying jobs. Students can keep costs low by keeping on pace with their requirements and graduating on time. Additional semesters of college can be expensive and in some cases, scholarship and grant aid does not apply for semesters beyond the standard four years.\n\nBut the most significant step students can take to ensure their college degree pays off is, simply, to complete their college degree. Just 60% of college students complete their bachelor’s in six years and many drop out altogether, and one of the worst outcomes for students is taking on loans for a degree they do not complete. The economic benefits of earning a bachelor’s degree are still significant, and if students study hard and play their cards right, college can pay off big time.\n\n©CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

As such, a law degree can be a stepping stone to a career that can have a meaningful impact on many lives. It can also be a pathway to a high-paying career.\n\nEnrolling in any one of the more than 200 law schools recognized by the American Bar Association can equip students with the expertise needed for a successful career in law. However, these schools vary considerably in selectivity. While the more competitive law schools do not necessarily offer a better education, top law firms often only recruit from the most selective and elite law schools.\n\nUsing data from the ABA, 24/7 Wall St. created an index of three measures of selectivity to identify the 50 hardest law schools to get into.\n\nThe first index measure is the acceptance rate, or the number of offer letters a school sent in 2019 as a share of the number of applications. The second is the median LSAT score of newly enrolled students in fall 2019, and the third measure is the median undergraduate GPA of newly enrolled students. We also reviewed the share of students in the class of 2018 who took the bar exam and passed on their first attempt.\n\nMany of the most powerful people in the United States have attended the most selective schools on this list. All nine justices of the Supreme Court graduated from one of two elite Ivy League law schools. Similarly, the last three U.S. presidents with backgrounds in law were trained in those same institutions: Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton at Yale Law School, and Barack Obama at Harvard Law. In fact, most U.S. presidents have been lawyers. Here is a look at each president’s path to the oval office.\n\nLaw school is a considerable investment of both time and money, often costing over $150,000 in tuition and fees over the course of three years. Partially because of the investment, an education in law – regardless of the selectivity of the institution – is a pathway to many exceptionally high-paying careers. Law school is a necessary prerequisite for many of the highest paying jobs. Here is a full list of the 79 jobs with six-figure salaries.\n\nDoes everyone have a 40-hour work week?:A look at countries that have shorter, or longer, work weeks than the US.\n\nStaff reductions:3M to cut roughly 1,500 jobs as it streamlines its business\n\n50.

Its content is produced independently of USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/03/12/great-schools-students-most-likely-succeed-these-districts/4999928002/", "title": "Great schools: Students are most likely to succeed in these districts", "text": "Samuel Stebbins and Michael B. Sauter\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nSchool district quality is one of the most important factors homebuyers consider when looking for a place to live – particularly for new or expecting parents. A good school district can greatly increase a child’s chances of future success.\n\nOf course, the influences that can shape a child’s future are not strictly limited to the classroom. Conditions in the home and the broader community also have an effect.\n\nUsing data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics, 24/7 Wall St. developed an index of measures, including the child poverty rate, the teacher-to-student ratio, per-pupil spending, the share of adults with a college education, and the high school graduation rate to determine the school district where students are most likely to succeed in every state. In our analysis, we also reviewed a number of measures of district outcomes, including college entrance exam performance and subject proficiency tests from education and community data clearing house, Niche. While favorable rankings in these measures will not alone ensure children's chances for success through their school years and into adulthood, they can provide them with considerable advantages.\n\nOne of the most important predictors of a child’s academic success is their poverty status. Children living below the poverty line are more likely to report poor physical health and have reduced ability to concentrate and retain information. Childhood poverty increases the likelihood of low test scores and reduces a student’s chances of completing high school. For this reason, the child poverty rate was selected as a component in the index. Here is a state-by-state look at the child poverty rate.\n\nIt is important to note that education policy is decided largely at the state level, and partially as a result, the difference in school district quality across a state can be lower than it is between states. A district that ranks as the best in a given state will not necessarily rank favorably among districts in other states. Here is a list of the states with the best and worst schools.\n\nInvesting:What's a bear market and why are stocks about to enter one?\n\nTesla milestone:Elon Musk congratulates electric vehicle manufacturer on making 1 million electric cars\n\n1. Alabama: Mountain Brook Schools\n\n• Location: Jefferson County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $13,303\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 85.1%\n\nAlabama's Mountain Brook School District, located just outside of Birmingham, educates over 4,000 students in grades K-12 in six different schools. While there is no direct link between school spending and outcomes, schools with greater financial resources can often offer students with a broader range of opportunities. Per pupil spending in the Mountain Brook district is over $13,000 per year, the most of any district in Alabama.\n\nChildren in the district are also less likely than most to be disadvantaged outside of the classroom. For example, the stresses associated with living in poverty can hurt academic performance, and in Mountain Brook, just 6.5% of school-age children live below the poverty line, well below the 17% U.S. child poverty rate.\n\n2. Alaska: Juneau School District\n\n• Location: Juneau City and Borough\n\n• Annual per student spending: $16,494\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 39.5%\n\nA child's academic performance tends to increase with parental educational attainment – and in the Juneau School District, parents are more likely to have a college education than parents nationwide. An estimated 39.5% of adults 25 and over in the district have a bachelor's degree, well above the 31.5% national rate.\n\nStudents in the Juneau district are also more likely to be enrolled in Advanced Placement classes than those in any other district in the state. Of the nearly 5,000 students in the district, 7.9% are enrolled in an AP class.\n\n3. Arizona: Catalina Foothills School District 16\n\n• Location: Pima County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $7,070\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 70.1%\n\nThe Catalina Foothills School District 16, located in the northern part of the Tucson metropolitan area, ranks as the best district in Arizona. The district has one of the most affluent populations in the country, as well as one of the most highly educated – approximately 70% of adults have a bachelor's degree. Students who grow up in an affluent household with college-educated parents are more likely to achieve academic success.\n\nThe school district's per student spending per year is lower than many of the school districts on this list, at just over $7,000 per pupil.\n\n4. Arkansas: Valley View Schools\n\n• Location: Craighead County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $8,692\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 45.3%\n\nValley View School District, located in northeastern Arkansas, enrolls about 3,000 students across four schools. The district's ranking on this list is due in large part to positive educational outcomes, as over 90% of high school freshman graduate in four years.\n\nThe greater likelihood of academic success in the district is partially due to factors outside the classroom. For example, children raised by college-educated parents are more likely than most to do well in school. Across Valley View District, 45.3% of adults have a bachelor's degree or higher, well above the comparable 31.5% share of adults nationwide.\n\n5. California: Palo Alto Unified School District\n\n• Location: Santa Clara County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $19,648\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 83.8%\n\nPublic school spending on a per student basis is nearly $20,000 per year in the Palo Alto School District. The high spending is due in part to high revenue from property taxes as Palo Alto is one of the wealthiest parts of the country with relatively expensive real estate.\n\nWhile high per student spending does not necessarily translate to positive outcomes, the district boasts a near perfect graduation rate. Additionally, over 95% of students who take one or more AP exams pass at least one.\n\n6. Colorado: Aspen School District\n\n• Location: Pitkin County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $16,820\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 69.4%\n\nAs a highly affluent school district, Colorado's Aspen School District 1 relies relatively little on state or federal revenue to fund its schools. In 2017, 83.8% of the district revenue came from local sources, close to double the average among districts nationwide of 45.8%.\n\nLiving in poverty can be a major obstacle for childhood development, and in the district, just 3.4% of children 5 to 17 live in poverty, a lower child poverty rate than the vast majority of school districts nationwide and well below the national child poverty rate of 17%.\n\n7. Connecticut: Darien Public School District\n\n• Location: Fairfield County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $21,648\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 81.3%\n\nDarien is one of the wealthiest school districts in the country, with a median annual household income of over $210,000. Likely partially as a result, per-pupil spending in the district of $21,648 exceeds the national per pupil spending average of $12,201.\n\nThe district ranks sixth out of 130 districts in the state in Niche's ranking of teacher quality. Darien High School, the only high school in the district, has an average SAT score of 1310 and an average ACT score of 30, well above average scores for high school students nationwide.\n\n8. Delaware: Appoquinimink School District\n\n• Location: New Castle County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $12,567\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 37.2%\n\nDelaware's Appoquinimink School District – which is located in the northern part of the state, approximately 20 miles south of Wilmington – ranks as the best in the state. The district's per student spending of $12,567 is in the middle of most of the districts on this list, although still slightly higher than the national per pupil spending figure of $12,201.\n\n9. Florida: St. Johns County School District\n\n• Location: St. Johns County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $8,331\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 43.7%\n\nThe St. Johns County School District is located along Florida's Atlantic coast and covers the city of St. Augustine. The school district's 88.6% graduation rate is the highest in the state and well above the 70.8% average graduation rate across all Florida school districts.\n\nChildren who grow up in financially stable households with college-educated parents are at a considerable advantage academically. In the St. Johns County School District, 43.7% of adults have a bachelor's degree, and just 6.5% of children live below the poverty line – compared to the 29.2% and 18.4% respective state averages.\n\nAcademic achievement:The best public high school in your state\n\nDegrees ahead:Boston, Seattle headline the cities with the most college graduates in every state\n\n10. Georgia: City Schools of Decatur\n\n• Location: DeKalb County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $11,657\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 72.5%\n\nGeorgia's Decatur school district spends $11,657 per student per year, well above the $10,205 statewide average. The greater school spending likely contributes to the smaller class sizes, as the district has about one teacher per 14.2 students – well below the one teacher per 15.2 students across Georgia.\n\nStudents in the Decatur District are far more likely to graduate high school than the typical student in Georgia. About 85.5% of high school students in Decatur graduate within four years, a far larger share than the 69.9% state average.\n\n11. Hawaii: Hawaii Public Schools\n\n• Location: Honolulu County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $14,322\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 32.5%\n\nHawaii is the only state to have a single school district manage every public school. Therefore, the district's ranking on this list is by default only. Still, by several measures, public school students in Hawaii have some advantages over students nationwide. For example, per student spending in the state is $14,322 compared to the national average of $12,201. Higher-spending districts often have smaller class sizes, and in Hawaii, the average student-teacher ratio of 15 to 1 is slightly lower than the 16.1 to 1 national average.\n\n12. Idaho: Moscow School District 281\n\n• Location: Latah County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $9,970\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 55.3%\n\nIdaho's Moscow School District 281 enrolls about 2,400 students in part of the northwestern section of the state. High school students in the district are more likely to be enrolled in an AP course than the typical high schooler in Idaho. Some 24% of high schoolers are taking an AP class compared to 17.4% of high school students across the state.\n\nChildren of college-educated parents are more likely to be academically successful than children of parents who never went to college. Across the Moscow School District, 55.3% of adults have a bachelor's degree, well above the 26.9% share of adults across the state as a whole.\n\n13. Illinois: Indian Prairie School District 204\n\n• Location: DuPage County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $15,738\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 63.4%\n\nCompared to most of the districts on this list, Indian Prairie Community Unit School District in Illinois is relatively large, with over 28,000 students and 33 operational schools in total. The district serves wealthy Chicago suburbs such as Naperville.\n\nStudent achievement is quite high in the large district, with Niche reporting an average SAT score across district students of 1300 and an average ACT score of 29, both well above the national averages. An estimated 37.1% of high school students in the district take at least one AP course, well above the 21.5% of high school students nationwide. Teachers are also well-compensated, with the average teacher earning over $70,000.\n\n14. Indiana: Zionsville Community Schools\n\n• Location: Boone County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $9,073\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 70.6%\n\nChildren of parents with a college education are more likely to have higher academic achievement than the typical student. In Indiana's Zionsville school district, located just north of Indianapolis, 70.6% of adults have a bachelor's degree or higher, well above the 25.9% of adults across the state as a whole.

Iowa: Gilbert Community School District\n\n• Location: Story County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $9,733\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 63.5%\n\nWhile per pupil spending isn't as high as many of the other districts in the district, Iowa's Gilbert Community School District, north of the city of Ames, has some of the best student outcomes in the country.\n\nLike a number of the best school districts in each state, Gilbert Community School District has a near-perfect graduation rate. Additionally, according to Niche, 95% of students in the district test as proficient in reading, and 97% test as proficient in math. The average SAT scores among students in the district is 1420, far higher than the national average SAT scores.\n\n16.

However, such conditions are rare in Kentucky's Beechwood Independent School District. Just 4.1% of area children live below the poverty line, a fraction of the 20.5% statewide child poverty rate.\n\nWith most students not saddled with financial hardship, certain academic outcomes are indeed better than average in the school district. For example, the district's high school graduation rate is over 93%.\n\n18. Louisiana: Orleans Parish Schools\n\n• Location: Orleans Parish\n\n• Annual per student spending: $12,761\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 36.8%\n\nThe Orleans Parish School District in Louisiana, which covers much of the greater New Orleans area, ranks as the district where students are most likely to succeed in the state. Public school spending per student in the district is $12,761, above the $11,199 average spending across the state as a whole.\n\nWhile higher spending does not necessarily translate to better outcomes, the higher spending likely contributes to smaller class sizes in Orleans Parish. The district's student-to-teacher ratio of 16.9 to 1 is well below the 17.8 to 1 state ratio.\n\n19. Maine: Falmouth School Department\n\n• Location: Cumberland County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $15,663\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 69%\n\nSmaller class sizes have been linked to better outcomes.

For example, while the stressors associated with serious financial hardship can detract considerably from academic performance, just 5.7% of children in the district live below the poverty line, compared to 11.4% of children statewide. Additionally, children of college-educated parents are more likely to be academically successful than children of parents who never went to college. Across the district, 61.4% of adults have a bachelor's degree, the largest share of any school district in Maryland.\n\n21. Massachusetts: Public Schools of Brookline\n\n• Location: Norfolk County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $20,250\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 83.7%\n\nPer pupil spending is not a guarantee of good student outcomes, but higher spending can come with certain advantages. And at Massachusetts' Brookline public school system, per pupil spending exceeds $20,000 annually, roughly $8,000 greater than national per pupil spending.\n\nAs is usually the case in high-spending districts, Brookline – a suburb of Boston – is a relatively affluent community, with a median household income of $113,515. Students who grow up in an affluent household with college-educated parents have a greater chance to succeed academically. Among the district's adults, 83.7% have at least a bachelor's degree, one of the 10 highest shares of any school district in the United States.\n\n22.

Missouri: School District of Clayton\n\n• Location: St. Louis County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $21,268\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 77.4%\n\nWhile high per pupil spending is no guarantee of better outcomes, it can provide students with greater opportunities and advantages. In Missouri's School District of Clayton, per pupil spending is $21,268 per year, roughly double the average of $10,589 across the state as a whole. In districts that spend more, students often benefit from smaller class sizes. In Clayton, there are 11.8 students per teacher, below the 13.4 to 1 student-to-teacher ratio statewide.\n\n26.

Over 85% of ninth graders graduate high school within four years, compared to about eight in every 10 across Wyoming.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the school district where students are most likely to succeed in every state, 24/7 Wall St. developed an index based on various measures of school finance, student success, and other socioeconomic measures. Data on per pupil spending in 2017 came from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of School System Finances and was included in the index. Data on the ratio of students to teachers in the 2017-2018 school year came from the National Center for Education Statistics and was included in the index. The average freshman graduation rate for the 2009-2010 school year also came from the NCES and was included in the index. Data on the percentage of children aged 5 to 17 living in poverty in 2018 came from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates program and was included in the index. Finally, five-year data on the percentage of adults 25 and over with at least a bachelor’s degree by school district in 2018 came from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey and was included in the index. Only school districts with at least 500 students and four of the five data points included in our index were considered.\n\nData on Advanced Placement enrollment and the percentage of students who took and passed at least one AP exam in the 2015-2016 school year came from the U.S. Department of Education’s Civil Rights Data Collection program and were aggregated from the school level to the district level using only schools with students in grades nine through 12 exclusively.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

She had shot herself in the heart with their father’s hunting rifle weeks after their church excommunicated her for getting engaged to a man who was not a Jehovah’s Witness.\n\nFor Sawyer — who sat on the bedroom floor near her sister's body for hours that day, waiting for her mother to come home from her door-to-door missionary work — it was the beginning of a long, painful journey that would one day tear her family apart.\n\nYears later, Sawyer got excommunicated, too, after seeking a divorce from an abusive husband. She ended up leaving the husband — and the faith.\n\n► March 12:Kaylee Muthart explains what made her pull out her eyes\n\n► March 12:Oregon couple’s final days captured in intimate aid-in-dying video\n\n► Feb. 20:Did shunning from Jehovah's Witnesses drive mom to murder-suicide?\n\nHer family cut all ties.\n\n“Jehovah’s Witness kids grow up knowing that if they ever mess up, their parents will leave them — and that’s scary,” Sawyer, now 38, said in a recent interview from her home in Pascagoula, Miss. “The shunning is supposed to make us miss them so much that we’ll come back. … It didn’t work.”\n\nSawyer and many others like her now are denouncing the church's shunning practices in wake of a recent murder-suicide in Keego Harbor, Mich., that killed a family of four former Jehovah’s Witnesses who were ostracized after leaving the faith.\n\n► Feb. 11:As details of Burning Man suicide emerge, family grieves anew\n\n► Dec. 13: Lawmaker dies of suicide days after being accused of sexual abuse\n\nThe deaths sparked outrage among scores of ex-practitioners of the faith nationwide who took to Facebook, online forums, blogs and YouTube, arguing that the tragedy highlights a pervasive yet rarely publicized problem within the church: Shunning is pushing the most vulnerable people over the edge and tearing families apart, they say.\n\nIn the Michigan case, a distraught mother shot and killed her husband, her two grown children and herself in their home about 25 miles northwest of Detroit, shocking the small and quiet community.\n\nThey chose to leave\n\nThe shooter was Lauren Stuart, a part-time model and personal trainer who struggled with depression and spent much of her time working on her house, her friends said. She and her husband, Daniel Stuart, 47, left the Jehovah's Witnesses faith more than a decade ago over doctrinal and social issues.\n\nAmong them was their desire to send their kids to college, which many former Jehovah's Witnesses say the church frowns and views as spiritually dangerous.\n\n“University and college campuses are notorious for bad behavior​ — drug and alcohol abuse, immorality, cheating, hazing, and the list goes on,” read an Oct. 1, 2005, article in Watchtower, the church's official publication that is not available online until 2008 editions.\n\n► Nov. 20:How other countries can help us understand U.S. mass shooting crisis\n\n► Oct. 14:Mom kills 2 sons, herself. But why did she do it?\n\nThe Stuarts sent both their kids to college: Steven Stuart, 27, excelled in computers, just like his father, who was a data solutions architect for the University of Michigan Medical School. Bethany Stuart, 24, thrived in art and graphic design.\n\nAfter the parents left the faith, the Stuarts were ostracized by the members of the Kingdom Hall — the churches where Jehovah's Witnesses worship — in nearby Union Lake, Mich., and their families, friends said.\n\nLauren Stuart, whose mother died of cancer when she was 12, struggled with mental illness that went untreated, isolation and fears that the end was near, friends and officials familiar with the case said. One friend who requested anonymity said she believes the killing was the result of depression, not religion.\n\nLongtime family friend Joyce Taylor, 58, of White Lake, Mich., believes depression, shunning and religion-based doomsday fears all played a role. She said that about six weeks before the killings, Lauren Stuart started getting religiously preoccupied and telling her, \"It's the end times. I know it is.\"\n\nWeeks later, Taylor saw her friend again. Lauren Stuart had a vacant look in her eyes.\n\nShe was emotionally distressed.\n\nA week later, with her home decorated for Valentine's Day, Lauren Stuart killed her family. She left behind a suicide note.\n\n\"She said in the suicide note that she felt that by killing them it was the only way to save them,\" recalled Taylor, who said police let her read the letter. \"She said she's sorry that she has to do this, but it was the only way to save them all.\"\n\nTaylor, a former Jehovah's Witness herself who left the faith in 1986, explained: \"Jehovah's Witnesses believe that if you die on this side of Armageddon, you'll be resurrected in paradise.\"\n\n► June 1:Persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia intensifies\n\n► April 20:Russian court bans Jehovah's Witnesses as extremist group\n\nIn Lauren Stuart's case, Taylor believes her friend never deprogrammed after leaving the church — a state she describes as \"physically out, but mentally in.\" She believes that Lauren Stuart's indoctrinated doomsday fears never left her and that the shunning helped push her over the edge.\n\nIf her tight-knit community that once was her entire support system had not excommunicated her — and left her with no one to share her fears with — Lauren Stuart may not have done what she did, Taylor believes.\n\n\"People do things when they are desperate,\" Taylor said. \"And that was an extreme, desperate act.\"\n\nShunning \"can lead to great trauma among people because the Jehovah's Witnesses are a very tight-knit community,\" said Mathew Schmalz, a religious studies associate professor at the College of Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass.\n\n\"If you're separated out, you're really left to your own devices in ways that are very challenging and very painful,\" Schmalz said. \"Once you leave a group that's been your whole life, letting that go is a kind of death.\"\n\nPolice have not yet disclosed details about the death of the Stuart family except for calling it a murder-suicide.\n\nThe tragedy has emboldened many once-quiet ex-Jehovah's Witnesses to speak up. Many say they suffered quietly on their own for years until they discovered an online community full of isolated, ostracized people like themselves — people who had lost someone to suicide or attempted suicide themselves because their families, friends and church community had written them off for making mistakes, for being human.\n\nThe church calls it being \"disfellowshipped.\" Members can return if they repent, change the behavior and prove themselves worthy of being reinstated. But unless or until that happens, members are encouraged to avoid the sinners, especially those who leave the faith.\n\nMothers go years, even decades, without talking to their children.\n\nSiblings write off siblings.\n\nFriends shun friends.\n\nAn estimated 70,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses are disfellowshipped every year — roughly 1% of the church’s total population, according to data published by the Watchtower.\n\n► April 12:Body of judge on New York's highest court found in Hudson River\n\n► January 2017:Michigan officers stop suicide just in time\n\nTheir names are published at local Kingdom Halls. Of those, two-thirds never return.\n\nHowever, within a faith representing 8.4 million people worldwide, many members believe the religion is pure, good and loving. Those who are speaking against it are disgruntled and angry people who have an ax to grind because they were disfellowshipped, current members argue.\n\nOr, they are lost souls who have misinterpreted the meaning and love behind the faith. Members say they believe that the shunning accusations are exaggerated and the suicides are often more about mental illness than ostracism.\n\n► June 2016:Mom who stabbed self killed her three sons first, police say\n\n► June 2016:Is there a psychology of hate we need to understand better?\n\nMany of those who have left the religion disagree.\n\nIn the world of ex-Jehovah’s Witnesses, they maintain that the shunned are considered dead to their families, just like the suicide victims.\n\nThese are their stories.\n\n‘A dangerous cult’\n\nThe conversation was difficult to wrap her 8-year-old brain around.\n\n“You know your sister was being bad, right?“ Sawyer recalled her mother telling her after her sister's suicide.\n\n“And what she did was stupid, right?’ … To take your own life is very wrong,\" her mother continued.\n\n“I didn’t understand what was going on … and I said, ‘Oh. OK,’ “ Sawyer recalled. “In my 8-year-old brain, I was thinking, ‘When I mess up, my mom’s going to hate me.’ \"\n\nAnd so began her painful journey with the Jehovah’s Witnesses faith, the religion she was born into and grew up in in Pascagoula, Miss., where her fears of abandonment took hold at age 8.\n\n► March 2016:Former Army Reservist kills family, self\n\n► March 2016:Cannabis church founder says he was defamed\n\nSawyer believes that the shunning drove her sister to suicide. After the church disfellowshipped her for getting engaged to a non-Jehovah's Witness, the fiancé left, and her sister was thrown into depression.\n\nHer sister tried turning to her mother for consolation. But her mom would read scripture and tell her, \"Until you start acting right, you’re going to have these bad things happen to you.“\n\nBad things happened to Sawyer, too.\n\nAt 30, she sought a divorce from her husband because he was abusive and cheating on her, she said. But church elders and family pressured her to save her marriage.\n\n“I showed them the holes in my walls,” Sawyer said, referring to the damage her ex-husband did to the home during fights. “They told me to pray more … and sent me back home to him.”\n\nSawyer took up smoking to handle the stress, which got her disfellowshipped because smoking is not allowed.\n\nShe also went through with the divorce. She ended up losing her home to foreclosure and turned to her mother for help because she had two children to raise.\n\nHer mother took her in temporarily, but when church elders found out, they threatened to shun Sawyer’s mother. Her mother let the grandkids stay but not her daughter.\n\nSawyer ended up homeless for six months, living out of her car in a community college parking lot.\n\nShe landed on her feet with the help of a student loan. She got an apartment, a job as a hospice nurse and her children — now 10 and 18 — back.\n\nShe found herself but lost her family along the way.\n\n► January 2016:Dad likely torched home with gasoline\n\n► December 2015:Minister stripping away church knowledge gap on mental health\n\nHer mother doesn’t speak to her. Sawyer said she can’t recall the last time they spoke.\n\nHer sister in Alabama hasn’t spoken to her since Sawyer got divorced in 2010.\n\n“She was on my porch with my parents,\" Sawyer said. \"My sister looked at me and said, ‘You’re abandoning me just like Donna did’ and left. And that's the last thing she ever said to me.\"\n\nSawyer has kept silent about her pain for decades.\n\n“This is a dangerous cult,” she said of her former religion. “It’s important for people to realize. This is serious.”\n\nHe lost his daughter\n\nOn Feb. 3, 2011, the Utah church of Dave Gracey disfellowshipped him at age 61.\n\nBy then, he had been an elder three times — a job that troubled him as he often found himself judging and sanctioning people who had sinned in the eyes of the church: Smokers. Drug users. Adulterers. Homosexuals.\n\n“I had a terrible time with that,” Gracey said. “All we were doing was chasing people around and catching them in their sins and kicking them out.”\n\nBut then came the day the church judged his own children. That's when Gracey said he started rebelling.\n\nIn 2010, Gracey’s 38-year-old daughter, Laura, committed suicide after a fallout with church elders.\n\n► September 2015:Town comes together for funeral of family shot by dad\n\n► February 2015:Missouri candidate dies of self-inflicted gunshot wound\n\n“It put me in an absolute rage,” he recalled.\n\nGracey's daughter was rebellious growing up and suffered from mental illness, he said. She got into drugs and became homeless at one point but tried to get her life in order.\n\nAt 33, she was baptized as a Jehovah's Witness and over the next four years she was disfellowshipped twice and reinstated twice.\n\nBut in January 2010, following a meeting with church elders, Gracey's daughter fatally overdosed on prescription medication. She had been living in an apartment complex with other Jehovah's Witnesses in California and had a medical marijuana card for anxiety and stress.\n\nGracey suspects his daughter told the elders about the card.\n\n“The elders won’t tell me why they met with her,” Gracey said. “Obviously, she was distressed that night, and they left her alone. They knew how fragile my daughter was. … It’s my guess that they excommunicated her that night, but they won’t tell me. They failed to protect her in her most vulnerable state.”\n\nThat same year, Gracey would suffer more heartache at the hands of his church. His 14-year-old stepdaughter had been raped, but the elders didn’t believe her, he said.\n\nAn investigation followed and an administrative judge and child protective services made a finding that the Jehovah's Witnesses were guilty of child maltreatment.\n\nThe church mounted a campaign to oust the Graceys of Layton, Utah, who appealed to the Jehovah’s Witnesses' headquarters in Warwick, N.Y., in the New York City metro area, claiming the church had harmed their daughter.\n\nOn Feb. 3, 2011, the Graceys were excommunicated.\n\n“We were so indoctrinated. We had difficulty with it,” Gracey said, noting he and his wife officially left the faith in March 2013 after getting shunned repeatedly.\n\n► January 2015:Parents killed selves, kids fearing apocalypse\n\n► July 2013:Rick Warren returns to pulpit after son's suicide\n\n“I walked out and never came back,” Gracey said. “I started kind of waking up.”\n\nGracey, who considers himself agnostic now, is focused on helping all of his family escape the Jehovah's Witnesses organization.\n\n“I want to expose this religion for what they really are. It is a cult that splits up families and separates people from life. … They seem nice on Saturday morning when they are peddling their Watchtower, but they are insidious.”\n\n‘I’ve been sick over this'\n\nFor Californian Kerry Kaye, the Keego Harbor killings triggered a host of emotions: anger, pain, frustration.\n\nShe, too, is a former member of the Jehovah's Witnesses community and lost a very good friend to suicide more than 20 years ago.\n\n“I’ve just been sick over this. It brings back a lot of memories,” Kaye said of the Michigan killings in a recent telephone interview.\n\nKaye was in her early 20s when her friend committed suicide after being disfellowshipped for getting pregnant out of wedlock. The woman was 20 years old and seven months pregnant at the time.\n\nKaye said her friend tried to get back into the church, but the elders told her, “No, you need more time. You’re not qualified to come back.“\n\n► July 2013:Indiana mom, 2 kids' drowning deaths called accident\n\n► May 2013:Man commits suicide inside Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral\n\nThat day, the friend went home and shot herself in the heart, Kaye said.\n\n“If you’re in the organization, you understand the depression and despair,” said Kaye, who explained that when someone gets disfellowshipped, word spreads fast in the church. She admits that she once shunned her own father at the direction of the church.\n\n“The moment they make an announcement, you’re not allowed to have contact with them whatsoever. You have to pretend they’re dead,” Kaye said. “That’s how they control the people. It’s a fear tactic. It’s to keep them in the cult, under their control.”\n\nKaye was 24 when she left the church. Her father had left the faith a few years earlier after the church pressured him to leave his government job, telling him he had to choose the faith or his work.\n\nHe picked the job and disassociated himself.\n\nKaye was forced to shun her father or face consequences, she said.\n\n“I didn’t talk to my father for almost two years, and then I finally had enough,” Kaye said. “I started to try to make an escape.”\n\nIt wasn’t easy. After she left, she said she became suicidal.\n\nDoctors intervened and saved her life, she said. Eventually, she moved away from her hometown to the Los Angeles area to raise her three children on her own, outside the organization.\n\nThey are all college educated now and thriving, she said. And she has found peace as she has dedicated herself to helping others who feel trapped in the denomination.\n\n“I’m wonderful since I left,” Kaye said. “My mission is to help other people. When entire families are destroyed, it makes all of us who have been involved in this cult very angry. We want people to know what is really going on.”\n\n‘We love everyone’\n\nAlmost 8.5 million people are Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide, including 1.2 million in the United States, according to the JW.org website.\n\nWe come from hundreds of ethnic and language backgrounds, yet we are united by common goals. Above all, we want to honor Jehovah, the God of the Bible and the Creator of all things. We do our best to imitate Jesus Christ and are proud to be called Christians. Each of us regularly spends time helping people learn about the Bible and God’s Kingdom. Because we witness, or talk, about Jehovah God and his Kingdom, we are known as Jehovah’s Witnesses.\n\nThe Jehovah’s Witnesses national organization did not return calls and e-mails from the Free Press for comment on the subject of disfellowshipping. Multiple members and elders were contacted, but all declined to speak on the record, many saying they were not authorized to publicly comment on scripture and church teachings.\n\nHowever, following the Keego Harbor killings, numerous current Jehovah’s Witnesses contacted the Free Press to defend their religion, stressing it is about unconditional love, peace, helping people and having an unwavering commitment to God and Jesus Christ.\n\nBut like many religions, Jehovah's Witnesses have rules to follow — such as no stealing, killing, committing adultery, smoking or getting intoxicated on alcohol or drugs. If one commits any of these acts, they can be disfellowshipped, but they can get back in if they truly repent and change their behavior.\n\nThey, too, did not want to have their names published.\n\nMisunderstood denomination\n\nSchmalz, the religious studies professor, said mainstream Christians often misunderstand the Jehovah's Witnesses' faith. Their beliefs may seem \"unorthodox\" to other religious groups and their rules too strict or extreme.\n\nBut Jehovah's Witnesses, a Protestant denomination that began in the 1870s as a Bible study group in Pittsburgh, have rational reasons for much of what they believe and do, he said.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses believe in a \"great cataclysm,\" that \" 'the end is near' is continually imminent,\" he said. When you are brought up with that belief within a strong and tightly knit religious setting, it is hard to shake.\n\n► April 2013:Churches shed light on suicide, depression\n\n► April 2013:Pastor Rick Warren blames son's death on depression\n\n\"This belief in Armageddon, which is central to the Jehovah's Witness worldview, is something that still retains its power — even for people who have left,\" said Schmalz, who teaches a course in modern religious movements with discussions about Jehovah's Witnesses and Scientology. Author L. Ron Hubbard founded Scientology in the early 1950s in Los Angeles.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses aren't alone in the practice of shunning, Schmalz said. The Amish and other Mennonite groups ostracize those who leave the faith, too.\n\nHe said Jehovah's Witnesses have two goals in mind when they disfellowship someone:\n\n1. They need a mechanism to discipline people who don't abide by their tenets.\n\n2. They are trying to create a pure community whose members adhere to the group's beliefs and tenets.\n\nThis practice can be harmful, he said. But members have a rationale for the behavior.\n\n\"How is disfellowshipping really that different from tough love, where you hold people accountable for their actions? It's a complicated question,\" said Schmalz, who is opposed to using the word \"cult\" to describe the Jehovah's Witness church.\n\n\"We should look at the Jehovah's Witnesses not as a bizarre religious group but as a religion that has its own internal means of discipline,\" he said. \"They can be very harsh and have very unintended and tragic consequences.\"\n\nFollow Tresa Baldas on Twitter: @Tbaldas", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/30/us/csu-caste-protections-universities-cec/index.html", "title": "Colleges and universities across the US are moving to ban caste ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOn paper, the change was subtle – the word “caste” appearing in parentheses after the term “race and ethnicity.”\n\nBut for many advocates and student leaders, the tweak to California State University’s anti-discrimination policy that quietly went into effect on January 1 was a civil rights victory: An acknowledgment from the nation’s largest, four-year public university system that the insidious form of oppression that has long haunted some on campus is, in fact, real.\n\nCaste-oppressed students, who mostly hail from South Asian immigrant and diaspora backgrounds, say that casteism tends to manifest in US colleges and universities through slurs, microaggressions and social exclusion. But because these dynamics play out within these minority communities, most other Americans have little understanding of how they operate – leaving these students, many of whom refer to themselves as Dalits, without recourse.\n\nThe move by Cal State, which came after nearly two years of student organizing, stands to change that. By explicitly mentioning caste in its anti-discrimination policy, Cal State has made it a protected status, thereby prohibiting caste-based discrimination, harassment or retaliation. For a university system with more than 485,000 students and about 56,000 faculty and staff members, that could have significant implications.\n\n“This is very important for us because we can feel safer,” said Prem Pariyar, a recent alumnus of Cal State East Bay who helped advocate for caste protections across CSU’s 23 campuses. “At least the university has a policy to recognize our pain and to recognize our issues.”\n\nNow that Cal State has declared caste a protected status, Dalit students and employees on its campuses have an avenue for accountability, activists said. And now that the largest university system in the country’s most populous state has committed to caste protections, they hope that the movement for caste equity will continue to grow.\n\nCaste has followed South Asians to the US\n\nOriginating in ancient India, the caste system is a social hierarchy that historically assigned people to groups based on their occupations or work (karma) and obligations or religious duty (dharma). The system would evolve to assign a certain degree of “spiritual purity” based on the family they were born into. That degree of so-called purity, in turn, determined the path of a person’s life: their rank in society, their career options, what they ate and who they married. At the bottom of the hierarchy, considered so low that they are relegated to the most undesirable jobs in society, are the Dalits.\n\nThough the caste system and caste-based discrimination have been legally outlawed in India and other South Asian countries, its legacy persists in cultural and systemic ways, extending beyond Hinduism and India to other South Asian religions and regions. And as South Asians migrate across continents and oceans, they often bring caste with them.\n\nThat was the experience for Pariyar, who is a Dalit Hindu and moved to the US from Nepal in 2015 in part, he said, to escape caste oppression. He said his family faced discrimination and violence from dominant caste Nepalis both because of their caste and their outspokenness on such injustices. By coming to the US, Pariyar assumed he would be leaving that all behind.\n\n“I thought at that time that now I don’t have to experience caste discrimination because the US is different. In the US, the South Asian diaspora, including the Nepali diaspora, are educated … so they don’t believe in caste discrimination,” he said. “But I was wrong. Totally wrong.”\n\nCaste seemed to follow Pariyar even in California. Unlike other Dalits he encountered in the US, Pariyar didn’t hide his last name, which gave away his caste identity. But he said he found that his transparency colored his interactions with caste-privileged Nepalis. He felt their tone of voice and behavior toward him change once they learned his full name. At gatherings in the homes of other community members, he said he would be given a plate of food while others were allowed to serve themselves – implying that his handling of the food might somehow pollute it.\n\nWhen Pariyar enrolled in a graduate program at Cal State East Bay in 2019, he found that he couldn’t escape caste there either. While waiting at a Bay Area rapid transit station on one occasion, he encountered two Nepali students and introduced himself. Their conversation was warm, he said, until they asked for his name. When he told them, Pariyar said they looked him up and down and appeared uncomfortable. Their reaction was humiliating.\n\n“Why? Why do they do that?” Pariyar said. “They were surprised seeing a Nepali Dalit from ‘untouchable’ community going to their university.”\n\nPrem Pariyar, who left Nepal for the US to escape caste oppression, launched the fight for caste protections at Cal State East Bay. Nani Walker/Los Angeles Times/Shutterstock\n\nAnother time, Pariyar brought up his experiences with caste discrimination during a classroom discussion about the trauma of racism and sexism. Some South Asian students in the class, he said, reacted as though caste discrimination was completely foreign to them. He felt they were effectively gaslighting him. And when he tried to organize a conference on issues of caste, Pariyar said he got little support from other South Asians.\n\nStill, Pariyar pushed ahead with his efforts to secure caste protections. As a result of his advocacy, the department of social work at Cal State East Bay – where Pariyar was pursuing a master’s degree – updated its mission statement to acknowledge caste discrimination. The academic senate of Cal State East Bay passed a resolution calling for caste protections, and other campuses followed. Eventually, Pariyar and a coalition of other activists and allies across various faiths and caste backgrounds banded together to try and get caste discrimination banned across the entire Cal State system.\n\nThough their goal – getting the word “caste” added to Cal State’s non-discrimination policy – was modest, they said they faced resistance along the way.\n\nThe opposition against caste protections\n\nWhen the California State Student Association met in April 2021 to discuss a resolution calling for a ban on caste discrimination, several people pushed back against it.\n\nThe opponents, who included alumni, professors and community members, argued that discussions about caste unnecessarily divided South Asians and that caste discrimination no longer existed. They claimed that caste was a construct of British colonialism, even though it had existed for millennia, and insisted that the resolution would instead provoke hate against Hindus on campus.\n\nKrystal Raynes, a student at Cal State Bakersfield who currently serves as a CSU student trustee, wasn’t familiar with caste and caste-based discrimination before that meeting. But the language and line of reasoning she heard that day rang familiar.\n\n“It reminded me so much of the discrimination happening against Black people in America,” she said. “Black students being gaslighted, [being told] your experience isn’t discrimination, your experience isn’t oppression.”\n\nAn activist protests against the alleged gang-rape and murder of a caste-oppressed, teenage woman in Mumbai on October 6, 2020. Punit Paranjpe/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of the Dalit rights organization Equality Labs, likened the gaslighting, denial and misinformation around frank discussions of caste oppression to the conservative campaign against “critical race theory,” which has since become a catch-all term for any instruction around the history of racism in the US.\n\n“It makes people feel uncomfortable,” she said. “But discomfort can be a doorway to learning more about ourselves and having greater connection with each other.”\n\nIn the end, despite the dissenting voices, the California State Student Association passed the resolution calling on the university system to ban caste discrimination. Cal State’s faculty union showed its support by including caste as a protected category in its collective bargaining agreement. And ultimately, Cal State added caste protections for its students and employees.\n\n“The CSU takes a great amount of pride in serving an incredibly diverse group of students and employing a diverse workforce,” Michael Uhlenkamp, a spokesperson for the Cal State system, wrote in an email to CNN. “The inclusion of caste in the policy reflects the university’s commitment to inclusivity and respect, ensuring that all members of the CSU’s 23 campus communities feel welcome.”\n\nDalit alumni reflect on the past and future\n\nFor Dalit alumni who once faced caste-based microaggressions on Cal State’s campuses, the university’s move to make caste a protected category was a step in the right direction.\n\nNeha Singh, who asked that her real name not be published to protect her caste identity, said she wished that campus leaders had an understanding of caste oppression during her time at Cal State Northridge in the late 2000s so that she would have had somewhere to turn to for guidance.\n\nShe recalls members of South Asian student groups making derogatory comments about oppressed castes in casual conversation, how one friend shunned her after learning Singh’s caste identity and how she felt afraid to speak up when witnessing caste discrimination against a fellow student by a dominant caste staff member for fear that she might out her own caste.\n\nThe change makes Singh hopeful about the environment for future Cal State Dalit students.\n\n“The students who are coming there will be free from discrimination and fear and can openly complain about it,” she said. “They would know that someone can understand … [that] they can come and have a safe place.”\n\nM. Bangar, who attended Cal State Sacramento and also requested to use an alias, knows that simply having caste protections won’t solve the problem of caste oppression on campus. But it could prompt others to be more considerate.\n\n“At the end of the day, you can’t force someone to not be casteist, but you can force them to be careful about how they’re casteist or what they say,” Bangar said. “These caste protections create an opportunity for people to report the things that they face.”\n\nThe movement is only growing\n\nCal State’s move to make caste a protected category is the latest in a growing movement at US colleges and universities.\n\nIn the last few months, the University of California, Davis, Harvard University and Colby College all added caste to their non-discrimination policies, while Brandeis University set an early example by doing so in 2019. And since the development at Cal State, Soundararajan said that the phones at Equality Labs “have been going off the hook” with other universities seeking to make the same changes.\n\nAt Colby College, efforts are now shifting to how its policy might be put into action. Sonja Thomas, who spearheaded the effort to secure caste protections there, said she wants to get caste added to the school’s bias reporting and prevention system.\n\nColby College is among several US colleges and universities that have banned caste discrimination in recent months. Robert F. Bukaty/AP\n\n“We need to take the second step, which is then implement policies for people to recognize when it’s happening so that there’s recourse for people who might be affected by caste discrimination,” said Thomas, who is also an associate professor of women’s gender and sexuality studies at Colby.\n\nOutside academia, two ongoing legal battles have brought attention to the ways casteism functions in the US.\n\nIn 2020, California authorities filed a lawsuit against Cisco Systems and two of its employees for allegedly discriminating against a Dalit engineer. (Cisco has denied the allegations and said it would “vigorously defend itself.”) And last year, a federal lawsuit alleged that a prominent Hindu sect lured hundreds of caste-oppressed workers to the US to work on temples for low pay and under dangerous conditions. (The organization’s leaders denied wrongdoing and called the workers “volunteers.”)\n\nAnd in addition to universities, the California Democratic Party and prominent labor unions – such as the Alphabet Workers Union – have come out in support of caste protections.\n\nPariyar, who started the movement at Cal State, hopes that this is only the beginning. At the university level, he wants to see caste competency trainings so that students and leaders are equipped to recognize and respond to bias incidents. But he isn’t stopping there – he said he’s currently talking to members of the California state assembly about potentially instituting caste protections statewide.\n\nPariyar said he believes casteism has taken root in the US and that the issue should concern not just South Asians or those who are caste-oppressed.\n\n“It must be the issue for everyone.”", "authors": ["Harmeet Kaur"], "publish_date": "2022/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/09/11/hardest-colleges-to-get-into/40090323/", "title": "Ivy League schools headline some of the hardest colleges to get into", "text": "Samuel Stebbins\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nAbout 16.9 million students will attend America’s college campuses this year to either begin or continue their undergraduate studies.\n\nHow beneficial a bachelor’s degree is can vary, in part depending on the name of the institution that issued it.

Schools that had no data on SAT and ACT scores were excluded from consideration. For schools that did not have a net price figure for the 2017-2018, the net price for the previous year was given. All other data is for the 2017-2018 school year.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

It's Notre Dame hoops chat time. Just a little bit has changed (OK, a whole lot has changed) since we were last here around these parts in mid-November. You have to have questions. You have to have comments. We're here for you, for however long it takes. To participate, make sure to include your name and hometown. And with that, you know the rest... let's light this chat candle.\n\nWayne: I hate to think about next season already, but depending on who is back and the great class coming in, who do you think does come back?\n\nTom Noie: Wayne: There's a LOT to like about what next season might look like. How about this - what if EVERYBODY decides to come back? That would include graduate transfer Paul Atkinson if - and that's a big if - the NCAA eventually rules that Ivy League players past and present can get that COVID year back. It was generally assumed that Dane Goodwin, Cormac Ryan and Trey Wertz would return for their fifth years. Nate Laszewski was a question mark and Prentiss Hubb was a doubtful. But what if they all decide to run it back. And Blake Wesley realizes he really needs another year. What then? Nobody on the current roster will 100 percent commit to next season, but it is there.\n\nTyler B: Another year (though it's been awhile) where ND hoops is showing they can play with the best of the best in the ACC. What can they be doing better to turn on-court success into recruiting success to help everything snowball for the better?\n\nTom Noie: Tyler: Getting the highest-ranked recruiting class in Mike Brey's tenure is a good place to start. J.J. Starling is generational good. Ven-Allen Lubin might be really good. Dom Campbell can be really good down the line. Now build on it with the right pieces. It wasn't that recruiting took a total backseat the last few years. It was Mike Brey putting all his trust and belief and confidence into this current senior class. He wasn't going to recruit over them, believing that they would deliver. They're delivering. This staff will recruit.\n\nTyler B: Are you surprised that Trey Wertz hasn't had a larger/role bigger impact at ND? Do we just always have too high of expectations for transfers?\n\nTom Noie: Tyler: Trey Wertz was really good at North Carolina State in the second half (which forced Blake Wesley to sit and watch) and helped win the Louisville game. Wertz's arc at Notre Dame is similar to Cormac Ryan. That neither had the benefit prior to the 2020-21 season of playing summer pickup with their veteran teammates (there was no summer program that year) really put him and Ryan behind. It's taken this long for them to figure out where they fit, where their games fit. They're both part of a really crowded perimeter. It's been hard at times, but they've both persevered. Maybe now we're seeing what they truly can do.\n\nTyler B: Even when ND is kicking butt in the ACC, there are always naturally skeptics questioning whether its fool's gold or not. How's the feeling around the locker room by comparison -- do the guys truly believe they can go out and win some big games? Felt like the previous Elite Eight teams had true, deep believes in themselves\n\nTom Noie: Tyler: There's a belief, a swagger, a confidence that might even border on cockiness, that these guys are just going to get it done. On the court, it's gone from, here we go again when other teams make a run and make it close or take a lead to yeah, they're going to figure it out. The North Carolina State and Louisville games are the most recent examples. Notre Dame would've likely lost those games the last two/three years. But the Irish insist they don't get rattled. They embrace having to figure it out in close games. Like, how's it all going to unfold? Then they go and get another one. It's been a really intriguing group to watch grow and kind of just believe that, yeah, we're pretty good.\n\nJoe from St. Petersburg: Hi Tom - I understand the short bench and I know you dislike hearing about it. But We all know how this ends. When the tourney comes (ACC and NCAA tourney) it becomes a major issue. I just don't understand how Brey doesn't start at least giving others some run if they want make serious noise. If its just about getting a bid, fine. But if you want to make it to, dare I say, the second weekend - this group will be burnt out before that happens.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: I knew this topic was going to be a hot one today. It really shouldn't be. Look at the current minutes played in the ACC. You'd think that with playing only seven guys with Nate Laszewski healthy that Notre Dame would dominate that statistical category. Dane Goodwin the only Irish in the top 10 for minutes played. Goodwin and Wesley the only Irish in the top 25. Mike Brey made it crystal clear from the start of the season - he was going with those seven guys and only those seven guys. Everybody knew that. The guys in the 8-9-10 spots didn't necessarily like it, but they accepted it. Like, OK, this is the way this season is going to go. Mike Brey isn't alone in when it comes to shorter rotations. The fewer, he feels, the better. It leads to the cohesiveness and continuity that Notre Dame has shown the last three league wins. The other guys, they'll have their time. They know it. They accept it. They don't have to like it, but it's working....\n\nTom Noie: ...However this season unfolds, it's not going to be because Matt Zona didn't play more or Tony Sanders didn't play more or J.R. Konieczny didn't play more. It just isn't. Mike Brey believes the Irish are better with the seven in the rotation.\n\nEric G: Why do you think that Brey didn’t insert Zona when Atkinson had to go to bench with foul trouble, when ND was having trouble with that small lineup?\n\nTom Noie: Eric: His seven are on the floor (or the rotation). Again, if he believed that Matt Zona could help, he'd play. Right now, Notre Dame is best having only those seven guys.\n\nEricD: Hi Tom, looking at rest of schedule, if ND loses the Wake Forest and FSU games on the road, do you think they will still have enough juice to make the Big Dance?\n\nTom Noie: Eric: Losing those games (and are we really sure Florida State is that formidable at home? It just lost to Pittsburgh) and none other would give Notre Dame a 15-5 league record. Down year or not, 15 wins in the ACC gets you into the NCAA tournament. Book it.\n\nMike, Rochester, NY: Any idea whether we might be looking to add another HS recruit to the excellent class coming in next year?\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Not likely, mainly because you need to see how the returning player decisions shake out. Are Goodwin-Ryan-Wertz all coming back? Seems to trend that way. What about Laszewski? Heck, what about Hubb? Paul Atkinson? You have three really talented freshmen coming in next season. There's no room. Or need.\n\nJim in Charlottesville: How did the Irish simplify the Offense to make it more efficient and effective--cleaner-- as it looks to have become? Should Cormac Ryan hunt shots more than he seems to be doing now? Do you think Mike Brey makes this harder to do by not incorporating man screens into the Offense?\n\nTom Noie: Jim: Great question. More motion, less standing around. Get guys moving and cutting and passing and screening, then rolling. It was really trial and error early. Notre Dame didn't know what it had in Paul Atkinson and how his game would translate in the ACC. It didn't know if Blake Wesley was ready to do what he's done. Once Mike Brey saw it, it was like, OK, now we're doing this...and playing this way....get the ball in Wesley's hands more, get it out of Hubb's and let him be a spot-up guy on occasion. Get Goodwin to his sweet spots. Play screen and roll with Atkinson. Mike Brey mentioned last night that the game offensively has finally slowed down for Cormac Ryan to the point where he believes Ryan has another level to hit offensively. That's something to keep an eye on as we move toward March.\n\nMorgan McKinley: Tom - I missed these. You might remember me as The Front Line Brey Defender. Because there are idiots across the country and we get to read comments from some of them over the years that Mike’s a horrible coach and should be fired because they have a better coach who will without a doubt do better than he has for the past 20+ years, I’d like to get your take on why this year (obviously Atkinson & Wesley) and 2015 & 16 teams and 2011 (Ben?) and others are successful and others are okay and a few bad seasons?? Of course the top level guys almost never if ever come to ND, and athletically is Blake his best and maybe only elite athlete (besides Pat I can’t think of one but Pat couldn’t slash to the hoop as well)\n\nTom Noie: Morgan: A voice of reason! We still need to have that around these parts. Everybody wanted those Elite Eight runs of 2015 and 2016 to be the norm instead of the exception, but they never were going to be that. They just weren't. Let's look at what happened since 2016 and why it happened - the Irish piggy-backed the Elite Eight runs by going 12-6 and getting to the NCAA tournament in 2017 before running into the West Virginia buzzsaw. That's going to happen. Following year, they win Maui but lose their two best players (Bonzie Colson and Matt Farrell) for extended time to injuries. Still, they were the 69th team in the 68-team field. They should've gotten in. Next year, they lose the one veteran perimeter guy they couldn't afford to lose to injury (Rex Pflueger) and have to play freshmen who were nowhere near ready. They go 3-15 in the league, but improve their league win total by seven (10-10) the following year. That was a huge bounce-back step...\n\nTom Noie: ...But then the pandemic hit and it wiped out any chance of tasting postseason, if it was the NIT. Then last year was a complete wash. Notre Dame was holding on for its collective life during COVID. The Irish weren't living day to day as they were hour to hour. Still, they go 7-11 in the league and no postseason. This year was supposed to be what last year was and what last year could've been but wasn't. Mike Brey waited on this senior core to get it. Now they get it. They weren't that far off but when you're mired in what the Irish have been mired in since 2018-19, it feels like a lifetime. People get impatient, people get mad, people want coaches fired and players shown the door. Notre Dame stayed the course, and here's the payoff.\n\nDave from Alpha,NJ: Hi Tom. Thanks for having this hoops chat. Couple questions: any idea on the injury status of Robby Carmody?\n\nTom Noie: Dave: Robby Carmody likely will never play for Notre Dame, which is tough. Too many injuries, too much lost time. That train had to leave the station without him. He'll have to decide come spring what he wants out of his remaining seasons of eligibility - stay at Notre Dame and likely never play or transfer to a lower level of competition and get something out of his playing career. He's been a great teammate even during a bad situation. You feel for him, but understand that the Irish just had to keep moving.\n\nDave from Alpha,NJ: and do you think Greg Zona will ever get any meaningful playing time down the stretch?\n\nTom Noie: Dave: Greg Zona certainly isn't going to get any time, and likely neither will Matt Zona. Not this year. Keep working on his game, keep staying ready and see where that takes him.\n\nMark Oliver: Hi Tom, It sure looks like a top 4 seed in the ACC tourney and an NCAA bid are certainly in play for this team. Never would have thought that after the BC game. What do you think the team's ceiling can be this year - possible run to Sweet 16 with a few things and matchups going their way? And do you think at some point Brey needs to get at least a little bit more from players 8 on down?\n\nTom Noie: Mark: Great to hear from you again. Hard no on the idea of going deeper on the bench. Mike Brey has mentioned it several times over the last few months - it was going to be those seven guys and only those seven guys. Add an eighth or a ninth, and it disrupts the cohesion and continuity that we've seen from the seven (particularly in the first Louisville game). Mike Brey's not about to sacrifice that just to play more guys. It's seven and that's it. Today. Tomorrow. Next week.\n\nRonbo: What affect will Notre Dame’s conference opponents have in their chances of making the tourney? Do you realize that the six home and homes they have in the conference are against the bottom six teams in the standings. They play none of the top 9 more than once\n\nTom Noie: Ronbo: Notre Dame can only play the schedule that the league hands it. Like, they can't say, oh, let's shuffle out repeaters against Clemson and Boston College and Georgia Tech for Virginia and Wake and Duke. Just like it can only play an ACC schedule. It can't say, yeah, let's move to the Big Ten or the Big 12 and play some of those teams. The league is what it is. Down? Sure, but you win 13-14-15 games in the ACC no matter the year, you're an NCAA tournament team. What will separate Notre Dame from some of its league colleagues is its non-league schedule. It went out of league play and played people. That's going to be a big boost in about four weeks when a certain Sunday of selection surfaces.\n\nRonbo: Which of the academic seniors will be back next year? Is there anyway they could pull an extra year out of the hat for Atkinson? I love him and his hand and foot work around the hoop offensively .\n\nTom Noie: Ronbo: Asked and answered earlier, but it wouldn't be too far fetched that every single one of the seniors (and Atkinson depending on the NCAA) has a decision to make. Maybe some return. Maybe all return. Stay tuned.\n\nHoward, Gainesville, VA: You may have answered this at one point but … how did Jaden Ivey get away from Brey?\n\nTom Noie: Howard: You new around these parts? Matt Painter was the first to offer Jaden Ivey at a time when Notre Dame wasn't in position to offer at that point. That stayed with Ivey. The more Brey talked with Ivey, a player he's seen basically grow up on campus, the more he got the impression that Ivey wanted to get out of the shadow of the Golden Dome, where both of his parents were athletes, and set out on his own. Sometimes, you get a kid like that. You look at his hometown and say, well, why would he NOT go to Notre Dame? All the while, the kid is looking at it and wondering what else is out there in the world outside of Saint Joseph County? What it would be like to make a name for himself somewhere different than where his mother and father made theirs. Sometimes, you get a kid in Demetrius Jackson and know that he has no desire to go anywhere but Notre Dame. Sometimes you get a kid like Ivey and realize, yeah, he wants to see what's outside the Notre Dame bubble. Brey really had zero shot.\n\nChristian, Chicago IL: Tom, I am shocked more teams don’t press ND. Our ball handling under pressure is a real liability and we have escaped a few times with a lucky plays late in games (Virginia). Brey is rather casual on this topic but I am concerned we might blow a must win down the stretch here. Interested to hear your thoughts and hopefully I am overreacting…\n\nTom Noie: Christian: It's reached a point in league games of late where you just know the press and the traps and freneticism (is that even a word???) is coming from the opponent. Notre Dame still cannot figure it out to the point where it's not adventure, though there was a sign of hope last night against Louisville when it moved Dane Goodwin closer into the backcourt to be a pressure release guy. He's their best foul shooter, so he should always be involved in any press break. It's still an adventure. Like, buckle up, here it comes.\n\njoe from the south side: At the beginning of each of Mike Brey's, post-game, press conferences, you ask the first question. Is that due to seniority, talent, money, looks or some combination thereof? Part 2. The reporters' questions are inaudible in that situation and the listener is left to try to piece together info. based on Brey's response. Any chance you guys could get closer to the mike or ask Brey to repeat the question?\n\nTom Noie: When you've been on the beat for 24 years, it's an unwritten rule that you have the option of asking the first question. You just do. When they're on the road, I'm often the only local media guy there, so it's kind of up to me to get everything going. Happens also in football where I defer to the football guys who've been around the program longer. But no, it has nothing to do with money (I'll take more of it) or definitely not looks. The quiet mike thing is an in-house Notre Dame issues. Coaches and players want to get out of there ASAP. Not going to make them repeat questions.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Your thoughts on Wesley leaving for the NBA? My observation is that he is a year or two away. 1. His build is too slight. He is wearing down after a few dozen college games. Imagine playing 80 or 90 in the pros. He needs more muscle. 2. While he exhibits athleticism and some wiggle in his hips, I don't find him to be explosive. You can make 2 star guys from Pitt or BC look bad. Those kinds of players do not exist in the NBA. 3. Lastly, I thought the Duke game was a litmus test. That is as close to NBA level talent, top to bottom, as you will see in the ACC. Bad night for him, but also a talent level he couldn't solve. I think he needs at least one more year in school, in which case he may explode like Ivey did at Purdue. Right now, he is G League for a year or two. Your thoughts?\n\nTom Noie: This is all we need to know when it comes to Blake Wesley and the chances of his going to the NBA after this season. Does Blake Wesley have the talent right now to GO to the NBA. Yes. Given that league's penchant for drafting solely on potential, he'd fit the profile of what that league looks for and wants. But here comes the rub. Does Blake Wesley have the talent right now to STAY in the NBA? No. Just watch the last few games. There are obvious holes in his game, and in his shooting percentages that need work. He needs work. So he can go one of two ways - leave after this season and run the risk of being out of the league in three years if he doesn't go to the right team with the right coach at the right time, or come back and be good enough to follow the Jaden Ivey track. Do that, and Wesley has a chance to do what you really have to do - get to that second NBA contract. That's where the payoff is. Just getting there is enough for some, but he's talented enough to do more than that.\n\nTony: Tom, if we do not make the big dance. Do you think Coach Brey will be back? I don’t think Slo would come back fora one year gamble. Do you think Blake is ready for the NBA like the agents think? I think if he comes back and gets stronger it would benefit him. Thanks, go Irish!\n\nTom Noie: Tony: Mike Brey has a contract at Notre Dame that runs through 2024-25. I expect him to fulfill that obligation. After 2024-25, it's anybody's guess. And no, no player today is truly ready for the NBA, which mentioned earlier drafts almost entirely on potential. They don't want to miss on the next possible can't-miss prospect. Thing is, if they swing and miss and guys who should stay in school, well, there's always another guy coming down the college pipeline. It's an easy solve for them - grab a guy and if he hits, awesome. If he doesn't, thanks for the chance, but who's next?\n\nTony: Any news on the 2023 recruiting? Brey has to have another solid class.\n\nTom Noie: Tony: No, and it's too early for that. No, seriously. Notre Dame is in on a couple known juniors in Xavier Booker (Indianapolis Cathedral) and Aden Holloway (La Lumiere), but there's so much that still needs to shake out for Notre Dame to really zero in on what it needs. What will this current sophomore class do after this season? Can J.R. Konieczny take a big step this summer? How ready are Ven-Allen Lubin and Dom Campbell? There's also a variable that's allowed a lot of schools to take a different approach to recruiting. yeah, you have a tight wish list of main guys, but you also have the ever-evolving transfer portal, which can help teams like Notre Dame that like to get old and stay old to do just that. It's an area that will be more of a factor as we move forward, to the point where Notre Dame may spend more time mining the portal than traditional recruiting.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Honestly, I thought this team was dead following the Las Vegas trip and the disasters against the Big 10 and BC. Aside from Wesley in the starting lineup, what have you observed, what can you point to where the light went on for this team?\n\nTom Noie: Joe: There was just too much there for them not to be good. Or, be way better than what they were, especially early. Even in Vegas, and to an extent the Boston College game, Mike Brey wasn't sure what he had. He knew he wanted to ride that seven-man rotation, but didn't really know if he could. Maybe he'd have to go eight, nine, deep. Maybe he'd have to get those sophomores ready. The defensive principles that Anthony Solomon had preached since summer weren't all that evident. They kept drilling it and drilling it and getting those seven guys confident. More Wesley with the ball. Less of Hubb having to handle all the heavy lifting. That worked. Atkinson understanding what was expected of him in league play. That worked. Laszewski not thinking so much about being the scoring power forward and being more of the ringleader defensively who would rebound and rotate and guard guys. That worked. It was kind of like the perfect storm. You could see it brewing. It was only a matter of whether it would hit. It's hit.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, I am writing this before the LOUIS game. ND has a legit chance of 14 or 15 regular season league games. I know the ACC is the whipping boy of the day by the gurus and pundits, but C'MON. 15 wins in a Power 5 conference. There should be no question they are in the Tourney. I see places where MICH is in. That is a .500 team in conference and outside of the conference. Where do you feel ND fits in? To me, they look like Top 30, maybe a 7 or 8 seed, but not 11 or 12 and just barely hanging in there.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: You can drive yourself bananas wondering and worrying about where Notre Dame fits TODAY. i about fell off my couch when the ACC Network actually quoted Joe Lunardi during the North Carolina State game last week when he said he had Notre Dame among his last four teams in but ONLY if it beats North Carolina State. Wait, it was Feb. 5 for crying out loud. The Irish have seven league games left - four at home, three on the road. Win your home games, steal one more on the road and get to 15-5.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Couple of roster questions. ND has 12 on scholarship. Let's assume Atkinson, Hubb and Laz are gone. That is 9. What will they do with Carmody? Seems like he will never hoop for ND. Can he go to an academic scholarship or just graduate and move on? That may be 8. Any inkling Zona, Sanders or Taylor are unhappy? Next years bigs may push the incumbents for playing time. Wesley may go, who knows? My guess is ND might be down to 8 scholarship guys or even less. With only 3 coming in, he might be short on bodies. Any chance they are reaching out to Braeden Moore? I know they kicked the tires before and he committed to Rutgers. But he decommitted over 3 months ago and he is still out there. So the questions are what do you think about roster movement when the season ends and are they involved with anyone else for next year?\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Roster management is coming this offseason is ways we don't realize. Not only for Notre Dame, but every college basketball team. The transfer portal has changed the dynamic of keeping your roster intact from one season to the next. Mike Brey knows it. Mike Brey gets it. Only the guys whose time had run out here last year (Nik Djogo, Juwan Durham) left but Brey said it then that he knows that's going to be an exception rather than the rule. Somebody's going to go, somebody may arrive. The portal being the portal, they're always going to keep an eye out for next year. But as of now, too hard to say because we don't know what the roster is even going to possibly look like. That's a spring exercise. A big one. The Irish will figure it out.\n\nLee from Lancaster: Hi Tom, I know that you're not a women's basketball fan. However, will you at least admit the ND women's team with freshmen Olivia Miles and Sonia Citron along with Maya Dodson is at least somewhat fun to watch?\n\nTom Noie: Admitted.\n\nGreg, Las Vegas: A lot of talk about Brey and this potentially being his last year if the Irish do not make the tournament. How do you reconcile this with the incoming class with huge potential, Wesley staying at least another year, plus past success. I see Coach Brey as someone who is enjoying what he does, adjusting to new staff that seems to show progress, strong recruiting for 2023. Seems ending the run now would leave a few chips on the table. I get this senior class has not met expectations, but there are many others that have exceeded expectations.\n\nTom Noie: Greg: They talking among the slot machines and craps table on the Strip? There's no talk of that from the snow and cold of South Bend. Mike Brey's not going anywhere no matter how the rest of this season shakes out. Bet on it. And put $20 on 20 black for me. Or red. lol\n\nCaleb from Charlotte: Hi Tom, Paul Atkinson is a talented basketball player that is a very effective scorer in the low post. However, he doesn't seem to be able to consistently hit the mid-range jump shot. He also seems to struggle a little bit against the bigger post players. Do you think his game will be effective in the NBA?\n\nTom Noie: Caleb: Don't know and don't care. Why should we? Paul Atkinson's going to have an undergraduate degree from Yale and a Master's from Notre Dame. He'll play somewhere professionally and make some good money for a few years, then have those degrees to fall back on. You learn this when you cover Notre Dame hoops - it's not just about the NBA, and sometimes it's not about the NBA at all. Paul Atkinson is a really good college basketball player who's been exactly what the staff hoped he'd be this season, especially of late when he finally figured out how to be effective in the ACC. Don't think the NBA was ever mentioned when he was being recruited. And that's totally cool.\n\nGreg, Las Vegas: Bench beyond the chosen 7…are they really not strong enough to provide 2-3 minute breathers? Seems like a missed opportunity to develop game time experience. Are the balling out in practice and Brey’s trusts his historically short bench…or is the talent gap that large, even from a team that was 500 at best these last few years?\n\nTom Noie: Greg: Doesn't matter. Like, doesn't matter at all. Mike Brey made it clear in no uncertain terms that he was going with the main seven and the main seven. That was it. The guys on the back end don't have to like it, but they have accepted it. Get better, grow your games and be one of the guys in the mix next season. It has less than zero with not being able to play or not being good enough to play. It's where this program is - with an experienced seven who have it figured out. Ride them.\n\nBruce, Centralia, IL: Hello Tom, We thought Konieczny was the impact guy in this class. Instead, he has barely played, and Wesley is one of the best freshmen in the country. Two questions: (1) is defense the issue with Konieczny?; and (2) would you expect him to be in the rotation next year? Thanks for doing this.\n\nTom Noie: Bruce: Whoa, wait, what? No, J.R. Konieczny was a really good high school player, but at no time did anyone around South Bend or around Notre Dame (and I'm one of the few to be around both) think that he had the higher upside as a freshman than Blake Wesley. Wesley can do things on the court, make that did things, on the court last year that Konieczny didn't do. Konieczny scored a lot of points just shooting up over the top of 5-11 defenders. Wesley attacked the rim, found guys off the dribble. His game was 10 times more college ready as a freshman than Konieczny, who has the chance to be really good next season. But that's next season. Why not now? He considers himself a guard even though he's probably closer to 6-7. If he's a guard, whose minutes would he take this year? Notre Dame's got enough guards right now.\n\nCaleb from Charlotte: Hi Tom, when Nate L. sustained the injury and left the game and Paul A. got into foul trouble, Coach Brey chose to play with a small lineup rather than put Matt Zona into the game for a couple of minutes. Does Coach Brey trust Matt Zona or Elijah Taylor enough to play them for a couple of minutes?\n\nTom Noie: Caleb: Nowhere near to the point where he trusts the main seven guys in the rotation. And Elijah Taylor, honestly, he can't be trusted at all at this point. He's academically ineligible, so we won't see him until the fall.\n\nLee from Lancaster: Tom, Jaden Ivey would look good in the blue and gold. Was he not interested in coming to ND or did ND not bother to recruit him? Also, with 5 seconds left in the NCAA finals and ND down by 1 with the ball, who takes the final shot, Wesley of Hubb?\n\nTom Noie: Lee; Bit of both with Ivey, which was asked an answered earlier. As for the second part, there's no question. It's Prentiss Hubb. In November and December, it would've been and was Wesley, but as we saw Wednesday against Louisville, when Notre Dame needs it from Hubb in the clutch, he delivers. He may drive you completely nuts for the first 37 minutes, but then drops the dagger. Yeah, they're going to Hubb, though personally, give me Wesley with the ball near halfcourt, go one-four flat with maybe a ball screen and tell him to attack. Don't settle, which is what he tends to do. When he's attacking, he's tough to stop.\n\nDan: Who is coming back next year?\n\nTom Noie: Hopefully, me for Year No. 25. lol\n\nJim in Charlottesville: Glad to see the improved Notre Dame Defense! The Irish Guards seem to me to dominate rebounding on the defensive end. Do you have numbers that show this?\n\nTom Noie: Jim: The rebounding numbers were a little skewed for Wednesday's game against Louisville without Nate Laszewski, who averages 7.0. Dane Goodwin is at 5.0, Blake Wesley 3.4, Hubb 2.7, Ryan 4.6 and Wertz 2.0. They knew that without Laszewski, it had to be a collective effort. Atkinson grabbed 15, but when it's a team thing, with the guards getting on the glass, it's so much more effective. Still, it would be nice to have Laszewski back sooner than later.\n\nMatt from Fairfax, VA: Hey Tom, it's about time you had one of these chats! Thanks! The Irish are rolling, but it's never too soon to look toward the future. Any word on if Atkinson could be eligible to return next season? When will that be sorted out? And if eligible, would he want to return? Finally, care to predict who from the long-time core will return next season and who will be ready to move on?\n\nTom Noie: Matt; A popular topic today that's been asked and answered a couple times today. The possibility of Atkinson returning is intriguing. Nobody has given any indication on anything definite, saying it's something that will be sorted out when the season ends. I wouldn't be surprised if a bulk of the guys return. That could include Laszewski and even Hubb. Would be interesting.\n\nJim Tal, Valley Center, CA.: Hi Tom, great and timely work as always covering the Irish beat. Though things are certainly trending in a most positive direction this season after another gritty win last night, I want to ask a question as it relates to the 2022-23 campaign. Yes, it's very encouraging that Brey is bringing in a Top 20 ranked class but here's a cold, uncomfortable fact. If a number of the seniors elect to bypass the chance to return next year, it's hard to envision a scenario whereby ND doesn't suffer a huge drop off and falls right back into total mediocrity. As of now, do you have any inkling as to whom among Goodwin, Hubb, Nate, Ryan and Trey might be contemplating a return to South Bend? Lose three or more of those guys and it's time to turn out the lights because the party will probably be over!\n\nTom Noie: Jim: Whoa, the glass ain't half empty with you, it's broken and spilled all over the kitchen table. Turn out the lights? Seriously. Just the opposite. The party might just now be getting started. House a rockin, don't bother knockin.\n\nDave from West Covina, California: Hi Tom: I really enjoy your articles out here in Southern California! Why do you think Notre Dame does not go 2 for 1 when the half is winding down? I continuously see them get the ball with about 45 seconds and the seconds melt away but they could have two possessions in those 45 seconds?\n\nTom Noie: Dave: I got into writing at such an early age because I was told there'd be no math. The college shot clock is 30 seconds. That's a lot of work to do in a short time to get two possessions, no?😀\n\nVictor K.: Tom, we enjoy your coverage here in Salem. What is it that makes Anthony Solomon such an effective defensive coach?\n\nTom Noie: Victor: Come to town and spend five seconds around Anthony Solomon and you'd understand. You'd be ready and willing to run through a wall for the guy so as not to disappoint him. It's the perfect storm of a new coach with a new voice and new ideas with a team that was so starved to be better. They've maybe even exceeded expectations when it comes to defense. The Irish have held each of their last six league opponents to 65 or fewer points. That's never happened for them in ACC play. Cormac Ryan said it best the other day when we talked defense. He admitted that, yeah, having Slo and Antoni Wyche (zone) preach playing defense has been needed, but if the Irish didn't collectively take pride in defending, of guarding their guys and staying true to that, it wasn't going to work. It's worked.\n\nRyan mars pa: What do you think about this team so far go Irish can’t wait to watch the Irish play against Georgia Tech soon\n\nTom Noie: Ryan: Notre Dame's on a nice little run right now where the Irish have won 13 of 15 with those two losses over the last 55 days. It's all right there in front of them. Just keep competing and believing and just maybe....\n\nIrishHoopsFan: Who is your favorite clown?\n\nTom Noie: Bozo, is that you again? Remember what we talked about when using the computer?😀\n\nEd,Greensboro: Tom, great to have you and the chats back! Where in the world would we be without Atkinson? He has been spectacular.\n\nTom Noie: Ed: Probably where the program was the last couple seasons. He just gets it. He's an old guy who knows that he's not the most physically imposing guy out there but that doesn't meant that he can't influence games. He shoots a ridiculously high percentage. He competed his backside off against Louisville. There have been times this year when you look at Dane Goodwin and think, team most valuable player. Same with Blake Wesley. At times, Nate Laszewski was trending that way with what he was doing for a stretch. Second half of last night's game, I started thinking that of Atkinson. Guy just gets it.\n\nVictor K.: Also, Tom, what are your top three ND basketball halftime shows? If the list does not have Red Panda at number-one, you will have invalidated yourself.\n\nTom Noie: Victor feeling frisky today? No doubt, Red Panda is the halftime GOAT, but honestly, if your world travels have ever taken you overseas and you've been to Beijing to see a performance of the Beijing circus (no, really), they make Red Panda look like she's riding a tricycle and using paper plates. But I digress. It's 1. Red Panda, 2. Jesse White Tumblers (if you know, you know) and 3. The professional Simon Sez guy. Let's see you beat that troika.\n\nJason: Is a 7(now 6) man rotation smart or sustainable? Every year Breys teams look worn down. Is there really no one else on the bench that could play 5-10 minutes? I remember when J Grant and Pat C were sitting on in the bench and those guys both ended up in the nba\n\nTom Noie: Jason: For this group, it's both smart and sustainable. As long as all seven are healthy. Smart in that those seven think like one. You lose a lot of that, which results in too many empty possessions or missed defensive assignments with a Matt Zona or a Tony Sanders or a J.R. Konieczny, even for a few minutes. Those are chances that Mike Brey doesn't want to take. And the whole worn down narrative is sooooooooo stale. Look at the ACC league leaders for minutes. Notre Dame has one guy (Dane Goodwin) in the Top 10. Only two (Blake Wesley) in the Top 25. There's your tired legs for you.\n\nDanny: Love the content Tom! Quick question, what ever happened to the gold jersey? I know you brought up the gold (mustard) uniforms a few weeks ago. Is it the players who decide which uniforms to wear, or do those jerseys not even exist anymore?\n\nTom Noie: Danny: Mustard gold uniform references will get you in good with the chat host every single time. It's the players who decide what uniform to wear, but I also think the mustard golds were retired. They went through a run there with several alternative unis - black, gold, green - but have not gone that route. The mustard golds scream 2015. I'd make those permanent. But that's just me. The black and green also were sharp.\n\nEd,Greensboro: Tom , looks like Brey’s staff shakeup is producing great results.Have the players indicated to you that they are happy as well?\n\nTom Noie: Ed: not really, they're not the kind of guys who are going to go down that road, but it was obvious that they needed to be pushed/taken in a direction that the previous staff couldn't tap. This staff has tapped into it. Maybe some of it was just a matter of time, but they've been pushed in ways they weren't in the past.\n\nChris, DC: How will the Irish defend PJ Hall on Saturday? Do you think the 3 PT shooting eilll\n\nTom Noie: Chris: Just like guys like Dereon Seabron and Tequarvion Smith were defended. Don't think anyone at Notre Dame is going to lose sleep worrying how to defend P.J. Hall. He's a good player. The Irish have seen their share of good players. Just dig in and defend.\n\nJeff - Fort Wayne: I was at the game last night, and if it wasn’t for the student section, the place could pass as a library. You can see Coach Brey almost begging the crowd to make noise, and it wasn’t until the very end that there was any energy in the building. How does this get fixed?\n\nTom Noie: Jeff: That's a question that has been asked since I started covering Notre Dame hoops in 1998. It's a fair-weather fan base (students included) who can be counted on for maybe one or two games a year. They like to complain when it's going bad, and find reasons to stay away when things turn. Here's the thing - they've moaned and moaned and moaned about wanting a better product on the court for the last three years. Now they have it. Where they at?\n\nDan: First time poster, but have followed Men’s basketball for 40 years. I think it’s time to shelved the Wesley to the NBA talk. In my opinion he is a couple years away, at least.\n\nTom Noie: Dan: Good to have you here. Here's the thing with Blake Wesley - he has the skills right now to GET to the NBA, but without at least another year where he can work on said skills, he doesn't have enough in the toolbox to STAY in the NBA. He's going to have to decide - is it enough for him to be the first one-and-done at Notre Dame who gets to the NBA for a cup of coffee (which is what it will be) or does he want to take the steps needed (another year) to be a career pro? It's up to him to decide.\n\nGoIrish!: Are any games confirmed for the 2022-23 season?\n\nTom Noie: Notre Dame will play a 20-game league schedule, participate in the annual ACC/Big Ten Challenge and start a home-and-home in Milwaukee next season with Marquette. The third and final game in the Kentucky series may not be played for mutually-decided on reasons.\n\nPhil: Brey's strategy to run seven (and now basically six) guys deep just about this whole season has obviously been contentious among many fans (although in fairness, it's gotten the club wins). Given that Goodwin and others may be coming back, is there a chance guys like Zona/Sanders/Elijah Taylor might transfer to get playing time elsewhere (especially with the high-quality recruits coming in)? Or will the culture/the ND degree outweigh their lack of involvement?\n\nTom Noie: Phil: Welcome to college basketball 2022-23 and beyond. Odds are, somebody's going into the transfer portal after this year. They just are. When the transfer rules were relaxed to eliminate the sit-out season, it became the Wild West. Mike Brey understands that. Guys want to play. When they don't see playing time, they hit the reset button. But again, Notre Dame guys have seen the bigger picture and get it. Though there are some who haven't - I see you Matt Ryan. Sometimes, it's best if guys go (D.J. Harvey). Sometimes, it's not. Matt Ryan being the poster child for that. He stays, he's maybe the career leader in program history for 3s.\n\nAdam: Hi Tom - You mentioned in an earlier question the idea of Blake realizing he could really use another year at the NCAA level before making the jump. I absolutely think it'd benefit him to come back for one more year, but do you have any sense of the likelihood of that happening? Wouldn't blame him one bit if he decides to go - gotta get that NBA money where you can - but as an ND fan fingers crossed he takes one more year. Thanks!\n\nTom Noie: Adam: That's a slippery slope, to \"get that NBA money while you can.\" No, no, no. You gotta be good enough and driven enough and focused enough to get to that second NBA contract. That's where the real money is. If it's all about the money, then yeah, Blake Wesley leaves in the spring. But if it's about being a PRO, like being a 10-year guy, he works on his game and is an even better/more finished product in 2023-24. Right?\n\nZach S: How much stock do you take in that horrid Duke game last week? Do you think we can realistically get them in the ACC tourney if matched up? That felt like an outlier game, but Duke notably does defend the 3 really well. Maybe it’s just a bad matchup? Curious what your thoughts are. Go Irish!\n\nTom Noie: Zach: Good point, but here's also a key factor - the Irish basically wet their pants when they ran out of the locker room and saw a full house and those Duke uniforms and K and the ESPN cameras on. Like, that was big-time college basketball and this Notre Dame group has never played in a big-time college basketball atmosphere. Remember, it beat Duke last year at Cameron Indoor with no fans in the stands. It was an adjustment. Notre Dame wanted it perhaps too much. They were tight and couldn't function. A rematch with Duke on a neutral court? Might be a different story. Would be nice to find out, right?\n\nJustin, Ft Wayne: You going to be at anymore away games and the ACC tournament?\n\nTom Noie: Justin: Fingers crossed that we can get to the ACC Tournament. Travel these days are tricky, for myriad reasons. I miss it, but in other ways, I don't. But if there's any year to be in Brooklyn, this might be the one. Especially since there just could be more basketball to come the following week.\n\nChris in New York: Tom how do you feel about NCAA chances given the lack of Quad 1 wins and overall awfulness if ACC. What do they need to do to be called on March 13th\n\nTom Noie: Chris: Notre Dame is 10-3 in the league with seven ACC games remaining - four at home, three on the road. Hold serve at home, steal a sixth league road win and Selection Sunday takes care of itself if Notre Dame finishes 15-5 in the league.\n\nJason: How would you describe Dane Goodwins game? He seems to be well rounded with no elite skills but good at everything. What past nd player would you compare him to or maybe he’s a combination of 2 players?\n\nTom Noie: Jason: Steve Vasturia on Line One.\n\nTim from Evanston: Did something specific happen after the bad loss to BC and/or the crossroads loss to Indiana to help turn things around? Was there a players only meeting or something similar where the seniors finally stepped up and took accountability? Feels like the team's confidence and play started to evolve and improve after that stretch. They've shown flashes of this potential in previous seasons but how have they been able to sustain this level over the last 15 games or so of their current hot streak?\n\nTom Noie: Tim: Great stuff. Don't think anything had to be said after the Boston College game where Notre Dame never led, trailed by 23 and lost by 16 to the team picked to finish last in the league. It was more a collective decision that this #$%@ stops and it stops right now. Time to wake up and get serious about defending and figuring out who they could be. That was the end of a really brutal stretch where Texas A&M took its collective heart in Vegas the previous week before the high-intensity atmosphere/loss to Illinois, which is really good. Indiana? Notre Dame was more encouraged than deflated after that one. The Irish played well in that road atmosphere (and it was a road game) against a high-level opponent. They were closer than what many of us believed. It was just a matter of those seven guys collectively clicking. And you can't underestimate/value how much confidence matters. Once they were able to string some league wins/road wins together, that confidence was like a rocket.\n\nJohn R.: We’ve all heard the hype around Wesley being a potential lottery pick. If he gets word at the end of the year from his advisors that he will be a lottery pick, how does Brey (and should Brey) bring him back? While we fans obviously want him back, I couldn’t fault the kid for going to the NBA. Of course he could always benefit from more coaching before making the jump, it just seems like a lottery pick is too much to pass up. Do you think we are in real danger of him not coming back?\n\nTom Noie: John: Sure, because when it comes to decision time, Blake Wesley will have to decide what he wants. Is it enough for him to be a lottery pick, because if it is, it's over. Mike Brey will shake his hand and thank him for the year and wish him well. But does he want to truly be an NBA player? Look, he won't develop in that league, especially if he goes to a bad team, the way he'd develop at Notre Dame. He just won't. Is he mature enough to work through all that at that level? One more year gives him a lot more to take with him to the league to where he's not only a lottery pick, he's a pro. There's a massive difference.\n\nTim from Evanston: Tom - feels like Wesley has gotten a number of critical baskets for ND this year where he simply drove to the hoop and used his superior athleticism to score (just ask Louisville both times we played them). ND doesn't typically have guys with this kind of physical ability but perhaps from what I read about the upcoming recruiting classes, more are on the way. Who is the last ND player that you can remember who could call his own number and go one on one like that for a big bucket when it was needed?\n\nTom Noie: Tim: Jerian Grant on Line One as well. Bonzie Colson too. There have been a few, but few with the overall mix of athleticism and stones.\n\nSouth Bend Bob: Mr Noie: No questions, sir; just a thank you for your terrific work and dedication to local journalism.\n\nTom Noie: My man! As they say, say it louder for the people in the back! 😀\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Buzz showed that the press can kill ND, so that is no surprise. The other way to beat them is to do what Duke did. Unfortunately, only 5 or 6 teams in the country have that kind of talent makeup to play DEF the way Coach K did. Brey can use Atkinson to receive the inbound pass off the press, since no Big DEF is ever going to play that far from the basket, Paul will be open. You bring the inbounder, say Hubb, toward Atkinson for a pass and Hubb can rub off his defender on the Atkinson screen.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Call the Notre Dame men's basketball offices. Tell them I told you to...they've listen. Maybe.\n\nRussell: Who comes back next year? Wesley 50/50 at best. Assume Cormac Ryan comes back, but who else (of the core rotation guys now)?\n\nTom Noie: Russell: Asked an answered. Scroll through to find the info. You won't regret it.\n\nXavier: What do you think about Solomon being the coach in waiting assuming Brey continues to keep things on track?\n\nTom Noie: Xavier: Don't see it. Anthony Solomon is a good man who is of tremendous value, but it's a tough sell to say that he's the head coach in waiting at Notre Dame when he's a career 24-88 as a head coach. Some guys are better off as assistants and I think Slo more than fits that bill. I do know that one reason he left after the 2015-16 season was that he believed that he should've been given more of a look as a head coach elsewhere. But it was hard for Mike Brey to convince schools A, B and C to give Slo a serious look when he's 24-88. At this stage of his coaching career, Slo's more of a sage than a sergeant, That's OK. He's exactly what this program needed this season. E-X-A-C-T-L-Y. It's no coincidence that the Irish are where they are with Slo back on the staff.\n\nMike - Newark, DE: Hey Tom - walk me back from thinking about this team (if Wesley returns) as a top 10-15 team... Wesley and Starling plus an assortment of fifth year guys that clearly can go out and win a ton of ACC games... only real weakness to me would be in the middle if Atkinson has to move on (as well as Nate being a question mark for 22-23). Feels like they'd have real staying power in the national discussion next year in this scenario\n\nTom Noie: Mike: This, times 10. The bulk of the core comes back, one of the other freshmen (Ven-Allen Lubin) hits big early and the transfer portal works its magic, and you've got the makings of something sustainable in South Bend.\n\nAdam: Love ND in all sports, great season so far far. My son and I don’t miss a game, I’m just shocked at the lack of fan support at home games? What is the issue? That place looked empty last night?\n\nTom Noie: Adam: It was bad. I get the pandemic and get that classwork may have been a conflict, but if you can fill it for Duke, you can fill it for any other game. And should fill it. Fans (and you know who you are) whined incessantly the last three years about the state of the program. Now the program's on firm footing, and it's a collective shrug. Facts.\n\nTyler: Tom, I’m curious what your relationship (if any) is like with Coach Brey outside of basketball season? Occasional text, yearly July dinner, anything? If so, would you say he's about as authentic as he appears to be nationally to those who don't know him as well as you guys that do?\n\nTom Noie: Tyler: You'll have to wait for the book to learn about that. 😀\n\nJim Tal, Valley Center, CA.: Tom, thanks so much for your great work covering ND hoops. Despite their notable efforts so far, I sense that the Irish aren't getting much respect on a national level and are being somewhat dismissed by the supposed experts whose job it is to project the Big Dance field. I hate to think of it, but in your opinion, is there any way that ND could finish in top three of the ACC regular-season standings and yet still get aced out of earning a NCAA postseason berth? I don't why but I've got a funny feeling about this possibility.\n\nTom Noie: Jim: None, zero, zlich, nada, and any other word you might want to use. Notre Dame is 10-3 in the league. It has four home games left. Win those four and get to 14 wins, steal one more road win. Finish 15-5 and it's over. Mike Brey is Atlantic Coast Conference coach of the year and the Irish are back in the tournament.\n\nRobert from Mishawaka: Thank you for having these chats, and Go Irish!\n\nTom Noie: Another one.....say it louder for those in the back my man!\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Lunardi has OKLA has one of the last teams in. They have THREE league wins. ALL three were against teams under .500 in the league. I believe they are 1-7 in their last 8. OKLA is hanging its hat on two wins two months ago. Ignore Lunardi. There are much better options.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: I would counsel any college basketball fan to ignore EVERYBODY when it turns to NCAA talk. Only 68 teams will get in, but between now and Selection Sunday, there will be at least 200 that people say are in or deserve to be in. It's dizzying, and even downright dopey. Just keep winning, and Selection Sunday takes care of itself.\n\nTyler: Tom, you might of already covered (I always read the full transcript after the chat), but in the eyes of those within the program and those that cover this program closely, what specifically makes this season a great one and not a bust? I’m a little more realistic than most ND hoops fans with expectations and I’d argue we are getting to that territory of this season already being a success (pending an NCAA bid). Given how short the majority of this team has fell with expectations, just to finish in the top 4 of the ACC in year 4 and to finally earn a bid to be given a chance at the whole thing is a successful season in my eyes- even if an early round exit (sigh, I know). What say you?\n\nTom Noie: Tyler: The greatness bar was forever raised by the 2014-15 team. The Irish went 32-6. They went 14-4 in the league. They were a top four seed in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament. They won said tournament by beating Duke and North Carolina on consecutive nights in the city where the league was formed. It nearly got to a Final Four. It maxed everything out. That's greatness. Anything less than that and the season's really good. Though I have a different view of greatness. Great seasons are when you can just kind of hang on and enjoy the ride. That certainly was 2015. That also was 2011 with what that team did (NCAA stagger aside). This one has a chance to be great in a sense if the Irish continue doing what they're doing. Getting to the NCAA usually would be enough, but there's something different about this group. We might soon see it.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, You know you raised an interesting point. Brey can probably recruit 10-15 kids out of the Top 100. The rest are just never getting into ND. If you go the portal route, not only do you \"stay old\", but you at least get a known commodity academically. You think ND should/will place more of an emphasis on transfers going forward? If they do, it kind of goes against how the school has positioned itself, reputation-wise.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Yes, yes, yes, but only for absolutely the right fits. Notre Dame never is going to get guys just to get guys (as evidence by never maxing out the allotted scholarships, which is also by design). But that's where college basketball is headed. Either play the game or you won't be in the game. And 10-15 of the Top 100 is way too generous. It's more like 5-10 with a \"realistic\" shot at MAYBE one or two kids a year. But hey. you still better win in the ACC.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Wouldn't be a chat without the mention of Djogo. BTW, both he and Chris D. are doing quite well with ND's AAA team. Djogo is the 2nd leading scorer and Dougherty basically averages a double-double. All that for a team with ONE conference win. Who is next in the conversation? DJ Harvey? LOL\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Both (really all three) doing stuff at their respective schools (D.J. Harvey is at Detroit-Mercy) at a level where their games really belong. Doesn't make them bad guys. Just not ACC-caliber guys.\n\nTom, Gary, Indiana: I have really enjoyed watching Blake Wesley play, and I believe, pump some life into the program. How do you think his performance helped Brey get J.J. Starling? Future recruits?\n\nTom Noie: Tom: Honestly, it didn't. J.J. Starling signed with Notre Dame three days before Blake Wesley ever played a game in an Irish uniform. Now, the thought of pairing with Wesley was intriguing for Starling, but one thing you learn when you're around this program for 24 years, Notre Dame guys are different. In so many ways. Basketball is important but not end-all-be-all important. J.J. Starling looked hard at Notre Dame because he wanted to be different. Wanted to blaze his own trail. Same for future recruits. They want to play high level hoops and compete in the ACC and all that, but they want more - want the all-encompassing of what a Notre Dame education can provide.\n\nTyler: Tom, let’s “pretend” (because we can do that) this entire group returns next year after getting a taste (using Brey lingo) of the tournament but getting bounced after game 1. Where would see his \"Mahomes\" fitting into the rotation next year? I couldn’t imagine a 5th year guy with as many miles on his tires (and having a great 21-22 ACC season) would be accepting of a rotating bench role with JJ Starling getting 28+ minutes. Would Hubb be understanding to pass the torch? Sure. But accepting? No way. Nor would Brey do that to him or put him in that position. Nor should he. So I guess my question is 1) if they ALL (except Paul) return, where do you see Hubb fitting in that rotation? And 2) fair to say out of ALL of this core, Hubb would/should be least likely to return because of Starling, and well.. it’s just time? Agree?\n\nTom Noie: Tyler: Conventional wisdom would agree, but then again, since we are pretending...The more I've seen J.J. Starling play, the more I can see that it's not out of the realm of possibility that Prentiss Hubb might - stress might - return. In his current role at La Lumiere, J.J. Starling is not the true \"point guard.\" he often plays off the ball and allows Jeremy Fears (Michigan State signee) and/or Aden Holloway to handle point guard duties. Then there are times where when Starling needs to be Starling, he can be Starling. Hubb has been the ultimate team guy this season, which has gone unnoticed. What would he want out of next year? A main role? Yeah, probably not. A team role? Hmmmmm.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, I'll give you the book on the 3 recruits. Starling starts from Day 1. More advanced than Wesley was at the same time in their careers. JJS has NBA written all over him. If Wesley and Dane stay, you might average 50 points a game from those 3 spots. No kidding. Ven-Allen will likely be the best athlete on the team. Explosive. A motor that just does not quit. In some ways reminds one of Ryan H. when he transferred. The first time I saw RH play at ND, I thought, \"My Lord, we don't get those kinds of basketball athletes here.\" Ven-Allen is in that category, though a little undersized. That said, he is rough around the edges. He definitely needs polish. If he works with Hump for a few years, he is going to be hard to handle. Finally, my favorite is Dom C. Love this guy's skill set. Would need to see what his body looks like before making an assessment, but easy to play with. Dirty work kind of teammate. Trivia question----He reminds me of the \"Malverne Mountain\". Who am I referring to?\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Good stuff, and agree. Have seen/talked with J.J. Starling plenty to see that he's next. Never heard of your Mountain guy and too swamped with questions to cheat with Google.\n\nMatt: If Hubb and Goodwin both come back next year (along with Wertz and Ryan), where does JJ Starling fit in the rotation? He has to play given his talent, but how much? Who sacrifices minutes? Love the idea of Hubb tutoring both Wesley and Starling for another year, but guard is getting crowded (no to mention JR).\n\nTom Noie: Matt; Regardless of who's back or who's not, J.J. Starling is a starter/main guy from the minute he steps on campus until his career ends. It's as sure of a thing as sure things are.\n\nTyler: Tom, wouldn’t be a party without a crowd question. I’m not saying I’m interested in the Big 10 (but really I am) or suggesting even holding to that to be a future possibility for ND (won't happen). My question is, do you think the crowds would be better if ND was in the Big 10? Just overall attendance. I mean, give me Northwestern + Penn State + Minnesota over GT + NCST + BC any day of the week. It will never happen but you get what I’m saying. Agree? Heck, you would get the same Duke crowd that you would for Michigan. Same North Carolina (non xmas break) crowd that you would for Indiana. Same (non covid) crowd for a good Syracuse and good Louisville that you would for Purdue or Michigan State. My only concern would be the 60/40 split or even losing the building to Indiana or Purdue LOL.\n\nTom Noie: Tyler: Agree. The Midwest crowd just isn't as invested in teams from the southeast, and that even includes Louisville. Scale of one to 10, last night was a 6.5 Maybe.\n\nTim from Evanston: You tweeted a pic of the empty arena last night and Tory Jackson commented as well. Why do you think there is lack of support for this team in the form of crowd size? Also, do you think Brey really enjoys going to the dining halls and lecture halls handing out tickets and throwing t shirts to students. Coach K, Boeheim would never do that stuff and they are his closest peers in the ACC.\n\nTom Noie: Tim: Full disclosure, that picture was snapped about one minute before tip. So many fans/students/lackeys were so fed up the previous three seasons that they can't possibly stoop to the level of crawling back to root for them now. That would be admitting that they were wrong. And that the program again is good and worth watching. Sometimes I wonder if \"fan\" is short for \"dope.\" And now, Brey can't like having to scour the dining and lecture halls to drum up interest, but hey, he got this program into it. Time for him to get it out, right?\n\nTyler: Tom, who’s the one guy on this team that if they don’t “elevate” their game over the course of this season or next (if they return), and they just remain the same would you be most disappointed in as far as like gosh, I thought we could of gotten more out of him? Mine is Cormac Ryan. IF he remains the same as he has this year and remains the same next year. I wasn’t expecting an all-league offensive guy but gosh, I was expecting more than only just 1 or 2 all-league type nights in a few seasons. Even Nate or Hubb can inconsistently give you those. Cormac can consistently defend though so he does check that box.\n\nTom Noie: Tyler: Good call. You know what direction I'm going to go? How about Blake Wesley. Say he is one-and-done guy. Say he believes he's ready to go to the NBA. Let's see him do what another ACC guy did when he was a freshman who was really good during the bulk of the season, but took it to another level while on his NBA drive late. I'm referring to Jayson Tatum. I remember watching him earlier in the 2016-17 season, then seeing him again in the ACC tournament in Brooklyn. Specifically, the ACC title game against Notre Dame, a game Notre Dame should've won. I watched Tatum that night and thought, wow, best player in the draft. Franchise-like guy. Just couldn't be defended. Why not watch Wesley do that the last six weeks of the season? Just go on a run that says, yeah, I'm a pro and here's why...\n\nJoe: Not to beat the rotation topic into the ground, but what did Brey see in Tony Sanders that had him play minutes at Michigan St. last year in the opener, but hardly gets on the court this year? Would love to see him used like Austin Torres for a few minutes of burst and hustle plays\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Nothing any of those guys did last year held any water/carryover to this season. They didn't have a summer to figure it out. They barely knew where all the buildings were on campus. Zona and Sanders and to an extent Taylor really are only freshmen this year and they're playing roles like freshmen play. He's not an answer now. Not even close. Next year? We'll see.\n\nTodd in Charlotte: Tom: When you mentioned Djogo, I remembered he transferred out to Northeastern. Forgot that he's teammates with Chris Doherty. Both of them are having solid seasons! Sometimes players find greener pastures. Good for them.\n\nTom Noie: Todd: Greener pastures in fields not as fertile as the Atlantic Coast Conference can be beneficial. In the case of both, it is.\n\nJoey from Highland: I have thoroughly enjoyed the spacing they’re playing with and the pace helps them limit possessions for the opponents. I still think they’re better shooters than they’ve shown, namely Ryan and Wertz. I can’t believe how good of a basketball player Goodwin has become. I know they pick on him defensively, but he competes and has come a long way on that end.\n\nTom Noie: Old guys getting old. See what happens? You see that, hey, they actually can play.\n\nJon, PA: Hi Tom. Can you think of a time when the first place acc team was not ranked?\n\nTom Noie: Jon: Yes. Couple weeks ago when Miami (Fla.) was in first place and Duke was the lone ACC team ranked. In fairness, the national rankings are released every Monday, so Notre Dame was not in first place at that time. It's the ACC is down narrative that's hurting the league. Hard to bust through that now.\n\nBrendan, TN: Tom, what do you think is the long term expectation for Coach Solomon and Coach Wyche? They seem to get the credit with making our defense better, and I'm all for it. Is one of them Coach in waiting for when Brey's contract is up? Do you expect them to look elsewhere after this season? Would love any insight you have into the dynamic with Brey and his staff.\n\nTom Noie: Brendan: Anthony Solomon returned for a third stint at Notre Dame to work one more time with Mike Brey. Antoni Wyche is a Notre Dame graduate in his first season back at his alma mater. He's still learning about life at this level. Slo's not going anywhere that Mike Brey's not going. Let's give it a year or two.\n\nMike,New Jersey: Hey Tom, The three point shooting hasn't been stellar at all in this last stretch of games. I look at it as a positive that the Irish are still winning these games with Great defense and toughness. Your thoughts? Have to think the 3 ball will come back around eventually for these guys.\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Great point. Kind of shoots down the \"All they do is shoot 3s\" complaints from the whine and wheeze crowd. It's a weapon, but it doesn't have to be THE weapon.\n\nLee from Lancaster: Tom, do you think the fact that the Irish will likely make the tournament this year will impact the decision to leave or come back to ND for a final year for players like Hubb, Goodwin, and Nate L. ?\n\nTom Noie: Lee: Can see it swing both ways with those guys. Part of them might think, we accomplished our goal and got Notre Dame back to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2017. We're done. Part of them also might think, we did it once and it felt phenomenal, let's see if we can do more, and then decide to come back.\n\nJim Tal, Valley Center, CA.: Tom, since you cover both Irish hoops and football, would you say that the cases of Paul Atkinson and Jack Coan are analogous? Both arrived with high expectations and legitimate pressure and though each had some hiccup moments, no one can deny that these two athletes have delivered in a mighty big way. Without them, it's a daunting thought to imagine how their respective teams would have fared without them. Would you agree that Brian Kelly and Mike Brey are thanking their lucky stars that the grad transfer portal was at their disposal and that Atkinson and Coan ended up making all the difference in the world?\n\nTom Noie: Jim: Brian Kelly is too busy making dance videos at LSU and Mike Brey is trolling the dining halls to recruit students. They haven't stopped to think.\n\nJDub, Ft. Wayne: Different perspective on the Duke game. The officials let them play and I am fine with that. Very physical game underneath the basket. Usually in that scenario, the bigger, more physical team is probably going to win and that team was clearly Duke. I think it also underscored why the game was so low scoring. My opinion is ND did not stand a chance against Duke with the game called that way. When the officials do call a game that way and it does not favor ND, do you think Mike Brey should do more lobbying during the game to try and change that narrative to give his team a better chance? He did not appear to that night and I know he is not usually a 'talk to the officials' kind of guy, but can a coach affect the game that way?\n\nTom Noie: JDub: Interesting. I get what you'd like to see out of Brey at that point, but that game got sideways so early, I'm sure he already was thinking how to hold it all together when they got on the flight the next day to South Florida. He was already working on his flush-it speech before that game ended. He's turned the page in that one early. And don't be mistaken, Brey's good getting after the officials when it's warranted. Seen it plenty.\n\nJoey from Highland: also, with the quantity of timeouts and the tv timeouts, they’re rested anyways. Depth is overrated. 7 skilled guys is better than 9 minute wasters.\n\nTom Noie: Joey: Will never get this notion of everybody has to play. Ice cream all around. And the whole, yeah, get a guy two or three minutes here or there. It takes you a minute to get your wind, another to settle in and another to figure out what's what. By then, you're back out. Enough of the nonsense of playing guys just to play them.\n\nJoe, Chicago: How does ND match up with Wake - they seem to be the only two non-Duke teams in the league to be trending in the right direction\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Wake Forest's going to be a massive problem with a lot of old guys and skilled guys and guys that believe it's their time. Can't wait for that one.\n\nBrendan, TN: Last night post game I heard Brey said when Louisville made their run and they called timeout, there was no strategy, just a sense of they'd been there before and let's figure it out. I don't ever see a whiteboard and marker in his hands, so are you ever close enough to the huddles to share anything about what those conversations are really like? Who's talking? Who's directing? Who's yelling?\n\nTom Noie: Brendan: Ha! We're way upstairs for home games so the seats that once were press row can remain unused. Whoops, did I say that? Brey's huddles usually operate where he gives a few beats to the guys to discuss amongst themselves while he meets with his assistants to plan a direction. Then he'll step in and say what needs to be said. But like he said Wednesday, he just doesn't want to screw them up. Sometimes, good coaching is saying/doing less. Not more.\n\nLee from Lancaster: Tom , what team in the ACC is considered ND's primary rival? Possibly, Duke? Is there a game that will generate the buzz that a ND-Clemson game will in football?\n\nTom Noie: Lee: Thought a little on that this week. I'd say if I had to guess, it would be Louisville. To have a rival, you have to have good games, and games against Duke has been too one-sided. Plus, you mention to anyone from Duke that Notre Dame is a rival in basketball and they may laugh you out of the league. yeah, they have rivals in basketball, but Notre Dame isn't one of them. Outside of Louisville, don't know if Notre Dame really has one. That's life in Indiana as a member of the ACC.\n\nJDub, Ft. Wayne: Since the question was asked about Anthony Solomon being the next coach, and I know Brey still has several years left on his contract, have you thought about who might be on a short list to succeed Mike Brey?\n\nTom Noie: JDub: No, because nobody really knows. Us media dopes spent years and years and years trotting out the who's-next list for Notre Dame football when it came time for Brian Kelly to leave. If he ever would leave. Even before the 2021 season, Marcus Freeman was on less than zero percent of media radar. You don't know what the situation is until it arises. When it does, I'll have a better idea of what direction the search might go.\n\nCaleb from Charlotte: From a historical perspective, which of these is the greatest accomplishment in ND basketball history, 1.) ending USCL's 88 game winning streak, or 2.) making the final four in 1978?\n\nTom Noie: Caleb: When's the last time they played a highlight clip of that 1978 Final Four run? The final seconds of the UCLA game are replayed every January. Not even close. It's the UCLA game.\n\nJake: Tom, does this team give you 2015-2016 vibes? Guard that can get to the basket, dj vs Blake, shotmaker Beachem vs Dane, and post guy that can get you a bucket ZA vs Paul. This team lacks the offensive versatility that Steve and Bonzie brought, but I think makes up for it on the defensive end with better on ball defense and team rebounding.\n\nTom Noie: Jake: Great call. That 2015-16 team lost early in non-conference to...Monmouth. I figured leaving Disney that night that there was no way that team would get back to an Elite Eight. Then, 11-7 in the league and a late run and there they were.\n\nWoofCookies from LaPaz: Tom, any idea why Matt Ryan didn't hang on? He seems to be doing well in the D League...lack of patience, or just the way it works in college ball...Thanks, WOOF\n\nTom Noie: Woof: He fell victim to two things that will crush any collegiate career - insecurity and impatience. Ryan wanted to be a starter, but saw all the buzz about D.J. Harvey coming in and didn't even wait around. Harvey was in, Ryan was out. He never was in the shape he needed to be. If he'd taken that seriously, and was secure in his skills, he would've torched the 3-point records. All of them. He would've gotten so many open looks and opportunities that his right arm may have fallen off late in one season. Right there, just dropped. Instead, he bounced from Vanderbilt to Chattanooga. What might have been...\n\nJustin, Ft Wayne: Have you talked to any of the incoming freshman besides JJ? Just wondering if you did and what they had to say about ND\n\nTom Noie: Justin: Unless they're local like J.J. where you can go over and spend some face-to-face time and see them play, it's a waste of time. They just recycle the same old recruiting quotes they've used for months. Better to get them on campus when you can see them first-hand.\n\nJohn from Naperville: Tom, thanks for getting these going again. Love em, and appreciate the time you take out of your day to talk ND hoops. Was Elijah Taylor ever really going to be a piece for this team? He put together some nice minutes vs Illinois, then got hurt, and obviously ran into some academic issues. Is he still around the team, traveling, practicing etc? A lot of really good examples of those who had missteps within the ND program that have bounced back, hope he stays the course.\n\nTom Noie: John: If there was anyone who had an outside chance at being the eighth guy, it was Elijah Taylor. But it was always something that was holding him back. He got sick and missed time, then he got hurt and missed time then he didn't get it done in the classroom and was gone for the spring semester. He's still around the team for practices and home games. But again, a guy whose collegiate career hasn't even gotten close to getting off the ground. A total blank slate/mystery heading into 2022-23.\n\nJustin, Ft Wayne: Do you have a personal opinion of the teams ceiling this year? Curious to what you think it would be.\n\nTom Noie: Justin: Sweet 16? Seriously, though, it's so difficult to say what this team might do in postseason until the bracket comes out. Oh, they also have to get there as well.\n\nMickey, NY, NY: Great to see a chat going. A few questions: if MB is going to play 7 because they work well together what is the cause of the offense being stagnant for large stretches (I’m not talking missing shots, talking looking completely out of synch). 2) With the recruiting class coming in and the 2 freshman how do you think MB handles that next year? To get top recruits they will want to play immediately and a lot. Is that another impediment to attracting top classes with multiple top players? 3) When are you in NY so I can buy you a drink and a meal for all the grief I give you on Twitter? I really do like you, Tom! I promise.\n\nTom Noie: Mickey: We're back and maybe better than ever. Great to hear from you. Give the defense some of the credit. This ain't the CYO league they're playing against out there. We'll worry about next year in the summer. Plenty of time for that. Checks to see where ACC tournament is this year. Brooklyn? Answer to question No. 3 is ... next month. 😀\n\nSzn TicketGuys: Tom any idea why we don’t see JR get in the mix more for PT seems like we could use one more guys off the bench?\n\nTom Noie: Not this year. Mike Brey was very clear with J.R. Konieczny on that one from the start. He sees Konieczny with the same collegiate career arc as Tim Abromaitis. Going to take longer to get there, but once he gets there, he's going to be good.\n\nWadelite: Tom, if ND has an open Scholarship in the spring, which I believe they will, can you see them offering Ryan Mabrey? His family has certainly been winners at ND and he would help facilitate a lalumiere pipeline. There will be many open scholarships 22-23, so put him on the 5 year plan.\n\nTom Noie: We'll be fighting Mabrey fatigue by then. Notre Dame definitely knows where he is, but his name has seldom come up.\n\nMatt from Campus: Can you tell us about how/if the committee weighs head-to-head matchups? Four other ACC teams on bubble watch (I know there's still a ton of season left) but we've beat 3 out of the 4 of them (Miami, UNC, Virginia) and still have to play Wake. How much do they take those wins into account on the bubble? I guess I am still upset about Syracuse getting into the tournament in 2017-2018 when we didn't because I felt that we had very similar resumes AND we beat them in the Carrier Dome.\n\nTom Noie: Matt: Hard to say exactly what the committee will take into account. How much will the deafening chatter of the ACC hurt Notre Dame? It might, but its resume might be too good to ignore. Just keep winning and it will solve any issues.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Slo and Brey are basically the same age. Slo is not in the picture. Wyche's resume does not have the heft. Hump is the best option, but, with no head coaching experience, that's a tough hire. I would look at someone in their 40s, HC in a lower league, successful, and some ties to ND. And no, not Marty I. Danny Hurley or Kevin Willard come to mind.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Wait, Ryan Humphrey not having any previous head coaching experience is a tough hire? Marcus Freeman and Niele Ivey would like a word. Hump would be a really good option.\n\nJoey from Highland: FYI, a 3 seed (in Kentucky’s bracket) after winning the acc tourney in Greensboro and beating Duke and Carolina twice still irks me to no end. Can you say hosed????\n\nTom Noie: Let....it....go....\n\nPortND: Tom great stuff as always. I'm of the opinion that ND is in first place right now BECAUSE of the BC loss, I actually see it as a benefit as it was a come to jesus moment for the veterans on the team. Any insight into what happened after that loss or if there was a \"come to Jesus meeting\"\n\nTom Noie: Port: Nothing really needed to be said, except this $#^& stops now. It was a team still trying to figure it out. All that game did was force them to figure it out faster.\n\nCole: Tom, what are your thoughts going into Clemson on Saturday with only 6 guys… Is it a must win game? And how do you see it playing out?\n\nTom Noie: Cole: Clemson will be on the back end of three games in five days. North Carolina on Tuesday, Duke on Thursday, Notre Dame on Saturday. The way this team has played on the road in the league this year, I'd be surprised if it doesn't get league road win No. 6. Clemson's not good.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, \"Workin' on mysteries without any clues.\" First time I saw Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band was at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena as the opening act for Kiss. Let's just say the fan bases didn't mix. Brief aside, now back to hoops.\n\nTom Noie: Great story. Night Moves was my entry point into music, so it holds a special place. It started it all. Thanks, Bob.\n\nJDub, Ft. Wayne: I don't know that much needs to be said about it, but Dane Goodwin yelling back at Mike Brey during a timeout at NC State. What I read about it I was really impressed with the way Mike Brey handled it: he was happy to see the emotion out of Dane. I think he turned a potential negative into a positive. Your thoughts on what happened and do you have any more insight into what happened and why?\n\nTom Noie: JDub: Mike Brey barked at Dane Goodwin to rebound better and Dane barked back. Only took four years for him to show that kind of emotion. Think Dane is beyond a boiling point for not getting some calls he should get as a main guy. Not the first time that's happened. Brey's had his moments with Troy Murphy and Kyle McAlarney and Ben Hansbrough. He looks at it as, if I'm going to dish it out, I have to take it. Goodwin apologized afterward on the team bus, and Brey laughed it off. Said it's all good.\n\nMatt from Campus: Does Dane Goodwin still have a chance at ACC Player of the Year? Who do you think the favorite is right now?\n\nTom Noie: Matt: Absolutely, especially if the Irish finish in the top three. We were asked to submit by one member of the ACC media our top three choices earlier this week. Mine were 1. Alondes Williams (Wake Forest), 2. Dane Goodwin (Notre Dame) and 3. Armando Bacot (North Carolina). Williams might be the first player in conference history to lead the ACC in scoring and assists. He does that, and Wake Forest finishes in top four, it's over.\n\nBrad: Sometimes players find greener pastures with different coaches not just different conferences. Brey was never going to lift Doherty up after he left in the summer of his freshman year. I know Doherty personally and 2 coaches on the ND staff told him he should’ve been playing more for the ND team back in 2019 when he decided to leave….\n\nTom Noie: Brad: Good stuff, but a little revisionist history going on there. Chris Doherty left Notre Dame because he didn't want to be at Notre Dame. His mother drove out from New England and picked up and took him home without the staff even knowing about it. Big red flag there. He could never get over being that far away from home, so it's no surprise that he landed at Northeastern. He had no concept of college basketball in 2018-19....he wasn't going to play. Good kid in a tough situation out here. Better situation for him back home.\n\nJoey from Highland: Would you give your honest opinion on Coach K? Do you think he gets preferential treatment? I personally am not a fan of the guy and I’m glad he is retiring.\n\nTom Noie: You do everything he has in the game and won at the level he's won, you wouldn't expect the same? Of course you would. Let's see Jon Scheyer get a similar whistle next season. Probably not happening.\n\nPat H. Springfield Illinois: Can you comment on team’s resiliency in context of playing four games in eight days, being on the road, missing time in the classroom etc. Also if you can, what is latest on Nic Diogo, Juwan Durham and Chris Daugherty? Keep up your fine work. It’s always appreciated\n\nTom Noie: Pat: Just a situation of old guys handling their business like old guys. Play a game, win or lose, it's on to the next one. They actually like playing as much on the road as they do at home, which is what I'm writing about for Saturday. Nik Djogo and Chris Doherty are each at Northeastern. Djogo is averaging 12.4 points, 5.3 rebounds and 2.0 assists in 31.7 minutes. He's shooting .447 from the field, .441 from 3 and .820 from the free throw line. He's played in 20 games with 19 starts. Doherty is averaging 11 points and 9.2 rebounds with 1.3 assists in 30.9 minutes. He's shooting .566 from the field and .756 from the foul line. He's started all 22 games he's played. Juwan Durham is playing for Prienai CBet in Lithuania. He's averaging 10.8 points and 5.3 rebounds in 25.2 minutes. He's shooting .619 percent from the floor, .737 from the foul line.\n\nBrendan, TN: Wesley's been out at closing time in the last two games, which I think has been the right call given some of his turnovers. What is your sense of how he handles that?\n\nTom Noie: Brendan: You hope it eats at him, but he's been on the bench because he's not been able to take care of the ball at critical times. North Carolina State and Louisville, one of the other two guards that would normally sit - Cormac Ryan, Trey Wertz - has been better. So Brey's gone with the old guys to close it out. Brey has praised Wesley for being coachable, so it's another coachable/teaching moment. Handle your business, and you'll play those crunch time minutes.\n\nWadelite: Wesley was settling too much on taking treys. It was sort of like when Jordan Cornette had so many open treys. It wasn't by accident.\n\nTom Noie: Wesley has to be beyond falling into that trap. Everyone around the program, and even those outside of it, has continuously counseled him to drive it, drive it, drive it. Then that opens everything else up for him.\n\nMark Oliver: Tom, Quick follow up question if the chat is still going. Do Zona, Sanders, J.R. etc. understand the situation with not playing this year and are they OK with it? Will they stay and be usable contributors next year and beyond? Thanks.\n\nTom Noie: Mark: Absolutely. I don't think they're sitting there in Game No. 24 last night thinking, man, I hope I get some run tonight. There have been conversations with each where they all know the score. Mike Brey said it before this season ever started - he's going to play seven guys and only seven guys. It's up to the others to handle it with understanding and maturity and stay ready in case they're needed. There's no rule, unwritten or otherwise, that says they have to play. This is big boy college basketball. Handle it like an man. Beyond this year, that's another discussion. But for now, this is the rotation. Be a team guy and not a me guy.\n\nMickey, NY, NY: ive been seeing more midrange jumpers from the team lately. Do you know if that is something the team is consciously doing since their M.O. has been behind the arc? What player leaving after the season (other than Atkinson with 2 great degrees) would be a surprise? And finally, any food allergies we should avoid next month??\n\nTom Noie: Just a case where you want to give the defense more to worry about. Used to be that you guard Notre Dame, you run them off the line and they have trouble creating offense. Not so now with so many guys who can find something in the mid-range. Having Atkinson there kind of opens up best of both worlds. They can shoot the 3 or dump into him for open looks. Dane Goodwin leaving next year would be a surprise. Really, that troika of Goodwin, Ryan and Wertz, all of whom seem like they're locks as five-year guys.\n\nLee from Lancaster: What would you consider to be the most difficult game remaining on the regular season schedule for the Irish to win?\n\nTom Noie: Lee; Wake Forest, and it might not be close. They've got that \"it\" about them this year. If there is a second, it's Syracuse. Notre Dame should handle its business in the other games, including at Florida State. If Pittsburgh can go in there and win, which it did last night, there's no reason Notre Dame can't.\n\nTom Noie: That's going to do it for today. Solid effort for our first time back around since November. We'll be back, probably in two weeks on Feb. 24 for another chat.

Tenured professors can't be fired except for cause or severe financial issues.\n\nPeople of color in higher education have raised the alarm for years that although student bodies are becoming more diverse, faculty are still overwhelmingly white. Experts said the lack of diversity is partly due to a subjective tenure application process and the failure to value labor by professors of color.\n\nBlack people make up 13.4% of the U.S. population but accounted for less than 6% of faculty at public and private nonprofit four-year colleges in the USA in 2018, according to federal data analyzed by the AAUP.\n\nThough less than half of faculty members are tenured, Black professors held about 5% of those positions in fall 2018. Black women make up a little more than 2% of tenured professors.\n\nTo receive tenure, professors must be hired by a committee of the faculty in their department for a competitive tenure-track opening. Then they have six years to earn the tenure distinction. They amass a portfolio of research, teaching experience and service on committees. The other faculty in the department weigh in on their application for tenure, taking into account how the person contributes to the department's workplace culture as well. A tenure committee then sends a recommendation to the school's administration or board of trustees.\n\n\"The tenure and promotion process is problematic in a few ways,\" said LaWanda Ward, an assistant professor at Pennsylvania State University who seeks tenure.\n\n\"The challenge for Black women is the unspoken academic norms that are still in place that are harmful to them,\" she said. \"Specifically, how people can use nebulous concepts like fit and quality and collegiality to prevent them from being hired, prevent them from getting tenure.\"\n\nA study in 2020 noted that Black women face a wider range of microaggressions in the workplace, have their judgment questioned more often and are less likely to say their manager advocates for opportunities for them than their colleagues of other races and ethnicities.\n\nThat may come into play when a professor is considered for tenure.\n\nTenure is essentially a lifetime appointment that comes with an increase in pay, influence and opportunity within the university. Critics of the tenure system say it makes it difficult to remove professors accused of misconduct, such as sexual harassment.\n\nMore than 70% of Black faculty members reported “feeling a need to work harder than their colleagues to be seen as legitimate scholars,” compared with less than half of white professors, according to a report in 2019 from the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nThis feeling may be fueled in part by a lack of clarity surrounding the promotion and tenure process, the report found.\n\n\"The policies aren't specific. You have to do rigorous work, or you have to do enough work or high-impact work,\" said Kimberly Griffin, a professor of higher education at the University of Maryland at College Park who studies faculty diversity.\n\n\"It can be very subjective,\" she added.\n\nGriffin said many tenure-seeking professors of color report feeling unwelcomed by white colleagues and unable to find mentorship opportunities to help navigate the \"really fuzzy\" process.\n\nMore:Predominantly white colleges tackle racism, diversity, equity and inclusion\n\n'On our own terms':How scholars of color correct the narrative of national tragedies\n\nMinority professors are often asked to participate in their university's diversity, equity and inclusion work and mentor the growing number of students of color. But during tenure considerations, that service labor is less valued than research and teaching, Griffin said.\n\nInstitutions may place less value on research and subjects that Black women teach related to race or social justice, said Ward, who studies tenure denial lawsuits filed by Black women.\n\n\"We’re at risk,\" she said. \"There's definitely more precarity for those of us who want to emphasize and teach the next generation about equity and inclusion.\"\n\nFor Hannah-Jones, the Pulitzer Prize-winning creator of The New York Times Magazine’s 1619 Project, tenure had historically been offered for the position she was set to fill at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The board offered her the position without tenure this year.\n\nThough it sparked a conversation about inequities in academia, Griffin said, it's not a typical example of how the tenure process works. It was only after Hannah-Jones retained legal counsel, students staged protests on campus and the university faced national backlash that UNC-Chapel Hill trustees voted to offer her tenure. Hannah-Jones declined and accepted a tenured position at Howard University.\n\nNormally, when professors are denied tenure, it's because their colleagues didn't support their case, not a school's board of trustees, Griffin said.\n\nProfessors denied tenure can appeal the decision. If that fails, they may pursue legal action, but most tenure denial lawsuits are \"not very successful\" because it is challenging to find direct evidence of discrimination, Ward said.\n\n\"The litigation process is not only financially cost-prohibitive but also emotionally, psychologically,\" Ward said. “Some Black women say, ‘You know what? It's not worth it. This institution doesn’t want me.’”\n\nMore:After George Floyd, students sick of ‘lip service,’ want action from colleges over racism\n\nFinding another tenure-track position could be challenging for someone without the attention and credentials Hannah-Jones has, Griffin said.\n\n\"You’re losing your job,\" Griffin said. \"When you're early in your career and still trying to establish your name, it can be really difficult.\"\n\nHaving a more diverse faculty at the highest ranks would allow institutions to better serve the increasingly diverse student bodies on campuses, Griffin said. Research has shown having diverse perspective leads to better research outcomes.\n\nFor decades, universities have touted their commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, but in the wake of last summer's racial justice protests, students have demanded their schools do more.\n\nGriffin said colleges and universities should focus on recruiting and retaining a diverse student body and staff by addressing the stereotyping, bias and marginalization they face. Tenure and promotion practices must be reevaluated, she said, to ensure they recognize and reward the work scholars of color do outside the classroom.\n\n\"This is not a problem that's going to be fixed really quickly,\" Griffin said.\n\nFollow N'dea Yancey-Bragg on Twitter: @NdeaYanceyBragg", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/restaurants/2018/08/09/highest-grossing-restaurants-in-america/37227589/", "title": "Profitable restaurants: Highest grossing eateries in America", "text": "Colman Andrews\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nThe restaurant business is a tough one. The average lifespan of a restaurant is five years and by some estimates, up to 90 percent of new ones fail within the first year. There are, however, some very successful exceptions that manage to rake in millions of dollars a year.\n\n24/7 Wall Street reviewed food service trade publication Restaurant Business’s latest annual ranking of the top 100 independent restaurants in America, which is based on their reported or estimated gross food and beverage sales for the year. They define independents, for the survey’s purposes, as restaurants with no more than five locations. Fewer than a dozen of the places on this list are single-operator restaurants.\n\nThe most recent Restaurant Business rankings, sponsored by Campbell’s, were published late last year, based on figures from 2016. The shuttering in late July of one of their top 50 establishments, Carnevino (No. 23), due to sexual misconduct allegations, inspired us to take a new look at the list. In the course of doing that, we discovered that two other restaurants in the top 50 have also closed since the list was published. There’s no indication that these two went out of business for financial reasons, but the fact that even restaurants that are phenomenally successful can close might serve as a reminder that sales and profits are not the same thing.\n\nPerusal of this list reveals a few interesting facts. First, American diners are obviously carnivorous, as 16 of the top 50 are steakhouses or focus strongly on meat. Second, though Los Angeles has been getting much publicity lately as the country’s new food capital, it shows poorly on the list of top grossing restaurants, with only one restaurant making the cut. New York City, on the other hand, accounts for 20 of the 50. Next in line are Las Vegas, Chicago and vicinity, and Washington, D.C. Finally, celebrity chefdom apparently doesn’t mean very much when it comes to serious financial success. Only half a dozen of these highly grossing restaurants have or had famed culinary personalities attached. Two of those are among the places that have since closed, and two more are no longer associated with the noted names.\n\nSome of the restaurants on this list serve breakfast (and brunch), lunch, and dinner, while others are open only in the evenings; many are open seven days a week, while others might close for a day or two. These factors obviously influence the number of meals served annually. The restaurant industry usually computes “average check” (or “check average”) by dividing total sales by number of those meals. In some instances in this list, the math doesn’t work out, but that’s most likely because the restaurants in question (especially those with nightclubs and/or large bars or lounges) racked up substantial sales from alcohol unaccompanied by meals.\n\nMore: Employment trends: 20 jobs that have become dominated by women\n\n50.

Opened in 2005, Del Posto got a three-star review in the New York Times the following year, and then a four-star ranking — the paper's highest restaurant accolade — in 2010. No other Italian place had reached that level since 1974. Chef Rodriguez -- who joined the staff in 2011, was promoted to chef de cuisine in 2015, and became executive chef last year -- prepares refined but full-flavored versions of many Italian classics, including vitello tonnato, orecchiette with rabbit sausage and turnips, and the seafood stew called cacciucco livornese.\n\n31.

After that closed, the structure was occupied only occasionally until 2014, when Nashville chef-restaurateur and caterer Tom Morales took it over.

There's a salad bar, a selection of fresh fish, and some meat dishes marked on the menu as \"for the landlubber.\" Some 13 variations on surf & turf are also offered.\n\n29.

The restaurant's winning customer-suggested dessert is cheesecake ice cream with Key lime pie ribbons, graham cracker crunch, and toasted marshmallow swirl. T.G.I.

The wine list is immense and justly famous, and there are private rooms that can seat up to 250 people.\n\n27. The Smith (Lincoln Square)\n\nLocation: New York, N.Y.\n\nNew York, N.Y.

Burke, the celebrity chef who has opened and closed a number of restaurants in New York and elsewhere, actually left the place in 2014 but didn't take his name off it until last year. Despite its success, the restaurant, which is located in the James Hotel, closed on Dec. 9 and is scheduled to be reinvented soon as The James Kitchen + Bar.\n\n25.

He is also a showman, well-suited to Las Vegas, where this carnivore's paradise offers an array of tartares, carpaccios, and cured meats; steaks galore, including Japanese Kobe; roast suckling pig (by special order); and, just for variety, caviar tasting flights and what the menu calls \"meats from the sea\" like whole turbot and grilled Maine lobster.\n\n23.

The structure burned in 1964 but was rebuilt and reopened the following year. Aged steaks, in various cuts and sizes, are a specialty — the restaurant claims to serve an average of 22,000 of them a month — but seafood, seafood-and-meat combinations, and even a char-grilled vegetable plate are also available.\n\n21.

Two more were subsequently launched, in Las Vegas and Washington, D.C., and all three are among\n\nthe highest-grossing restaurants in the country (see No. 15 and No.17).\n\nFlorida stone crab remains a staple of the menu, along with other fish and shellfish choices such as oysters Rockefeller, crispy fried shrimp, and grilled Alaskan halibut. Steaks include a rarely seen bone-in filet mignon.\n\n19.

The club at The Hamilton is host to the annual White House Correspondents Jam, held the night before the famous political-themed dinner itself (Billy Bob Thornton, Kevin Bacon, and newsman/rock bassist Lester Holt have been among the performers).\n\nThe restaurant?

The design of this three-level, 300-seat place is appropriately theatrical, with a dining room dominated by a 16-foot-tall seated Buddha above a virtual reflecting pool.\n\nDim sum and other small plates such as rock shrimp lettuce cups, and chicken satay, as well as Chinese-style spareribs, tempura vegetables, sushi and sashimi, seafood in various guises, kung pao chicken, and a grilled Kobe ribeye with yuzu cilantro butter are among the menu choices.

The group launched this place — which it describes as \"the first modern steakhouse in the United States\" — in 2004.\n\nThe extensive menu includes a raw bar selection, more than 20 appetizers and salads -- including such unusual choices as truffle provolone fondue and pan-seared diver scallops with slow-braised wagyu short rib -- 15 different cuts and sizes of steak with 17 accompanying sauces and compound butters, 10 kinds of regular and sweet potatoes, 22 vegetable preparations, and a raft of \"chef's compositions,\" from blackened local swordfish to chicken and waffles.\n\n12.

Annual sales: $23,680,917\n\n$23,680,917 Avg. check: $80\n\n$80 Meals served annually: 215,483\n\nAnother oversized restaurant complex from the Tao Group (see No. 50, No. 14, No. 7, No. 3, and No. 1), which has been majority-owned by the Madison Square Garden Co. since last year, Vandal eschews the Asian ambiance of the Tao restaurants themselves to feature what its website styles as \"the art, architecture, and food of global culture.\" Graphics, multimedia works, and photographs by an international group of urban artists line the walls. It can be debated whether yellowtail crudo with blueberry and ginger, avocado toast with peas and radishes, or a 50-day-dry-aged 36-ounce tomahawk ribeye steak were \"[i]nspired by street food from around the world,\" as the website puts it, but there is certainly a multi-cultural flavor to such dishes as roasted squash tostadas, shawarma salad, tortilla soup dumplings, and wild mushroom \"street pizza.\"\n\n11. Junior's (Times Square)\n\nLocation: New York, N.Y.\n\nNew York, N.Y. Annual sales: $23,972,978\n\n$23,972,978 Avg. check: $24\n\n$24 Meals served annually: 950,000\n\nSince the original was opened in 1950 in Brooklyn, Junior's has been famous for its New York-style cheesecake. The menu goes far beyond that, though, with a full deli-style selection of blintzes and potato pancakes, deli sandwiches (including four Reuben variations), burgers, and entrees, including brisket of beef and Hungarian beef goulash. Less in the deli mode are such appetizers as Thai ginger BBQ wings, disco fries, and seven barbecue shrimp, chicken, and ribs choices. When this first Junior's in Manhattan's Times Square neighborhood opened in 2006, according to the restaurant website, its \"Brooklyn NY\" sign confused would-be customers who thought they'd come out of the subway at the wrong stop. There's a newer Junior's four blocks north, as well as outposts at Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut and in Boca Raton, Florida.\n\nMore: Are these the worst cities to live in?

It opened its doors in 1989 in the space that once housed the legendary club Mister Kelly's, where the likes of Bette Midler, Sarah Vaughan, and Muddy Waters once appeared. Gibsons was the first restaurant group in the country to be granted its own USDA Prime certification, and it serves only Midwestern grass-fed Black Angus beef plus a couple of 75-day-aged Australian grass-fed cuts. The menu is similar to that at the Rosemount restaurant, and prices are basically the same.\n\n9. Bryant Park Grill & Cafe\n\nLocation: New York, NY\n\nNew York, NY Annual sales: $25,400,000\n\n$25,400,000 Avg. check: $50 (est.)\n\n$50 (est.) Meals served annually: 420,000\n\nIn the early 1980s, Manhattan's centrally located Bryant Park, behind the New York Public Library's main branch, was an unkempt no-go landscape where dope dealers and other disreputable types plied their trades. Today, it is a major destination, hosting over a thousand free activities, classes, and events each year as well as a popular Winter Village of shops — and this beautifully situated restaurant, opened in 1995 in a latticed pavilion and environs.\n\nBreakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, and all-day café service are available here. The menu is international in flavor, ranging from Moroccan lamb kebab and sashimi tuna taco appetizers to such main dishes as sweet and spicy monkfish and grilled chicken fricassée. Ark Restaurants, which operates 22 establishments in six states and Washington, D.C., runs the place.\n\n8. Smith & Wollensky\n\nLocation: New York, N.Y.\n\nNew York, N.Y. Annual sales: $25,961,337\n\n$25,961,337 Avg. check: $100\n\n$100 Meals served annually: 296,723\n\nBorn in 1977, this classic steakhouse was named totally at random, with \"Smith\" and \"Wollensky\" chosen from a New York City phone book. The man behind it was Alan Stillman, who a dozen years earlier had created T.G.I. Fridays. He described the steakhouse originally as \"the American version of the French restaurants I loved in France.\" Since its founding, Smith & Wollensky grew into a small chain, which today has nine venues around the country and one in London. In 2007, however, Stillman sold the company to the Patina Restaurant Group, keeping the Manhattan original for himself.\n\nPrime dry-aged steaks form the heart of the relatively restrained menu, but there are also such traditional dishes as Caesar salad, New England clam chowder, lemon pepper chicken, and Dover sole meunière. Wine lovers appreciate the thrice-yearly Wine Week promotion, which offers samples of 10 different wines with lunch or dinner for $20.\n\n7.

Antique mirrors, reclaimed subway tiles, and old factory bricks frame the dining room.\n\nThe menu offers a few surprises, but covers such basics as baked clams oreganato, Maine lobster cocktail, \"The Meatball,\" an assortment of pizzas and pastas, chicken Marsala, and grilled red snapper with panzanella salad. The subterranean herringbone-tiled nightclub boasts a sunken dancefloor, raised VIP sections, and a multitude of LED screens.\n\n6.

Chicago's Gibsons Restaurant Group (see No. 36 and No. 10) is in charge here.\n\nMore: Who is getting paid more? 16 states where personal incomes are booming\n\n5.

It evolved into a saloon and then an eating place, occupying numerous locations over the decades. The owners of Georgetown restaurant Clyde's bought it at a federal tax auction in 1970 -- this was the beginning of what is today the Clyde's Restaurant Group (see No. 16) -- and it moved a final time in 1983.\n\nThe clubby dining room, with its Old Bar behind carved glass panels, serves mostly all-American fare with an occasional Southern accent, including fried green tomatoes, oyster gumbo, cornmeal-crusted fried catfish, along with a couple of steaks, a few pastas, and a choice of sandwiches and burgers.\n\n4.

A special allergy menu caters to those with dairy and egg, wheat/gluten, and garlic allergies as well as to vegetarians and vegans.\n\n3. Tao Downtown\n\nLocation: New York, N.Y.\n\nNew York, N.Y.

The restaurant's website says that the place \"is intended to look and feel as if it has been there for decades and only unearthed recently …\"\n\nThe pan-Asian menu includes dim sum, yakitori, tempura, a number of noodle and rice selections, sushi and sashimi, and numerous seafood, poultry, and meat dishes. The majority owner of the Tao group is now the Madison Square Garden Co., which owns sports teams and various entertainment venues around the country in addition to its iconic namesake.\n\nMore: Broad appeal: McDonald's, Walmart top list of 25 most popular stores in America\n\n2.

He and his wife had opened a lunch stand in Miami Beach in 1913. In 1921, a visiting ichthyologist from Harvard brought him a sack of these crustaceans. At first, Joe thought nobody would eat them, but he tried boiling and then chilling them, and they were a hit. In 2000, Chicago's Let Us Entertain You restaurant group went into partnership with Weiss's descendents to open a hybrid called Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab (see No. 20 and No. 17), but the original remains a one-of-a-kind operation.\n\nBesides the signature claws -- fresh stone crabs are in season from October 15 to May 15 -- the large menu offers plenty of other seafood, including oysters, snapper and shrimp ceviche, crab cannelloni, potato-crusted mahi mahi, and even skirt steak tacos and steak frites. If you can't get to Joe's in person, the restaurant ships \"Claws for Celebration\" packages, featuring stone crab claws, the house mustard sauce, a cracking board, a mallet, cocktail forks, and bibs. Prices range from $138.95 for medium claws for two to $1,251.95 for jumbo claws for 10.\n\n1.

The Madison Square Garden Co., which bought a majority stake in the Tao Group in 2017, owns various entertainment venues in addition to sports teams and the Garden itself.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Russia, meanwhile, has become a top market for China’s currency, and Chinese companies are rushing to fill the vacuum left by departing Western brands.\n\nRecord trade\n\nChina’s spending on Russian goods soared 60% in August from a year ago, hitting $11.2 billion, according to Chinese customs statistics, surpassing July’s 49% gain.\n\nIts shipments to Russia, meanwhile, jumped 26% to $8 billion in August, also accelerating from the previous month.\n\nFor the first eight months of this year, total goods trade between China and Russia surged 31% to $117.2 billion. That’s already 80% of last year’s total — which stood at a record $147 billion.\n\n“Russia needs China more than China needs Russia,” said Keith Krach, former Under Secretary of State for Economic growth, Energy and the Environment in the United States.\n\n“As the war in Ukraine drags on, Putin’s losing friends fast and increasingly becoming more and more dependent on China,” he added.\n\nFor China, Russia now accounts for 2.8% of its total trade volume, slightly higher than the 2.5% share at the end of last year. The European Union and United States have much bigger shares.\n\nChina was already Russia’s largest single trading partner before the war, and accounted for 16% of its total foreign trade.\n\nBut the world’s second biggest economy has assumed much greater significance for Russia, which has plunged into a recession because of the Western sanctions.\n\nThe Russian central bank stopped publishing detailed trade data when the war in Ukraine started. But Bruegel, a European economic think tank, analyzed statistics from Russia’s top 34 trading partners recently and estimated that China accounted for roughly 24% of Russia’s exports in June.\n\n“China-Russia trade is booming because China is taking advantage of the Ukraine crisis to buy Russian energy at a discount and replace Western firms that have exited the market,” said Neil Thomas, a senior analyst on China at Eurasia Group.\n\nRussia displaced Saudi Arabia in May as the top supplier of oil to China. Moscow has held onto that top spot for three straight months through July, according to the latest Chinese customs data.\n\nChina’s coal imports from Russia also hit a five-year high of 7.42 million metric tons in July.\n\nCoal in freight wagons ahead of shipping at Tomusinskaya railway station near Mezhdurechensk, Russia, on Monday, July 19, 2021. Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nYuan the new dollar in Russia?\n\nThe Ukraine war has also sent demand for the Chinese yuan soaring in Russia, as Western sanctions largely cut Moscow off from global financial system and restricted its access to the dollar and euro.\n\nYuan trade on the Moscow stock exchange amounted to 20% of the total trading volumes by major currencies in July, up from no more than 0.5% in January, according to Russian news media outlet Kommersant.\n\nDaily trading volumes in the yuan-ruble exchange rate also hit a new record last month, surpassing ruble-dollar trade for the first time in history, according to Russian state-controlled media RT.\n\nAccording to statistics published by SWIFT, the messaging system used by financial institutions globally to process international payments, Russia was the third biggest market in the world for payments made in yuan outside mainland China in July, after Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. The country didn’t even appear on SWIFT’s list of top 15 yuan markets in February.\n\nRussian companies and banks are also increasingly turning to the yuan for international payments.\n\nLast week, Russia’s Gazprom said it would start billing China in yuan and ruble for natural gas supplies, while Russia’s VTB bank said it was launching money transfers to China in yuan.\n\nFor Beijing, it’s a boost to its ambitions to make the yuan a global currency.\n\n“Increased Russian use of the yuan also helps to inch forward China’s long-term goals to make the redback a global currency, to insulate itself from Western financial sanctions, and to enhance its institutional power in international finance,” said Thomas from Eurasia Group.\n\nFor Russia, this partnership with China “is born of desperation,” said Krach.\n\n“Because Russia has been severely weakened, in part by sanctions, Putin is willing to do a deal with a predatory power so long as it gains access to capital,” he added.\n\nChinese companies fill the vacuum\n\nChinese companies are also taking advantage of the exodus of Western brands from Russia.\n\nChinese smartphones accounted for two-thirds of all new sales in Russia between April and June, Reuters reported, citing Russia’s top electronics retailer M.Video-Eldorado. Their total share in Russia has steadily increased from 50% in the first quarter, to 60% in April, and then to more than 70% in June, M.Video said.\n\nXiaomi was the best-selling smartphone maker in Russia in July, holding 42% of the market, according to Russian media Kommersant.\n\nSamsung (SSNLF), once the market leader, had only 8.5% of the market in July. Apple (AAPL) held 7%. The two companies accounted for almost half of the Russian market prior to the Ukraine invasion, but suspended sales of new products in the country after the war began.\n\nChinese cars have also flooded Russia.\n\nPassenger cars from Chinese manufacturers accounted for almost 26% of Russia’s market in August, the highest on record, according to Russian analytical agency Autostat. That compares with just 9.5% in the first quarter.\n\nMajor global auto players, including Ford and Toyota, have pulled back from Russia this year.\n\nLimits in ‘no limits’ partnership\n\nBut there are also significant limits in the China-Russia partnership, analysts said.\n\nChina is not providing military, commercial, or technological support that would “risk significant US sanctions on China,” said Thomas at Eurasia Group.\n\n“Beijing will not sacrifice its own economic interests to support Moscow,” he said.\n\nFearing a US backlash, China has so far “steadfastly” refused to violate international sanctions against Russia, forcing Moscow to request military support from North Korea, said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the DC-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\n“Beijing’s refusal to violate US and international sanctions reflects its begrudging acceptance that China remains reliant on Western capital and technology to sustain its ongoing development, even though Xi is personally inclined to assist Putin’s war effort,” he said.\n\nMoreover, China’s rapid economic slowdown this year will further constrain Xi’s willingness to help Putin. The Chinese president won’t want to risk anything that further destabilizes the economy mere weeks before he’s poised to secure an historic third term at the Communist Party’s congress.\n\nWhat the future holds\n\nFuture relations will likely remained strained, and China will want to keep its options open, analysts said.\n\n“There’s always been mistrust between the two regimes, which historically treated each other as rivals,” Krach noted.\n\nThe current Sino-Russia partnership is mainly a “defensive” one, enhanced by Beijing and Moscow’s shared view that NATO and the United States pose a “palpable national security threat,” said Susan Thornton, senior fellow and visiting lecturer at Yale Law School.\n\n“Russia’s war in Ukraine is not in China’s interest, but given Western hostility, China will not oppose Russia,” she added.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/economy/china-cant-help-russia-sanctions-fallout-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China can't do much to help Russia's sanction-hit economy | CNN ...", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN Business —\n\nWill China help Russia cope with the fallout from economic sanctions?\n\nThat has been the big question since Russia invaded Ukraine last week. The two nations have forged close ties in recent years, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping calling Russian President Vladimir Putin his “best and bosom friend” in 2019. During Putin’s visit to Beijing last month, the two states proclaimed that their friendship has “no limits.”\n\nThat was before Russia launched its war in Ukraine, and was hit with unprecedented sanctions from Western countries. Now, China’s ability to help its neighbor is being sorely tested. Experts say Beijing’s options are limited.\n\n“China’s leaders are walking a very difficult tightrope on Ukraine,” said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a DC-based think tank.\n\nBeijing has not rushed to help Russia after its economy was slammed by sanctions from all over the world. On Wednesday, Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said that the country won’t participate in sanctions, but he didn’t offer any relief either.\n\nEarlier this week, China’s foreign minister spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart, and said that China was “deeply grieved to see the conflict” and that its “fundamental position on the Ukraine issue is open, transparent and consistent.”\n\nAnd the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a development bank backed by Beijing, said Thursday it was suspending all its activities in Russia as “the war in Ukraine unfolds.”\n\n“China’s complicated messaging suggests that Beijing will continue to blame Washington and its allies for provoking Russia,” Singleton said.\n\nHowever, “such moves will fall far short of further antagonizing the United States on account of Beijing’s desire to avoid a complete breakdown in US-China relations,” he added.\n\nClose but relatively small trading ties\n\nBefore Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Putin had deepened his country’s ties with China significantly.\n\nDuring his recent visit to China, the two countries signed 15 deals, including new contracts with Russian energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft. China also agreed to lift all import restrictions on Russian wheat and barley.\n\nLast year, 16% of China’s oil imports came from Russia, according to official statistics. This makes Russia the second biggest supplier to China after Saudi Arabia. About 5% of China’s natural gas also came from Russia last year.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, buys about 70% of its semiconductors from China, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. It also imports computers, smart phones, and car components from China. Xiaomi, for example, is among the most popular smartphone brands in Russia.\n\nChina has also signed Russian banks onto its Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), a clearing and settlement system seen as a potential alternative to SWIFT, the Belgium-based secure messaging service that connect hundreds of financial institutions around the world.\n\nChina and Russia share a strategic interest in challenging the West. But the invasion of Ukraine has put the friendship to the test.\n\nFriendship test\n\n“There is not yet any indication that China sees aiding Russia as worth violating Western sanctions,” said Neil Thomas, a China analyst at Eurasia Group, adding that a “flagrant” defiance of those sanctions would come with a “heavy economic punishment” for Beijing as well.\n\n“Beijing’s much-touted lifting of import restrictions on Russian wheat was agreed before the invasion and does not indicate Chinese support,” he said.\n\nWhile Russia needs China for trade, Beijing has other priorities. The world’s second largest economy is Russia’s No. 1 trading partner, accounting for 16% of the value of its foreign trade, according to CNN Business’ calculations based on 2020 figures from the World Trade Organization and Chinese customs data.\n\nBut for China, Russia matters a lot less: Trade between the two countries made up just 2% of China’s total trade volume. The European Union and the United States have much larger shares.\n\nChinese banks and companies also fear secondary sanctions if they deal with Russian counterparts.\n\n“Most Chinese banks cannot afford to lose access to US dollars and many Chinese industries cannot afford to lose access to US technology,” said Thomas.\n\nAccording to Singleton, these Chinese entities “could very quickly find themselves subject to increased Western scrutiny if they are perceived in any meaningful way as aiding Russian attempts to evade U.S.-led sanctions.”\n\n“Recognizing that China’s economy and industrial output have been under enormous pressure in recent months, Chinese policymakers will likely attempt to strike a delicate balance between supporting Russia rhetorically but without antagonizing Western regulators,” he added.\n\nThere have been reports this week that two of China’s largest banks — ICBC and Bank of China — have restricted financing for purchases of Russian commodities, in fear of violating potential sanctions.\n\nReuters also reported Tuesday that China’s coal imports from Russia have stalled because buyers couldn’t secure funding from state banks worried about international sanctions.\n\nICBC and Bank of China did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business.\n\nSignificant practical constraints\n\nEven if China wants to support Russia in areas that are not subject to sanctions — such as energy — Beijing may face severe restrictions, experts said.\n\nThe “financial sanctions that have been imposed on Russia by the West put significant practical constraints on China’s dealings with Russia even where they don’t restrict them directly,” said Mark Williams, chief Asian economist at Capital Economics, in a research note on Wednesday.\n\nSome commentators have suggested that China’s CIPS could be used as an alternative by Russia, now that seven Russian banks have been removed from SWIFT.\n\nBut CIPS is much smaller in size. It has only 75 direct participating banks, compared with more than 11,000 member institutions in SWIFT. About 300 Russian financial institutions are in SWIFT, while only two dozen Russian banks are connected to CIPS.\n\nThe yuan is also not freely convertible, and is used less frequently than other major currencies in international trade. It accounted for 3% of payments globally in January, compared with 40% in the dollar, according to SWIFT. Even China-Russia trade has been dominated by the dollar and euro.\n\n“In practice, because CIPS is limited to payments in [yuan], it is only currently used for transactions with China. Banks elsewhere are unlikely to turn to CIPS as a SWIFT workaround while Russia is an international pariah,” Williams said.\n\nNeither can China replace the United States in providing key technologies for Russia’s needs.\n\nLast week, the Biden administration announced a series of measures to restrict technological exports or foreign goods built with US technology to Russia.\n\nRussia imports mostly low-end computer chips from China, which are used in cars and home appliances. Both Russia and China rely on the United States for high-end chips needed for advanced weapons systems.\n\n“China alone can’t supply all of Russia’s critical needs for the military,” a senior US administration official said at a media briefing last week, according to Reuters. “China doesn’t have any production of the most advanced technology nodes. So Russia and China are both reliant on other supplier countries and of course US technology to meet their needs.”\n\nThat could lead Chinese tech companies — particularly larger ones — to exercise even more caution in potential deals with Russia.\n\n“Some small Chinese firms that do not depend on US inputs may backfill some of Russia’s demand for sanctioned US technology,” said Thomas from Eurasia Group. “But big Chinese tech firms will be cautious to avoid the fate of Huawei, which the US government stunted by cutting its access to advanced semiconductors,” he added.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/china/china-russia-united-front-sco-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China and Russia present united front at regional summit despite ...", "text": "Hong Kong (CNN) When Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin sit down with other Asian leaders at a summit in Central Asia Friday, they will seek to present a united front to counterbalance the United States and its allies.\n\nBut within their \"no-limits\" relationship, potential differences over Russia's faltering invasion of Ukraine are beginning to emerge. The brutal war has also created friction within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a regional security grouping led by Beijing and Moscow.\n\nBeginning Thursday, leaders from the grouping, including India, Pakistan, Iran and four Central Asian countries, have convened in the city of Samarkand in Uzbekistan, which has seen a flurry of high-level talks, including the first face-to-face meeting between Xi and Putin since the invasion.\n\nDuring their talks, Putin conceded that Chinese officials had \" questions and concerns \" over his protracted military assault, in what appeared to be the first -- although somewhat veiled -- admission of their differences on the conflict.\n\nPutin's appearance alongside Xi at the high-profile summit comes just days after Russian forces suffered a series of major defeats on the Ukrainian battlefield. Moscow's invasion has left it diplomatically isolated, and its economy severely weakened by a raft of punishing Western sanctions.\n\nIn recent months, China has offered Russia tacit support and stepped up economic assistance to its neighbor, boosting bilateral trade to a record high. But as the conflict drags on into winter, analysts question how far Xi will be prepared to go in continuing to back Putin -- and at what cost.\n\n\"The economic situation in Russia is deteriorating, and that gives China an upper hand in the relationship,\" said Alexander Gabuev , a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"Ties between Moscow and Beijing have been asymmetric before Russia was a needier partner, but now this is an asymmetry on steroids where China has the commanding position, and definitely will be not shy to use it going forward.\"\n\nIn public, China has pledged to deepen ties with Russia. An official Chinese readout of the Xi-Putin meeting Thursday made no mention of Ukraine. Instead, it quoted Xi as saying that China would \"work with Russia to extend strong mutual support on issues concerning each other's core interests\" and \"play a leading role in injecting stability and positive energy into a world of change and disorder.\"\n\nFor his part, Putin highlighted Moscow's value to Beijing -- namely to join hands in counterbalancing the West and creating what he calls \"a just, democratic and multipolar world order.\"\n\nIn a thinly-veiled snub at the US, the Russian leader noted that \"the attempts to create a unipolar world have recently acquired an absolutely ugly shape, and are absolutely unacceptable for the vast majority of states on the planet.\"\n\nDivision within the SCO\n\nThe SCO summit could have provided a chance for Beijing and Moscow to make a case for that \"multipolar world order,\" but Russia's invasion of Ukraine may have sowed divisions within the grouping and alienated some countries.\n\nHaving watched Russian tanks roll into Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, Central Asian leaders of former Soviet territories are worried that Russia could encroach on their land too.\n\nKazakhstan, in particular, has refused to toe Moscow's line. It has sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and its President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has publicly refused to recognize Russia-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, enraging some Kremlin officials.\n\nChina's refusal to condemn Russia has also caused unease among Central Asian countries, experts say. That risks hampering China's efforts to build stronger ties with its Central Asian neighbors, an endeavor China has invested heavily in for two decades.\n\nDuring Xi's state visit to Kazakhstan on Wednesday -- his first foreign trip in nearly 1,000 days -- the Chinese leader sought to allay such concerns.\n\n\"China will always support Kazakhstan in maintaining national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" Xi told Tokayev, the Kazakh President, according to Chinese state media.\n\nAlso complicating the picture is India, which occupies a unique role in the SCO.\n\nDelhi, which like Beijing has not condemned Russia's invasion, has strong ties with Moscow dating back to the Cold War. According to some estimates, India gets more than 50% of its military equipment from Russia.\n\nIn recent months, India has significantly increased its purchase of Russian oil, coal and fertilizer, despite Western pressure to cut economic ties with the Kremlin following its aggression in Ukraine.\n\nBut Delhi has also seen relations with Beijing nosedive due to conflicts along their border, and has moved closer to Washington and its allies in the Indo-Pacific. India is a member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue alongside the US, Japan and Australia, a grouping driven closer together by China's threats.\n\nModi, who arrived in Samarkand after midnight Friday, is expected to have one-on-one meetings with his Russian, Uzbekistan and Iranian counterparts, a source from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs told CNN.\n\nBut based on his tentative schedule, Modi doesn't have a meeting scheduled with Xi. The two leaders haven't met since the start of the China-India border conflict more than two years ago.\n\nLast week, Delhi and Beijing began disengaging from the Gogra-Hotsprings border area in the western Himalayas.\n\nIn addition to their territorial disputes, Delhi is also wary of Beijing's growing economic influence over its smaller neighbors.\n\n\"Ever since Modi came to power, we have seen relations (between India and China) steadily deteriorate,\" said Manoj Kewalramani, a fellow of China studies at the Takshashila Institution in India.\n\nBut Kewalramani said the SCO could provide a \"space (for India) to engage with China and Russia.\"\n\n\"Particularly, being on the table while China and Russia are together, because the closer that relationship gets, the trickier it gets for India,\" he said.\n\nAn anti-West world order?\n\nFounded in 2001 by China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to combat terrorism and promote border security, the SCO was initially shrouded in relative obscurity for years.\n\nUnder Xi, it expanded in size and profile, granting membership to India and Pakistan in 2017. After years on the waiting list as an observer, Iran will become a full member at this summit.\n\nAfghanistan is also an observer, and the Taliban -- having taken over Kabul following a chaotic US withdrawal last year -- is sending a delegation to Samarkand.\n\nBut it is Iran that has set off most alarm bells in the West. Since 2019, Iran, Russia and China have held three joint naval drills amid deepening ties. Now, Iran's inclusion in the SCO is stoking fears long held by some observers that the grouping is emerging as an anti-West bloc.\n\nBut some experts say in its current state, the SCO is not really the ideal platform for China and Russia to push that anti-West world order.\n\nAs a multilateral organization, the SCO is a much weaker regional bloc compared to the European Union or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n\n\"There has actually been some tension at times within the SCO. Russia has tried to advance some of its interests which aren't always aligned with China's in the region. I don't think it's perfectly set up to be this kind of platform for shaping a new world order,\" said Brian Hart, a fellow with the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"But I do think it is an important organization, one that Beijing hopes to continue to support and lead -- and one that it does appreciate Russian buy-in on.\"", "authors": ["Nectar Gan", "Rhea Mogul"], "publish_date": "2022/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/china/xi-putin-meeting-sco-summit-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Putin-Xi meeting: Russia's setback in Ukraine could derail their ...", "text": "Hong Kong (CNN) The last time Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin sat down face to face , they declared triumphantly the arrival of a \" new era \" in international relations.\n\nAmid a Western diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics and a looming crisis in Ukraine, the world's two most powerful autocrats shared their vision for a new world order: it would better accommodate their nations' interests, and no longer be dominated by the West.\n\nIn a 5,000-word joint statement, the two leaders declared a friendship with \"no limits\" and spelled out their shared grievances toward the United States and its allies.\n\n\"The world is going through momentous changes,\" their joint statement said, noting the \"transformation of the global governance architecture and world order.\"\n\nMore than 200 days later, Xi and Putin are to meet again at a regional summit in the city of Samarkand in southeastern Uzbekistan. Much has changed, but not necessarily in ways China or Russia could have predicted.\n\nThree weeks after meeting Xi in Beijing -- and just days after the Winter Olympics ended, Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He had expected a quick victory, but seven months in, Russia is far from winning. Its forces are exhausted, demoralized, and fleeing territories they have occupied for months.\n\nA destroyed Russian tank overgrown by plants in the village of Lukashivka, in the Chernihiv region of Ukraine.\n\nAnd that is making China nervous. Having grown ever closer to Moscow under Xi, Beijing has a direct stake in the war's outcome. A defeated Russia will strengthen the West and become a less useful and reliable asset in China's great power rivalry with the US. A weakened Moscow might also be less of a distraction for the US, thereby enabling Washington to focus more squarely on Beijing.\n\nXi has a fine line to tread. If he leans too much into helping Russia, he risks exposing China to Western sanctions and diplomatic blowback that would harm its own interests. The backlash would also come at a sensitive time for Xi, who is only weeks away from seeking a norm-breaking third term at the 20th Party Congress.\n\nSo far, the two authoritarian powers have not come any closer to shaping the world order in their favor -- if anything, experts say Russia's war on Ukraine has served to strengthen Western resolve.\n\nHigh stakes\n\nFor Putin, invading Ukraine was likely a first step in removing Russia from the post-World War II -- and post-Cold War -- international order.\n\nA swift seizure of Ukraine would have dealt a painful blow to NATO, expanded Moscow's sphere of influence and significantly shifted the balance of power in Europe, in Russia's favor.\n\nA Russian victory might also have set a dangerous precedent in regards to China, which has vowed to \"unify\" with the self-governing democracy of Taiwan -- by force if necessary.\n\nUnder Xi, Beijing is already stepping up military activity around the island. An easy win for Putin would have further deepened Xi's belief the West is in decline, and provided a template for an attack on Taiwan -- a hugely consequential event that could reset the global balance of power.\n\nTanks fire projectiles during a Taiwanese military live-fire drill, after Beijing increased its military exercises near Taiwan in September.\n\nBut Ukraine fought back and instead of sabotaging the US-led order, the invasion has reinvigorated NATO, strengthened transatlantic ties and united the West.\n\nPutin's meeting with Xi, meanwhile, could not have come at a worse time. Russian forces are retreating en mass in the northeast of Ukraine, losing more territory in a week than they captured in five months.\n\nWhile it is still too early to predict the outcome, even the prospect of Russia losing the war is enough to make Beijing anxious.\n\nRussia's setback in Ukraine is already starting to draw considerable political backlash within Moscow, and a complete defeat could potentially create political instability in the Kremlin -- and serious headaches for China.\n\nWhile the growing ties between China and Russia are primarily driven by their tensions with the West, they are also partly propelled by the close personal relationship between Xi and Putin. During his decade in power, Xi has met Putin 38 times -- more than twice as many times as he has met any other world leader.\n\nThere is no guarantee a Russia without a strong Putin would be as keen to pursue a \"no-limits\" friendship with Beijing; in a worst-case scenario, it might even grow more friendly to the West, adding to long-running Chinese fears about geopolitical encirclement by the US.\n\nJUST WATCHED Map shows how Ukraine pulled off counteroffensive Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Map shows how Ukraine pulled off counteroffensive 04:19\n\nSelf-interest calculation\n\nThe question, then, becomes how far Beijing is willing to go to ensure Putin remains in control, and that Russia remains a powerful security and strategic partner to counterbalance America.\n\nFor its part, China has abstained from voting against Russia at the United Nations. It has blamed NATO and the US for the war and decried Western sanctions on Moscow. It has also stepped up economic assistance to its neighbor, boosting bilateral trade to record levels.\n\n\"China is willing to give Russia some tacit support politically, diplomatically and to some extent economically, but the bottom line is that it isn't going to go out of its way and undercut its other strategic objectives to support Russia,\" said Brian Hart, a fellow with the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nSo far, Beijing has carefully avoided actions that could violate Western sanctions, such as providing direct military aid to Moscow. Access to the global market is crucial for China, especially when its economy is already beset by severe problems -- from slowing growth, skyrocketing youth unemployment to a collapsing housing market.\n\nOne area to watch, Hart said, is arms sales. China has long been one of Russia's largest purchasers of arms. \"I wonder if Russia's own defense industry is overstretched, would it turn to buy weapons from China,\" he said.\n\nBut even then, China would likely seek to send spare parts or items not on the sanction list, or ship them via convoluted routes that are difficult to trace.\n\n\"(Beijing and Moscow) have said over and over again that they don't intend to create a formal alliance that binds them in ways that go against their interests. That didn't work for them during the Sino-Soviet alliance in the 1950s, and I think they really view that as a lesson of history,\" Hart said.\n\n\"I think China will only continue to strengthen relations with Russia, to the extent that it really is in their overall interests.\"\n\nGrowing unease\n\nBut even before Russia's battlefield woes, its military aggression toward Ukraine -- and Beijing's tacit support for Moscow -- had already alienated some countries outside the Western orbit.\n\nWhen Xi and Putin meet other leaders of the eight-nation Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Uzbekistan on Thursday and Friday, the war in Ukraine will be the elephant in the room.\n\nHaving watched Russian tanks roll into Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, Central Asian leaders of former Soviet territories are worried that Russia could encroach on their land too.\n\nKazakhstan, in particular, has refused to toe Moscow's line. It has sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and its President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has publicly refused to recognize Russia-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, enraging some Kremlin officials.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping with Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev as he arrives in Kazakhstan on Wednesday.\n\nChina's refusal to condemn Russia has caused unease among Central Asian countries, said Niva Yau, a senior researcher at the OSCE Academy, a foreign policy think tank in Kyrgyzstan.\n\n\"China is at odds with countries in the region because it is still looking at Russia's war in Ukraine from this anti-West narrative -- like it's about to bring down Western hegemony,\" she said.\n\nThat risks hampering China's efforts to build stronger ties with its Central Asian neighbors, an endeavor China has invested heavily in for two decades, according to Yau.\n\nDuring Xi's state visit to Kazakhstan on Wednesday -- his first foreign trip in nearly 1,000 days -- the Chinese leader sought to allay such concerns.\n\n\"China will always support Kazakhstan in maintaining national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" Xi told Tokayev, the Kazakh President, according to Chinese state media.\n\nAn anti-West world order?\n\nXi's trip to Central Asia isn't only about showing support for Putin, though. It is also about strengthening ties in China's periphery and reasserting Beijing's global influence.\n\nFounded by China in 2001 to combat terrorism and promote border security, the SCO was shrouded in relative obscurity for years. Under Xi, it expanded in size and profile, granting membership to India and Pakistan in 2017. After years on the waiting list as an observer, Iran is slated to become a full member at this summit, according to Chinese state media reports.\n\nAfghanistan is also an observer, and the Taliban -- having taken over Kabul following a chaotic US withdrawal last year -- is sending a delegation to Samarkand.\n\nBut it is Iran that has set off most alarm bells in the West. Since 2019, Iran, Russia and China have held three joint naval drills amid deepening ties. Now, Iran's expected inclusion in the SCO is stoking fears long held by some observers that the grouping is emerging as an anti-West bloc.\n\nBut some experts say in its current state, the SCO is not really the ideal platform for China and Russia to push that anti-West world order.\n\nAs a multilateral organization, the SCO is a much weaker regional bloc compared to the European Union or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n\n\"There has actually been some tension at times within the SCO. Russia has tried to advance some of its interests which aren't always aligned with China's in the region. I don't think it's perfectly set up to be this kind of platform for shaping a new world order,\" said Hart at the CSIS.\n\nAlso complicating the picture is the presence of India, which has strong ties with Russia dating back to the Cold War. But Delhi has also seen relations with Beijing nosedive due to conflicts along their border, and has moved closer to Washington and its allies in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nIndia is a member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue alongside the US, Japan and Australia, a grouping driven closer together by China's threats\n\nNevertheless, Xi will use the SCO summit to show both the home crowd and the world that, despite being diplomatically isolated by the West, China still has friends and partners, and is ready to take on more leadership on the world stage.\n\nBut if the war in Ukraine ends up being a major inflection point for Russia's weakening, it could deal a setback for Xi's plans.\n\n\"China doesn't really have any other large powerful partners in the way that the United States has many European and Indo-Pacific allies that it can rely on. So Russia is by far the most powerful state that is somewhat closely aligned with China,\" Hart said.\n\n\"I think that is something Beijing worries about -- that Russia will overextend itself and it could undermine their collective efforts to shape the world order.\"", "authors": ["Analysis Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/08/asia/north-korea-nuclear-ukraine-war-lessons-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Analysis: What North Korea learned from Ukraine: Now's the perfect ...", "text": "(CNN) If North Korea was looking for another excuse to forge ahead with its nuclear weapons program, it just found one in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThat one of the very few countries to have voluntarily given up a nuclear arsenal is now under attack from the same country it gave its warheads to will not be lost on Pyongyang.\n\nIn fact, analysts say, Moscow's actions have gifted the reclusive Asian nation a \"perfect storm\" of conditions under which to ramp its program up.\n\nNot only will North Korea use Ukraine's plight to bolster its narrative that it needs nukes to guarantee its survival, but leader Kim Jong Un may find that, with all eyes on the war in Europe, he can get away with more than ever.\n\nDivided over Ukraine, the international community will likely have little appetite for sanctions on the hermit kingdom; indeed, even unified condemnation of a recent North Korean ICBM test remains elusive. What's more, the boycott of Russian oil and gas could even open the door to cut-price energy deals between Pyongyang and Moscow -- ideological allies whose friendship harks back to the Korean war of the 1950s.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, experts even wonder whether this is the start of a once unthinkable chain of events that could end with a return to inter-Korean conflict, perhaps even with the North invading the South -- though most see this as highly unlikely.\n\nAs professor Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University puts it, the lesson North Korea has learned from Russia's war in Ukraine, is simple:\n\n\"Never, ever surrender your nuclear weapons.\"\n\nNorth Korea's intermediate-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12 lifts off in 2017.\n\nA nuclear lesson, from Ukraine to Saddam and Gaddafi\n\nMoscow's invasion of its neighbor has reinforced a message that has been playing on Pyongyang's mind for decades, Lankov said.\n\nWhen Ukraine was part of the USSR, it hosted thousands of nuclear warheads. It voluntarily handed these over to Russia after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, as part of a 1994 deal with the United States, United Kingdom and Russia which would guarantee Ukraine's security, a deal known as the Budapest Memorandum.\n\nUkraine now finds itself under brutal attack from the very same country that signed the deal to protect its sovereignty -- one that now repeatedly refers to its nuclear arsenal to warn the West off intervention.\n\nWould Moscow have invaded if Ukraine had kept its warheads?\n\nMost experts -- and most likely Pyongyang too -- think not.\n\n\"Now (the North Koreans) have got yet another confirmation (of this lesson) after Iraq, after Libya,\" Lankov said.\n\nPyongyang regularly uses the experiences of Saddam Hussein and Moammar Gaddafi, the former leaders of Iraq and Libya, to justify its nuclear program, both to its own people and the world. Both strongmen leaders lost their grips on power -- and ultimately their own lives -- after their own nuclear ambitions came grinding to a halt.\n\nThe Russian invasion will bolster that narrative, but in doing so it could also have a \"very negative impact\" on the mind of North Korea's own strongman leader, according to Lee Sang-hyun, president and senior research fellow of the Sejong Institute.\n\nHe says Kim is likely to respond in only one way: by becoming \"even more obsessed with his nuclear weapons and missile capabilities.\"\n\nMissiles on display during a military parade at Kim Il-sung Square in Pyongyang in April.\n\nPyongyang's carte blanche\n\nEven before the invasion, North Korea had shown signs of ramping up its nuclear ambitions.\n\nOn Saturday, it held its 14th missile launch of the year -- up from just four tests in 2020 and eight in 2021. One of the missiles tested this year was believed to be an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) that is assumed capable of hitting the mainland US. That was the first ICBM test since 2017 and was widely seen as a harbinger of tests to come.\n\nKim made clear his intention to go full speed ahead with his nuclear program at a military parade on April 25.\n\nAnd commercial satellite images suggest Pyongyang is trying to restore access to its Punggye-ri underground testing site, according to South Korean officials and think-tanks.\n\nAgainst this background the Russian invasion -- and the international sanctions that followed -- have created a \"perfect storm\" of conditions for Pyongyang to operate in, analysts say.\n\n\"There are some interesting, perhaps unintended consequences for the Western response against Russia in particular, which is that a Russia that has been completely isolated from the global economy and put under tremendous sanctions pressure. I think it has very few incentives to enforce sanctions against North Korea,\" said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nA clear split among United Nations Security Council permanent members -- Russia and China on one side, the UK, US and France on the other -- means any unified decision to punish North Korea is impossible.\n\n\"It's quite clear that China and Russia will block additional sanctions and frankly it's not quite clear, what else can you possibly sanction,\" Lankov said.\n\nEven a seventh nuclear test may not provoke the usual negative response from Beijing, \"China is not going to be happy enough about nuclear tests, but they will swallow it,\" Lankov said.\n\nA South Korean news report on a North Korean missile launch in 2019.\n\nCashing in with an old friend\n\nIf anything, North Korea may even benefit financially as other countries boycott Russian oil and gas. The cash-strapped country would be more than happy to take up some of the slack, potentially at a discount, and deal with a Russia no longer constrained by US-led sanctions against the North.\n\n\"I think that Russia is going to provide more economic support and energy support to North Korea,\" said Ramon Pacheco Pardo, the KF-VUB Korea chair at the Institute for European Studies of Vrije Universiteit Brussel.\n\n\"Oil and gas, certainly but it could also include food... fertilizers, it could be all sorts of economic aid North Korea wants.\"\n\nThat Pyongyang would side with Moscow in a new world order is not a surprise.\n\nRelations between the two countries were forged by the Korean War of 1950-1953, and they shared a communist ideology for decades.\n\nThe former Soviet Union was a major benefactor to North Korea, financially propping the Kim regime up. While that task has now transferred to China, the return of Russia to strongman rule under President Vladimir Putin has put a new shine on the relationship.\n\n\"(Pyongyang) were sort of disgusted about the democratic and liberal or semi-democratic, semi-liberal Russia which used to exist, and they basically greeted Vladimir Putin as a leader who was driving the country into the right direction,\" Lankov said.\n\nKim's fleeting dance with the US -- holding three meetings with former President Donald Trump that ultimately yielded little -- only reminded him his more natural and lucrative allegiances remain with China and Russia.\n\nPyongyang for its part has made clear where it places the blame for the war in Ukraine. \"The root cause of the Ukraine crisis lies totally in the hegemonic policy of the US and the West which indulge themselves in high-handedness and arbitrariness towards other countries,\" its Foreign Ministry said.\n\nWorkers pour concrete at a construction site for nuclear reactors in Kumho, North Korea, back in 2002.\n\nWould North Korea invade the South?\n\nSince Russia's invasion, North Korea's rhetoric towards South Korea has changed.\n\nLast month Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, warned that if South Korea was to confront the North militarily its army would \"face a miserable fate little short of total destruction and ruin.\"\n\nThreatening language from Pyongyang is nothing new -- a US official once described being insulted publicly by North Korea as like a \"badge of honor.\"\n\nWhat is new is that since the invasion, experts like Lankov have been asking whether North Korea would consider an invasion of the South again -- more than seven decades after its invasion in 1950 sparked the Korean War.\n\nThat question has for years been dismissed out of hand. Most experts still see the changes as negligible, but the fact it is even being discussed is noteworthy.\n\n\"North Koreans are probably dreaming again about something that (they) used to take seriously, but in recent decades nearly forgot. That is conquest of the South,\" Lankov said.\n\nFor now, the idea seems fanciful. But the future is another matter.\n\n\"Maybe, just maybe, the American President of the year 2045 or 2055 will not risk San Francisco in order to save Seoul,\" Lankov said. \"(By then) North Koreans could use ICBMs, maybe nuclear armed submarines to (terrify) Americans, to blackmail Americans out of the conflict.\"", "authors": ["Analysis Paula Hancocks"], "publish_date": "2022/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/middleeast/iran-joins-shanghai-coop-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Iran inches one step closer to Russia and China as nuclear talks ...", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN's Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region's biggest stories. Sign up here .\n\nAbu Dhabi (CNN) Iran is set to formalize its relationship with the Global East, inching one step closer to joining the Sino-Russian axis as its nuclear talks with global powers falter.\n\nThe Islamic Republic on Wednesday signed a memorandum of obligations that will grant it full membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a climactic moment after a fifteen-year wait since it first applied to join the Asian body, which includes Russia and China\n\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi said on Friday that expanding the Asian organization could help defy Washington's unilateralism, adding that thwarting \"draconian\" US sanctions required new solutions.\n\nHailed by Tehran as a successful entry into \"a new stage of economic cooperation,\" the soon-to-be accession comes as hopes to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement are diminishing, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine has left the world in a state of polarization not seen since the Cold War.\n\nFormed in 2001, the Asian bloc accounts for almost a third of the world's economy. It includes ex-Soviet states Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and more recently India and Pakistan. Iran had been an observer state since 2005.\n\nWhile Iran's bid for full membership was first approved last year, Wednesday's decision comes at an awkward moment as both Iran and Western leaders had hoped that by now there would be an agreement on reviving the nuclear deal, says Trita Parsi, vice-president of the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC.\n\n\"Iran has managed to begin to break out of its isolation,\" Parsi told CNN, noting that as the world turns multipolar, the West is now losing a key card it has long used to pressure Iran -- namely the United States' role as \"a gatekeeper into the world economy.\"\n\nWestern sanctions had been a major pressure point drawing Tehran to the negotiation table, some of which were meant to be lifted if the nuclear deal had been revived. Talks have, however, stalled once more and analysts say that both Iran and the West are preparing for a no-deal scenario.\n\nWhile little material relief is likely to come out of the SCO membership, Iran is likely to use the optics of Wednesday's signing to show the world that it is not alone, said Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran Program at the Middle East Institute.\n\n\"The symbolic aspect is undeniable,\" he said, noting that in practice, however, it will mean very little in the short term for Iran.\n\nOn the sidelines of the summit, which took place on Thursday and Friday in the Uzbek city of Samarkand, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi was pictured meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"In the short term, [Ebrahim] Raisi will get another smile from Vladimir Putin and some handshakes,\" said Vatanka. \"But it means nothing in economic terms.\"\n\nThe alliance, therefore, seems mostly political, especially as Russia and China move away from the West and get closer to the Middle East.\n\n\"Iran interprets its membership in the framework of its regional security agenda of curtailing US regional influence and encroachments,\" said Fardin Eftekhari, an expert on Iranian national security and foreign policymaking, noting that the SCO shouldn't be compared to Western security blocs like NATO, primarily \"due to its membership diversity and the lack of sustaining agenda.\"\n\nTehran is therefore \"testing a new pattern of multilateral security relationships within the SCO,\" he added.\n\nSome attribute Iran's increasing alignment with Russia and China to the US' failure to effectively leverage its influence while it still could.\n\nThe majority of UN Security Council states opposed using sanctions as a strategy to discipline Iran in 2020. Many states feared that it would only push Tehran into the arms of Russia and China, said Parsi.\n\nBut as former US President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and imposed a \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Iran, the Persian Gulf state started looking for new alliances.\n\nIn June, Iran also applied to join a group of emerging economies known as BRICS, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. It has been selling its crude to China in an effort to cling to its last economic lifeline as Western countries refuse to buy its oil.\n\nIran has also been selling what US officials believe are weapons-capable drones to Russia at a time when Moscow is waging the largest European war since 1945.\n\nIran's relations with Russia and China are not, however, without complication. Iran shares a bitter history with Russia and has over the last 150 years looked westward for economic partners, according to Parsi.\n\nNot only are Russia and Iran competitors within the oil market , but they also have little in common apart from their shared anti-Americanism, said Vatanka.\n\nIran's famous 1979 revolution slogan, \"Neither East, Nor West,\" points to the degree to which both the Iranian people and the ruling elite wanted to avoid a scenario where dependence on either Russia or the US was necessary.\n\nYet Western attempts to isolate Iran have pushed it in a direction that analysts say might prove detrimental for Tehran in the long run, even if there is slight short-term relief to its crippled economy.\n\n\"Had it not been for 30 or 40 years of sanctions on Iran, I think we would have seen a very different orientation of Iran,\" said Parsi, adding that while it wouldn't have necessarily been completely allied to the West, Iran's foreign policy would have at least been a balanced one where there is less dependency on the East.\n\n\"Russia and China alone cannot compensate for what Iran could have had if it had a slightly more mainstream foreign policy,\" said Vatanka.\n\nThe digest\n\nUAE foreign minister in Tel Aviv for two-year Abraham Accords anniversary\n\nThe United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan arrived in Israel's Tel Aviv on Wednesday to mark two years since the signing of the Abraham Accords, the Emirati state news agency WAM said.\n\nBackground: Sheikh Abdullah was set to meet Israel's Prime Minister Yair Lapid at his residence in Jerusalem on Thursday, Israel's government said. The visit will span several days to commemorate the normalization agreement, signed two years ago after the UAE formally ended its near-half-century boycott of Israel. This is the Emirati top diplomat's second official visit to Israel. His first was to attend a meeting held in the southern Israeli city of Sde Boker in the Negev desert in March.\n\nWhy it matters: The agreement opened doors to bilateral economic activity and security cooperation. Thousands of Israeli tourists now visit Dubai and other Emirati cities, while trade between both countries has steadily risen. The countries continue to cooperate on security and at a landmark meeting hosted by Israel in March, the UAE joined other Arab countries to demonstrate their newly formed close partnership.\n\nSaudi crown prince to travel to London for condolences but won't attend funeral\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) will travel to London on Sunday to pay his respects to King Charles III and express his condolences on the death of Queen Elizabeth II , but the Saudi royal will not attend the funeral of the late monarch on Monday, a source close to the Saudi royal family told CNN.\n\nBackground: The crown prince will return to Saudi Arabia right after he offers his condolences, the source added. Another senior member of the Saudi royal family may attend the funeral, according to the source.\n\nWhy it matters: MBS had avoided traveling to Western states since the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 at the hands of Saudi agents. In July, he visited Greece and France, his first European Union trip since the murder. The crown prince last visited the UK in March 2018.\n\nFive more banks in Lebanon held up by customers demanding access to savings\n\nCustomers held up at least five banks around Lebanon on Friday in an attempt to retrieve frozen savings just two days after the last such hostage situation, a Lebanese army official told CNN. In one incident, an armed man entered a bank and poured gasoline on the floor, threatening to burn the branch down if he wasn't given access to his funds, state news agency NNA reported. He was able to retrieve around $19,000 and handed it to someone waiting outside the bank before handing himself to authorities.\n\nBackground: Since October 2019, Lebanon has implemented severe restrictions on cash withdrawals as the country faces economic collapse. On Wednesday, two hostage situations at different banks took place in Beirut. In one incident, a woman managed to take a total of $20,000 from her account after taking hostages at a bank with a toy gun.\n\nWhy it matters: Hostage takings are becoming more common in heavily armed Lebanon as citizens whose savings are frozen by banks say they are left with no option to retrieve their funds. In some cases, the hostage takers have said they have done so to help pay for their loved ones' medical treatment.\n\nWhat to watch\n\nUnder the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, Britian's relationship with the Middle East significantly changed as colonial structures collapsed and strategic partnerships formed, some of which are sustained to this day.\n\nWatch the full report with CNN's Becky Anderson here:\n\nWhen Queen Elizabeth II became head of state, Britain was the dominant power in the Middle East. Within just three decades of her rule, she witnessed her country's supremacy there crumble, but held on to strategic relationships in the region that persist to this day. pic.twitter.com/1PfWPXltFY — Becky Anderson (@BeckyCNN) September 15, 2022\n\nAround the region\n\nA rare, 2,000-year-old Jewish coin that US authorities have returned to Israel.\n\nA coin dating back to a Jewish rebellion against Roman rule almost 2,000 years ago has been returned by the US to Israel following a joint smuggling investigation\n\nMinted in AD 69, the \"exceedingly rare\" quarter shekel is estimated to be worth over $1 million, according to the Manhattan District Attorney's office, which hosted a repatriation ceremony in New York on Monday.\n\nThe move comes 20 years after Israeli authorities first learned, via informants, that the silver coin had been discovered by antiquities looters in the Ella Valley, south of Jerusalem. It is believed to be one of a cache of coins found by thieves in the area, which is home to numerous important archeological sites.\n\nInvestigators say the item entered the black market before being smuggled to the UK through Jordan. It was then exported to the US using false paperwork. In 2017, Homeland Security officers seized the coin in Denver, Colorado, where it was due to be offered at auction.\n\nThe kingdom of Judaea fell under Roman control in AD 6, though resistance to imperial rule led to a series of revolts known as the Jewish-Roman Wars. The coin dates to the fourth year of the First Jewish Revolt, also known as the Great Jewish Revolt, which began in AD 66.\n\nBy Oscar Holland\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Nadeen Ebrahim"], "publish_date": "2022/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/17/business/china-russia-sanctions-friction-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "4 ways China is quietly making life harder for Russia | CNN Business", "text": "Hong Kong CNN Business —\n\nChina is quietly distancing itself from Russia’s sanction-hit economy.\n\nThe two states proclaimed last month that their friendship had “no limits.” That was before Russia launched its war in Ukraine.\n\nNow, with Russia’s economy being slammed with sanctions from all over the world, there is growing evidence that China’s willingness and ability to aid its northern neighbor may be limited. Beijing has refused to condemn Russia’s attack on Ukraine but wants to avoid being impacted by the sanctions it has repeatedly denounced as an ineffective way of resolving the crisis.\n\n“China is not a party to the [Ukraine] crisis, and doesn’t want the sanctions to affect China,” Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Tuesday during a phone call with his Spanish counterpart.\n\nBeijing also gave its full backing Wednesday to comments made earlier this week by China’s ambassador to Ukraine. “China will never attack Ukraine. We will help, especially economically,” Fan Xianrong was quoted as saying in a press release from the Lviv regional government.\n\nFears that Chinese companies could face US sanctions over ties with Russia had contributed to an epic sell-off in Chinese stocks recent days. That slump was reversed Wednesday when Beijing promised it would pursue policies to boost its sputtering economy and keep financial markets stable.\n\nUS officials told CNN on Monday that they have information suggesting China has expressed some openness to providing Russia with requested military and financial assistance. China dismissed that as “disinformation.”\n\nAnalysts say that China is attempting to strike “a delicate balance” between supporting Russia rhetorically but without further antagonizing the United States.\n\nBeijing and Moscow share a strategic interest in challenging the West. However, Chinese banks cannot afford to lose access to US dollars, and many Chinese industries cannot afford to be deprived of US technology.\n\nWhile China is Russia’s No. 1 trading partner, Beijing has other priorities. Trade between the two countries made up just 2% of China’s total trade volume. The European Union and the United States have much larger shares, according to Chinese customs statistics from last year.\n\nHere are some measures Beijing has taken in the last few weeks to distance itself from the isolated and crumbling Russian economy.\n\nLetting the ruble drop\n\nChina’s currency, the yuan, doesn’t trade completely freely, moving instead within bands set by officials at the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). Last week, they doubled the size of the ruble trading range, allowing the Russian currency to fall faster.\n\nThe ruble has already lost more than 20% of its value against both the dollar and euro since the start of the war in Ukraine. By allowing the Russian currency to fall against the yuan, Beijing isn’t doing Moscow any favors.\n\nRussians will have to pay more in rubles for Chinese imports such as smartphones and cars. Chinese phone brands like Xiaomi and Huawei are hugely popular in Russia, and were vying with Apple (AAPL) and Samsung (SSNLF) for market leadership before the war.\n\nChinese car makers, such as Great Wall Motor and Geely Auto, occupy 7% of Russia’s market, selling more than 115,000 vehicles last year. Great Wall Motor has stopped supplying new cars to dealers in Russia because of the exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nExpanding the trading band would allow the yuan to keep up with the ruble’s wild swings, so that Chinese companies can “better grasp the magnitude or trend of future exchange rate fluctuations and reduce exchange risks by using hedging methods, such as derivatives,” state-owned China Business Network reported last week.\n\nCurrently, about $25 billion of China-Russia trade is conducted in yuan, Chinese state media reported.\n\nSitting on reserves\n\nThe most significant help China could offer Russia is through the $90 billion worth of reserves Moscow holds in yuan, wrote Alicia García-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, in a research report on Tuesday.\n\nSanctions have frozen about $315 billion worth of Russia’s reserves — or roughly half the total — as Western countries have banned dealing with the Russian central bank.\n\nRussia’s finance minister Anton Siluanov said this week that the country wanted to use yuan reserves after Moscow was blocked from accessing US dollars and euros, according to Russia’s state media.\n\nThe PBOC has so far not made any comment about its position regarding these reserves.\n\nIf China allowed Moscow to convert its yuan reserves into US dollars or euros, “that would clearly help Russia’s current impasse,” García-Herrero noted. However, “the reputational risk of potentially breaching Western sanctions would be a huge step for the PBOC to take and therefore makes it highly unlikely,” she said.\n\n“The long-term gains of moving closer to Russia might not match the impact of Western investors suddenly losing interest in China,” she added.\n\nWithholding aircraft parts\n\nSanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union mean that the world’s two major aircraft makers, Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSF), are no longer able to supply spare parts or provide maintenance support for Russian airlines. The same is true of jet engine makers.\n\nThat means Russian airlines could run out of parts within a matter of weeks, or fly planes without having equipment replaced as frequently as recommended to operate safely.\n\nEarlier this month, a top Russian official said that China has refused to send aircraft parts to Russia as Moscow looks for alternative supplies.\n\nValery Kudinov, head of aircraft airworthiness at Russia’s air transport agency, was quoted by Russian state news agency Tass as saying that Russia would look for opportunities to source parts from countries including Turkey and India after a failed attempt to obtain them from China.\n\n“As far as I know … China refused,” Kudinov was quoted as saying.\n\nIn response to CNN’s request for comment, China’s foreign ministry reiterated Beijing’s opposition to sanctions adding that China and Russia will maintain “normal economic and trade cooperation.”\n\nChina and Russia set up a civil aviation joint venture in 2017 to build a new long-haul, widebody passenger plane, seeking to rival the duopoly of Boeing and Airbus. Production of the CR929 has begun, but disagreements over suppliers have caused delays. The plane was initially expected to be offered to customers in 2024. But Russia postponed the timeline to 2028 to 2029.\n\nFreezing infrastructure investment\n\nThe World Bank has halted all its programs in Russia and Belarus following the invasion of Ukraine. It hadn’t approved any new loans or investments to Russia since 2014, and none to Belarus since 2020.\n\nMore surprisingly, perhaps, is the decision by the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to do the same. In a statement earlier this month, it said it was suspending all its activities related to Russia and Belarus “as the war in Ukraine unfolds.” The move was “in the best interests” of the bank, it added.\n\nFrustrated by a relative lack of influence at the World Bank (based in Washington, D.C.) and the Asian Development Bank (where Japan is a major force), China launched the AIIB in 2016. In addition to hosting the headquarters, China provides the president of the bank and has 26.5% of the votes. India and Russia have 7.6% and 6% respectively.\n\nThe AIIB’s decision to suspend activities in Russia means $1.1 billion of approved or proposed lending aimed at improving the country’s road and rail networks is now on hold.\n\n— CNN’s Beijing bureau and Hannah Ritchie in Sydney contributed to this article.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/20/middleeast/russia-iran-friendship-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Iran and Russia's friendship is more complicated than it seems | CNN", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN's Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region's biggest stories. Sign up here .\n\nAbu Dhabi, UAE (CNN) One image distributed by Iranian media on Tuesday of Russia and Iran's leaders meeting stood out. Russian President Vladimir Putin is shown clasping palms with Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the two rulers -- both heads of oil-rich countries grappling with grueling Western sanctions -- boast about their tight partnership.\n\nRussia and Iran say they are now closer than ever as the West clamps down on both states. But some observers say the two countries' highly publicized friendship has both a tumultuous past and a difficult future ahead.\n\nPutin's visit was part of a trilateral meeting with Raisi and NATO leader Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has so far refused to join in on Russian sanctions and offered to play a mediating role between Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nBut some analysts are skeptical of the true strength of Russia and Iran's declared friendship, with some saying the meeting was mostly about the optics, signaling potential cooperation as opposed to the more modest support both countries currently give one another.\n\nIn the past, Russia had always \"overpromised and underdelivered,\" said Ali Vaez, Iran Project Director at Crisis Group, a think tank in Washington, D.C., and has even \"stabbed [Iran] in the back repeatedly and sold it to the highest bidder.\"\n\nBut options for Iran and Russia are limited, he added, and so they cannot afford to alienate one another.\n\nThe timing of the meeting is also pertinent, coming just days after US President Joe Biden ended a Middle East tour that many hoped would yield more oil and forge a stronger regional alliance against Iran, yet ended in Biden going home largely empty-handed.\n\nThe Islamic Republic has accused the US of rallying the region against it , planting instability and spreading \"Iranophobia.\"\n\nThe meeting is, from Tehran's point of view, \"a signal of strength in response to the American attempt to show itself as in charge of the region,\" Mohammad Marandi, a professor at the University of Tehran, told CNN's Becky Anderson on Tuesday, who added that Biden's trip to Saudi Arabia \"was perhaps seen as a sign of weakness\" and is \"representative of a relative decline of the United States.\"\n\nRussia is in a similarly isolated position after becoming the world's most heavily sanctioned country in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. Iran comes in second, according to Castellum.Ai , which tracks sanctions.\n\nThe two oil-rich states were keen to show their tight alliance in Tuesday's meeting, with Iran showing strong support for Russia's war effort in Ukraine.\n\nIn a bilateral meeting with Raisi, Putin said he was \"very pleased to be on the hospitable Iranian soil\" and that the two countries \"can boast about record figures in terms of trade growth.\"\n\nThe talks also brought forth a $40 billion agreement between Iran's national oil company and Russia's state-run gas company Gazprom, according to a statement from Shana, the news agency for Iran's oil ministry. The memorandum of understanding is meant to develop Iranian gas fields and build new pipelines for export.\n\nHowever, Iran's heavily restricted economy and Russia's past ventures in the Persian Gulf state are driving skepticism about whether the deal will indeed materialize.\n\nThe Gazprom deal is an example of the complexities facing close Russian-Iranian cooperation, says Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, founder and CEO of the Bourse & Bazaar Foundation think tank in London.\n\n\"It is part of a pageantry of state visits,\" he said. \"It does not obligate Russia to invest and Russia is not going to invest in Iran's energy sector while Iran's energy sector is under stricter sanctions than Russia's energy sector.\"\n\nInvestment in Iran's energy sector would \"trigger enforcement action from the US that would jeopardize Russia's continued energy exports to Europe and to other countries,\" Batmanghelidj added.\n\nUnlike Russia, Iran is under secondary US sanctions that place firms or individuals that deal with Iran at risk of being penalized.\n\nGazprom had previously signed a gas deal with Iran's National Oil Company in 2016, when Iran was not yet under secondary sanctions, but which \"didn't lead anywhere\" due to several barriers constricting Iran's economy, said Batmanghelidj.\n\nRussia has in the past hindered Iranian policy when it stood as an obstacle to key interests.\n\nThe two countries have also recently fallen into a tense energy competition as they scramble to find buyers for their sanctioned oil. As the West began barring Russian oil, Moscow has been biting into Tehran's last remaining lifeline for its energy exports --, China -- , leading to an oil price war where Russia still maintains the upper hand.\n\nAnd in March, Russia rose as a temporary hurdle in nuclear talks with Iran, asking for guarantees that protect its own national interests as Western sanctions fell down on Moscow.\n\n\"The track record is full of so many negative experiences, where Iran felt that Russia has undercut Iran,\" said Batmanghelidj, adding that in many situations Russia acted as \"ruthless and self-serving country\" in its dealings with Iran.\n\n\"It takes a long time for two countries to build genuine trust,\" he said.\n\nWhile there is relatively little Russia can expect Iran to do to help help it emerge from its heavily sanctioned economy, the US has warned that Tehran is planning to help Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nEarlier this July, the White House said that Iran is expected to supply Russia with \"hundreds\" of drones -- including weapons-capable drones --- for use in the war in Ukraine and that Iran is preparing to begin training Russian forces on how to operate them as soon as this month.\n\nIran has denied selling drones to Russia, but on Tuesday, Iranian media reported that Iran is ready to export military equipment and weapons to friendly nations, quoting an Iranian army general.\n\nIran's experience in evading sanctions may also be of use to Russia, said Vaez, showing Moscow the tricks -- and limitations -- of living with a restricted economy.\n\n\"I think it is completely natural that both sides are thinking about creating a club of sanctioned states,\" he added, \"But I think there are also limits to how far they can go.\"\n\nThe digest\n\nAustralian teenager dies while detained in Syrian prison\n\nAn Australian teenager who was forced as a child to live under the Islamic State (ISIS), has died in detention in a northeastern Syrian prison, Human Rights Watch says, citing family members. The rights group said Monday that 17-year-old Yusuf Zahab's family had previously asked the Australian government to bring him home, but to no avail.\n\nBackground: There are believed to be 41,000 foreigners held in camps and prisons in northeast Syria, many being children living in poor conditions. Diseases like tuberculosis and deaths from serious wounds are reportedly not uncommon. It is unclear what Zahab died of, but his story is not unique -- like many in detention, he was forced to live under ISIS when brought from his native country at a young age against his will. His family were then captured by US-backed Syrian forces a few years later.\n\nWhy it matters: The Syrian Defense Forces currently have between 69 and 80 Australian nationals detained, mostly women and children, according to HRW, but Australia's government only repatriated eight citizens in 2019. They are not alone in their hesitancy to bring home citizens, as many nations cite security concerns.\n\nSaudi Arabia's economy expected to grow an average of nearly 4% a year until 2026\n\nThe credit rating agency Moody's has given Saudi Arabia a top score and says it expects the Gulf powerhouse to grow 3.9% yearly from 2022 to 2026, according to the Saudi Press Agency. The country's robust balance sheet, relatively modest debt levels and large oil reserves were factors considered in Moody's stable outlook.\n\nBackground: Some of the world's biggest hydrocarbon producers, the Gulf nations are seeing billions of dollars added to their coffers aided by a Ukraine war-driven rally in oil prices. They are expected to register their first budget surpluses after an eight-year oil slump that was compounded by a pandemic-linked downturn.\n\nWhy it matters: Despite the recent oil-linked boon to the Saudi economy, its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman continues his mission to diversify its sources of revenue for a post-oil future. After an oil price crash induced by the pandemic slowed down his Vision 2030 plan two years ago, it seems the Gulf nation's economy is back on track and possibly stronger than ever.\n\nHuman rights groups demand action on decaying oil tanker off Yemen\n\nSeveral humanitarian and human rights groups are again calling for a government-led salvage operation of a supertanker moored off Yemen's coast to prevent an environmental catastrophe. The groups, which include Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, said in a statement Monday that the enormous FSO Safer oil storage tanker sitting in the Red Sea could explode or rupture at any moment.\n\nBackground: The FSO Safer tanker -- which contains 1.1 million barrels of oil, or more than four times the amount spilled in 1989 by the Exxon Valdez 2 -- has been \"deserted\" off Yemen's coast since 2015 and continues to deteriorate. The United Nations have been trying to inspect the vessel for years, but cannot due to insufficient funding.\n\nWhy it matters: Fisheries are responsible for providing subsistence for 1.7 million people in the country, which is in its seventh year of conflict and is on brink of famine. Nearly all of those fisheries are under threat if there is a major oil spill, according to a 2021 study published in the journal Nature Sustainability.\n\nWhat to watch\n\nFrance is on the lookout for alternative energy sources as Europe prepares for the worst amid gas disruptions from Russia, and just days ago signed an energy deal with the United Arab Emirates during a state visit by UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan to Paris.\n\nFrench foreign minister Bruno Le Maire tells CNN's Becky Anderson that France \"must be prepared\" for the possibility that Putin cuts off gas for all of Europe.\n\n\"I really think that nuclear energy will be one of the key advantages for France facing this question of energy supply\"\n\n\n\nFrench Fin.

The desert heat, which can reach 120°F in the summer months, makes it almost impossible to grow traditional produce on a large scale.\n\nHowever innovative modern technology has changed the future of farming, as indoor vertical farms spring up across the world, from Los Angeles to Kyoto\n\nThe United Arab Emirates is also experimenting with new ways to produce food locally, most recently in opening one of the world's largest indoor vertical farms in Dubai.\n\nCrop One , a Boston-based food technology company, and Emirates Flight Catering (EKFC), a subsidiary of the Emirates Group, best known for its airline, have teamed up to build a 330,000 square foot facility -- that's nearly six football pitches in size.\n\nIt aims to produce more than 900,000kg of crops annually, which won't require washing or contain artificial pesticides and other chemicals. The farm will use 95% less water than traditionally grown greens, according to Crop One.\n\nOne of the other advantages of vertical farming is the removal of seasonal constraints and weather changes, allowing a year-long harvest. Dubai's newest vertical farm is no different, promising to produce fresh food 365 days a year.\n\nCritics of vertical farming say the technique uses too much energy and is more expensive than traditional farming.\n\nBut rising temperatures and extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change are making farming conditions increasingly challenging and disrupting food distribution. Countries such as the UAE, which are heavily dependent on food imports, can also be vulnerable to external shocks like Russia's war on Ukraine; hence the adoption of technologies like vertical farms and smart greenhouses to increase local food production -- even in the desert.\n\nBy Eoin McSweeney\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Nadeen Ebrahim"], "publish_date": "2022/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/18/biden-xi-jinping-ukraine/7050895001/", "title": "Biden, China's Xi Jinping to speak amid tensions over Ukraine war", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden took office framing this moment in geopolitics as a battle between autocracy and democracy – casting China as the chief authoritarian threat on the world stage.\n\nMore than a year later, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has magnified the question of China's role in the world, and it has worsened tensions between Washington and Beijing.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/26/russia-ukraine-invasion-update/6947419001/", "title": "Kyiv invasion intensifies as explosions rock Ukraine - live updates", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Saturday, Feb. 26.

Residents were urged to stay inside.\n\nThe troops in Kharkiv arrived hours after Russia unleashed a wave of attacks on Ukraine targeting airfields and fuel facilities.\n\nEarlier there were two large explosions that rocked an area south of Kyiv just before 1 a.m. One of the blasts was near the Zhuliany airport, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office said. The mayor of Vasylkiv, about 25 miles south of the capital, said an oil depot there was hit, according to the Associated Press.\n\nElsewhere, Russian forces blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv. The explosion created mushroom-cloud and could cause an “environmental catastrophe,” warned the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection. Residents were advised to cover their windows with damp cloth or gauze and to drink plenty of fluids.\n\nAt least 240 civilian casualties are confirmed by the United Nations, including at least 64 people killed in the fighting — though it believed the “real figures are considerably higher” because many reports of casualties remain to be confirmed. More than 150,000 people have fled the Ukraine to neighboring countries and the United Nations warned that number could grow to 4 million.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States and its European allies agreed to remove “selected” Russian banks from the international SWIFT messaging system, which allows for the movement of financial transactions.\n\nThey also moved to impose restrictions on Russia's central bank, a measure the White House and its partners said would further hammer Russia's financial systems and hit the country's wealthy and political elites.\n\nTo catch you up:\n\nWhy is Russia invading Ukraine?:Could it be the start of WWIII?

The U.S. and EU responded with weapons and ammunition for the outnumbered Ukrainians and powerful sanctions intended to further isolate Moscow.\n\nHuge explosions lit up the sky early Sunday south of the capital, Kyiv, where people hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale assault by Russian forces.\n\n–Associated Press\n\n'You cannot defeat a whole nation'\n\nOn Sunday morning, Ukranian writer Illarion Pavliuk plans to set out on a dangerous journey to help his countrymen as explosions rock Kyiv, and outgunned Ukrainian forces continue to maintain control of their capital.\n\nPavliuk is not a solider, but he does have a military background. In 2015, he was an intelligence volunteer in the war in Eastern Ukraine. And yet, this is what Ukraine has become – a country where internationally acclaimed artists are forced to kiss their children goodnight before they go off to defend their homeland from the occupying force. \"We will never give up and we are going to win this war. You cannot defeat the whole nation. And Ukrainians are absolutely united as a nation now.\"\n\nHis words are haunting and powerful, with his children in the background.\n\n\"What can I tell you about this war? It is difficult to say a couple of words,\" he says. \"I would never ever imagine my four children dropping their toys and running to sit in the thickest doorway in the house because of cruise missiles above our city; ballistic missiles.\n\n\"And I would never imagine this and I will never forgive Russia.\"\n\n– Carli Pierson, USA TODAY\n\nRead the full interview:'We will never give up': A father prepares to leave his kids and fight for Ukraine\n\nFrench president asks Belarus leader to order Russian troops to leave\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has asked his Belarus counterpart to demand that the country, Ukraine’s neighbor, quickly order Russian troops to leave.\n\nIn a phone conversation Saturday, Macron denounced “the gravity of a decision that would authorize Russia to deploy nuclear arms on Belarus soil,” a statement by the presidential palace said.\n\nMacron told Alexander Lukashenko that fraternity between the people of Belarus and Ukraine should lead Belarus to “refuse to be a vassal and an accomplice to Russia in the war against Ukraine,” the statement said.\n\nBelarus was one one of several axes used by Russia to launch attacks on Ukraine, with Belarus the point to move toward the capital Kyiv, a senior U.S. defense official has said.\n\nMacron has pushed persistently to try to claw out a ceasefire amid the war, using the telephone to talk to all sides, diplomacy and sanctions by the European Union.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nUN: At least 240 civilian casualties\n\nGENEVA — The United Nations says it has confirmed at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed, in the fighting in Ukraine that erupted since Russia’s invasion on Thursday — though it believed the “real figures are considerably higher” because many reports of casualties remain to be confirmed.\n\nThe U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs relayed the count late Saturday from the U.N. human rights office, which has strict methodologies and verification procedures about the toll from conflict.\n\nOCHA also said damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, and produced a map of “humanitarian situations” in Ukraine — mostly in northern, eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\nThe human rights office had reported early Friday an initial count by its staffers of at least 127 civilian casualties – 25 people killed and 102 injured – mostly from shelling and airstrikes.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nUS, allies committed to removing certain Russian banks from SWIFT\n\nThe United States and its European allies have agreed to remove “selected” Russian banks from the international SWIFT messaging system, the White House announced on Saturday. The White House also announced that the US and allied countries will move to impose new ”restrictive measures” on Russia’s central bank.\n\nThe new economic penalties on Moscow come as Russia’s military continues to bombard Kyiv and other population centers in its deadly invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA senior administration official said the U.S. and EU will work to finalize the list of Russian banks that will be barred from the SWIFT system. But Russia will feel the impact of the decision well before it’s enacted, said the official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.\n\n“I have great confidence the effects of these measures will be felt immediately in Russia’s financial markets,” the official said.\n\nThe U.S. official suggested some banks that handle energy transactions could be exempted in the SWIFT delisting process. That would help cushion the economic blow to Europe, which relies heavily on Russia for oil and gas.\n\nThe SWIFT system is based in Belgium, where officials will have the final sign-off on the list of barred institutions.\n\nThe U.S. and EU countries also announced new steps to limit the sale of “golden passports,” which allows wealthy individuals become citizens of European countries.\n\n– Rebecca Morin, USA TODAY\n\nZelenskyy says he’s open for talks with Russia\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he’s open for talks with Russia.\n\nZelenskyy said in a video message Saturday that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev offered to help organize such talks. He added that “we can only welcome that.”\n\nZelenskyy also said he and Erdogan “agree that a ban on the passage of Russian warships into the Black Sea is very important today,” adding that “it has been done.” Turkey, however, hasn’t announced any ban for Russian warships to move through Turkish Straits following Erdogan’s talk with Zelenskyy.\n\nZelenskyy said that “Ukrainians’ readiness to protect our state, our solidarity and courage have thwarted the scenario of occupation of our country.”\n\n“The world has seen that Ukrainians are strong, Ukrainians are brave, Ukrainians stand on their land and will not surrender it,” he said.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nGermany to send anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, drops opposition to SWIFT sanctions for Russia\n\nIn a significant shift, the German government said Saturday it will send weapons and other supplies directly to Ukraine and supports some restrictions of the SWIFT global banking system for Russia.\n\nGermany’s chancellery announced it will send 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 “Stinger” surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine “as quickly as possible.”\n\n“The Russian invasion of Ukraine marks a turning point. It threatens our entire post-war order,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a statement. “In this situation, it is our duty to help Ukraine, to the best of our ability, to defend itself against Vladimir Putin’s invading army.”\n\nIn addition, the German economy and climate ministry said Germany is allowing the Netherlands to ship 400 German-made anti-tank weapons to Ukraine.\n\nGermany had long stuck to a policy of not exporting deadly weapons to conflict zones, including Ukraine. As recently as Friday, government officials said they would abide by that policy.\n\nGermany on Saturday also joined the rest of the European Union in voicing support for SWIFT sanctions on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and German Economics Minister Robert Habeck announced the decision in a joint statement that indicated there might be limits in how far Germany is willing to go on the issue.\n\n“We are working flat out on how to limit the collateral damage of a disconnection from #SWIFT, so that it hits the right people. What we need is a targeted and functional restriction of SWIFT,” the officials wrote in a statement.\n\nSWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. It is a global messaging system connecting thousands of financial institutions around the world.\n\nSWIFT was formed in 1973, and is headquartered in Belgium. It is overseen by the National Bank of Belgium, in addition to the U.S. Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and others, NBC News reported. It connects more than 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide, so banks can be informed about transactions.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Zelenskyy said that Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi also voiced his approval for disconnecting Russia from SWIFT.\n\nThe U.S. did not impose removing Russia from SWIFT following concerns from European allies in what was seen as America's harshest punishment at its disposal.\n\nWhat is SWIFT?:How could banning Russia from the banking system impact the country?\n\n– JJ Hensley and Associated Press\n\nRussian forces meet firm resistance on path to Kyiv\n\nRussian forces have grown increasingly frustrated by Ukrainian resistance, particularly near the capital of Kiev, and the Russian advance remains about 18 miles from the city, a senior Defense Department official said Saturday.\n\nRussia has, however, sent reconnaissance forces into Kyiv, the official said, declining to say how many of those troops have penetrated the city.\n\nThe official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said the Pentagon had used several means to determine that Russian forces invading Ukraine had been stalled by determined resistance.\n\nThe official warned that the battlefield situation is fluid and changing rapidly.\n\nAddressing reports that some Russian military vehicles had run out of gas, the official said the invading force sent by Russian President Vladimir Putin had expended more fuel resources than it had planned for.\n\nUkrainian forces continue to contest the airspace over the country with warplanes and missile defense, the official said.\n\nAlso Saturday, the Pentagon announced that $350 in emergency military aid to Ukraine. That package includes Javelin anti-armor missiles, ammunition and body armor, according to the official. Prior to the invasion, military materiel had been arriving in Ukraine by cargo aircraft. U.S. military aid has continued to flow into Ukraine in the last few days but the official declined to say how it has arrived there.\n\nMeanwhile, Britain’s Defense Ministry said Saturday that “the speed of the Russian advance has temporarily slowed likely as a result of acute logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance.”\n\n“Russian forces are bypassing major Ukrainian population centres while leaving forces to encircle and isolate them,” the ministry said.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook and Associated Press\n\nSnake Island defiance:Ukrainian soldier on Snake Island tells Russian officer 'go (expletive) yourself' before being killed\n\nFleeing to the border: Over 150,000 Ukrainians seek refuge\n\nMEDYKA, Poland – At least 150,000 people have fled Ukraine into Poland and other neighboring countries in the wake of the Russian invasion, the U.N. refugee agency said Saturday.\n\nSome walked many miles through the night while others fled by train, car or bus, forming lines miles long at border crossings. They were greeted by waiting relatives and friends or headed on their own to reception centers organized by neighboring governments.\n\n“The numbers and the situation is changing minute by minute,” said Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. “At least 150,000 people have fled, they are refugees outside of Ukraine. ... At least 100,000 people – but probably a much larger number – have been displaced inside Ukraine.”\n\nThose arriving were mostly women, children and the elderly after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy banned men of military age from 18 to 60 from leaving. Some Ukrainian men were heading back into Ukraine from Poland to take up arms against the Russian forces.\n\n- The Associated Press\n\nChelsea's Russian billionaire owner hands over Premier League club\n\nLONDON — Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich suddenly handed over the \"stewardship and care\" of the Premier League club to its charitable foundation trustees on Saturday.\n\nThe move came after a member of the British parliament called for the Russian billionaire to hand over the club in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAbramovich, who has owned Chelsea since 2003, made no mention of the war in his statement.\n\n– The Associated Press\n\nInvasion response:Chelsea's Russian owner Roman Abramovich passes 'stewardship and care' of Premier League club\n\nFormer president Poroschenko: everyone understands risk of death\n\nFormer Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko, Zelenskyy’s predecessor, said he was prepared to die to defend his country.\n\n“I think that we should do our best to protect our nation,” he told CNN in an interview Saturday. “To protect the nation against the Russian aggressor definitely bring the risk of life.”\n\nPoroschenko, who was wearing a flak jacket and standing outside in Kyiv with members of the Ukraine military, sounded clear-eyed and defiant.\n\n“Everybody here – all the young and old people – fully understand that we have this risk,” he said. “Somebody has a choice to go abroad. Somebody has a choice to be the refugee in some regions of Ukraine. But many, the biggest part, make a decision to take the rifle and to protect the nation.”\n\n“I proud for these people. I proud for this country. And I proud to be Ukrainian.”\n\n– Ledyard King\n\nBiden authorizes $350 million more in US military aid for Ukraine\n\nThe Biden administration is providing an additional $350 million in immediate U.S. military assistance to Ukraine as Russia continues a full-scale attack on the country with intense fighting in the capital city of Kyiv.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken announced the drawdown of funds Saturday morning after Biden authorized the emergency military aid late Friday night through the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.\n\n“This package will include further lethal defensive assistance to help Ukraine address the armored, airborne, and other threats it is now facing,” Blinken said in a statement. “It is another clear signal that the United States stands with the people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereign, courageous, and proud nation.”\n\nThe aid brings the U.S.’s total assistance to Ukraine to more than $1 billion over the past year, according to Blinken, including $200 million in military assistance in December and $60 million last fall.\n\nZelenskyy has urged Ukraine civilians to join the fight against Russia, and as he remains defiant about not leaving Kyiv, he’s made clear about the need for more help.\n\n“I need ammunition, not a ride,” he said in a video Friday.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nIn Kyiv, residents seek shelter after night of explosions, street clashes\n\nKYIV, Ukraine – Russian troops pressed toward Ukraine’s capital Saturday after a night of air strikes and street fighting.\n\nUkrainian officials have reported some success in fending off assaults. A U.S. official told reporters Friday the Pentagon had information suggesting that Moscow had expected a faster advance on Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy refused an American offer to evacuate, insisting he would stay. “The fight is here,” he said.\n\nSkirmishes reported on the edge of Kyiv suggested that small Russian units were trying to clear a path for the main forces. A missile struck a high-rise apartment building in the city’s southwestern outskirts near one of Kyiv’s two passenger airports, Mayor Vitali Klitchsko said, leaving a jagged hole of ravaged apartments over several floors. A rescue worker said six civilians were injured.\n\nRussia claims its assault on Ukraine is aimed only at military targets, but civilians have been killed and injured during Europe’s largest ground war since World War II.\n\n– Caren Bohan and Associated Press\n\nTikTok is Russia's newest weapon in arsenal for anti-Ukraine propaganda\n\nIn 2014, Russia flooded the internet with fake accounts pushing disinformation about its takeover of Crimea. Eight years later, experts say Russia is mounting a far more sophisticated propaganda effort as it invades Ukraine.\n\nArmies of trolls and bots stir up anti-Ukrainian sentiment. State-controlled media outlets look to divide Western audiences. Clever TikTok videos serve up Russian nationalism with a side of humor.\n\nThe effort amounts to an emerging part of Russia’s war arsenal with the shaping of opinion through orchestrated disinformation fighting alongside actual troops and weapons.\n\nAnalysts at several different research organizations contacted by The Associated Press said they are seeing a sharp increase in online activity by groups affiliated with the Russian state. That’s in keeping with Russia’s strategy of using social media and state-run outlets to galvanize domestic support while seeking to destabilize the Western alliance.\n\nResearchers saw a sudden and dramatic increase in anti-Ukrainian content in the days immediately before the invasion. On Valentine’s Day, for instance, the number of anti-Ukrainian posts created by the sample of Twitter accounts jumped by 11,000% when compared with just days earlier. Analysts believe a significant portion of the accounts are inauthentic and controlled by groups linked to the Russian government.\n\n– David Klepper, The Associated Press\n\nRussian propaganda:TikTok is Russia's newest weapon in arsenal for anti-Ukraine propaganda\n\nTroops from NATO member nations could be deployed to defend Slovakia\n\nSlovakia’s defense minister says up to 1,200 foreign troops from other NATO members could be deployed in his country in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe plan is part of the NATO initiative to reassure member countries on the alliance’s eastern flank by sending forces to help protect them. Slovakia borders Ukraine.\n\nDefense Minister Jaroslav Nad said forces from the Netherlands and Germany are among those expected to come. Germany will also provide the Patriot system to boost Slovakia’s air defense.\n\nThe country’s government and Parliament have not yet approved the plan.\n\nNad also said his country’s government has approved sending arms and fuel worth 11 million euros ($12.4 million) requested by Ukraine. The aid will include 10 million liters (2.6 million gallons) of fuel, 2.4 million liters (630,000 gallons) of aviation fuel and 12,000 pieces of ammunition.\n\n– The Associated Press\n\nZelenskyy mobilizes Ukrainian reservists and those eligible for service\n\nAfter Russia launched a military invasion into Ukraine early Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called up reservists and those liable for service for a full military mobilization.\n\nAs many Ukrainians fled to neighboring countries, the Ukraine State Border Guard Service announced that men ages 18 to 60 were prohibited from leaving the country, ahead of a possible draft to increase the country's military service.\n\nTalk of conscription led to questions in the U.S. about whether the government could ever reinstate the draft. That is highly unlikely in a country where antiwar sentiment has grown in the aftermath of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress would have to reinstate the draft since induction authority expired in 1973.

This week, their wealth and connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin made some of them targets of President Joe Biden's sanctions in response to the Kremlin’s ongoing military invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut if the Biden administration really wants to hurt Russian oligarchs enough to rein in Putin's actions in Ukraine, it needs to hit them much harder – and hit a lot more of them, some U.S. officials and kleptocracy experts told USA TODAY.\n\nBy any measure, the new rounds of U.S. financial blockages issued this week go far beyond what has been done in the past to pressure Putin into curbing his rogue behavior, White House officials said.

But it was the 19-year-old and world No. 4 from Spain who pulled through, 6-7(6), 6-3, 6-1, 6-7(5), 6-3 in four hours, 19 minutes.\n\nAlcaraz will face Norway’s Casper Ruud, the No. 5 seed, in Sunday’s final, and the stakes are high: The winner will rise to No. 1 in the world for the first time.\n\nThe No. 22 seed Tiafoe, 24, was seeking to become the first American grand slam men’s finalist since Andy Roddick at Wimbledon in 2009. Roddick was the last American man to reach the final at the US Open, in 2006, and is the last American man to win a major, which came at the US Open in 2003.\n\n“Too good from Carlos tonight,” Tiafoe told ESPN in front of the crowd. “I gave everything I had. I gave everything I had the last two weeks. Honestly, I came here and wanted to win the US Open. I feel like I let you guys down. This one really hurts. This one really, really hurts.”\n\nAlcaraz is “going to win a lot of grand slams,” Tiafoe told the teen phenom. “You’re a hell of a player, a hell of a person. I’m happy I got to share the court on such a big stage with you. I’m going to come back and I will win this thing one day. I’m sorry, guys.”\n\nAlcaraz celebrates after winning the semifinal match against Tiafoe. Corey Sipkin/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIf Alcaraz wins the final, he will become the youngest world No. 1. Should he ascend to the top, he would tie Carlos Moya, Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras for the biggest jumps to world No. 1 (from No. 4).\n\n“It’s amazing to be able to fight for big things,” Alcaraz said to ESPN in an on-court interview. “First time in a final of a grand slam. I can see the No. 1 in the world, but at the same time, it’s so far away, you know? I have one more to go against a player who plays unbelievable. … I’m going to give everything that I have.”\n\nShould Ruud, 23, win the title, he would make biggest jump to world No. 1 in men’s tennis history. He entered the US Open ranked seventh. He defeated Russian Karen Khachanov, the No. 27 seed, 7-6(5), 6-2, 5-7, 6-2 in the earlier Friday semifinal.\n\n“I think what’s most fair is if we both reach the final and whoever wins the final reaches the world No. 1,” Ruud told reporters as Alcaraz was playing in his semifinal. “That would be I think the ideal situation.”\n\nThis will be Ruud’s second grand slam final appearance, having lost in the French Open final earlier this year to Rafael Nadal. Nadal, who lost to Tiafoe in the round of 16, would have risen to No. 1 in the world if Ruud and Alcaraz had both lost in the US Open semifinals.\n\nThis will be Alcaraz’s first grand slam final.\n\nThis year there were four first-time US Open men’s semifinalists for the first time since the inaugural US Championships in 1881 (William Glyn, Robert Gould Shaw, Edward Gray, Richard Sears).

Last month, Tiafoe reached a career-high of No. 24 in the world – he’s currently 26th – and this year has shown flashes of the quality that many predicted would take him to the top.\n\nBut make no mistake, given Tiafoe’s disappointing form coming into the US Open, there was no indication that he would make a deep run in New York. However, the big-hitting Washington, D.C. native has mentioned on more than one occasion how the home support on Arthur Ashe has spurred him on to new heights.\n\nIn winning his quarterfinal, Tiafoe became the first Black American man to reach a US Open semifinal since Ashe in 1972.\n\nHis father, Constant Tiafoe, started working at the Junior Tennis Champions Center in Washington back in 1999 and eventually moved into one of its vacant storage rooms while working around the clock.\n\nREAD: How Frances Tiafoe went from sleeping at a tennis center to the US Open semifinals\n\nFrances Tiafoe is appearing in his first grand slam semifinal.

But I was just living life. I could play tennis for free, the sport I loved,” he told CNN Sport back in 2015, adding that he wouldn’t change his upbringing for the world.\n\nHe was asked Wednesday what message people should draw from his story.\n\n“I mean, anybody can do it, honestly,” he said, adding that his passion and obsession is tennis. “Obviously, that’s a cliché, but I think if you are really passionate about something… Everybody’s got a gift.”", "authors": ["Matias Grez Ben Church", "Matias Grez", "Ben Church"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/dan-wolken/2022/09/11/carlos-alcaraz-first-grand-slam-title-u-s-open/8060571001/", "title": "Carlos Alcaraz wins his first Grand Slam title with U.S. Open victory", "text": "A potentially legendary career in men’s tennis reached a significant milestone Sunday when Carlos Alcaraz of Spain won his first Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open, defeating Norway’s Casper Ruud 6-4, 2-6, 7-6, 6-3.\n\nAlcaraz, who turned 19 in May, has been the subject of outsized expectations and breathless predictions of greatness since early in his teenage years. But it would have been difficult for even his most ardent believers to envision how quickly he has ascended to the top of the game.\n\nAfter being ranked 141st at the beginning of the 2021 season, winning the U.S. Open makes Alcaraz the first teenage male to ever reach No. 1 in the world. He is also the youngest man to win a maiden Grand Slam title since Rafael Nadal did it just shy of his 19th birthday at the 2005 French Open.\n\n\"It's crazy for me,\" Alcaraz said. \"I never thought I was going to achieve something like that at 19 years old, so everything came so fast and for me it's unbelievable. It's something I dreamed since I was a kid, since I start playing tennis. To lift this trophy today is amazing for me.\"\n\nAnd he did it the hard way, battling through three consecutive five-set matches before a tough final against an opponent who brought a lot of quality to the table and forced Alcaraz to come up with his best tennis despite playing on clearly tired legs.\n\nAlcaraz’s total of 23 hours, 39 minutes on court is the most combined amount of on-court time any player has ever endured during a major, passing Kevin Anderson’s 23 hours, 20 minutes during a run to the 2018 Wimbledon final.\n\nThat work load might have eventually caught up to a lesser player. But Alcaraz, in addition to his superior physical abilities, showed remarkable mental acuity and tactical brilliance during the final to manage his body and seize the biggest moments.\n\n\"He's one of these few rare talents that comes up every now and then in sports,\" Ruud said. \"That's what it seems like. Let's see how his career develops, but it's going all in the right direction.\"\n\nAfter Alcaraz's energy dipped about an hour into the match, helping a fresher-looking Ruud secure a 6-2 second set win to even the match, Alcaraz appeared to take control again when he got an early break of serve in the third set and had an opportunity to go up double-break. Instead, with Ruud playing solid tennis himself and declining to give away any points with sloppy errors, Alcaraz found himself back on serve at 5-6 and facing two break points to keep the set alive.\n\nHe saved both of them by attacking the net and putting away volleys, showcasing the all-court game that has separated him from scores of young players who have struggled to break through at the Grand Slams.\n\n\"I think he born to play this kind of tournament, born to play these kind of matches,\" said Juan Carlos Ferrero, the 2003 French Open champion who now coaches Alcaraz. \"Since the moment that I started with him, I saw some things that were different than the other guys at his age. I am still seeing it on the court. In important moments, he always tries to go. He's a great competitor.\"\n\nAfter that key hold of serve, Alcaraz dominated the tiebreaker to put him one set away from victory. In the fourth set, both players held serve until 2-3 when Alcaraz’s stunning speed and court coverage to go along with massive forehands finally generated a break of serve to put him closer to the finish line.\n\nServing for the match, Alcaraz missed an easy overhead that would have given him a 40-0 lead. But he responded immediately with an ace up the middle for some breathing room, then finished the title at 40-30 with a heavy wide serve that Ruud could not get his racquet on.\n\nThough much of the tennis world has known for awhile about the massive talent Alcaraz possessed, he had not had breakthrough results until last year’s U.S. Open when he upset Stefanos Tsitsipas in the third round and made it to the quarterfinals.\n\nThat effort foreshadowed how quickly and easily Alcaraz would adapt to the highest levels of the sport. This spring, he reeled off four tournament titles in four months including significant prizes at the Miami Open and Madrid Open where he defeated Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal consecutively.\n\nWith a new set of expectations, Alcaraz somewhat disappointed at the French Open where he lost a quarterfinal to Alexander Zverev. He lost in the round of 16 at Wimbledon to 21-year old Jannik Sinner, whom Alcaraz turned the tables on in New York in an epic, 5-hour and 15 minute quarterfinal.\n\nFor the 23-year old Ruud, who will move to No. 2 in the rankings, it was his second Grand Slam final loss of the year.

However, he says that’s not the case.\n\n“I have nerves, but I’m trying to manage the nerves better than the other one and trying so the opponent doesn’t see that I’m nervous,” he explains. “But trust me, I have nerves, a lot of nerves.”\n\nBacked by a home crowd on Sunday in the final, Alcaraz was dominating against Zverev, flying around the court as he belied his age and experience on a huge stage.\n\nAs someone who used to watch the tournament as a kid, the Madrid Open held even greater significance for Alcaraz.\n\nAnd his achievements over the last few months have not yet settled in for the young star.\n\n“I mean, everything came so fast, two Masters 1000 titles – one on hard court, one of clay court,” he said.\n\nAlcaraz returns a ball against Zverev.

For me, it’s pretty good. But it gives me a lot of power to play in the best stadiums against the best players in the world. So for me, it’s quite cool.”\n\n‘An absolute disgrace’\n\nAlthough he was defeated in the final, world No. 3 Zverev was full of praise for Alcaraz.\n\nThe German called the Spaniard the “best player in the world” after showering him in champagne during the trophy ceremony.\n\nHowever, Zverev criticized the ATP Tour for its scheduling of late-night matches during the Madrid Open, saying that while he didn’t “want to take anything away” from Alacaraz, he would have performed better had players been given more time to rest.\n\n“The ATP’s job was an absolute disgrace this week,” Zverev said. “To play a final against Carlos Alcaraz, who for me is the best player in the world right now, in a Masters 1000 event … it is difficult. I had no coordination today. I had no coordination on my serve, I had no coordination on my groundstrokes. I missed two overheads that were super easy because I see the ball and everything is moving in my eyes.\n\n“I was a little bit late all of the time. My first step was not so quick.

The word coming out of Spain, where he has trained at former French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero’s academy since age 15, was that stardom would not be too far away.\n\nNow it’s here.\n\nThe 18-year old Alcaraz, who entered the U.S. Open ranked No. 55 in the world, introduced himself in a major way Friday by knocking out No. 3 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in a four-hour, seven-minute epic. It ended in the fifth-set tiebreak when Alcaraz pelted his 61st winner of the match: An inside-out forehand that Tsitsipas had no chance to get his racquet on to finish off a 6-3, 4-6, 7-6, 0-6, 7-6 win.\n\n“His ball speed was incredible,” Tsitsipas said. “I’ve never seen anyone hit the ball so hard.”\n\nAlcaraz advances now to the round of 16, where he’ll be favored against qualifier Peter Gojowczyk, the world’s 141st-ranked player who has made his own longshot run through the draw.\n\nBut the story isn’t just Alcaraz breaking through into the second week at a major. That was always going to happen at some point. The bigger picture here was Alcaraz injecting a shot of star quality into the sport, a flair for the big stage that will surely remind many fans of another Spaniard who has won the U.S. Open four times.\n\nOf course, comparing any 18-year-old to Rafael Nadal is inherently unfair. And stylistically, Alcaraz does not fly around the court like he modeled his game after Nadal. In fact, he said after the match his style was more similar to Roger Federer. But where it’s easy to see the connection to his countryman is the relentlessness of Alcaraz’s attack, his fist-pumping flair and the ability to raise his level in the big moment.\n\nAnd the New York fans absolutely loved him for it.\n\n“The crowd was behind me, pushing me up in every moment,” Alcaraz said. “It surprised me.”\n\nThe palpable buzz around Arthur Ashe Stadium began when Alcaraz got off to a fast start, but it truly started to build to a crescendo when he came from two breaks of serve down in the third set to pull even and then win the tiebreak with a combination of roped backhands that seemed to kiss every line and deft drop shots that vexed his opponent.\n\nThe fans jumping on board the Alcaraz bandwagon also probably had something to do with Tsitsipas, who took something of a heel turn at this tournament with a series of long, eight-minute bathroom breaks after sets during his first two matches.\n\nOther players began calling Tsitsipas out on the tactic — which isn’t against the rules but is widely viewed as unsportsmanlike — and it became one of the big topics of the U.S. Open. Former champion Andy Murray, who lost to Tsitsipas in the first round, was extremely vocal about it during the match, after the match and the next day on Twitter.\n\nThat was enough to turn the crowds against him, and Tsitsipas was booed when he left the court after the third set — though this time, he managed to cut the time it took him to change clothes to around three minutes.\n\nAt that point in the match, it looked like Tsitsipas was going to take control and that perhaps Alcaraz had already fired his best shot. Tsitsipas easily ran away with the fourth set to level the match, but Alcaraz came into the decider with a different approach.\n\nMore U.S. Open action:Sloane Stephens' run ends, but former champ appears back on track\n\nShowing zero fear of his opponent, the venue or the moment, Alcaraz just started firing at the ball, hitting even harder than he had before. And then after holding serve at love to force a tiebreak, he managed to win the tiebreak with five clean winners in a spectacular show of power and precision.\n\n“I’ve never seen someone play such a good fifth set, honestly,” Tsitsipas said.\n\nAnd when it was over, Alcaraz had put his name in some pretty elite company, becoming the youngest player to reach the fourth round of a Grand Slam since Andrei Medvedev at the 1992 French Open and the youngest at the U.S. Open since 1989 when Michael Chang and Pete Sampras did it. He also surpassed Sampras and Andre Agassi to become the youngest player to beat a top-three opponent at the U.S. Open since 1973.\n\nStill, for all the hype around Alcaraz, this was a legitimate surprise. Though he won his maiden ATP title in July on clay in Umag, Croatia, and has steadily progressed up the rankings, his résumé has not been filled with wins over top players. Just last week, Alcaraz’s game fell apart in the semifinals of the Winston-Salem Open against 90th-ranked Mikael Ymer.\n\nThat’s a long trip from there to the biggest tennis court in the world against one of the favorites for the title. But now that Alcaraz has successfully made that leap, get used to seeing him on the big stage. What he did Friday was only the beginning.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Dan Wolken on Twitter @DanWolken", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/columnist/dan-wolken/2022/09/11/us-open-champ-carlos-alcaraz-chase-for-grand-slam-titles/8061057001/", "title": "US Open champ Carlos Alcaraz is only beginning his Grand Slam run", "text": "It should not have been possible to combine the offensive shotmaking and creativity of Roger Federer, the relentlessness and mental strength of Rafael Nadal and the supernatural speed and endurance of Novak Djokovic into one body.\n\nBut when they made Carlos Alcaraz, the 19-year old Spanish tennis phenom who now rules the sport as its new No. 1, the rules obviously didn’t apply. And by the time he’s done, he may well have made us rethink everything about what greatness looks like.\n\nEven as Alcaraz shot up the rankings this year, won big tournament titles and even started to beat some of those legends, it was fair to wonder if the hyperbole was too much. The standard in tennis is winning Grand Slams, and the last two decades of Big Three dominance have sometimes cruelly exposed that talent isn’t enough to get to the finish line at even one of these tournaments, much less do it 20 times. It is impossible to know if someone can do it until it has been done.\n\nBut on Sunday, as Alcaraz put his hands on the U.S. Open trophy for the very first time after defeating Norway’s Casper Ruud, there was no sense of relief or surprise. Instead, it looked like a scene that we will assuredly see play out many more times over the next 15 years.\n\nUS OPEN: Alcaraz picks up first Grand Slam title with victory against Ruud\n\nNEVER MISS A MOMENT: Follow our sports newsletter for daily updates\n\nAs generations of players came and went, unable to break through the physical and mental wall that Federer, Nadal and Djokovic had erected around the Grand Slams, it was natural to be cynical about the future of men’s tennis at the end of their reign.\n\nAnd yet just as their dominance has begun to wane, here comes something entirely new: A generational talent who combines the best attributes of all three while playing the game with charisma, flair and unshakable confidence that he can pull off any shot at any time.\n\nIn his matches at the U.S. Open, which stretched across a grueling 23 hours and 39 minutes, Alcaraz showed what new-age tennis will look like and the level his contemporaries and younger challengers will have to reach to win these events. It won’t be easy for any of them.\n\nObviously, Alcaraz has a very, very long way to go for his achievements to match what the Big Three have done. And there are so many variables that will determine whether it’s possible, including health and the ability to sustain the hunger that makes him the first teenager to reach No. 1 in ATP history.\n\nBut in many ways, Alcaraz has already broken through the hardest part of the process because what he just did in New York wasn’t supposed to be possible at all anymore.\n\nBack in the 1980s and early 1990s, the timetable for tennis players was much different. It wasn’t unusual to see teenagers win Grand Slams, but players were rarely competitive into their 30s.\n\nOver the last two decades, the entire career window has shifted as the game became more and more demanding, especially in the best-of-five set format utilized by the Grand Slams. Tennis became a sport for grown men at their physical peak, not still-developing youngsters who lacked the strength and competitive stamina to survive seven grueling matches. With sports science advances allowing more and more veteran players to extend their careers, it has become exceedingly lately for teenagers to make a significant impact on tour.\n\nAlcaraz, though, put himself on a much different timetable than the rest. He won his first ITF-level event at 16, his first Challenger Tour event at 17 and his first ATP title at 18. He started 2022 ranked No. 32 in the world, setting a goal to crack the top 10 by the end of the year.\n\nBut by the time he won the Miami Open in March and the Madrid Open in May, two of the biggest non-Slam events on the calendar, it was obvious something else was happening.\n\nThe kid had figured this game out.\n\nIt’s not just that Alcaraz hits the ball harder off the ground than just about anyone. It’s not just that he runs faster, with the ability to contort his body on defense and uncork winners at ridiculous angles. It’s not just his willingness to come forward and finish points at the net or utilize his creativity and touch with terrorizing drop shots.\n\nIn the end, it’s all of that plus something else that simply can’t be taught: When the moment gets bigger, he plays better.\n\n“In the third set, it was close to go in my favor,” Ruud said, referring to a moment in the final when Alcaraz needed to save set two set points to get to a third set tiebreaker, which he ultimately won. “He just played too good on those points. We've seen it many times before, he steps up when he needs to. When it's close, he pulls out great shots.”\n\nThat was the story of Alcaraz’s tournament because there was no other way for him to get through a fourth round against Marin Cilic when he fell down a break in the fifth set, or to come back from the brink against Jannik Sinner during a 5-hour, 15 minute marathon or to survive an onslaught of brilliant shotmaking from Frances Tiafoe in the semifinals.\n\nBut it also wasn’t too surprising. We have known for awhile Alcaraz had no real technical weakness in his game. When he beat Nadal and Djokovic in consecutive matches in Madrid, showing absolutely zero tentativeness or deference to their intimidating presence, there was little doubt he would have that special quality needed to finish a Grand Slam title.\n\nIt wasn’t a matter of if, but when. Now, it’s how many.\n\nTime will tell, but the transition from the Big Three to the Era of Alcaraz looks like it’s going to be a smooth one. The U.S. Open was just the beginning, and now it’s time to watch to him really take off.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/11"}]}

Greg Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, also claimed that Biden's plan would harm low-income families – writing, \"hourly workers will pay off the master’s and doctorate degrees of high salaried lawyers, doctors, and professors. ... Simply put, your plan rewards the rich and punishes the poor.\"\n\nIn response, the White House pointed to Republican support of significant tax cuts for the wealthy under President Donald Trump, as well the GOP politicians who benefitted from having their federal Paycheck Protection Program loans forgiven during the COVID-19 health crisis.\n\n\"These same Republican governors didn’t seem to object when their Republican colleagues in Congress passed a $2 trillion tax giveaway for the rich or had hundreds of thousands of dollars of their own small business loans forgiven,\" White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan wrote in an email sent to USA TODAY Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"While Republican elected officials try to keep working middle-class Americans in mountains of debt, President Biden is committed to delivering relief to the borrowers who need it most,\" Hasan added.\n\nVoices:Is Biden student loan forgiveness unfair? No, it's a vital first step.\n\nLate last month, Biden fulfilled a key campaign promise by announcing that he would cancel at least $10,000 in student loan debt for millions of federal borrowers, as well as $20,000 to Pell Grant recipients.\n\nWhile the Monday letter argues that the president's move will reward rich Americans, Biden has stressed that the income-based eligibility of his plan is aimed to help those who need it most, notably middle-class and lower-income families. Borrowers with incomes less than $125,000, or households earning $250,000 or less, are eligible for the $10,000 in forgiveness – and the up to $20,000 in debt relief is for people who have been low-income Pell Grant recipients.\n\n\"An education is a ticket to a better life. ... But over time, that ticket has become too expensive for too many Americans,\" Biden said Aug. 25. \"The burden is so heavy that even if you graduate, you may not have access to the middle-class life that the college degree once provided.\"\n\n'Debt and no degree':Biden cancels as much as $20K in student loan debt: Recap\n\nHow do I get my student loans forgiven? Qualifying for Biden's debt relief, explained.\n\nMany applauded the president's historic move, expected to aid up to 43 million borrowers. Other activists stressed that more relief is needed. Progressive Democrats, unions and liberal groups have urged Biden to cancel at least $50,000 in student loans.\n\nBiden's announcement also prompted GOP attacks, with many Republicans slamming the president for the potential impact on the economy and pointing to those who paid off their student loans in the past.\n\nNeed for more relief: Debt relief will change the lives of some with student loans, but fall short for others.\n\nGov. DeSantis:Student loan forgiveness alienates 'people who went and did the right thing'\n\n\"At a time when inflation is sky high due to your unprecedented tax-and-spend agenda, your plan will encourage more student borrowing, incentivize higher tuition rates, and drive-up inflation even further, negatively impacting every American,\" the 22 Republican governors said in their Monday letter.\n\nBiden argued in August that the plan was \"economically responsible,\" pointing to \"real benefits for families without meaningful effect on inflation.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs issued an analysis in August with similar findings, noting there wouldn't be much of an impact on inflation in the long run.\n\n\"Debt forgiveness that lowers monthly payments is slightly inflationary in isolation, but the resumption of payments is likely to more than offset this,\" Goldman Sachs analysts said.\n\nIn their letter, the Republican governors also said that Biden's loan forgiveness plan is estimated to cost a total of $600 billion and an average of $2,000 per taxpayer.\n\nBut these estimates have fluctuated among different experts. After Biden's August announcement, the White House said the plan would cost roughly $240 billion. The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania estimates it will cost between $469 billion and $519 billion.\n\nIn a handful of states, borrowers getting relief may also face higher taxes.\n\nMore:White House pegs student loan plan's cost at $240 billion. Experts say it will be twice that.\n\nTaxing loan forgiveness?

The boost, originally $600 but later cut in half, was extended twice, most recently to Sept. 6 under Biden's American Rescue Plan that Congress passed in March.\n\nUnemployment in the U.S. has dropped to 5.4%. Several states with Republican governors have already opted out of the benefits, slamming the extra money as a financial disincentive for the unemployed to get back to work.\n\nOther enhanced benefits during the pandemic – the extended length of benefits and coverage of individuals who wouldn't typically qualify – will also expire Sept. 6.\n\nMore:These 9 states will end participation in unemployment assistance programs. Their reasons vary.\n\nSome moderate Senate Democrats had indicated they wouldn't support extending the benefits past September. Biden's decision not to seek congressional approval to do so was outlined in a letter to Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Rep.

They said the rise in the COVID-19 delta variant \"may also pose short-term challenges to local economies and labor markets.\"\n\nFor states that want to keep extra benefits going, the administration is emphasizing that states can use their portions of $350 billion in direct aid from the American Rescue Plan.\n\n\"Where a more gradual wind down of income support for unemployed workers makes sense based on local economic conditions, American Rescue Plan funds can be activated to cover the cost of providing assistance to unemployed workers beyond September 6th,\" Yellen and Walsh said.\n\nMore:Economy adds 943,000 jobs in July despite COVID surge, worker shortages as unemployment falls to 5.4%\n\nLetting the expanded benefits end stands in contrast to the Biden's administration's move this month to issue a new federal moratorium on evictions for renters unable to make payments in areas hardest hit by COVID-19. The freeze expires Oct. 3 after a previous moratorium ended Aug. 1.\n\nThe administration said the Labor Department will be ready to assist states that want to use existing unemployment insurance infrastructure for enhanced benefits that are funded by rescue funds.

Eric Holcomb signed a proclamation Wednesday calling lawmakers back to the Statehouse for a special session starting July 6. He's asking legislators to send a collective $1 billion back to Hoosiers in order to combat inflation, but lawmakers could also pass new abortion restrictions during the special session.\n\nUnder Holcomb's plan, each taxpayer would receive about $225, in addition to the $125 Hoosiers already are receiving from the automatic taxpayer refund.\n\n“This is the fastest, fairest and most efficient way to return taxpayers' hard-earned money during a time of economic strain,” Holcomb said in a statement. “Indiana’s economy is growing and with more than $1 billion of revenue over current projections, Hoosier taxpayers deserve to have their money responsibly returned.\"\n\nMore:GOP delegates buck establishment, nominate Morales over Sullivan for secretary of state\n\nHolcomb's proclamation only mentions the need for a special session to provide economic relief. In a statement earlier this month, however, the governor's office said lawmakers could decide if they wanted to use the special session to address other issues, such as abortion, aside from Holcomb's plan to return money to taxpayers. Special sessions can last up to 40 calendar days.\n\n\"A special session is needed for the inflation relief plan, but it’s up (to) the legislators on what other issues they would want to address,\" the statement read.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule in the next week or so on a Mississippi abortion law banning most abortions after 15 weeks. A draft of the court's opinion showed the justices voted to strike down Roe v.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, The Sentencing Project and others signed on to a letter arguing that prison construction is an improper use of money from the American Rescue Plan and asking Chairwoman Rep. Maxine Waters to hold hearings on the matter. “Directing COVID relief funds to a massive prison construction plan that long predates the pandemic is an absurd and inappropriate use of (American Rescue Plan) funds,” the organizations wrote. Gov. Kay Ivey signed legislation in October to tap $400 million of the state’s money from the federal plan to help build two super-size prisons. The Republican governor at the time called the construction plan “a major step forward” for the prison system, which faces various federal court orders and a lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department. Republican legislative leaders and Ivey have said they are confident they can use the pandemic money for prison construction because the American Rescue Plan says states can use the money to replace revenue lost during the pandemic to strengthen support for vital public services and help retain jobs.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The newly crowned Miss America has made history, becoming both the first Korean American and the first Alaskan to hold the title in the competition’s 100-year history. “I never could have imagined in a million years that I would be Miss America, let alone that I would be Miss Alaska,” a beaming Emma Broyles said Friday. In fact, she was sure they had it wrong. The final two contestants were Broyles and Lauren Bradford, Miss Alabama, and Broyles said she was thinking Bradford was going to make an amazing Miss America. “And then they said Alaska, and I said, ‘No way. Are you sure? Do you want to check that card again?’ ” she said. “I am so, so grateful to everybody back at home who’s been supporting me for so long, and I’m so glad that I’m able to bring home the title of Miss America to the state of Alaska for the first time in history.” Broyles, 20, said her grandparents immigrated to Anchorage from Korea about 50 years ago, before her mother was born. Her mother is a special education teacher at Service High School in Anchorage, the same school Broyles attended. Broyles has chosen the Special Olympics for her social impact initiative. Besides her mother’s position, her older brother, Brendan, has Down syndrome and competes in athletic events with Special Olympics Alaska.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey has extended an executive order prohibiting state and local governments from requiring people to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The prohibition includes an exception for hospitals and other licensed health care institutions. It’s a small part of a nine-page order signed Wednesday that largely deals with surveillance and monitoring of health care institutions during the pandemic. Ducey in August issued an executive order barring the state and local governments from requiring vaccines, based on an existing public health law. However, after the outbreak worsened again during the fall, the state university system, the city of Tucson and Pima County decided to require their employees to be inoculated. Tucson Mayor Regina Romero said in a statement Friday that the city will keep its employee vaccine mandate in place. The city says Ducey has no authority to block its immunization rules. Phoenix also mandated employee vaccinations, but it and at least one university have since paused their mandates after a court blocked the Biden administration’s mandate that federal contractors require employee vaccinations. Ducey’s office did not announce the latest order, which was reported by local news outlets.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Friday reported its first case of the omicron variant as the state’s coronavirus cases and COVID-19 hospitalizations continued to increase. The Arkansas Department of Health did not release information about the person’s location, age or gender, nor whether they had been vaccinated. However, department spokeswoman Meg Mirivel said the case was not associated with travel. The variant’s appearance in the state had been expected as it spreads throughout the United States. The variant has been detected in at least 40 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Globally, more than 75 countries have reported confirmed omicron cases. “This was expected, and we expect more cases of the variant to be confirmed in the near future,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted. “This is not a surprise, but it is a compelling reason to get a booster shot now.” The state reported 1,111 new virus cases, bringing its total since the pandemic began to 542,426. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations rose by nine to 538. The state reported 17 new COVID-19 deaths. Arkansas ranks 35th in the country for new virus cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The California Coastal Commission has approved a plan to poison invasive mice threatening rare seabirds on the Farallon Islands National Wildlife Refuge. The agency that regulates California’s coastline voted 5-3 Thursday night to approve a plan to drop about 3,000 pounds of poisoned bait from helicopters onto the rocky islands off the San Francisco coast that are home to hundreds of thousands of breeding birds. The move still requires approval from the regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, officials said. The Farallon Islands refuge is home to an estimated 300,000 breeding seabirds, including the rare ashy storm-petrel. But officials say the population is threatened by mice that arrived on the islands aboard ships more than a century ago. In recent years, the mouse population has exploded, attracting burrowing owls that also prey on the ashy storm-petrel, officials said. “This project is necessary and is the right thing to do to stop the ecosystem carnage done by mice: a human-caused problem,” Gerry McChesney, manager of the wildlife refuge, said at the meeting. The proposal has won both support and condemnation from various conservation groups. Critics contend other wildlife could be poisoned by the rodenticide. Famed animal researcher and conservationist Jane Goodall spoke against the proposal at the hearing. “This poison will inflict pain and suffering on a great many sentient animals,” she said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The 110-year prison sentence meted out last week to the truck driver who killed four people when he lost his brakes on Interstate 70 put a renewed spotlight on the state’s mandatory-minimum sentencing laws and on district attorneys’ ability to use such laws to ensure convictions lead to prison time. Rogel Aguilera-Mederos, 26, was sentenced to a prison term twice as long as some Colorado murderers after his convictions triggered provisions in state law that forced District Court Judge Bruce Jones to lay down a minimum 110-year sentence. The judge said during the sentencing hearing that he had no discretion to set a lesser prison term but wished he could. One family member of a man who died in the fiery 28-car pileup in Lakewood said he did not want a life sentence for the truck driver. And the day after the sentencing, First Judicial District Attorney Alexis King – who pursued the convictions that led to the 110-year sentence – said in a statement that she would “welcome” a reconsideration of the prison term. Aguilera-Mederos’ sentence stretched to more than a century because under Colorado law, first-degree assault and attempted first-degree assault are so-called crimes of violence in which prison sentences must run consecutively, not concurrently, when they spring from the same incident.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: An appeals court ruled Friday that a local historical society cannot try to impose its conservation rules on a congregational church that dates back to 1700 and is located on the celebrated Lebanon Town Green. The ruling by the state Appellate Court is the latest chapter in years­long legal proceedings over who owns the mile-long green and how to shield it from development that would harm its historic character. As a result of those proceedings, the Lebanon Historical Society has conservation authority over 95% of the green, meaning any construction and property improvements must adhere to its building rules and restrictions. But the First Congregational Church of Lebanon is on the 5% of the green the society does not control. In a lawsuit filed in 2019, the historical society is seeking authority to regulate the remaining 5%, saying it needs to be protected like the rest of the green. The church argued that just because the society controls adjacent property doesn’t mean it has legal standing to try to impose that authority on the property where the church buildings stand. Three judges on the Appellate Court on Friday upheld a lower court ruling in favor of the church, saying the case has implications for property owners statewide. The historical society intends to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court, a lawyer said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A lawsuit filed Friday on behalf of two men who claim they were unjustifiably beaten by officers at Sussex Correctional Institution aims to investigate what the filing describes as an “ongoing and egregious pattern of the use of excessive force” against people housed in the prison. The lawsuit was submitted to U.S. District Court in Wilmington on behalf of William “Bill” Davis and Isaac Montague. Both claim that they were beaten as pretrial detainees and that officers deployed pepper spray directly into their noses and mouths as they were held down in two separate incidents this fall. “Justice? I think they definitely need to be charged criminally because eventually they are going to kill somebody,” said Davis, a resident of Bear and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The lawsuit follows other litigation against the Delaware Department of Correction in which people imprisoned by the state claim that officers engage in violence and other violations of basic rights with impunity. Both Davis and Montague are being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Delaware. It is the first time the organization has represented prisoners in recent years and the first such lawsuit since hiring Susan Burke, who took over as the chapter’s legal director earlier this year. “We intend to do a lot of prison litigation,” Burke said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new mural honoring civil rights icon John Lewis now decorates the walls of the barbershop where the late congressman was a regular customer, WUSA-TV reports. The artwork was officially unveiled at HIS grooming Thursday afternoon. Posts on the shop’s Instagram page show that the piece depicts Lewis in the chair getting his head shaved. After Lewis’ death in 2020 of pancreatic cancer, shop owner Jared Scott spoke about the first time Lewis came into his business for a hot shave with a straight razor. “My heart skipped a few beats,” Scott said. “My hands were trembling.” Lewis continued to visit HIS Grooming nearly a dozen times over the course of a year. The art project honoring Lewis has been in the works for a while, but a special event for its unveiling will have D.C. Council members in attendance, as well as U.S. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district’s delegate to Congress.\n\nFlorida\n\nGulf Breeze: A man who was rewarded by the Planters peanut company for being a good Samaritan is continuing to help others in his Panhandle city. Over the previous two Christmas seasons, Mike Esmond donated about $12,000 to pay off utility bills for people in Gulf Breeze who needed some extra help. Then, in March, Planters sent Esmond a check for $104,000 for his good works as part of the company’s “A Nut Above” campaign. Since then, Esmond has continued helping with past-due utility bills, paying off balances for 677 accounts. “In other words, I paid everybody’s past-due account for a while, about March to August, like six months straight,” Esmond said. Last week, he donated funds to pay off 29 accounts, putting his total donations at about $85,000 this year and more than $96,000 over three years. He said he’s continuing his effort in hopes of inspiring others, and it’s been touching to hear how the donations have helped older residents who may need additional assistance. “I’ve had some older, retired people call me crying on the phone because I paid their bills, because they live on Social Security, and they don’t know what’s going on,” Esmond said. The U.S. Army veteran said he was inspired to help with utility bills because of his own experience in the 1980s, when he couldn’t afford to pay his winter gas bill.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Johnny Isakson, an affable Republican politician who rose from the ranks of the Georgia Legislature to become a U.S. senator known as an effective, behind-the-scenes consensus builder, died Sunday. He was 76. Isakson’s son John Isakson said his father died in his sleep before dawn at his home in Atlanta. John Isakson said although his father had Parkinson’s disease, the cause of death was not immediately apparent. “He was a great man, and I will miss him,” John Isakson said. Johnny Isakson, whose real estate business made him a millionaire, spent more than four decades in Georgia political life. In the Senate, he was the architect of a popular tax credit for first-time home buyers that he said would help invigorate the struggling housing market. As chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, he worked to expand programs offering more private health care choices for veterans. Isakson’s famous motto was that “there are two types of people in this world: friends and future friends.” That approach made him exceedingly popular among colleagues. In a farewell Senate speech, he pleaded for bipartisanship at a time of bitter divisions between Republicans and Democrats. He cited his long friendship with U.S. Rep. John Lewis, an Atlanta Democrat and civil rights hero, as an example of two men willing to put party aside to work on common problems.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A working group tasked by the Legislature to come up with recommendations for a new management plan for the state’s tallest peak and its affiliated telescopes released the first draft of its proposal Friday. Mauna Kea is the proposed site for what would be the world’s largest optical telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope. The giant telescope project has sparked a cultural movement among Native Hawaiians who believe the mountain is sacred. Construction of the massive instrument has been blocked by opponents. The group suggested a new governing entity for the mountain, which is managed by the University of Hawaii. The group recommended the school not have a seat on the board of the new governing body. The university’s lease expires in 2033. “The University of Hawaii was represented at the table during the working group discussions,” said the group’s chairperson, Rep. Mark Nakashima, a Democrat whose Hilo district includes Mauna Kea. “One of the premises of the resolution was that the university failed in some of its duties and responsibilities to the Native Hawaiian population, and so it was not included in the final management structure.” The group could not come to a consensus on whether someone from the astronomy field should participate and recommended any such involvement be in an advisory capacity.\n\nIdaho\n\nKuna: Lawmakers are looking at a $400 million tax relief package for the upcoming legislative session that includes a $200 million income tax cut, a top Republican House member said. House Assistant Majority Leader Jason Monks said Friday that the income tax cut involves lowering the top income tax bracket from 6.5% to 6%. Monks spoke at a legislative district town hall meeting in Kuna with several other lawmakers. Monks said Republican Gov. Brad Little is behind the income tax cut plan, as is the House Revenue and Taxation Committee chairman. “They’re greasing the skids pretty good on this,” Monks said. He said the other $200 million would come from a one-time tax relief package. Republican lawmakers last year passed nearly $400 million in tax relief that Democrats said mainly benefitted the wealthy. Idaho’s budget surplus is estimated at $1.6 billion, much of that attributed to the $5 billion the federal government has sent to Idaho in coronavirus relief money. The Legislature is scheduled to meet in Boise on Jan. 10, and lawmakers will look at setting state agency budgets. Republican Gov. Brad Little earlier this month hinted at possible tax cuts stemming from the projected surplus.\n\nIllinois\n\nHoffman Estates: Sears plans to sell the sprawling suburban Chicago corporate headquarters that’s been the struggling retailer’s home for three decades. Transformco, Sears’ parent company, confirmed last week that in early 2022 it plans to market the 273-acre corporate headquarters in the northwest suburb of Hoffman Estates. Transformco has been downsizing Sears’ operations and corporate staff for several years. “These changes have reduced our needs for a corporate campus that was built 30 years ago for the needs of a more centralized business,” Transformco spokesman Larry Costello said in a statement. Costello said employees have been operating under a hybrid structure during the pandemic, with a mix of in-office and remote work. He declined to say how many employees are based out of Hoffman Estates or where a future headquarters might be located. The Hoffman Estates campus was home to more than 4,000 Sears employees as recently as 2017, according to company filings. The site features a 2.3 million-square-foot corporate office and 273 acres, including 100 acres of undeveloped land.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: More than half of the state’s population remains unvaccinated against COVID-19, and its largest hospital system is so strained that it has asked the Indiana National Guard for assistance. A new WalletHub report adds another dire distinction to the resume: Indiana is the least safe state in the country during the pandemic – not just one of the worst or the worst in the Midwest but the absolute worst. Indiana ranked 51st on the list of “Safest States During COVID-19,” which includes all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The rankings came from the following data, according to WalletHub: vaccinations, deaths, hospitalizations, transmission rate and positive testing rate. All five categories were averaged together and graded on a 100-point scale, with 100 being the most safe. Indiana received a score of 17.67 out of 100. Hoosiers fared poorly in each individual category. When looking at vaccination rates, Indiana ranks No. 48. For COVID-19 hospitalizations, it ranks No. 46, tied with South Dakota, Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan. As of Thursday, the state reported more than 3,000 hospitalized patients, according to the Indiana State Department of Health’s dashboard. The state’s latest average positivity rate was 13.8%, as of Dec. 10. Nearly 18,000 Hoosiers have died of COVID-19 throughout the pandemic.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Property owners who ask to remove their names from online property searches to conceal their address may keep their names confidential under a ruling the state Supreme Court published Friday. Des Moines Register reporter Clark Kauffman filed a complaint with the Iowa Public Information Board against Polk County Assessor Randy Ripperger in 2017 after Ripperger refused to release a list of people who had requested their names be removed from the county’s online search-by-name property search database. The list includes police officers, prosecutors, judges and crime victims who want to make it harder for criminals or harassers to find out where they live. There are more than 3,500 property owners on the list. Kauffman alleged that Ripperger was violating the state’s open records law by refusing to provide the list of names. Kauffman said in a hearing that he sought the disabled name list to determine who opts in to the policy and find out if developers, landlords or slumlords are trying to keep their names from public disclosure. The board, which under Iowa law is empowered to enforce the state’s open records law, found in 2018 that Ripperger had violated the law. An administrative law judge and a state court judge affirmed that conclusion, and Ripperger appealed. The court concluded the list of names fits within an exception the Legislature allowed in the state law.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A moratorium on voluntary admissions at Osawatomie State Hospital will be lifted in January to provide more space for adults with long-term mental health issues. The Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services announced Thursday that the ban, which has been in place since 2015, will end as of Jan. 3. The hospital, one of two state-run hospitals for the seriously mentally ill, stopped taking voluntary admissions after receiving citations for not doing enough to help suicidal patients and routinely housing three patients in rooms meant for two because of capacity issues. The policy caused problems for other mental health providers, law enforcement and health care facilities who struggled to place people with serious mental health issues. The department also has created a new classification for mental health providers called State Institutional Alternative, which allows private psychiatric facilities to accept mentally ill patients who have been approved for admission to state hospitals. Currently, eight hospitals in the state are classified as SIAs, and they have cared for 122 adults and 291 youth since September. The agency is also planning renovations on the Osawatomie campus that will eventually increase capacity to 72 certified beds and 110 licensed beds.\n\nKentucky\n\nMadisonville: Two babies survived a tornado that ripped the bathtub in which they were sheltering out of the ground and tossed it with them inside, their grandmother said. Clara Lutz told WFIE-TV she put 15-month-old Kaden and 3-month-old Dallas in the bathtub Dec. 10 with a blanket, a pillow and a Bible. Then the house in Hopkins County started shaking. “Next thing I knew, the tub had lifted, and it was out of my hands,” Lutz said. “I couldn’t hold on. I just – oh my God.” Lutz, who had been hit in the back of the head by the water tank from the tub, said she began looking everywhere among the wreckage for the children. Her house was stripped to the foundation. “All I could say was, ‘Lord please bring my babies back safely. Please, I beg thee,’ ” she said. The bathtub was found in her yard, upside down, with the babies underneath. Authorities from the sheriff’s office drove to the end of her driveway and reunited her with the two children, she said. Dallas had a big bump on the back of his head and had to go to Vanderbilt University Medical Center Nashville because his brain was bleeding, but the bleeding stopped before Lutz got to the hospital, she said. Lutz said the parents of the children live on the north end of the county, and their home was nearly untouched by the tornado.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A man convicted in a killing has been exonerated and freed after being locked up for 12 years. Kendall Gordon walked out of the criminal courthouse in New Orleans a free man Thursday, days after local prosecutors asked a judge to void his conviction and release him, news outlets report. Gordon was serving a life sentence in the shooting death of a young woman during a 2009 home invasion and robbery. But the justice advocacy group Innocence Project New Orleans and the District Attorney’s office said DNA collected from the crime scene linked someone else to the crime. Also, a key witness recanted. “Darceleen Comadore consistently described the intruders that entered her home as an older man and a younger man, explicitly pointing out that the younger intruder had been shot and wounded while in her home by his accomplice,” the IPNO said in a news release. “Ms. Comadore believed she recognized the younger wounded intruder and identified him as Kendall Gordon.” However, she changed her story after learning that another man, Jessie Bibbins III, 18, had been shot and killed with the same weapon as the victim in her home. Bibbins was found dead less than 3 miles from the crime scene, wearing clothes matching those worn by the younger intruder, IPNO said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: New England’s commercial shrimp fishery will remain shut down because of concerns about the health of the crustacean’s population amid warming ocean temperatures. The cold-water shrimp were once a winter delicacy in Maine and beyond, but the fishing industry has been shut down since 2013. A board of the regulatory Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission voted Friday to keep the fishery shuttered for at least three more years. The shrimp prefer cold water, and their population health is imperiled by the warming of the ocean off New England. The Gulf of Maine, in particular, is warming faster than most of the world’s oceans. Scientists have also said recently that warming waters led to increased predation from a species of squid that feeds on shrimp. The board last voted to extend the existing moratorium on commercial fishing of the shrimp in 2018. The board could have decided to reopen the fishing industry Friday but chose not to do so in the face of discouraging news from scientists. Recent surveys of the shrimp show far less of them than historical averages, and there have been seven consecutive years of low abundance, said Maggie Hunter, a scientist with the Maine Department of Marine Resources. Warming waters remain a problem, Hunter said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The state’s Public Service Commission on Friday awarded offshore wind renewable energy credits to two developers who have proposed two projects off Maryland’s coast. The decision will support plans by US Wind Inc. and Skipjack Offshore Energy to build separate projects that would produce more than 1,600 megawatts of energy, the PSC said in a news release. The new proposed projects are in addition to the 368 megawatts of offshore wind already being developed by both companies off Maryland’s shore and whose offshore wind renewable energy credits were approved by the commission in 2017. In the second-round application period that ended in June, US Wind submitted three bids, and Skipjack submitted two bids. The proposals were evaluated on a number of criteria, including impacts to customer electric bills; Maryland’s health, environmental and climate interests, including progress toward lowering the state’s greenhouse gas emissions; and economic development benefits, the PSC said. The second-round projects are both expected to be operational before the end of 2026. They are subject to review by the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Nurses at St. Vincent Hospital have reached a tentative agreement to end one of the longest nurse strikes in state history. The deal between the Massachusetts Nurses Associates and Tenet Healthcare, the Dallas-based company that owns the Worcester hospital, was announced late Friday. Union members will vote on the proposal at a later date. The hospital said in a statement that 700 nurses will be able to resume their old jobs, and the nurses hired to replace them will also be able to retain their current positions. “We are glad to finally end the strike and put our sole focus back on patient care,” Carolyn Jackson, the hospital’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We will be setting a new tone at Saint Vincent Hospital: We are one team with a common purpose. Not striking nurses versus replacement nurses. Not nurses versus management.” U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, a former Boston mayor and labor leader in Massachusetts, helped broker the accord during an in-person meeting Friday, the union said in a statement. Federal mediators have been working for two weeks with both sides to reach an accord. The nurses walked out in March complaining that staffing levels were too low and that they had too many patients to care for safely.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The University of Michigan and Michigan State University will require all students, faculty and staff to receive a COVID-19 booster vaccination for the next semester in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The two universities, with the two largest student enrollments in the state, released statements Friday announcing the requirement, noting the omicron variant being found in the state. MSU said in its release that the deadline to get a booster shot is the beginning of the spring semester Jan. 10, while Michigan’s release said Feb. 4. Both schools already require vaccination against COVID-19 and have set their policies to reflect access and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation to receive a booster for anyone who is 18 or older and six months out from the last vaccine in their initial series. In July, both university presidents announced vaccines would be required for the fall semester due to spread of the highly infectious delta variant. The first case of the omicron variant was found in Kent County earlier this month. The CDC says the omicron variant may be even more contagious than the highly spreadable delta variant.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Hennepin County’s sheriff has pleaded guilty to drunken driving. Dave Hutchinson entered the plea Thursday to the misdemeanor charge and said he has enrolled in an outpatient treatment program to address his issues with alcohol. Hutchinson crashed his SUV on Interstate 94 near Alexandria on Dec. 8 at 2:30 a.m. after attending a state sheriffs conference. Hutchinson’s blood alcohol level was 0.13%. The legal limit to drive is 0.08%. The sheriff said in a statement that the crash was a “wakeup call” for him. He suffered three broken ribs and head and hip injuries when he rolled the SUV. “I understand the seriousness of my actions, for which I take full responsibility,” Hutchinson said. Hutchinson entered his guilty plea to fourth-degree driving while intoxicated via a plea petition. Douglas County Attorney Chad Larson said a plea agreement calls for a stayed jail sentence of 90 days, up to two years of probation, a $500 fine, a chemical-use assessment and a requirement that he follow the assessment’s recommendations. Hutchinson also must abstain from alcohol and nonprescribed controlled substances and submit to random testing. Larson said it’s a standard misdemeanor sentence for anyone with a first-time drunken-driving conviction.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Five universities are receiving nearly $10 million from the state to cover tuition for aspiring educators. The Mississippi Teacher Residency Program is part of an effort to address the state’s teacher shortage. There were 3,036 certified teacher vacancies in Mississippi’s public schools from Aug. 21 to Oct. 11, 2021, according to a Department of Education survey. The grants will cover tuition and expenses for up to 240 people seeking a graduate degree in elementary and secondary education and are being paid for with American Rescue Plan relief dollars. The money is being split among Delta State University, Jackson State University, Mississippi State University, University of Southern Mississippi and William Carey University. Anyone accepted into the program will receive full scholarships, testing fees, books and mentor stipends. The grant includes training alongside a mentor teacher, testing support, professional development, and a commitment to teaching in a district serving low-income children, racial and ethnic minorities, and children with disabilities.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The state treasurer will no longer help schools refinance bond debt unless superintendents promise not to enforce face mask requirements and other COVID-19 safety measures issued by local officials. Treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick this month began requiring school districts trying to refinance bond debt to certify that they’ll obey Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s warning against coronavirus-related mandates, Missourinet reports. Schmitt this month threatened to sue school districts and local health departments that require masks. He cited a November ruling from Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green. “These schools received certification forms because their bond deals were scheduled to close after the Attorney General communicated with schools about the court decision and we were made aware of several schools which did not intend to comply with the order,” Treasurer’s Office spokeswoman Mary Compton said in a Friday email. Fitzpatrick’s policy puts more pressure on districts to ditch mask and quarantine requirements. Without help from the Treasurer’s Office, districts face higher interest rates on debts.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Federal wildlife officials say two species of rare insects in the Rocky Mountains will need several thousand acres of glaciers and snowfields if they are to survive a warming world that’s threatening them with extinction. The western glacier stonefly and the meltwater lednian stonefly live in streams that flow from melting glaciers and snowfields. Scientists say the insects are not doing well and face continued declines as they lose a projected 80% of their habitat in Glacier National Park by 2030. The stoneflies’ peril underscores the threat climate change poses worldwide to mountaintops that are “biodiversity hot spots” – home to a rich variety of plants, animals and insects about which scientists are still learning. The two species live in and around Glacier National Park in Montana; Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, Canada; and Native American tribal lands in western Montana. More recently, they’ve been found in streams in Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park and the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness in Montana and Wyoming. A new draft recovery plan from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service suggests the possible transplant of some of the insects to new areas, exploring ways to artificially propagate populations and research into the stoneflies’ heat tolerance.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Even in normal times, the state has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation, with fewer than 2 million residents and plenty of jobs to go around. But with some workers slow to return to work after COVID-19 shutdowns, the state has hit new depths, recording the country’s lowest-ever state unemployment rate of 1.8% in November. Now Gov. Pete Ricketts, who frequently expounds on the value of work, is confronting an intriguing question: Can a governor force citizens to work, even if they apparently aren’t eager or able to do so? Options he’s trying include requiring people to confer with job coaches before seeking unemployment benefits. “There’s going to be a lot of different things we’re going to have to do to reach each individual and, if they’re not working for whatever reason, get them back into the workforce,” Ricketts said recently. “Jobs help create great financial independence for Nebraskans and their families, giving them the dignity to achieve their dreams,” said the Republican governor, whose family’s estimated $4.5 billion in wealth originated with the creation of online brokerage Ameritrade. Nebraska has about 49,000 job openings listed on a state website and 19,000 working-age residents who are not working. About 4,300 people are receiving unemployment benefits.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Fireworks that were called off last year because of the coronavirus pandemic are returning to the Las Vegas Strip on New Year’s Eve, with a theme pointed toward 2022 – Deuces Wild – and the addition of an eighth hotel-top launching place, tourism and elected officials announced Thursday. “Aside from last year, ‘America’s Party’ has been the culminating event of the entire year for more than 20 years,” said Pat Christenson, president of Las Vegas Events, a nonprofit agency created to produce and support big events. Thousands of revelers still congregated on casino-lined Las Vegas Boulevard last year despite the canceled fireworks. There was no mention during a news conference previewing this year’s event of the possible effect of the emergence and spread in recent weeks of the omicron variant of the virus. Fireworks were first held on the Strip on the last night of 2000. The display has helped make New Year’s Eve one of Las Vegas’ biggest events, drawing more than 300,000 revelers, according to tourism officials, and filling the tourism-dependent city’s more than 250,000 hotel rooms. “Being able to host this event again is so special because it allows us to close out the year in a memorable way,” Christenson said in a statement accompanying Thursday’s announcement.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nGreenland: The town has resoundingly rejected a proposal to ban the use of voting machines and return to counting ballots by hand. Voters in the town of Greenland on Saturday defeated a citizen petition that would have stopped the use of voting machines in all local, state and federal elections. The vote was 1,077 against to 120 in favor of the proposal. Town Clerk Marge Morgan said turnout was higher than expected, and officials had to print more ballots. Greenland has a little over 4,000 residents, according to the 2020 U.S. census. Similar attempts to ban voting machines are under way in Hampton and Kensington, and a bill calling for a statewide ban was filed in the Legislature. Interest in banning the machines grew following an audit of a legislative race in Windham. The audit was requested after a losing Democratic candidate asked for a recount, which showed that Republican candidates got hundreds more votes than were originally counted. The discrepancy drew the attention of former President Donald Trump and his supporters in their effort to find evidence of his wider, unfounded claim of election fraud from 2020. But the audit showed the cause of the discrepancy yielded not from the AccuVote machine but from a separate letter-folding machine used to send out absentee ballots.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Marriage equality may soon be better protected as a bill moves on to votes in the state Senate and Assembly. A 2013 court ruling legalized same-sex marriage in New Jersey, but it has not been cemented in a statute. The New Jersey Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee on Thursday voted almost unanimously to move forward the bill that would codify marriage equality into law. Legislators will consider the bill Monday. If it passes both chambers, it heads to Gov. Phil Murphy for his likely approval. He has vocally supported LGBTQ rights during his tenure. The momentum in Trenton arrives at an important time, said Christian Fuscarino, executive director of Asbury Park-based Garden State Equality. “With a conservative-leaning Supreme Court, we cannot afford to sit by in hopes the justices will leave Obergefell v. Hodges intact,” Fuscarino said, referring to the 2015 ruling that legalized marriage equality at a national level. When marriage equality got the all-clear from New Jersey courts, Amy Quinn and her partner of 10 years, Heather Jensen, were among the first to be wed, exchanging vows on Asbury Park Boardwalk. Nearly a decade later, Quinn is now deputy mayor of Asbury Park, and the fight for marriage equality in New Jersey continues. “I can’t believe we’re still fighting for this, but here we are,” Quinn said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed legislation Friday to redraw the state’s three congressional districts and divide a conservative stronghold into multiple districts over the objections of Republicans. Lujan Grisham, a former three-term congresswoman, said the new congressional map establishes a “reasonable baseline for competitive federal elections, in which no one party or candidate may claim any undue advantage.” Republicans disagree, calling it a power grab by Democrats who have long dominated state politics. “These maps are far from fair representation, and they are a disservice to constituents,” said Steve Pearce, chair of the Republican Party of New Mexico. Consultants to the Legislature say the new congressional map gives Democrats an advantage in all three districts to varying degrees, based on past voting behavior. Republicans need a net gain of five seats in 2022 to take control of the U.S. House and effectively freeze President Joe Biden’s agenda on everything from climate change to the economy. Democrat-backed redistricting plans for the House and Senate also were on their way to the governor’s office Friday after a final House vote. Both plans embrace recommendations from Native American communities for shoring up Indigenous voting blocs in New Mexico’s northwest corner.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Despite soaring COVID-19 case numbers, long testing lines and event cancellations, so far New York City hospitals aren’t seeing a repeat of the surges that swamped emergency rooms early in the pandemic. The state reported Saturday that nearly 22,000 people had tested positive for the coronavirus Friday, eclipsing the previous day’s mark for the highest single-day total for new cases since testing became widely available. More than half the positive results were in the city. The Rockettes on Friday canceled remaining performances of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, citing “increasing challenges from the pandemic,” with lines at some testing sites in the city stretched around the block and at-home tests remaining hard to come by or pricier than usual. But new hospitalizations and deaths – so far – are averaging well below their spring 2020 peak and even where they were this time last year, during a winter wave that came as vaccinations were just beginning, city data shows. Mount Sinai Health System’s emergency rooms are seeing about 20% more patients – with all conditions – in recent days, according to Dr. Eric Legome, who oversees two of the network’s seven ERs. But at least so far, “we’re seeing a lot more treat-and-release” COVID-19 patients than in earlier waves, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state Supreme Court ruled Friday that nonprofit charter schools can’t avoid facing civil fraud claims alleging mismanagement of taxpayer money by arguing they are immune from such lawsuits like a state agency. The justices reversed a 2019 Court of Appeals decision that had dismissed claims against Kinston Charter Academy, which closed abruptly to 190 students and their teachers in 2013. A 2016 lawsuit by then-Attorney General Roy Cooper sought financial damages for the state and monetary penalties against the academy, its CEO and the chair of its board. Charter schools are tuition-free public schools that receive state funds on a per-pupil basis and have more flexibility – with instruction and enrollment among them – than traditional K-12 schools. They are overseen by the State Board of Education. Kinston Charter Academy and leaders were accused by Cooper’s office of violating the state’s False Claims Act and deceptive trade laws. State attorneys allege the school provided a bogus upgraded enrollment estimate to state education officials that meant receiving additional funds, even as leaders knew the school would not last the 2013-14 school year.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is urging the U.S. Supreme Court to reject an appeal by developers of the Dakota Access oil pipeline who are seeking to reinstate a federal permit for the line’s Missouri River crossing. Early this year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed part of a lower court order that revoked the permit and required a new environmental review of the pipeline. “Though the dispute over the pipeline garnered national attention, the D.C. Circuit’s decision plowed no new ground,” lawyers for Standing Rock and other Sioux tribes fighting the pipeline wrote in a brief filed Thursday. The tribes argued that the high court should decline the developer’s petition to hear the case because appeals courts are not split on the issues surrounding the dispute, which can lead to the Supreme Court taking the case. The tribes say the D.C. Circuit judges applied a “conventional” review of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ permitting decisions and “found no abuse of discretion” in the lower court’s order revoking the permit, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The Corps permitted the pipeline’s river crossing, which is just upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and where tribal members fear a leak could occur and harm their water supply.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: More than 1,000 members of the Ohio National Guard have been ordered into hospitals overwhelmed by patients being treated for COVID-19, the vast majority of them unvaccinated, Gov. Mike DeWine announced Friday. The state is also hiring a staffing agency to help recruit nurses from out of state to assist with patient care, DeWine said. “Twenty-two months of this pandemic has taken its toll on our health care workers,” the Republican governor said, recounting stories of short-staffed hospitals needing workers to return for second shifts after only short breaks. Of the Guard members, 150 are medical workers – mainly nurses and EMTs – who will be assigned beginning Monday to hospitals largely in the Akron, Canton and Cleveland areas, which are seeing the highest hospitalization numbers. Most of those hospitals have stopped elective surgeries, and facilities elsewhere are considering the same, the governor said. The remaining Guard members will serve in as-needed hospital roles in other parts of the state. As of Friday, 4,723 Ohioans were hospitalized with COVID-19 – a figure last seen almost a year ago, the governor said. Nine of every 10 of those patients are unvaccinated.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An Oklahoma County grand jury has indicted a top Republican state House leader on multiple felony counts, alleging he misused his power to change state law so his wife could become a tag agent. House Speaker Pro Tempore Terry O’Donnell, the second-highest-ranking member in the chamber, was charged in the indictment Friday with five felonies and three misdemeanors. “He denies any wrongdoing,” said his attorney, Mack Martin. His wife, Teresa O’Donnell, who was also indicted, faces three felonies and one misdemeanor. Court records don’t indicate the name of her attorney. The most severe offense against the couple is conspiracy against the state, which has a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a $25,000 fine. The Catoosa Republican introduced a bill in 2019 that allowed spouses of legislators to serve as tag agents. The Oklahoma Tax Commission appointed his wife to take over the Catoosa Tag Agency on Aug. 1, 2019, three months after Gov. Kevin Stitt signed the bill into law. Terry O’Donnell said last year that his wife had no intention of becoming a tag agent when he sponsored the bill. He said she sought the appointment after her mother died unexpectedly from pancreatic cancer. Her mother, Georgia McAfee, had been in charge of the Catoosa Tag Agency for more than 40 years. Teresa O’Donnell had worked there for more than four years before her appointment. Grand jurors alleged the two submitted a fraudulent application to the Oklahoma Tax Commission.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A weeklong strike is underway, affecting a number of grocery stores across the state less than a week before Christmas Day. The United Food and Commercial Workers Local 555, representing many employees at Fred Meyer and QFC stores, confirmed early Friday morning that it is moving ahead with a walkout at stores in Portland, Bend, Newberg and Klamath Falls, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. The details and specifics of a walkout are complicated. While the UFCW represents roughly 10,000 Fred Meyer employees, not all stores, departments or worker categories are participating in the strike. The union has been in labor negotiations for months with the Kroger-owned supermarket chains. Last weekend, UFCW announced its members had authorized a strike. Union representatives said Fred Meyer has been underpaying certain workers, in violation of contract terms. The grocery chain hasn’t been providing necessary information to the union to refute or verify its concern or to address it through the grievance process, according to the union. Workers are also seeking wage increases. A Fred Meyer statement provided to OPB confirmed that its stores affected by the strike, along with impacted QFC stores, remain open for customers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will no longer impose income taxes on public-sector workers and nurses who receive student loan forgiveness from two major programs, the Wolf administration announced Friday. The change affects participants in the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which provides debt relief to teachers, social workers, military members and other public servants, and the Pennsylvania Student Loan Relief for Nurses Program, a recent pandemic-era initiative to forgive up to $7,500 in student loan debt incurred by state-licensed nurses. Most other states and the federal government do not subject student loan forgiveness to taxation, but Pennsylvania lawmakers who pushed for the change said the state Department of Revenue had considered canceled student loans to be taxable income. That meant that a Pennsylvania resident who owed $50,000 in student loans would be subject to a $1,535 state tax bill once that debt was forgiven. “These people have chosen to serve the public, and often in lower-paying fields, because they want to make a difference. They don’t have thousands of dollars lying around to pay a one-time tax bill. So it’s wrong to take what should be a blessing and turn it into just another burden,” Gov. Tom Wolf said at a news conference Friday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A major theater canceled its performances of “A Christmas Carol” over the weekend because a cast member was dealing with COVID-19 symptoms. The Trinity Repertory Company made the announcement on its Facebook page about half an hour before Saturday’s matinee show. The Providence theater said the unnamed cast member reported feeling sick at home Saturday morning, and the afternoon performance had to be scrubbed because there wasn’t an understudy who could take on the role. The theater said it was canceling the rest of the weekend’s performances out of an abundance of caution. Officials apologized for the abrupt change and said ticket holders would receive a full refund and complimentary access to an online streaming version of the production. “While we never make the decision to cancel a show lightly, our commitment to the health and safety of our artists, staff, and audiences are extremely important to us and made this decision clear,” the theater said in a statement. “A Christmas Carol” runs through Jan. 2 at Trinity Rep. The online streaming version is available until Jan. 16.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFolly Beach: Three young men on a beach vacation dug up a marked loggerhead turtle nest, causing 71 of the 90 eggs not to hatch, wildlife officials said. The men posted video to Snapchat in September of themselves digging up a nest marked with orange tape and signs on Folly Beach, and the Department of Natural Resources said agents were able to track them down. The three men, all under age 21, met with wildlife agents and admitted what they did. In exchange, the agency said it won’t charge them with a count of unlawful taking of loggerhead turtle eggs for each egg, instead agreeing to two counts for each man who was seen digging up the nest and one count for the person who filmed it. The men will face a fine of up to $2,000 on each charge and community service, the agency said in a statement. Wildlife agents will recommend all three men work with the state Marine Turtle Conservation program so they can find out how much work goes into protecting sea turtles in South Carolina. More than 1,300 volunteers along the coast help protect nests. Female sea turtles don’t lay eggs every year, and their nests are vulnerable if not protected on the beaches. Wildlife agents said 2021 overall was a successful year protecting the turtle eggs, with 5,649 nests recorded.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nCuster: Authorities say numerous fire departments worked through the night to put out a fire at a popular 85-year-old lodge in the Black Hills. Two firefighters received minor injuries in the blaze at Sylvan Lake Lodge in Custer State Park. No guests of the multistory hotel were hurt, according to the Custer Volunteer Fire Department. Firefighters discovered a “free-burning fire” when they arrived at the lodge Saturday night, authorities said. They encountered heavy smoke and flames extending to the roof. The stone-and-timber lodge was built in 1937, funded in part through Depression-era New Deal programs. A wing of additional rooms was added in 1991. The original Sylvan Lake Hotel was a stopping point for adventurers looking to climb Black Elk Peak, the highest point in America east of the Rockies, according to the lodge’s website. Alarms initially went off in the southeastern part of the building, authorities said. Freezing temperatures, narrow roads covered with ice and snow, and darkness added to the difficulty of dealing with the blaze. About two dozen agencies responded to the fire. Thirty-one cabins are nearby, all within close access to Sylvan Lake. Authorities asked people to steer clear of the area, where Custer firefighters said on social media that a massive cleanup effort is required.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The future of Second Avenue, ravaged by a bomb blast nearly a year ago, will feature a life-size mural of the street’s historic buildings, expanded sidewalks and a restored tree canopy. Mayor John Cooper revealed details of the first phase of Second Avenue’s reconstruction Wednesday among a crowd of residents, property owners and first responders. The historic avenue was the site of a bombing on Christmas Day 2020 that crumbled 100-year-old facades and severely damaged dozens of businesses and homes. The bomber, Anthony Quinn Warner, was the only person killed in the explosion. The bombing left Nashville with the task of salvaging as much as possible of the core section of Nashville’s original downtown Market Street, literally brick by brick. In the months since, Cooper’s Second Avenue Task Force and numerous community organizations facilitated nine community workshops to collect input from more than 500 residents on how the street should be rebuilt. The first phase will be funded by a $20 million allocation approved Tuesday by the Metro Council as part of Cooper’s $564 million capital spending plan. The plans focus on creating a “more livable streetscape” with widened sidewalks, increased space for outdoor dining and food kiosks, plant life, and public art.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A group of attorneys and advocates have pledged to seek clemency for 110 Black soldiers who were convicted in a mutiny and riots at a military camp in the city in 1917. The South Texas College of Law Houston and the NAACP’s local branch have signed an agreement to continue fighting for clemency for the soldiers of the all-Black Third Battalion of the U.S. Army’s 24th Infantry Regiment, the Houston Chronicle reports. They plan to ask the secretary of the Army to posthumously grant honorable discharges and urge the Army Board for Correction of Military Records to recommend pardons to President Joe Biden. The soldiers were either executed or given long prison sentences. “We are on a quest to obtain justice for the 24th Infantry Regiment … that organized group of men who died with shameful reputations at the hands of those who had the power of the government, the courts and the power of the media,” said Bishop James Dixon, board president of the NAACP Houston Branch. On Aug. 23, 1917, four months after the U.S. had entered World War I, the regiment mutinied in Houston. It resulted in the largest murder trial in U.S. history, with 110 out of 118 soldiers found guilty. Nineteen were hanged. Law enforcement immediately recorded the events as a deadly, premeditated assault by Black Army soldiers on a white population. Historians and advocates now recognize the riot as part of the regiment’s response to what it believed was a white mob heading for them.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A local group is hoping to welcome Afghan refugees to America through playing soccer. Refugee Soccer organizes teams of those who’ve settled in Utah. It gathers equipment and helps place players on mainstream soccer clubs. “Really the mission is to bridge the gap between mainstream and refugee communities,” Executive Director Adam Miles told KSL NewsRadio. Miles is now leading a group of 10 volunteers to a military base in New Mexico after Christmas to play soccer with Afghans who fled the country this summer and are waiting for placement in homes around the country. Miles and his team will head there after Christmas and stay through the first of the year. “Three weeks of concentrated, intense (soccer) clinics, and getting to know these kids and building some relationships,” Miles said. He said soccer allows them to build those relationships. “It’s creating that bridge between people that don’t look like them, don’t speak their language and probably don’t practice their religion but are connecting over the world’s sport – the beautiful game of soccer,” he said. The group also has another big challenge. Miles said many kids fled Afghanistan with nothing. “They fled for their lives … a lot of these kids don’t have shoes.” So Refugee Soccer is trying to collect 500 to 800 pairs of shoes and cleats for the kids to wear.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The mayor says he hopes to double housing production over the next five years as part of an effort to end chronic homelessness in the city. Mayor Miro Weinberger released a 10-point action plan Thursday to fulfill what he calls the “promise of housing as a human right.” “The path to making good on the promise that decent, stable housing is a human right is to build a lot more homes throughout the city and throughout the region,” Weinberger said. “This will require community change and understanding from us all. Our goal should not simply be to reduce homelessness; it must be to end it.” Mychamplainvalley.com reports Weinberger said the number of people in Chittenden County experiencing chronic homelessness has risen from 35 in 2018 to more than 160 now. The mayor’s action plan includes investing $5 million in COVID-19 relief funds to build new, permanently affordable housing. That would include at least $1 million for initiatives to better serve the chronically homeless population. The plan would also set a goal of creating 1,250 new homes by the end of 2026, with a quarter of those permanently affordable.\n\nVirginia\n\nFairfax: Police say four bodies discovered at two different locations in the state are the work of a serial killer who used a shopping cart to transport his victims’ bodies after meeting them on dating sites. At a press conference Friday, Fairfax County Police Chief Kevin Davis dubbed the suspect, 35-year-old Anthony Robinson, of Washington, D.C., the “shopping cart killer” and said police are working to determine if there are other victims. Davis said Robinson, who was taken into custody in Rockingham County last month, has lived in multiple locations, including New York and Maryland, in recent years. Police in Harrisonburg arrested Robinson last month and charged him with two counts of murder after finding two bodies in a vacant lot in the city. “The good thing is he’s in custody. The challenge that remains is identifying other victims,” Davis said. One body found in Fairfax County has not yet been identified. The three victims who have been identified all went missing in the past few months. Police say they are trying to research Robinson’s life going back many years to see if there might be more victims. “That’s what worries us,” Davis said. “He didn’t suddenly turn into who he is three months ago.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Voters have retained socialist City Councilmember Kshama Sawant, a controversial lawmaker and longtime foe of hometown tech giant Amazon. Sawant had faced a recall effort. King County Elections on Friday officially certified the Dec. 7 recall election, showing Sawant narrowly prevailing with 50.4% voting “no” on the recall question and 49.6% people casting “yes” ballots. Sawant, a 48-year-old economics professor, is the longest-tenured councilmember in Seattle. By surviving the recall, she gave a boost to the beleaguered left wing in liberal Seattle, which was bruised in last month’s general election when business-friendly candidates won the mayor’s office and a council seat. Sawant has had an outsized influence on the tone and direction of Seattle politics since she launched her political career under the banner of the Socialist Alternative party in 2012, when she ran unsuccessfully for state representative. Sawant was elected to the City Council the following year, and her threat to run a voter initiative drive for an immediate $15 minimum wage has been credited with pressuring business leaders and then-Mayor Ed Murray to reach a deal raising the wage to $15 over a few years. Seattle was the first major city in the U.S. to adopt such a measure.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nParkersburg: A former city councilor who is charged with breaching the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot has pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts. Eric Barber, 43, admitted to entering the Capitol and stealing a portable charger from a C-SPAN media station during a remote hearing Thursday, the Parkersburg News and Sentinel reports. “When I entered the Capitol building, I knew we weren’t supposed to be there,” he said after the judge asked if the charges were accurate. The criminal complaint alleged photos and security video showed Barber inside the Capitol wearing a green, combat-style helmet and a green, military-style field jacket. It said that video recorded Barber saying, “They’re giving us the building,” and that he took selfies in the Capitol Rotunda. It also claims he stole a portable power station from a C-SPAN media stand. Barber was elected to the Parkersburg City Council in 2016 as a Democrat. He changed his registration to independent a year later, then changed it again to Republican before losing his reelection bid last November. As part of the plea agreement, other misdemeanor counts will be dismissed. Barber’s sentencing was set for March 31.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The city will soon have a change in leadership. The U.S. Senate on Thursday evening confirmed the nomination of Mayor Tom Barrett to become ambassador to the small European country of Luxembourg. Barrett, who was elected mayor in 2004, did not say when he plans to step down. Common Council President Cavalier Johnson will become acting mayor until a special election can be held to fill the remainder of Barrett’s term, which ends in 2024. Johnson is one of seven candidates who have filed papers to run for the permanent position. Others include Milwaukee County Sheriff Earnell Lucas, Ald. Marina Dimitrijevic and former Ald. Bob Donovan. After his nomination was confirmed, Barrett thanked President Joe Biden, who nominated him, and U.S. Sens. Tammy Baldwin and Ron Johnson. “I’m not running from something; I’m running to something,” Barrett said in a virtual press conference after the vote. “And I think we all recognize that there are different chapters in life, and I’m very, very eager now to start this next chapter.”\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Residents south of the town are sounding the alarm over the possibility that dozens of high-end commercial campsites, roads and related infrastructure could be carved into the lower flanks of Munger Mountain. A Wyoming-owned 640-acre section of land that raises money for the state’s school trust account and is exempted from local zoning regulations could host the development. At the direction of legislators seeking to wring more money out of state lands in exorbitantly priced Jackson Hole, the Office of State Lands and Investments has identified the site as a potential moneymaker and plans to issue an open-ended request for proposals, Jason Crowder, the office’s deputy director, told the Jackson Hole News&Guide. That board, which has the final say, consists of five state officials: Gov. Mark Gordon, Secretary of State Ed Buchanan, Auditor Kristi Racines, Treasurer Curt Meier and State Superintendent Jillian Balow. Although a request for proposals was once expected out by September, Crowder is now assigning no time frame for its release. But a luxury “glamour camping” company, Under Canvas, has already expressed an interest in building another of its safari-inspired glamping compounds on the Munger parcel. That the concept is being met with firm resistance.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/politics/joe-biden-abortion-supreme-court/index.html", "title": "Biden White House has planned for Supreme Court to overturn Roe ...", "text": "(CNN) President Joe Biden has been bracing for the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade for months, preparing for it to potentially set off mass protests and heap pressure on the White House to act, according to officials, even as there remains little he can do through executive action to mitigate the court's ruling.\n\nThe announcement of Friday's ruling punctuates months of contingency planning at the White House and lobbying efforts by abortion rights advocates, who have wanted Biden to take immediate action.\n\nThe President blasted the court's decision in a televised address from the White House early Friday afternoon, lamenting what he called a \"sad day for the court and for the country.\" And he said he is directing the Department of Health and Human Services to take steps to defend access to certain medications, such as contraception and mifepristone -- one of the pills used to induce a medication abortion.\n\nBiden said he's directing HHS \"to take steps to ensure these critical medications are available to the fullest extent possible. And that politicians cannot interfere with a decision that should be made between a woman and her doctor.\"\n\nAlong with eliminating barriers to accessing medication abortion, behind the scenes, Biden has been considering taking steps to challenge state laws that criminalize out-of-state travel to receive an abortion, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has heard from privacy experts about how law enforcement could use period tracking apps to monitor for abortions and the possibility that embryo destruction could become more difficult for those who have in vitro fertilization. Advocates for communities of color and undocumented immigrants have raised specific concerns to the White House about women in those groups accessing abortion across state lines. And state lawmakers have pressed for more federal resources to help manage what many describe as a looming crisis.\n\n\"We're exploring every option to respond to the upcoming decision ... and to protect access to reproductive health care, including abortion,\" White House Gender Policy Council Chair Jennifer Klein told Wednesday's virtual meeting.\n\nBut with a federal law in place barring taxpayer funds from going toward abortion in most cases and a rash of state bans poised to take effect as soon as a Supreme Court ruling comes down, there remains little Biden can do that would fundamentally restore the national right to end a pregnancy. And his calls for Congress to codify the right to abortion lack enough votes in the Senate.\n\nThat has left some advocates and lawmakers looking for rhetorical leadership from a President who has, at various points in his long career, shied away from a full embrace of abortion rights. He rarely uses the word \"abortion\" itself -- an absence his aides downplay but that advocates say is still symbolic.\n\n\"It's time for this President -- past time for this President and this administration -- to name what's happening as a moral failing in this country and as a public health and human rights crisis. It's beyond the point of playing politics. It's time to say the word abortion out loud,\" said New Mexico state Rep. Michaela Lara Cadena, who was one of six Western state lawmakers who joined a call with senior White House officials last week to discuss reproductive rights.\n\nNew Mexico, a state without any major types of abortion restrictions, stands to receive an influx of patients from neighboring states like Texas should the nationwide right to abortion be eliminated. Cadena's appeal to the White House was to be prepared to help states like hers as women seeking abortions travel there to look for them.\n\n\"It's going to be a stretch for us to keep our doors and our clinics open for people coming from across the country. We are ready and our values are there, but it will be a stretch and to be real, this is decades in the making,\" she said.\n\nPressure on Biden from the left\n\nAhead of the ruling, Biden had come under pressure from activists and Democratic lawmakers to use the full extent of his executive power to dampen its impacts. But White House officials sought to temper expectations for what the President would be able to do unilaterally to maintain access to abortion for the millions of women living in states where it is now expected to be outlawed.\n\nIn conversations with advocates, the White House has heard a range of options, not all of which officials believe are tenable or would withstand legal scrutiny. For example, calls for Biden to allow abortion providers to work from federal property have raised concerns among some lawyers. And providing federal funding for women to travel out of state has the potential of running afoul of the Hyde Amendment, the law that prohibits federal funding of abortions in almost all cases.\n\nOther options have appeared more feasible to officials, including making it easier for women to obtain abortion pills through the mail. But legal hurdles remain.\n\nIn a meeting with reproductive justice leaders last month, White House officials heard concerns about accessing abortions for undocumented women, who could risk deportation by passing through checkpoints on their way to access clinics out of state.\n\n\"Folks who lack immigration papers are probably less likely to travel out of state to seek abortion care because of checkpoints and the fear of arrest, adding the additional layer of criminalization,\" said Yvonne Hsu, the chief policy and government affairs officer at the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum, who has participated in meetings with White House officials. \"To communities of color and immigrant communities, I think it's really having a chilling effect. And so what we've been doing is just making sure that they know these barriers already exist.\"\n\nA long process to figure out next steps\n\nThe process of coming up with options for the President began before a draft decision leaked this spring showing the court was poised to overturn Roe v. Wade. But work accelerated after the leaked draft opinion, which surprised some White House officials with just how sweeping the ruling could be.\n\nBiden himself learned of the draft opinion late on May 2, when his chief of staff, Ron Klain, phoned him in the White House residence to brief him on the leak. In the weeks since, senior White House officials have met virtually and in person with dozens of representatives from reproductive rights groups, state legislators and private law experts to discuss a path forward.\n\nSenior White House staffers have also met weekly with the leaders of Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America since the draft opinion leaked, according to a White House official.\n\n\"They really want to hear what we are hearing and what we're seeing from the folks that we work with on the ground, our partners, how people in the community are reacting, and also what we anticipate is going to come. I think right now they're really thinking about their response. They want to do something, but they're trying to do that in an informed way,\" Hsu said.\n\nThe work has been led by the White House Gender Policy Council and its director, Klein, along with outgoing White House counsel Dana Remus and Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice.\n\nHarris has also assumed a leading role, convening her own discussions with advocates, faith leaders and law experts to collect different perspectives and policy ideas on how the administration could intervene to ensure the protection of certain safety and security rights should Roe be overturned.\n\nIn a conversation on June 14 that focused on privacy, Harris was focused in part on questions about digital technology like period trackers, according to Melissa Murray, a constitutional lawyer and reproductive rights expert from New York University who participated in the discussion.\n\n\"She was right there, asking really good questions, thinking about not only the sort of nuances of the issue, but also what's the best way to explain this to the public so that they understand what's actually at stake,\" Murray said of the conversation.\n\nMenstruation tracking apps and IVF in the spotlight\n\nAdvocates fear that data from menstruation tracking apps could be used to prosecute women who have or seek abortions in states where they are illegal. Harris was interested in \"whether those individual private entities might have a role in limiting the amount of data that can be turned over to state authorities who are interested perhaps in prosecuting abortion,\" Murray said.\n\nJennifer Weiss-Wolf, a Women and Democracy Fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who participated in the discussion, said Harris was particularly interested in ideas in a letter that Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Patty Murray of Washington state had sent to Biden in June that called on the President to use the Department of Health and Human Services to clarify how websites and apps that collect reproductive information should safeguard the sensitive data.\n\nHarris also raised the Federal Trade Commission's role in those efforts. And the group discussed the prospect of requiring tampon and pad manufacturers to provide more accurate information on early pregnancy and menstruation with their products.\n\n\"We talked about some more creative things that have been put on the table already. And she was very enthusiastic of all kinds of ideas. These aren't going to be the solutions to the full crisis that our nation is in, but these are steps that the government can take to still protect us and fill gaps ... that exist that make our life ... in this new reality much more dangerous,\" Weiss-Wolf said.\n\nAnother issue that was raised was the possibility that those who fertilize embryos through the IVF procedure could face restrictions when it comes to destroying them, if a state adopts the viewpoint that an embryo is an unborn child -- language that Justice Samuel Alito used to describe abortion in the leaked draft.\n\n\"I told the vice president I'm more worried about what I would call a sideswipe,\" Harvard law professor Glenn Cohen said. \"The idea that we'll introduce language that's really aimed at abortion but will end up implicating in vitro fertilization and create uncertainty.\"\n\nWorries about violence\n\nThe prospect of large protests following a ruling has concerned some White House officials. Biden has made clear he is opposed to violence surrounding the decision and recently signed legislation extending around-the-clock security to Supreme Court justices' families.\n\nSecurity protections surrounding the high court received fresh attention after the Justice Department arrested a man near Justice Brett Kavanaugh's house in Maryland earlier this month and charged him with attempting or threatening to kidnap or murder a US judge\n\nWhile protests around the country have been largely peaceful following the leak of the draft opinion, law enforcement officials in the nation's capital have braced for potential security risks. Last month, an 8-foot-tall, non-scalable fence was installed around parts of the Supreme Court building, and crews set up Jersey barriers to block the street in front of the court.\n\nIn conversations with groups and advocates, the White House has sought to gauge what the response to the ruling might look like while encouraging community leaders to channel frustration and anger into constructive action.\n\nDuring an early June conversation with faith leaders in Los Angeles, Harris asked a group of diverse clergy members what they would be preaching the weekend after the ruling comes down, according to Rabbi Dara Frimmer of Temple Isaiah.\n\n\"What's going to be your message of hope and resilience and faith that -- while the world has been turned upside down -- here is what we as a faith community believe, and here is where we are going to be able to mobilize as we move forward,\" Frimmer said, describing Harris' message.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak", "Jasmine Wright"], "publish_date": "2022/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/09/30/presidential-debate-read-full-transcript-first-debate/3587462001/", "title": "Presidential debate: Read the full transcript of the first debate", "text": "USA TODAY Staff\n\nCorrection and clarification: A prior version of this transcript misstated what President Donald Trump said about the Democratic Party and socialism.\n\nThis is the full transcript from Tuesday night's first presidential debate between Republican President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. The debate was moderated by Fox News host Chris Wallace. Minutes and seconds are marked at various points for reference\n\n00:00 CHRIS WALLACE\n\nThe first of the 2020 presidential debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The Commission has designed the format: six, roughly 15 minute segments, with two minute answers and each candidate to the first question. Then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics, and the questions in each topic. I can assure you, none of the questions has been shared with the commission, or the two candidates. This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is doing as a health security adviser to the commission for all four debates. As a precaution both campaigns have agreed that candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight's debate. The audience here in the hall has pledged to remain silent: no cheers, no boo’s, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee, Vice President Biden.\n\n01:40 WALLACE\n\nGentlemen, a lot of people have been waiting for this night, so let's get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late, Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate's to consider a nominee the court, Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the president and Republicans to jam through and an appointment and what you call an ‘abuse of power.’ My first question to both of you tonight: Why are you right in the argument you make, and your opponent wrong and where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court. President Trump, in this first segment you go first. Two minutes.\n\n2:29 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP\n\nThank you very much, Chris, I will tell you very simply. We won the election, elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee, respected by all top, top academic -- good in every way, good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places so I think she's going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself, I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding, she's going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that -- we have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, says she's the single greatest student he's ever had. He's been a professor for a long time in a great school. And we just, we won the election, and therefore we have the right to choose her and very few people knowingly would say otherwise -- and by the way the Democrats, they wouldn't even think about that, doing it. If they had -- the only difference is they'd try and do it faster. There's no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn't have the elections so they were stopped, and probably that would happen in reversal so definitely would happen reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it.\n\n3:50 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump, Thank you. Same question to your Vice President Biden you have two minutes.\n\n3:56 JOE BIDEN\n\nFirst of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President. I -- the American people have a right to have a say to who the Supreme Court nominee is, and that say occurs when they vote for United States senators and when they vote for the President of the United States. They're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already -- the election has already started. Tens of thousands of people have already voted. And so the thing that should happen is we should wait, we should wait and see what the outcome of this election is, because that's the only way the American people get to express their view, is by who they elect as president who they elect as vice president. Now, what's at stake here is, the President’s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He's been running on that. He ran on that and he’s been governing on that. He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having insurance, health insurance, now, if they -- if it goes into court and, and the justice and I have nothing -- I'm not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she's written before she went to the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not constitutional. The other thing is on the court -- if it’s struck down, what happens? Women's rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could be held -- make more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. We're able to, they're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets, and that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act. And there's 100 million people who have pre-existing conditions, and they'll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it's just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the senate is Democrat or Republican, then he goes forward; if not, we should wait until February.\n\n6:01 TRUMP\n\nThere aren’t 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as the say is concerned, people already had their say. They -- okay, Justice Ginsburg said -- very powerfully, very strongly -- at some point, 10 years ago or so, she said a president and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a president's elected for four years. We’re not elected for three years -- I'm not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a president --\n\nBIDEN\n\nWho’s elected at the next election.\n\nTRUMP\n\n-- During that period of time, we have an opening. I'm not elected for three years; I'm elected for four years. --\n\nBIDEN\n\nThe election’s already started.\n\n06:38 TRUMP\n\n-- Joe. The hundred million people is totally wrong. I don't know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you're going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care --\n\nBIDEN\n\nThat’s simply not true.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWell, you said\n\nWALLACE\n\nGentleman, we're now into open discussion, open discussion. Yes, I agree. Vice President.\n\n7:00 BIDEN\n\nNumber one. He knows that -- what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare, and we increase it, we do not wipe any -- and one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people have private insurance still, they can they do, they will under my proposal.\n\n7:25 TRUMP\n\nNot what you said. That is not what you said. Your party wants to go Socialist.They're gonna dominate you, Joe, you know that.\n\n7:36 BIDEN\n\nI am the Democratic Party right now. The platform of the Democratic Party is what, I, in fact, approved of. What I approved of. Now here's the deal. The deal is that this is going to wipe out pre-existing condition -- by the way, the 20, the 200 million, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch. How many of those have survived? Over 7 million people have contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?\n\n8:05 TRUMP\n\nJoe, you had 308,000 military people die because you couldn't provide them proper health care in the military, so don't tell me about this\n\nBIDEN\n\nI’m happy to talk about this\n\n8:15 TRUMP\n\nAnd if you were here, it wouldn’t be 200, it would be 2 million people, because you were very late on the draw. You didn’t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn’t want me to ban\n\n8:24 WALLACE\n\nAll right we're gonna jump in right now. Mr. President. Mr. President, there’s a moderator. We are going to talk about COVID in the next segment, but go ahead.\n\n8:36 BIDEN\n\nWell, let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe v Wade. That's on the ballot as well, in the court in the court. And so that's also at stake, right now.\n\n8:52 TRUMP\n\nYou don’t know that’s on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot, Why is it on the ballot. It's not on the ballot\n\nBIDEN\n\nIt’s on the ballot in the court\n\nTRUMP\n\nI don’t think so. There's nothing happening there. You don’t know her view on Roe v Wade. All right.\n\nBIDEN\n\nI don’t know --\n\n9:06 WALLACE\n\nAll right, all right, let's talk here. We got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen, and we’ve got a lot of time. On health care. And with that, we'll come back to Roe v Wade. All right, Mr President, the Supreme Court will hear a case, a week after the election, in which the Trump administration, along with 18 state attorneys general are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare. You have sent the last --\n\nTRUMP\n\nBecause I want to give good healthcare. Good healthcare.\n\nWALLACE\n\nIf I may ask that question, sir. Over the last four years you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare but you have never in these four years, come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare.\n\n09:51 TRUMP\n\nYes I have. Of course I have. I'll get rid of the individual mandate which was added. That is absolutely a big thing, that was the worst part of Obamacare. The worst part of Obamacare. Well, I’ll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare. I got rid of it.\n\n10:12 WALLACE\n\nI am the moderator in this debate. And I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer.\n\n10:18\n\nGo ahead.\n\nWALLACE\n\nYou, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday, you signed a largely symbolic executive order to protect people with pre-existing conditions, five days before this debate. So my question sir is, what is the Trump healthcare plan.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWell, first of all, I guess I'm debating you not him, but that's okay, I’m not surprised. Let me just tell you something. That has nothing symbolic. I'm cutting drug prices, I'm going with favored nations which no president has encouraged to do because you're going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down, 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government but you didn't do it, nobody's done it. So we're cutting health care, all of the things that we've done -- insulin. I‘ll give an example: insulin. It's going to, it was destroying families -- destroyed people, the cost -- ‘I'm getting it for so cheap; it's like water.’ You want to know the truth, so cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that --- what we're doing, prescription drug prices, we're going to allow our governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they make just a tiny fraction -- this is big stuff.\n\n11:31 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, you'll be happy. I'm about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare, and the argument that he makes and other Republicans make, is that that is going to end private insurance.\n\nBIDEN\n\nIt is not.\n\nWALLACE\n\nI am asking the question. That it will, it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health care.\n\n11:37 BIDEN\n\nIt does not. It's only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid, they can get that free. In most states, except governors who want to deny people are poor, Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicare -- excuse me, Medicaid -- would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one --\n\n12:22 TRUMP\n\nSo you agree with Bernie Sanders, who’s left on the manifesto we call it, that gives you socialized medicine\n\n12:31 BIDEN\n\nLook. The fact of the matter is, I beat Bernie Sanders --\n\n12:42 TRUMP\n\nYou got very lucky.\n\n12:45 BIDEN\n\nI got very lucky, I’m going to get very lucky tonight as well. And tonight I'm going to -- here's the deal, here’s the deal. The fact is that everything he’s saying so far it's simply a lie. I'm not here to call out his lies; everybody knows he's a liar. I want to make sure -- I want to make the President --\n\nWALLACE\n\nCan you let him finish sir.\n\nBIDEN\n\nHe doesn't know how to do that.\n\nBIDEN\n\nThere is no manifesto --\n\n13:25 TRUMP\n\nYou just lost the left. You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan.\n\n13:31 BIDEN\n\nFolks, do we have any idea what this clown is doing?\n\n13:36 BIDEN\n\nLet me tell you what. He is not for any help for people needing health care because he in fact already cost 10 million people their health care that they had from their employers, because of his recession, number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting health care through Obamacare now he wants to take it away. He won't ever look in your eye and say that's what he wants to do. Take it away,\n\nTRUMP\n\nNo, I want to give them better health care at a much much lower price because he has no, he doesn't know how to read fixed he has never already played it to an extent he has now.\n\n14:16 WALLACE\n\nI know you’ll realize you're both speaking at the same time. Let the President's -- go ahead sir.\n\n14:22 TRUMP\n\nObamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre existing conditions but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed, that they shouldn't even call it Obamacare. But I had a choice to make. Do I let my people run it really well, or badly. If I run it badly they'll probably blame him, but they'll blame me, but more importantly I want to help people. Okay, I said you got to run it so well. That's me, and I just had a meeting with them; they said, ‘The problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it's a disaster. It's too expensive, premiums are too high, that it doesn't work,’ I suppose, people -- yes we do want to get rid of it. I want to get rid of something.\n\n15:07 WALLACE\n\nI have to give you roughly equal time, please let the vice president talk.\n\n15:12 BIDEN\n\nHe has no plan for healthcare. He sends out wishful thinking, he has executive orders that have no power, he hasn't lowered drug costs for anybody, he’s been promising a health care plan since he got elected. He has none. Like almost everything else he talks about, he does not have a plan. He doesn't have a plan. And the fact is, this man doesn't know what he's talking about.\n\nWALLACE\n\nOne final question for you, Mr. Vice President, if Senate Republicans -- we were originally talking about the Supreme Court here -- if Senate Republicans, go ahead and confirm justice Barrett, there has been talk about ending the filibuster, or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You call this a distraction by the president, but in fact it wasn't brought up by the President, it was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in Congress. So my question to you as you have refused in the past to talk about it: Are you willing to tell the American people tonight, whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court.\n\n16:16 BIDEN\n\nWhatever position I take on that, that'll become the issue -- the issue is, the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. We're in voting now, vote and let your senators know how strongly you feel. Vote now, in fact let people know it is your senators. I'm not going to answer the question.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWhy won’t you answer the question -- radical left -- well, listen.\n\nBIDEN\n\nWould you shut up, man.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWho is on your list?\n\n16:49 WALLACE\n\nWe have ended this segment. We're going to move on to the second segment.\n\n16:52 BIDEN\n\nThat was a really productive segment, wasn’t it.\n\n16:57 BIDEN\n\nKeep yapping, man.\n\nTRUMP\n\nThe people understand, Joe. In 47 years, you've done nothing then just.\n\nWALLACE\n\nAlright. The second subject is a covid-19, which is an awfully serious subject, so let's try to be -- A million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back toward anything approaching normal. My question for both of you is based on what you have said and done so far and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward. In this case, the question goes to you first. Sir, two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n17:54 BIDEN\n\nLook, 200,000 dead. You said over 7 million infected in the United States. We in fact have 5% or 4% of the world's population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people, they're dying. When he was presented with that number he said ‘it is what it is’ -- what it is what it is -- because you are who you are. That's why it is. The president has no plan. He hasn't laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He's on tape as acknowledging he knew. He said he didn't tell us or give people a warning of it, because he didn't want to panic the American people. You don't panic, he panicked. In addition to that, what did he do? He went in and he, we were insisting that the Chinese, the people we had on the ground in China should be able to go to watch, and determine for themselves, how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that. He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him a debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. What did he do then? He then he waited and waited and waited. He still doesn't have a plan. I laid out or I could just watch, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear plus, we should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people to help they need to keep their businesses, open, open schools that cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap, get people the help they need to keep their businesses, open, open schools that cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the car, and in your golf course the golf course and going oval office\n\n19:54 TRUMP\n\nThe country would have been left wide open, Millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much -- it's China's fault, it should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China's fault, by the way when you talk about numbers you know how many people died in Japan. How many people died in Russia. How many people died in India. They don’t exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we've done. I closed it and you said he's xenophobic, he's a racist and xenophobic because you didn't close in our country. You didn't think we should have closed our country because you thought it was too -- it was terrible. You wouldn't have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early -- in fact Dr. Fauci said President Trump saved thousands of lives. Many of your Democrat governors said President Trump did a phenomenal job. We worked with the governors. Oh, really, go take a look. The governor said I did a phenomenal job, most of them said that they attract people that would not be necessarily on my side, said that President Trump's a phenomenal job. We did. We got the gowns, we got the masks, we made the ventilators -- you wouldn't have made ventilators -- and now we're weeks away from a vaccine. We're doing therapeutics already, fewer people are dying when they get sick, far fewer people are dying. We've done a great job. The only thing I haven't done a good job, and that's because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on, it's just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press, because that's the way it is, unfortunately. I don't care. I've gotten used to it. But I'll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did, you don't have it in your blood. You could have never done that yet.\n\n21:30 BIDEN\n\nI know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWell you didn't do very well in swine flu. H1N1. A disaster.\n\n21:38 BIDEN\n\n14,000 people died, not 200,000. There was no economic recession. We didn't shut down the economy. This is his economy, it's been shut down. The reason it’s shut down is because -- look you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died at COVID. How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn't even speak to the nurse holding the phone up so you could in fact say goodbye. By the way, his own CDC director says, we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year, and he held up he said, if we just wear a mask we can save half those numbers -- just just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the, the whole notion of a vaccine. We prefer a a vaccine, but I don't trust him at all, and neither do you, I know you don't. What we trust is a scientist.\n\nTRUMP\n\nYou don't trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer?\n\n22:44 WALLACE\n\nAnd let me, let me move on to questions about the future, because you both have touched on one of the -- two of the questions I'm going to ask. Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your government’s top scientists. The week before last, the head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield, said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public. You said that he was confused and mistaken. Those are your two words. But Dr. Slaoui, the head of your operation warp speed, has said exactly the same thing. Are they both wrong?\n\n23:24 TRUMP\n\nWell I've spoken to the companies, and we can have it a lot sooner. It's a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political and save less. It is a very political thing I've spoken to Pfizer, I've spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to -- we have great -- Moderna, Johnson and Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by lot. It can become very political, because the left or I don't know --\n\nWALLACE\n\nHead of your operation warp speed, Dr. Slaoui --\n\nTRUMP\n\nI disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn't say that. He said it could be there but it could also be -- I had him in my office two days ago.\n\n23:58 WALLACE\n\nHe talked about the summer, sir, before -- it's generally available -- .\n\nTRUMP\n\nHe said it’s a possibility that we'll have the answer before November 1. It could also be after that. We're gonna deliver it right away. We have the military all set up -- logistically, they're all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers, and they could do 200,000 a day. They're going to be --\n\nBIDEN\n\nThis is the same man who told you--\n\nTRUMP\n\nIt's all set up.\n\nBIDEN\n\nHe said this would be gone away. Whether it'd be gone -- miraculously, like a miracle. By the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm and that would take care of it.\n\n24:32 TRUMP\n\nThat was said sarcastically, you know that. That was said sarcastically.\n\nBIDEN\n\nAnd so here's the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine. Every serious, every serious company is talking about, maybe having the vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning or the middle of next year to get it out. If we get the vaccine. And pray to god we will. Pray god we will.\n\n24:56 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice President, I want to pick up one of the -- pick up on this question though. You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can't trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight. Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying that public health experts “will be muzzled, will be suppressed. Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate Senator Harris contributing to that fear?\n\n25:26 BIDEN\n\nNo more than the question you just asked. You pointed it out. He puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists. Well, no, no, you can trust the scientists. She didn’t say that.\n\nWALLACE\n\nShe said, the public experts, quote, “will be muzzled, will be suppressed.”\n\nTRUMP\n\nShe did say that.\n\nBIDEN\n\nWell, that's what he's going to try to do, but there's millions of scientists -- there's thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital, that don't work for him. Their job doesn't depend on him. That's not -- they’re the people, and by the way --\n\nTRUMP\n\nI spoke to the scientists that are in charge. They will have the vaccine very soon.\n\nBIDEN\n\nDo you believe for a moment what he's telling you, in light of all the lies he’s told you about the whole issue of COVID. He still hasn't even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn't even tell you. He's on record saying that he panicked, or he just looked at the stock market -- one of the two -- because guess what: a lot of people died, and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter.\n\n26:35 TRUMP\n\nDid you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn't go to Delaware State. You graduated, either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don't ever use the word smart with me, don't ever use that word.\n\nBIDEN\n\nOh, give me a break.\n\nTRUMP\n\nBecause you know what, there's nothing smart about you, Joe. 47 years, you've done nothing.\n\nBIDEN\n\nWell, let's have this debate. You would’ve had --\n\nTRUMP\n\nLet me just tell you something. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through -- I had to close the greatest economy in the history of our country. And by the way, now it's being built again --\n\nWALLACE\n\nWe’ll talk about the economy in the next segment, sir.\n\nTRUMP\n\nIt's going up fast --\n\nWALLACE\n\nOkay. When it comes to how the virus has been handled, so far, the two of you have taken very different approaches, and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward, by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president. I want to quickly go through several of those reopenings, Vice President Biden, you have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and school. Why, sir?\n\nBIDEN\n\nBecause he doesn’t have a plan. If I were running, I’d know what the plan is. You've got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with a PPE, as well as with sanitation they need. You have to provide --\n\nTRUMP\n\nTell that to Nancy Pelosi.\n\n27:51 BIDEN\n\nWill he just shush for a minute.\n\nTRUMP\n\nTell it to Nancy Pelosi. And Schumer.\n\n27:59 BIDEN\n\nNancy Pelosi and Schumer -- they have a plan. He won't even meet with them. The Republicans won't meet with them in the Senate. But he sits in his golf course -- I mean, literally, think about it --\n\nTRUMP\n\nYou probably play more than I do, Joe.\n\nWALLACE\n\nWhat about this question of reopenings, and the fact that --\n\nTRUMP\n\nWell, he wants to shut down this country. And I want to keep it open. And we did great --\n\nBIDEN\n\nYou need to shut it down --\n\n28:22 TRUMP\n\nWait a minute. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe. Just for one second.\n\n28:26 TRUMP\n\nWe want to -- he wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to because we didn't know anything about the disease. Now, we’ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot -- young children aren't, even younger people aren't. We've learned a lot. But he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing -- if you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down -- they have Democrat governors all. One of the reasons they’re shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election. This is political.\n\nWALLACE\n\nI wonder what's --\n\nTRUMP\n\nThose states, those states are not doing well that are shut down.\n\nWALLACE\n\nGentlemen, we’re going to go on to another subject. You have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer, and in fact recently you have cited the, the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates. Are you questioning the effectiveness of masks?\n\nTRUMP\n\nNo, you have to understand -- if you look, I mean, I have a mask right here. I put the mask on it, you know what I think I need it. As an example, everybody's had a test, and you've had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear a mask, when needed -- when needed, I wear masks. I don't -- I don’t wear masks like him. Every time you see him, he's got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from me, and he shows up with the biggest mask I've ever seen.\n\n29:51 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden, go ahead, sir.\n\nBIDEN\n\nLook, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able to open. We provided money --\n\nWALLACE\n\nI was asking, sir, about masks.\n\nBIDEN\n\nOh. Masks -- masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now -- if everybody wore masks and social distancing between now and January, we'd probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters,\n\nTRUMP\n\nAnd they've also said the opposite. They've also said the --\n\nBIDEN\n\nNo serious person has said the opposite --\n\nTRUMP\n\nWhat about Dr. Fauci? Dr. Fauci said the opposite.\n\nBIDEN\n\nHe did not say the opposite.\n\n30:27 TRUMP\n\nHe said very strongly: Masks are not good. Then he changed his mind. He's admitted -- I’m ok with masks.\n\nWALLACE\n\nI want to talk about one last subject, because your different approaches have even affected the way that you have campaigned. President Trump, you're holding the large rallies, with crowds packed together thousands of people.\n\n30:44 TRUMP\n\nOutside.\n\nWALLACE\n\nOutside. Yes, sir. Great. Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events with --\n\nTRUMP\n\nCause nobody will show up.\n\nWALLACE.\n\nPeople with --\n\nTRUMP\n\nNobody shows up to his rallies.\n\nWALLACE\n\nIn any case, why you’re holding the big rallies, why you're not. You goes first, sir.\n\n31:00 TRUMP\n\nBecause people want to hear what I have to say, I mean, 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. We use airports.\n\nWALLACE\n\nAre you not worried about the disease, though, sir.\n\n31:13 TRUMP\n\nWell, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It's outside -- that's a big difference according to the experts. And we do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see. I mean every -- and literally on 24 hours notice -- and Joe does the circles and has three people some place.\n\nBIDEN\n\nBy the way, did you see, one of the last reboot rallies he had -- a reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, ‘No no no. Stand back. Put on your mask, put on a mask. Have you been tested? I'm way, way far away from those other people.’ That's what he said. I can't, I'm gonna be okay. He not worried about you. He's not worried about the people out there --\n\nTRUMP\n\nWe had no negative, no negative effect. We've had no negative effect, and we've had, 35 40,000, people at some of these rallies.\n\nWALLACE\n\nJust finish off because I want to move on to our next --\n\nBIDEN\n\nYes, I would. He's been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing, and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. And he's a fool on that.\n\nTRUMP\n\nIf you could get the crowds, you would’ve done the same thing, but you can't -- nobody cares, nobody cares.\n\nWALLACE\n\nGentlemen, can we move on to the economy. The economy is, I think it's fair to say, is recovering faster than expected from the shutdown much in the second quarter. The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month. The Federal Reserve says the hit to growth which is going to be there is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected. President Trump, you say we are in a V shaped recovery. Vice President Biden you say it's more of a K shape. What difference does that mean to the American people in terms of the economy. President Trump, in this segment, you go first.\n\n32:56 TRUMP\n\nSo we built the greatest economy in history. We close it down because of the China plague, when the plague came in we closed it down, which was very hard, psychologically to do. He didn't think we should close it down, and he was wrong, again. To me it -- people would be dead now, instead of still 204,000 people is too much, one person is too much, should have never happened from China. But what happened is we've closed it down and now we're reopening, and we're doing record business. We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we've put back into the workforce. That's a record the likes of which nobody's ever seen before, and he wants to close down the -- he will shut it down again. He will destroy this country, you know, a lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down and you take a look at what's happening in some of your Democrat run states where they have these tough shutdowns, and I'm telling you it's because they don't want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, said they’ll open up November 9. Why November 9? Because it's after the election. They think they're hurting us by keeping them closed. They're hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance, they can wash their hands, they can wear masks -- they can do whatever they want, but they can open these states up. When you look at North Carolina, when you look at -- these governors are under siege in Michigan and a couple of others. You gotta open the states up. It's not fair. You're talking about almost like being in prison. And you look at what's going on with divorce, look at what's going on with alcoholism and drugs. It's a very, very sad thing. And he'll close down the whole country, this guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don't need somebody to come in and say let's shut it down.\n\nWALLACE\n\nAlright, your two minute sir, we're now moved to you. As I, as I said posing the question, the president says it's a V shape recovery, you say it's a K shape recovery. What's the difference?\n\nBIDEN\n\nThe difference is millionaires and billionaires like him, in the middle of COVID crisis, have done very well. The billionaires array have made another $300 billion. Because of his profligate tax proposal and you only focus on the market. But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont -- all the small towns and working class towns in America. How well are you doing? This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes.\n\nWALLACE\n\nI understand. You've agreed to the two minutes, so please let him have them.\n\nBIDEN\n\nI get my time back? The fact is that he is in fact worked on this in a way that he's going to be the first president in the United States to leave office, I mean fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. Fewer jobs than when he became president. The first one in American history. Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines, those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have went out there dying, people who have been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. The idea that he is consistent, that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID desks and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Why does he want to open it up? Why doesn't he take care of the American -- you can't fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis, and he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home, in terms of your health and your safety. Schools -- why aren't schools open? Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. You know, they were going to give his administration was going to give the teachers and school students masks. Then they decided, no, couldn't do that, because it's not a national emergency, not a national emergency. They've done nothing to help small businesses, nothing. They're closing. One is six is now gone. He ought to get on the job, and take care of the needs of the American people, so we can open safely.\n\nWALLACE\n\nRight. Your time is up, sir.\n\nTRUMP\n\nI need to respond to that.\n\nWALLACE\n\nWell, you both have two minutes, sir.\n\n37:02 TRUMP\n\nExcuse me. He made a statement. People want their schools, no, people want their schools open. They don't want to be shut down. They don't want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I look at New York. It's so sad what's happening in New York, it's almost like a ghost town. And I'm not sure I can ever recover what they've done in New York. People want their places open. They want to get back to their lives.\n\nBIDEN\n\nThey want to be safe.\n\nTRUMP\n\nThey’ll be careful. But they want their schools -- I'm the one that brought back football, by the way, I brought it back Big Ten football. It was me, and I'm very happy to do it. People on all sides are very proud of me, and you don't want to --\n\nWALLACE\n\nGentlemen, we’re going to get to your economic plans going forward in a moment but first, Mr. President, As you well know, there's a new report that in 2016, the year you were elected president, and 2017, your first year as president, that you paid $750 a year in federal income tax, each of those years. I know that you pay a lot of other taxes, but I'm asking you the specific question: Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes, each of those two years.\n\nTRUMP\n\nI paid millions of dollars in taxes. Millions of dollars of income tax. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers. I paid $38 million one year. I paid 27 million one year --\n\nBIDEN\n\nShow us your tax returns.\n\nTRUMP\n\nI went -- you'll see it as soon as it's finished, you'll see it. You know, what you want to do -- go to the board of elections. There's 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have -- I'm totally underleveraged because the assets are extremely good, and we have a very, we have a --\n\nWALLACE\n\nI’m asking a specific question, a specific question, which is --\n\nTRUMP\n\nLet me tell you, that I understand --\n\n38:49 WALLACE\n\nNo, Mr. President. I'm asking the question. Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017?\n\n38:59 TRUMP\n\nMillions of dollars.\n\n39:00 WALLACE\n\nYou paid millions of dollars?\n\n39:02 TRUMP\n\nMillions of dollars. Millions of dollars. And you'll get to see it. And you’ll get to see it.\n\n39:05 BIDEN\n\nWhen?\n\n39:06 TRUMP\n\nBut let me tell you, Chris. Let me just say something. It was the tax laws-- I don't want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer. I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws and that's what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation, and for tax credits. We built a building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. You get an asset, which by the way, was given to me by the Obama administration, if you can believe that. Now the man got fired up right after that happened but--\n\n39:43 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden, do you want to respond?\n\n39:45 BIDEN\n\nI do want to respond. Look, the tax code that made him, put him in a position that he pays less tax to the school teacher, make them, the money a school teacher makes. Is because of-- He says he's smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code, but that's why I'm going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And we're going to eliminate those tax cuts and make sure that we invest in the people who, in fact, need the help. People out there need help--\n\n40:15 TRUMP\n\nBut why did you do it over the last 25 years? Why doesn’t he do it over the last 25 years?\n\n40:19 BIDEN\n\nBecause you were president-- Because you were president and destroyed things up.\n\n40:22 TRUMP\n\nYou were a senator--\n\n40:24 BIDEN\n\nYou are the worst president America’s ever had\n\n40:26 TRUMP\n\nLet me just say Joe I've done more in, in 47 months, I've done more than you've done in 47 years, Joe. We've done things that you never even thought of doing, including fixing the broken military that you gave me, to taking care of the vets--\n\n40:30 WALLACE\n\nWe’re talking -- Mr. President, we're talking about the economy. I'd like to ask you about your plans going forward. Because Mr. Vice President, your economic plan, if you were to be elected president, focuses a lot on big government. Big taxes. Big spending. I want to focus first on the taxes. You propose more than $4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year and on corporations. President Trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it's just coming out of a recession.\n\n41:14 BIDEN\n\nWell, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth because it would be about buying American. And we have to. We're gonna make-- The Federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to build, to the like. And under my proposal, we're going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a--\n\n41:50 WALLACE\n\nRespectfully, sir. I’m talking about taxes, not spending.\n\n41:54 BIDEN\n\nWell, by the way, I'm gonna eliminate a significant number of the tax. I'm gonna make the, the corporate tax 28%, shouldn't be 21%. You have 19 companies--91 companies, federal, I mean in the fortune 500, who don't pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars.\n\n42:11 TRUMP\n\nWhy didn’t you do it when you were vice president with Obama?\n\n42:15 BIDEN\n\nBecause, because you in fact passed that. That was your tax proposal.\n\n42:18 TRUMP\n\nI got it done and you know what happened? Our economy boomed like it's never boomed --\n\n42:23 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, Mr. President, let me pick up on that. You would continue your free market approach, lower taxes, more deregulation, correct?\n\n42:32 BIDEN\n\nNot lower taxes for the American people.\n\n42:46 WALLACE\n\nBut in Obama's economy booming. It turns out that in Obama's final three years as president more jobs were created. A million and a half more jobs than in the first three years of your presidency.\n\n42:48 TRUMP\n\nThey had the slowest recovery. Since 19 -- economic recovery, since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you have to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot, but they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. Let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401k's. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas -- You want to terminate my taxes? I'll tell you what, you’ll lose half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here they'll leave for other places. They will leave, and you will have a depression, the likes of which you've never seen.\n\n43:29 BIDEN\n\nLook, we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression, in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery, the crazy jobs you're talking about. He comes in on a booming economy. He blew it. He blew it.\n\n43:44 TRUMP\n\nIt wasn’t booming. It wasn’t booming.\n\n43:49 WALLACE\n\nSir, wait. Wait. Is it fair to say he blew it when, when there was record low unemployment before COVID?\n\n43:57 BIDEN\n\nYeah. Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in the hole--\n\n44:04 TRUMP\n\nExcuse me, Chris. Wait, Chris. They said it would take?\n\n44:05 BIDEN\n\nNumber one, number two, number three --\n\n44:09 TRUMP\n\nNo, you’re number two. Chris, Chris.\n\n44:12 BIDEN\n\nThis guy --\n\n44:13 TRUMP\n\nThey said it was a miracle to bring back manufacturing, I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing --\n\n44:20 BIDEN\n\nWe did not give up. I'm the guy who brought back the automobile industry.\n\n44:23 TRUMP\n\nHe totally gave up on the auto industry --\n\n44:24 WALLACE\n\nAlright, let him --\n\n44:26 BIDEN\n\nWe brought back, I was asked to bring back, Chrysler and General Motors. We brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. He blew it. They're gone. He blew it. And in fact, they're going --\n\n44:34 TRUMP\n\nOhio had the best year it's ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they've ever had --\n\n44:39 BIDEN\n\nThat is not true.\n\n44:40 TRUMP\n\nMany car companies came in from Germany, from China. They went to Michigan, went to Ohio.\n\n44:47 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice President --\n\n44:48 BIDEN\n\nAnd so, you take a look at what he's actually done. He's done very little. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. You know, he talks about the art of the deal. China's made, perfected the art of the steel. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest trade deficit with Mexico --\n\n45:06 TRUMP\n\nChina ate your lunch --\n\n45:07 WALLACE\n\nAlright, gentlemen --\n\n45:09 TRUMP\n\nChina ate your lunch, Joe. No wonder your son goes in and he takes out what he takes out, billions of dollars. Takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars. And also, while we're at it, why is it, just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow’s wife gave your son $3.5 million? What did he do to deserve it? What did he do --\n\n45:34 WALLACE\n\nYou asked a question. Let him answer.\n\n45:36 BIDEN\n\nNone of that is true.\n\n45:38 TRUMP\n\nOh, really?\n\n45:39 WALLACE\n\nMr. President. Mr. President, please. You asked a question--\n\n45:41 BIDEN\n\nTotally discredited. Totally discredited and by the way --\n\n45:46 TRUMP\n\nHe did get $3.5 million, Joe?\n\n45:48 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice -- Mr. President --\n\n45:49 TRUMP\n\nHe got $3.5 million.\n\nBIDEN\n\nThat is not true.\n\nTRUMP\n\nOh, really?\n\n45:52 WALLACE\n\nMr. President. It's an, it's an open discussion, please. You --\n\n45:55 TRUMP\n\nNo. It’s a fact.\n\n45:57 WALLACE\n\nWell, you’ve raised an issue. Let the vice president answer.\n\n45:59 BIDEN\n\nTotally discredit --\n\nTRUMP\n\n-- $183,000a month? With no experience and energy?\n\n46:07 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, let him answer.\n\n46:08 BIDEN\n\nMy son did nothing wrong --\n\n46:09 TRUMP\n\nYes, he did --\n\n46:10 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, let him answer.\n\n46:12 BIDEN\n\nHe doesn’t want to let me answer because he knows I have the truth. His position has been totally, thoroughly discredited --\n\n46:17 TRUMP\n\nBy who? The media.\n\n46:20 BIDEN\n\nBy everyone, well by the media, by our allies, by the World Bank, by eh- by everyone has discredited. Matter of fact.\n\n46:30 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, please stop.\n\n46:30 BIDEN\n\nMatter of fact, even the people who testified under oath.\n\n46:32 TRUMP\n\nSo let me ask you this --\n\n46:39\n\nHe testified under oath and his administration said, I did my job and I did very well.\n\n46:45 TRUMP\n\nI don’t know who they are --\n\n46:46 BIDEN\n\nWell I'll give you the list of the people who testified. Sir, you’ve already fired most of them because they did their jobs.\n\n46:53 TRUMP\n\nWell some people don’t --\n\n46:56 WALLACE\n\nWait a minute, you get the final word.\n\n46:57 BIDEN\n\nWell, it's hard to get any word with this clown, excuse me, this person.\n\n47:00 TRUMP\n\nLet me just say --\n\n47:02 WALLACE\n\nNo, no, Mr. President. Mr. President.\n\n47:06 BIDEN\n\nThat is simply not true.\n\n47:07 TRUMP\n\nWhy did he deserve three and a half million for Moscow?\n\n47:08 BIDEN\n\nLook, here's the deal. I want to talk about families and ethics. I don't want to do that. I mean his family we could talk about all night. His family --\n\n47:18 TRUMP\n\nMy family, my family lost a fortune coming down and helping us with government and\n\n47:23 WALLACE\n\nMr. President.\n\n47:24 TRUMP\n\nEvery single one of them lost --\n\n47:26 BIDEN\n\nThis is not about his family or my family. It’s about your family.\n\n47:30 TRUMP\n\nThree and a half million dollars.\n\n47:31 Biden\n\nThat's not true. It doesn't want to talk about what you need, you, the American people. It's about you. That's what we're talking about.\n\n47:41 WALLACE\n\nAlright, that's the end of this segment. We're moving on. Mr. President --\n\n47:47 TRUMP\n\nCan I be honest? It's very important to --\n\n47:49 BIDEN\n\nTry to be honest.\n\n47:50 WALLACE\n\nNo, the answer the question is no. No, I, sir.\n\n47:54 TRUMP\n\n-- with a billion dollars.\n\n47:56 BIDEN\n\nThat is absolutely not true --\n\n48:00 WALLACE\n\nGentleman I hate to raise my voice, but why should I be different than the two of you? So here's the deal, we have six segments. We have ended that segment, we're going to go to the next segment. In that segment, you each are gonna have two uninterrupted moments. In those two interrupted minutes, Mr. President, you can say anything you want. I can asked a question about race but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead. But we, I think that the country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruption. I'm appealing to you sir to do that.\n\n48:34 TRUMP\n\nWell, him too.\n\n48:36 WALLACE\n\nWell, frankly, you've been doing more interrupting-\n\n48:38 TRUMP\n\nWell that’s alright, but he does plenty.\n\n48:40 WALLACE\n\nWell, less than, sir less than you have. Let's please continue on. The issue of race. Vice President Biden you say that President Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president,\n\n49:05 TRUMP\n\nOh yeah sure.\n\n49:05 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump, you have often said that you believe you have done more for black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. My question for the two of you is why should voters trust you, rather than your opponent, to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years? Vice President Biden, you go first.\n\n49:26 BIDEN\n\nIt's about equity and equality. It’s about decency. It's about the Constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to quite require equity for everyone, equality for the whole America.\n\nBut we've never accomplished it, but we've never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got into the race was with most people. Close your eyes. Remember what those people look like coming out in the fields carrying torches. Their veins bulgy. Spewing, just spewing anti Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed and when they asked the president what he thought he said there were very fine people on both sides. No presidents ever said anything like that.\n\n50:09 WALLACE\n\nOne second, sir.\n\n50:10 BIDEN\n\nSecond point I'd make, is that when Floyd was killed -- when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military to use tear gas on em so he could walk across to a church and hold up a bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said he only, all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle to try to generate racist hatred, racist division. This is a man who in fact, he talks about helping African Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn't do something quickly by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man? This man is a savior of African Americans? This man cares at all? This man has done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what it did has been disastrous for the African American community. So --\n\n51:24 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump you have two minutes. Why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal with race?\n\n51:30 TRUMP\n\nHe did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators. African Americans are super predators. And they've never forgotten it. They've never forgotten it, Joe.\n\n51:40 WALLACE\n\nSir, it’s his two minutes.\n\n51:41 TRUMP\n\nSo you did that and they called you super predator. And I'm letting people out of jail now that -- You have treated the African American population, community -- You've treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 199 -- And that's why, if you look at the polls, I'm doing better than any Republican has done in a long time. Because they saw what you did. You called them super predators, and you've called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years you've called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 200-250 military leaders in total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida, I have Texas, I have, Ohio. I have every, excuse me. Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said ‘I support President Trump.’ I don't think you have any law enforcement. You can't even say the word law enforcement because if you say those words, you're gonna lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren't you saying those words, Joe? Why don't you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what, if they called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won't do it because they’re run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe. Because we believe in law and order but you don’t. The top 10 cities, and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats. Just radical left. And they've got you wrapped around their finger, Joe. To a point where you don't say anything about law and order. And I'll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you're afraid to even say it.\n\n53:30 WALLACE\n\nAlright, I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Brianna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question “Whether justice could be equally applied in America”. Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for blacks in this country?\n\n53:54 BIDEN\n\nYes, there is a systemic injustice in this country. In education, in the law enforcement and the way in which it’s enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent honor men and women that risk their lives every day to take care of us. But there are some bad apples and when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I'm going to do is president of the United States is call together, an entire group of people at the White House. Well, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to police chiefs, and we're going to work this out. We're going to work this out so we change the way in which we have more transparency. And when these things happen, these cops aren't happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren't happy to see what happened to Brown and Taylor. Most don't like it, but we have to have a system report, held accountable. When, and by the way, violence in response is never appropriate. Never appropriate. Peaceful protests is. Violence is never appropriate.\n\n55:00 TRUMP\n\nWhat is peaceful protest? When they run through the middle of town and burned down your stores and kill people all over the place?\n\n55:04 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, Mr. President. President Trump, I’d like to continue with this. I promise we're gonna get to the issue of law and order in a moment. Your administration directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, end with sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?\n\n55:37 TRUMP\n\nI ended it because it's racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it was a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it and so does everybody else. And he would know it.\n\n55:54 WALLACE\n\nWhat is radical -- What is radical about racial sensitivity training?\n\n55:59 TRUMP\n\nIf you were a certain person, you had no status in life, it's sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we would pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly very sick ideas. And really, they were teaching people to hate our country. And I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place, it's a racist place, and they were teaching people to hate our country. And I'm not gonna allow that to happen.\n\n56:31 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden?\n\n56:33 BIDEN\n\nNobody’s doing that. He's just, he’s racist. Here's the deal, I know a lot more --\n\n56:38 WALLACE\n\nLet him finish.\n\n56:40 BIDEN\n\nThe fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It's important that people know they don't want to, many people don't want to hurt other people's feelings. But it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of a sense of self esteem. It's a little bit like how this guy and his friends looked down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics like me who grew up in Scranton. They look down on people who don't have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They look down on people who are a different color. In fact, we're all Americans. The only way we're going to bring this country together is bring everybody. There's nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on and we can defeat racism.\n\n57:35 WALLACE\n\nVice President -- I mean, President Trump, sir.\n\n57:37 TRUMP\n\nDuring the Obama-Biden administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred, you look at Ferguson, you look at, you go to very many places. Look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened- Frankly, it was more violent than what I'm even seeing now,\n\n57:55 BIDEN\n\nOh my god, this is ridiculous.\n\n57:56 TRUMP\n\nBut the reason is that the Democrats that run these cities don’t want to talk, like you, about law and order.\n\n58:03 BIDEN\n\nViolent crime -- Violent crime --\n\n58:03 TRUMP\n\nYou still haven’t mentioned, are you in favor of law and order?\n\n58:04 BIDEN\n\nI'm in favor of law. You --\n\n58:07 TRUMP\n\nAre you in favor of law and order?\n\n58:13 BIDEN\n\nLaw and order with justice where people get treated fairly. And the fact of the matter is violent crime went down 17%, 15% percent in our administration. It’s gone up on his watch.\n\n58:24 TRUMP\n\nIt’s gone down much more.\n\n58:28 WALLACE\n\nAlright, alright. Mr. President -- Mr. President, you’re now gonna be very happy because we’re gonna talk about law and order.\n\n58:34 TRUMP\n\nThe places we had trouble with Democratic-run cities --\n\n58:39 WALLACE\n\nThat's exactly my question. There have been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer, particularly. And you often blame that on Democratic mayors and Democratic governors, but in fact there have been equivalent spikes in Republican-led cities, like Tulsa, and Fort Worth. So the question is, is this really a party issue?\n\n58:59 TRUMP\n\nI think it's a party issue. You could bring in a couple of examples, but if you look at Chicago, what's going on in Chicago where 53 people were shot and eight died. Shot. If you look at New York where it's going up like these never seen anything. The numbers are going up 100, 150, 200% crime. It is crazy what's going on, and he doesn't want to say law and order because he can't. Because he'll lose his radical left supporters, and once he does that it's over with. But if he ever got to run this country, and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have -- Our suburbs would be gone, our suburbs would be gone, and you would see problems like you’ve never-\n\n59:38: BIDEN\n\nHe wouldn’t know a suburb unless he took a wrong turn.\n\n59:39 TRUMP\n\nOh, I know suburbs.\n\n55:43 BIDEN\n\nI was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All of these dog whistles and racism don't work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There's many people today driving their kids to soccer practice, or to black and white and Hispanic in the same car, as there have been any time in the past. What really is the threat to the suburbs and their safety has to deal with COVID? They're dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment. They're being flooded. They're being burned out, because he has refusal to do anything. That's why the suburbs are in trouble.\n\n1:00:15 WALLACE\n\nI do want to talk about this issue of law and order, though. And in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders Task Force you talk about “reimagining policing”. First of all, what does re-imagining policing mean? And do you support- Let me finish the question. What does re-imagining policing mean? And do you support the Black Lives Matter call for for community control of policing?\n\n1:0046 BIDEN\n\nLook, what I support is the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face. And I'm not totally opposed to defending the police officers. Matter of fact, police, local police, they only want defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 911 call to have someone with him as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community police, like we had before, where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That's when crime went down. It didn’t go up, it went down. And so we have to be --\n\n1:01:25 TRUMP\n\nThat’s not what they're talking about, Chris. That’s not what they’re talking about. That’s about defunding the police.\n\n1:01:31 BIDEN\n\nThat is not true.\n\n1:01:35 TRUMP\n\nHe doesn't have any law - He has no law enforced -\n\n1:01:39 BIDEN\n\nThat is not true. That’s not --\n\n1:01:39 TRUMP\n\nOh really? Who do you have? Name one group that supports you. Name one group that came out and supported you, go ahead, like we have time.\n\n1:01:46 BIDEN\n\nWe don't have time to do anything --\n\n1:01:53 WALLACE\n\nGentleman, I’m gonna take back control. And I want to get to another subject, which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent. In Portland, Oregon, especially, we had more than 100 straight days of protests, which I think you would agree about peaceful protests. Many of those turned into riots. Mr. Vice President, you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have though is as the Democratic nominee, and earlier tonight you said that you are the Democratic Party right now. Have you ever called the Democratic mayor of Portland the Democratic governor of Oregon and said ‘Hey, you gotta stop this. Bring in the National Guard. Do whatever it takes. That you'd stop the days and months of violence in Portland?\n\n1:02:40 BIDEN\n\nI don't hold public office now. I am a former Vice President. I've made it clear, I've made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. Anyone who committed it --\n\n1:02:53 WALLACE\n\nBut you've never called for the people- Excuse me, sir. You’ve never called for the leaders in Portland, and in Oregon, to call in the national office and knock off 100 days of riots.\n\n1:03:05 BIDEN\n\nThey can, in fact, take care of it if he’d just stay out of the way. Look-\n\n1:03:11 TRUMP\n\nOh really? Oh really? -- The killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him. For three days Portland didn’t do anything.\n\n1:03:18 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump. President Trump. I interrupt- President Trump\n\n1:03:22 TRUMP\n\nI had to send the US Marshals to take care of business --\n\n1:03:24 WALLACE\n\nGo ahead, sir\n\n1:03:25 BIDEN\n\nAnd by the way, you know, his own former spokesperson said, you know, riots and chaos and violence help his cause. That's what this is all about.\n\n1:03:34 TRUMP\n\nI don’t know who said that.\n\n1:03:35 BIDEN\n\nI do.\n\n1:03:35 TRUMP\n\nWho?\n\n1:03:36 BIDEN\n\nI think it was Kellyanne Conway.\n\n1:03:37 TRUMP\n\nI don't think she said that.\n\n1:03:39 BIDEN\n\nShe said that. And so here's, here's the point. The point is that is that that's what he is keeps trying to rile everything up. He doesn't want to calm things down. Instead of going in and talking to people and say, ‘let's get everybody together, figuring out how to deal with this’, what he does he do? He just poured gasoline on the fire. Constantly, at every single solitary time.\n\n1:04:00 WALLACE\n\nAnd to end this, button up this segment, I’m going to give you a minute to answer, sir. You have repeatedly warned us-\n\n1:04:07 TRUMP\n\n-answer his stuff.\n\n1:04:08 WALLACE\n\nYou have- No, you've been talking-\n\n1:04:11 TRUMP\n\nHe made a statement- I would love to end it.\n\n1:04:12 WALLACE\n\nI’m asking you- You know, sir- You know, if you want to switch seats-\n\n1:04:17 TRUMP\n\nVery quickly, we could do that but if - the National Guard it would be over. There’d be no problem, but they don’t want to accept the national guard.\n\n1:04:23 WALLACE\n\nOkay, you have repeatedly criticized the Vice President for not specifically calling out antifa and other left-wing groups. But are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacists and militia groups? And to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities, as we saw in Kenosha, as we've seen in Portland? Are you prepared specifically to do that?\n\n1:04:46 TRUMP\n\nSure, I’m prepared to do it. I would say- I would say, almost everything I see is from the left-wing, not from the right wing-\n\n1:05:55 WALLACE\n\nSo what do you, what do you say-\n\n1:04:56 TRUMP\n\nI'm willing to do anything I want to see peace.\n\n1:04:57 WALLACE\n\nThen do it, sir.\n\n1:04:59 BIDEN\n\nSay it, do it, say it.\n\n1:05:00 TRUMP\n\nYou want to call them -- What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me --\n\n1:05:04 WALLACE\n\nWhite supremacists and, white supremacists and right-wing --\n\n1:05:07 BIDEN\n\nThe Proud Boys.\n\n1:05:07 TRUMP\n\nProud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem. This is a left-wing problem\n\n1:05:19 BIDEN\n\nHis own FBI director said -- white supremacists. Antifa is an idea not an organization. Militia --\n\n1:05:27 TRUMP\n\nOh you’ve got to be kidding me\n\n1:05:27 BIDEN\n\nHis FBI said --\n\n1:05:28 TRUMP\n\nWell then, you know what --\n\n1:05:29 WALLACE\n\nGentlemen, we’re done, sir. We’re going to go on to the next-\n\n1:05:39 BIDEN\n\nEverybody in your administration tells you the truth that that’s a bad to bad idea. You have no idea.\n\n1:05:43 TRUMP\n\nAntifa is a dangerous, radical group --\n\n1:05:46 WALLACE\n\nGentleman, we're now moving on to the Trump and Biden records.\n\n1:05:50 TRUMP\n\n-- they overthrow you\n\n1:05:51 WALLACE\n\nPresident, I'm gonna ask you a question. When the President seats a second term, it’s generally a referendum on his record. But Vice President Biden you'd like to quote your dad's sayings which is ‘Don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative’. And in this case, sir, you are the alternative. Looking at both of your records, I'm going to ask each of you, why should voters you, President over your opponent. In this segment, President Trump you'll go first. 10 minutes.\n\n1:06:19 TRUMP\n\nBecause there has never been an administration or president who has done more than I've done in a period of three and a half years, and that's despite the impeachment hoax. And you saw what happened today with Hillary Clinton where a whole big con job. But despite going through all these things, where at a fight both flanks, behind me and above, there has never been an administration, that's done what I've done. The greatest, before COVID came in, the greatest economy in history. Lowest unemployment numbers. Everything was good, everything was go -- And by the way, there was unity. People were calling me. For the first time in years they were calling, and they were saying ‘it's time maybe’. And then what happened? We got hit but now we're building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military including space force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA, which was a mess under him. 308,000 people died. They didn't have proper health care. He was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA. Our vets, we take care of our vets. But we've rebuilt our military. The job that we've done- And I'll tell you so some people say me the most important, by the end of the first term, I'll have approximately 300 federal judges, Court of Appeals judges 300. And hopefully, three great Supreme Court judges, justices. That is a record, the likes of which very few people- And you know one of the reasons I have so many judges? Because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill. When you leave office, you don't leave any judges. That's like, you just don't do that. They left 128 openings. And if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I'd say ‘if you left us 128 openings, you can't be a good president. You can't be a good Vice President’. But I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it'll probably be above that by the end of this term, 300 judges. It's a record.\n\n1:08:22 WALLACE\n\nLooking at both your records, why should voters elect you president, as opposed to President Trump -- You get two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n1:08:29 BIDEN\n\nUnder this president we become weaker, sicker. poorer, more dividing and more violent. When I was Vice President, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it, I did. We left a booming economy, and he caused the recession. With regard to be weaker, the fact is that I've gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we're not going to take any of his stuff. He's Putin’s puppy. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers.\n\n1:09:01 TRUMP\n\nYour son --\n\n1:09:02 WALLACE\n\nNo, no, no --\n\n1:09:03 BIDEN\n\nAnd by the way --\n\n1:09:04 WALLACE\n\nMr. President. Wait a minute. Mr. President, your campaign agreed that both sides would get two answers uninterrupted. Your side agreed to it. Why don't you observe what your campaign agreed to as a ground rule. Okay, sir?\n\n1:09:18 BIDEN\n\nNever keeps his word.\n\n1:09:19 WALLACE\n\nNo, I’m not asking. That was rhetorical question.\n\n1:09:23 BIDEN\n\nCan you go back 30 seconds?\n\n1:09:25 WALLACE\n\nYeah, yes you may. Go ahead.\n\n1:09:26 BIDEN\n\nSo, thirdly we’re poorer. The billionaires have gotten much, much more wealthy by a tune of over four three to $400 billion more, just since COVID. You in the home, you got less. You're in more trouble than you were before. In terms of being more violent, when we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. He's president of the United states. It’s on his watch. And with regard to more divided, the nation can't stay divided. We can't be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them be losers and being, and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got, he got the Bronze Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a patriot. And the people left behind there were heroes.\n\n1:10:23 TRUMP\n\nReally? You talking about Hunter? Are you talking about Hunter?\n\n1:10:23 BIDEN\n\nand I resent -- I’m talking about my son, Beau Biden. You’re talking about --\n\n1:10:30 TRUMP\n\nI don’t know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out, dishonorably discharged for cocaine use.\n\n1:10:37 BIDEN\n\nThat's not true, he wasn’t dishonorably discharged. None of that is true.\n\n1:10:39 TRUMP\n\n-- and he didn't have a job until you became vice president. Once you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places --\n\n1:10:48 BIDEN\n\nThat is simply not true.\n\n1:10:49 TRUMP\n\nHe made a fortune and he didn’t have a job.\n\n1:10:50 BIDEN\n\nMy son -- My son -- My son, like a lot of people, like a lot of people you know I had a drug problem. He's overtaken it. He's fixed it. He's worked on it. And I'm proud of him.\n\n1:11:02 TRUMP\n\nBut why was he given tens of millions of dollars?\n\n1:11:05 BIDEN\n\nHe wasn't given tens of millions of dollars\n\n1:11:08 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump you’ve --\n\n1:11:11 BIDEN\n\nAlready been discredited\n\n1:11:13 WALLACE\n\nWe've already been through this, I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects. Well, you know, as the moderator sir I'm going to make a judgement call there.\n\n1:11:20 TRUMP\n\n-- 3.5 million dollars. Let’s talk about Moscow --\n\n1:11:24 BIDEN\n\nThat is not true. That report is totally discredited.\n\n1:11:25 WALLACE\n\nGentlemen --\n\n1:11:27 BIDEN\n\nMitt Romney on that committee said it wasn't worth taxpayers money. That report was written for political reasons.\n\n1:11:33 WALLACE\n\nYou know, I'd like to talk about climate change.\n\n1:11:36 BIDEN\n\nSo would I --\n\n1:11:37 WALLACE\n\nOkay, the forest fires in the West, are raging now. They have burned millions of acres. They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. When state officials there blame the fires on climate change, Mr. President, you said, ‘I don't think the science knows.’ Over your four years, you have pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama environmental records. What do you believe about the science of climate change? And what will you do in the next four years to confront it?\n\n1:12:11 TRUMP\n\nI want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon, if you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I haven't destroyed our businesses, our businesses are put out of commission. If you look at the Paris accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about what's going on, because our businesses are doing well as far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management, in addition to everything else. The forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees, that a years old and they're like Tinder, and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette and then the whole forest burns. You've got to have forest management-\n\n1:12:52 WALLACE\n\nWhat do you, what do you believe about the science of climate change, sir?\n\n1:12:57 TRUMP\n\nI believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air, immaculate water and do whatever else we can that's good. You know we're planting a billion trees, the billion tree project, and it's very exciting.\n\n1:13:08 WALLACE\n\nDo you believe that human pollution, gashouse, greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of this planet?\n\n1:13:15 TRUMP\n\nI think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent yes. I think, to an extent, yes. But I also think we have to do better management of our forests. Every year, I get the call. ‘California is burning California's burning.’ If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn't be getting those calls. You know in Europe they live that, forest cities, they call forest cities. They maintain their forests. They manage their forests. I was with the head of a major country. It's a forest city. He said, ‘Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California, there shouldn't be that problem’. I spoke with the governor about it. I'm getting along very well with the governor, but he said you know at some point, he can't every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground. That's burning down because of a lack of management.\n\n1:14:07 WALLACE\n\nBut sir, if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan, which limited carbon emissions in power plants? Why have you relaxed --\n\n1:14:16 TRUMP\n\nBecause it was driving energy prices through the sky --\n\n1:14:22 WALLACE\n\nWhy have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars?\n\n1:14:27 TRUMP\n\nNot really, because what's happening is the car is much less expensive and it's a much safer car. And you're talking about a tiny difference. And then what would happen, because of the cost of the car, you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10-12 years old. If you did that the car would be safer, it would be much cheaper-\n\n1:14:48 WALLACE\n\nIn California, they simply ignored --\n\n1:14:51 TRUMP\n\nTake a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now, so, and by the way we're gonna see how that turns out, but a lot of people agree with, many people. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline. And I'm okay with electric cars too. I think I'm all for electric cars with big incentives or electric cars. But what they've done in California is just-\n\n1:15:17 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden I'd like you to respond to the President's climate change record, but I also want to ask you about a concern. You proposed $2 trillion in green jobs you talk about new limits, not abolishing, but new limits on fracking. Ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035. And zero, net emission of greenhouse gases by 2050. The president says, a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs.\n\n1:15:46 BIDEN\n\nHe's absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact, when -- During our administration Recovery Act I was able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than, or as cheap as coal, and gas, and oil. Nobody's going to build another coal fire plant in America. No one's going to build another oil fire in America. They're going to move to renewable energy, number one. Number two, we're going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that's run on their electric vehicles. Making sure that they can do that we're gonna put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we're going to be building in the future. We're going to build a economy, that in fact, is going to provide for the ability, us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized. In a way that, in fact, they'll, they'll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There’s so many things we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero in terms of energy production by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs. Creating millions of jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage. By having a new infrastructure that in fact is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris accord. I will join the Paris accord because with us out look what's happening. It's all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no no relationship with foreign policy. Brazil, the rainforest to Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More, more carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that's admitted the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with 20 billion dollars. And say, ‘Here's $20 billion. Stop, stop, tearing down the forest. And if you don't, then you're going to have significant economic consequences’.\n\n1:17:52 WALLACE\n\nWhat about the argument that President Trump basically says that you have to balance, environmental interests, and economic interests? And he's drawn a line\n\n1:18:02 BIDEN\n\nBut if he hadn't drawn a line. He still, for example, makes sure that we- He wants to make sure that methane is not a problem. We could, you could now emit more methane without it being a problem. Methane. This is a guy who says that we don't have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now. He says that, the fact that it's all true and here’s the deal --\n\n1:18:22 TRUMP\n\nHe’s talking about the Green New Deal. And it's not 2 billion or 20 billion as you said, it's $100 trillion.\n\n1:18:31 BIDEN\n\nI'm talking about -\n\n1:18:31 TRUMP\n\nYou wanna rip down buildings and rebuild the buildings -- where airplanes are out of business. Where there are two car systems or where they want to take out the cows.\n\n1:18:40 BIDEN\n\nThat’s not true. Not true. Not true. Not true.\n\n1:18:43 TRUMP\n\nThat's not true either, right? Now, this is a, this is a 100. That's more money than our country could make in a hundred years.\n\n1:18:50 BIDEN\n\nThat is simply not true.\n\n1:18:55 WALLACE\n\nLet me -- Let me -- Wait a minute, sir. I actually have studied your plan, and it includes upgrading 4 million buildings, weatherizing 2 million homes over four years, building one and a half million energy efficient homes. So the question becomes, the president said, I think some people who support the president would say, ‘That sounds like it's going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy.’\n\n1:19:18 BIDEN\n\nWhat it's gonna do, it’s gonna create thousands and millions of jobs. Good-paying jobs-\n\n1:19:22 WALLACE\n\nLet him finish, sir.\n\n1:19:23 BIDEN\n\nHe doesn’t know how to do that. The fact it’s going to create millions of good paying jobs. And these tax incentives to people to weatherize, where he wants to get her get rid of, is going to make the economy much safer. Look how much we're paying now to deal with the hurricanes, with a deal with- By the way he has an answer for hurricanes. He said, ‘Maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, they may' --\n\n1:19:44 TRUMP\n\nI never said that you made it up. You make up a lot.\n\n1:19:46 BIDEN\n\nAnd here's the deal, we are going to be in a position where we can create, hard, hard good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape. We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes rising seas. We're in real trouble. Look what's happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn't happen before. There because of global warming. We make up 15% of the world's problem. We in fact- But the rest of the world we got to get them to come along. That's why we have to get back into, back into the Paris accord.\n\n1:20:32 WALLACE\n\nAll right, gentlemen.\n\n1:20:33 TRUMP\n\nChris, so why didn't he do it for 47 years? You were vice president. Why didn't you get the world- China sends up real dirt into the air. Russia does. India does. They all do. We're supposed to be good. And by the way, he made a couple of statements, the Green New Deal is 100 trillion dollar plan --\n\n1:20:48 BIDEN\n\nThat is not my plan. The Green New Deal is not my plan.\n\n1:20:56 WALLACE\n\nGentlemen, gentleman --\n\n1:20:58 TRUMP\n\nYou said I said something about the military. He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. I never said it. What he did is he said- He called the military stupid bastards\n\n1:21:06 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice President, Mr. Vice President -- Please, stop.\n\n1:21:15 TRUMP\n\nI would never say that.\n\n1:21:18 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice President answer his question his final question.\n\n1:21:21 BIDEN\n\nThe final question is I can't remember which of all is real.\n\n1:21:24 WALLACE\n\nI’m having a little trouble myself. But about the economy, and about this question of what it's going to cost. The Green New Deal and the idea of what, what your environmental changes to --\n\n1:21:38 BIDEN\n\nThe Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. You're not going to build plants that in fact are great polluting plans.\n\n1:21:44 WALLACE\n\nDo you support the Green New Deal?\n\n1:21:46 BIDEN\n\nPardon me?\n\n1:21:47 WALLACE\n\nDo you support the Green New Deal?\n\n1:21:49 BIDEN\n\nNo, I don't support the Green New Deal.\n\n1:21:50 TRUMP\n\nOh you don't? Well that’s a big statement. You just lost the radical left.\n\n1:21:55 BIDEN\n\nI support the Biden plan that I put forward.\n\n1:21:59 WALLACE\n\nOK.\n\n1:22:00 BIDEN\n\nThe Biden Plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New Deal.\n\n1:22:02 WALLACE\n\nAll right, gentlemen, final segment. Election integrity. As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks, because it'll not only be the election day but also counting some ballots mailing ballots after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next President will be the legitimate winner of this election? In this final segment, Mr. Vice President, you go first.\n\n1:22:41 BIDEN\n\nPrepared to let people vote. You should go to Iwillvote.com. Decide how they're going to vote, when they're going to vote and what means by which they're going to vote. His own Homeland Security director, as well as the FBI director, says there's no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that they're going to be millions of people, because of COVID, that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots, like he does by the way. He sits behind the Resolute desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one. Number two, we're going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance, the polls are open on time and they'll pull stay open until the votes are counted. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he's trying to scare people into thinking that it's not gonna be legitimate. Show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote. Vote. Vote. If you're able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you're able to vote in person, vote in person. Vote whatever way is the best way for you because you will- He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. Whether or not when the votes are counted, and they're all counted, that will be accepted. If I win, that will be accepted.If I lose, it will be accepted. But, by the way, if, in fact, he says he's not sure what he's gonna accept, let me tell you something, it doesn't matter. Because if we get the votes, it’s going to be all over. He's going to go. He won’t stay in power. It won't happen. It won't happen. So vote. Just make sure you understand you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. Is it going to change or are we gonna get four more years of these lies?\n\n1:24:31 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, two minutes.\n\n1:24:32 TRUMP\n\nSo when I listened to Joe talking about a transition, there's been no transition from when I won. I won that election. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition. Because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started on the day I won and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with the First Lady, they were a disaster, a grace to our country. And we've caught them. We've caught them all. We've got it all on tape. We've caught them all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that because we caught you in a sense. And President Obama was sitting in the Oval office. He knew about it too so don't tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots is concerned, it's a disaster. A solicited ballot. Okay, so listen it is okay. You're soliciting, you're asking they send it back, you send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited, they're sending millions of ballots all over the country. There’s fraud. They found them in creeks. They found some with the name Trump, just happen to have the name Trump, just the other day. In wastepaper baskets. They’re being sent all over the place. They sent two, in a Democratic area they sent out 1000 ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you've never seen. The other thing, it's nice for November 3, you're watching and you see who won the election. And I think we're gonna do well because people are really happy with the job they've done. But you know what, we won't know, we might not know for months. Because these balances are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They're not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. An election can be won or lost with that. They’re losing 30 and 40%. A fraud, and it's a shame. And can you imagine where they say, ‘you have to have your ballot in by November 10’. November 10. That means 7 days after the election, in theory, should have been announced. We have major states with that. All run by Democrats. All run by Democrats. It’s a rigged election.\n\n1:26:40 WALLACE\n\nOkay, okay, sir. President Trump, you’re gonna be able to continue. You have been charging for months and mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster. You say it's going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, the last midterm election, 3, million people voted mail-in voting. That was a quarter, more than a quarter, of all the voters that year cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a justice Barrett, to settle on a disputes?\n\n1:27:17 TRUMP\n\nYeah, I think we're getting them to look at the ballots, differently. I don't think I want them in terms of the election itself, but for the ballots I'd say. Because what’s happening is incredible. I just heard, I read today where 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They, they take them ‘we don't like them. we don't like them’.\n\n1:27:36 WALLACE\n\nThere are millions of ballots going out right now.\n\n1:27:39 TRUMP\n\nYou do a solicited ballot.\n\n1:27:42 WALLACE\n\nNo, no, I'm asking you about the fact that millions of people --\n\n1:27:46 TRUMP\n\nYou go and vote. You go and vote, like they used to do. You either do a solicited ballot, where you're sending it in and sending it back in and your sending. We have mailmen with lots of a- Did you see what's going on, take a look at West Virginia, mail-in ballots. They're being sold. They're being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country. This is no -- This is not going to end well.\n\n1:28:12 BIDEN\n\nThere is no evidence of that. Five states have had mail-in ballots in the last decade or sol, including two republican states. And you don't have to solicit the ballot. It's sent to you, and sent to your home. All we're saying is, they're saying is, that there has to be a postmark, by the time by Election Day. If it just doesn't get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. He’s just afraid of counting the votes because-\n\n1:28:38 TRUMP\n\nYou’re wrong. You’re wrong\n\n1:28:41 WALLACE\n\nAnd I want to continue with you on this -- Vice President Biden --\n\n1:28:44 TRUMP\n\nChris, he’s so wrong when he makes a statement like that\n\n1:28:45 WALLACE\n\nExcuse me. Vice President Biden, the biggest problem, in fact, over the years, with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been that sizable number, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots, are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out or there is some other irregularity they just see through that deadline. So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a justice Barrett will settle any disputes?\n\n1:29:12 BIDEN\n\nI'm concerned that any court would settle this. Because here's the deal, when you, when you get a ballot and you fill it out, you're supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn't know, you have someone say that this is me. You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that’s you when the, before the ballot is thrown out, that's sufficient to be able to count the ballot, because someone made a mistake in not dotting the correct i. Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say to you ‘that is totally legitimate’\n\n1:29:46 WALLACE\n\nAlright --\n\n1:29:49 TRUMP\n\nWhen you have 80 million ballots sent in and swamping the system -- You know it can't be done, you know it can’t. And already there have been --\n\n1:29:56 WALLACE\n\nAlright, so wait a minute. Final question is, in eight states, election workers are prohibited, currently by law in eight states, from even beginning to process ballots, even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them, until Election Day. That means that it's likely, because there's going to be a huge increase in mail-in balloting, that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is. And it could be days, it could be weeks.\n\n1:30:25 TRUMP\n\nCould be months.\n\n1:30:28 WALLACE\n\n-- until we know who the new president is. So I first for you sir. Finally, for the, for the vice president. I hope neither of you will interrupt the other. Will you urge our supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest? Will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified? President Trump will go first.\n\n1:30:54 TRUMP\n\nI’m urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully because that's what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. As you know, today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went into watch, they were called poll watchers, a very safe very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren't allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia. Bad things. And I am urging, I am urging my people- I hope it's gonna be a fair election. If it's a fair election, I am 100% on board. But if I see 10s of thousands of ballots being manipulated. I can't go along with that.\n\n1:32:31 WALLACE\n\nDoes that mean you are gonna tell your people to take to the streets?\n\n1:32:32 TRUMP\n\nI’ll tell you what it means. It means you have a fraudulent election. You're not equipped to, these people aren't equipped to handle it, number one. Number two, they cheat. They cheat. Hey, they found balance in a wastepaper basket days ago and they all had the name, military fellas. They were military, they all had the name, Trump on them. You think that’s good?\n\n1:31:51 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden, final question for you. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted? And will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified?\n\n1:32:05 BIDEN\n\nYes. Here's the deal, they count the ballots, as you pointed out some of these ballots in some states can't even be open until Election Day. And if there's thousands of ballots, it’s gonna take time to do it. And by the way, our military. They've been voting, by ballots since the end of the Civil War in effect. And that's what's happened gonna happen. Why was it not, why is it for them to somehow not fraudulent? It's the same process. It's honest. No one has established at all, that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots. That somehow it's a fraudulent --\n\n1:32:41 TRUMP\n\nIt's already been established. Look at --\n\n1:32:45 WALLACE\n\nYou had an opportunity to respond. Go ahead.\n\n1:32:48 BIDEN\n\nHe has no idea what he's talking about. Here's the deal, the fact is, I will accept it and he will too. Because you know why? Because once the winner is declared, after all the, all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that'll be the end of it. That'll be the end of it. And if it's me, in fact, fine. And if it's not me, I'll support the outcome. And I'll be a president, not just for the Democrats. I'll be president for Democrats and Republicans. And this guy --\n\n1:33:16 TRUMP\n\nI want us to --\n\n1:33:21 WALLACE\n\nGentlemen? Will you say that’s the end of it? This is the end of this debate. We're going leave it there. To be continued in more debates as we move on. President Trump, Vice President Biden, it's been an interesting hour and a half. I want to thank you both for participating in the first of three debates that you have agreed to engage in. We want to thank Case Western Reserve University, and the Cleveland Clinic for hosting this event. The next debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, will be one week from tomorrow. October 7 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The two vice presidential nominees Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris will debate at 9pm Eastern that we hope you watch. Until then, thank you and good night.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/09/01/arizona-election-senate-audit-cyber-ninjas-maricopa-county/5673563001/", "title": "Arizona audit update: Latest on Biden-Trump election findings", "text": "Arizona Republic\n\nMonths ago, Arizona Senate President Karen Fann had hoped for a fairly quick review of election procedures to look for ways the voting system could be improved. The Arizona audit launched in April and originally was expected to last a month. Here's the latest on the long-running political spectacle.\n\nFollow coverage of the Arizona election audit by Republic reporters here.\n\n2 p.m. Saturday: A day after audit announcements, small group rallies in support of Jan. 6 insurrection\n\nSeveral dozen people gathered at the lawn of the Arizona state Capitol for the \"Justice for January 6\" rally Saturday. The event was a localized version of the sparsely-attended Washington, D.C., rally a week earlier, and similar events had been announced in other states.\n\nThe rally at the Arizona state Capitol started just after 2 p.m. with a prayer for those who are imprisoned.\n\nFederal prosecutors have charged hundreds of people with crimes during the Jan. 6 rally, in which insurgents smashed doors and windows at the U.S. Capitol, assaulted police officers, stole property from congressional offices and threatened to kill elected officials including then-Vice President Mike Pence. Five people died during and after the events. Rioters that day stormed the building in an attempt to disrupt the proceedings, presided over by Pence, which officially certified the election of President Joe Biden and the defeat of former President Donald Trump.\n\nThough the crowd at Arizona's capitol Saturday was small, a number of politicians spoke, including congressional candidate Jeff Zink, Arizona Rep. Walter Blackman and former state Rep. Anthony Kern.\n\nThe event also was attended by a group of self-described Proud Boys, a far-right group with a history of violent confrontations — and by a Phoenix man charged in the Jan. 6 raid who, as a condition of his release from jail, promised a federal court not to associate with Proud Boys.\n\nZink, who had previously told The Republic that he attended the Jan. 6 event, is a congressional candidate. He spoke about his son, who was arrested on charges related to being at the riot.\n\nZink said he condemns “everything about what happened with the destruction of the federal government building” but claimed that the violence was committed by Antifa members and has been mistakenly attributed to supporters of former President Donald Trump.\n\nHis son, Ryan Zink, had posted video online documenting his actions that day. In one, Ryan Zink stood in front of his camera phone, saying \"We knocked down the gates! We're storming the Capitol!\"\n\nRyan Zink, who lives in Texas, was later arrested and charged with several crimes related to the riot. In court records, prosecutors presented other online posts by Zink that they recovered, including one that said, \"Literally inside the capitol shots fired on the floor there is a fire and gas and flash bangs have been used multiple serious injuries reported.\" In another private message, Ryan Zink wrote, \"Broke down the doors, pushed Congress out of session I took two flash bangs I'm ok,\" and later, \"I'm afraid the time for rioting is over better clean those guns and invest in some level 4 armor.\"\n\nJeff Zink said Saturday that his son is one of many whose lives and livelihoods have been upended unfairly because of their association with the events of Jan. 6.\n\nAlso speaking to the crowd was Micajah Jackson, a Phoenix resident who was charged after the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nMicajah Jackson claimed that the “radical” U.S. government, which was under Trump at the time of the riot, used organizations including the FBI and Capitol and D.C. to “set up a coup against patriotic Americans like myself and hundreds of thousands of others that are still being persecuted.”\n\nJackson faces federal charges of knowingly entering or remaining in a restricted building or grounds and violent entry and disorderly conduct related to the riot. The federal criminal complaint against Jackson shows photographs of him walking outside the Capitol alongside members of the Proud Boys. He later told FBI agents he had traveled alone and acknowledged the Proud Boys had given him an orange armband to wear. The criminal complaint alleges Jackson walked next to a person who yelled through a bullhorn, \"Whose streets?\" The group responded by yelling, \"Our streets.\"\n\nAs part of his release conditions, Jackson agreed to \"not associate with the Proud Boys or any person the defendant knows to be associated with the Proud Boys.\"\n\nOf the few dozen people at the rally, one group included people in \"Proud Boys\" T-shirts, and other speakers noted the group's presence.\n\nOn Saturday, Jackson said at the small rally, \"We’re going to restore law and order in this country and bring God back in this nation and take back our local communities, our school boards, and put the America first agenda back in order.”\n\nKern, the Arizona politician, was photographed in multiple places outside the Capitol raid, but has repeatedly insisted he did not breach the building itself. On Saturday, he said, \"I was there on Jan. 6. Jan. 6 is a big lie. It was not an insurrection. It was not traitorous.\"\n\nKern, who later participated in the Arizona Senate's partisan ballot recount, even though his name appeared on the ballots he was supposed to be counting, has refused to turn over messages or records about his travel to the Jan. 6 event.\n\nHis attorney, responding to public records requests from The Arizona Republic, said Kern attended the rally as a private figure who had \"completed his active service as a public official at the time of the riots.\" In fact, though, Kern was still a member of the Legislature. He had run for re-election and lost, but the new Legislature was not sworn in until five days after the riot.\n\nCouy Griffin, a county commissioner from New Mexico and leader of a group called “Cowboys for Trump,” also came to the Arizona event. Griffin was at the Jan. 6 raid. Later, at a Jan. 14 meeting of the Otero County Board of Commissioners, he told the meeting he planned pack firearms to return to Washington for the inauguration.\n\nThough Griffin faces charges of unauthorized entry and disorderly conduct, on Saturday he said he had been at the Capitol to peacefully pray for the nation alongside thousands of others. Drawing cheers and applause from a few dozen people, he described Jan. 6 as “the most amazing day of my life.”\n\n6:30 p.m.: Ken Bennett: Audit wasn't a 'failure'\n\nSenate audit liaison and former Republican Secretary of State Ken Bennett outlined election laws and procedures that he said were not followed to the letter and suggested “constructive improvements.”\n\nAmong his concerns were 2,500 ballots without serial numbers and an incomplete chain of command from the county dating back to the election, he said. Whether those rise to violations of law, however, would be determined by the state attorney general.\n\nBennett, speaking through video conference, said that he was already hearing from disappointed voters who expected the audit would show a different result.\n\n“I have already started to hear from people saying that the audit failed because it didn’t prove that the election was overturned, or that there was a different result,” Bennett said, nearing the end of roughly 3½ hours of reports on the audit.\n\n“There was no predetermined outcome that if we didn’t find this or didn’t find that we have failed,” Bennett said.\n\nInstead, he said, the review was aimed at identifying the strengths and weaknesses in the election process.\n\nThe fact that the hand count closely matched the county’s tally, he said, should not be seen as something bad.\n\n“I don’t consider that a failure at all,” he said.\n\nBennett said that CEO Doug Logan and the Cyber Ninjas “have identified the most accurate hand counting process that’s ever been used in the country.” Bennett said that ran counter to the criticism from elections experts and some media personalities who mocked spinning ballots on rotating platforms.\n\nYet there is still work to do.\n\n\"Further investigation, with the cooperation of the county, hopefully, is necessary to determine whether ineligible voters were allowed to vote in the 2020 election,” Bennett said.\n\n— Stacey Barchenger, Richard Ruelas\n\n6:20 p.m.: Machine count confirms original Maricopa County vote tally\n\nA machine recount of ballots cast by Maricopa County voters in 2020 confirmed the county’s count was accurate.\n\nRandy Pullen said the review under his oversight “independently confirmed numbers that the county and Cyber Ninjas found in the ballot count.”\n\nPullen, the Senate audit’s spokesman and a former state GOP chairman, oversaw a 12-day machine recount in July using high-speed machines purchased by the Senate. The machine count tallied 121 votes fewer than the county's official results, which was “not surprising,” Pullen said.\n\nPullen said there were organizational issues with how batches of ballots were provided for his team’s review. Boxes would have six batches of ballots in them, when paperwork said they should have seven, Pullen said as one example.\n\nThe impact of those discrepancies? “If things were done more properly, this would be much easier, it could've been done faster,” he said.\n\nSenate President Karen Fann, R-Prescott, said Pullen was brought on board just in case there were discrepancies between what Maricopa County and Cyber Ninjas found in other ballot counts. To date, all those audits have disproven Trump’s claims of fraud.\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\n6:05 p.m.: Final report drops earlier reference to canvass effort\n\nA draft report of the state Senate’s audit report states that results from a grassroots voter-canvassing effort were used to enhance the report, but that text is omitted from the final report published today.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice warned that knocking on doors as part of the audit could be considered illegal voter intimidation.\n\nCyber Ninjas, the chief contractor hired by the Senate to conduct the audit, said in its original statement of work that canvassing was important to determine whether the election was fair. Senate President Karen Fann rejected the use of canvassing after the DOJ sent its warning, postponing the operation indefinitely.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Liz Harris, a Chandler real estate and unsuccessful legislative candidate in 2020, from leading a group of hundreds of volunteers into neighborhoods around the Valley to ask voters about their election experience.\n\nThe Arizona Republic was invited out for a canvassing session with the group last month, but didn’t observe any problems among the voters interviewed by canvassers. Harris published a report earlier this month that claimed the county election featured significant numbers of invalid voters voting, or valid voters whose votes weren’t counted. Harris refused to release any of the underlying data for the overall claims. Two specific examples of alleged voter problems she provided were debunked by Maricopa County officials and the news media.\n\nA leaked draft report by Cyber Ninjas states that Harris’ group chose on its own to do canvassing “to validate some of our results. We have integrated those results for the completeness of our report.”\n\nHowever, in an interview with news media members after the Senate’s presentation, Fann reiterated that she halted the plan for canvassing after the DOJ warning, and she disputed that any draft report talked of integrating the canvassing results. The final report did not have such language, she said, adding that “sometimes you get misinformation” in draft reports.\n\nThe final report posted on AZSenateRepublicans.com says nothing about integrating the canvassing results, instead stating that because of Fann’s decision, “Cyber Ninjas was not able to perform any canvassing as part of the audit.”\n\nFann said she doesn’t know Harris personally, but told her she would love to have the canvassing results turned over to the state Attorney General’s Office. She emphasized “there is nothing of Liz Harris’s in that report.”\n\nYet if the draft report text wasn’t purely fictional, did Cyber Ninjas at some point use canvassing results in its findings — and then “un-integrate” them?\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n5:50 p.m.: As cyber issues detailed, county pushes back\n\nMaricopa County officials indicated they were underwhelmed as the Arizona Senate hearing on the ballot review ended.\n\n“So it’s over then?” the county tweeted, sharing a post from a reporter about the hand-count results.\n\nCounty officials also quickly explained away many of the main “critical” findings in the report, including questions about the county’s voter rolls and election records.\n\nThey said that if Cyber Ninjas understood data analysis, it would have “performed standard processes to rule out situations that lead to faulty conclusions.”\n\n“Unfortunately, AZ Senators gave unvetted, unqualified, private companies with known biases a platform to share misguided theories and faulty assumptions about Maricopa County elections,” one tweet read.\n\nAs CyFir CEO Ben Cotton attempted to raise questions about the security of the county’s election management system and voting machines, the county reminded people that the tabulation equipment “did its job.”\n\n“Per Chairman (Jack Sellers’) earlier statement, ‘everything else is noise.’”\n\nCotton raised what he described as a host of security issues, including failing to update antivirus programs and failing to preserve security logs.\n\nCotton described tens of thousands of election-related files that were deleted. He said he didn’t know what happened to those deleted files and could not say whether they were archived or not.\n\nCyFIR LLC is a Virginia-based digital security company contracted to work with Cyber Ninjas on the Arizona Senate’s audit.\n\n“This may be part of a normal process,” Cotton said Friday, “but the timing of this become a bit suspect.”\n\nCotton said that it appeared an individual intentionally overwrote security logs. Cotton said he knew when these incidents happened and was able to use security footage to find images of people at computers.\n\n“We have captured screenshots of Maricopa County people at the keyboards during those time periods,” Cotton said.\n\nAfter that, there was applause from the gallery of spectators.\n\nCotton said that beyond the screenshots, his group had identified the employees by name.\n\n“We will not release those names,” he said, “because we understand what the scrutiny is and what the impacts will be to those individuals.”\n\nCotton asserted that at least five devices used in the election had been connected to the internet. He found evidence of online visits to websites, including that of Maricopa County and Microsoft, on a portion of hard drives that was “unallocated,” or hidden from typical use.\n\nMaricopa County officials countered Cotton’s claims. In a tweet on Friday, they said “Maricopa County strongly denies claims that … staff intentionally deleted data.”\n\nOfficials said that files were archived to make room on the county's election management system, not deleted. The Senate did not request the archived data, according to county spokesperson Megan Gilbertson.\n\n\"It had nothing to do with us deleting them,\" said Scott Jarrett, county elections director.\n\nAlthough Cotton claimed he didn't have the information he needed to fully assess the county's network, officials have said that the county provided everything that competent auditors would have needed.\n\nIn a settlement with the county, the Senate announced that the county satisfied its subpoenas.\n\nIn response to Cotton's claims that some county machines showed some internet connections, the county tweeted that these were not machines that are part of the county's air-gapped election management system.\n\nFor example, one of the machines was the server for the Recorder's Office website. The county tweeted: \"We shouldn't have to explain this.\"\n\n— Jen Fifield, Richard Ruelas, Robert Anglen\n\n4:30 p.m.: Brnovich said findings are under review\n\nArizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said Friday his office will review allegations of election fraud raised by Cyber Ninjas in its draft audit report of Maricopa County’s 2020 election results.\n\n“I will take all necessary actions that are supported by the evidence and where I have legal authority. Arizonans deserve to have their votes accurately counted and protected,” Brnovich said in a written statement.\n\nThe Arizona Senate hired Cyber Ninjas to lead a hand recount of all 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County last year. The company concluded that President Joe Biden won the election and former President Donald Trump lost by nearly the same margins the county reported before the audit began.\n\nBrnovich said the office’s Election Integrity Unit will “thoroughly review the Senate’s information and evidence,” adding that he could not comment on specific allegations.\n\nCopies of the draft audit report obtained and reviewed Thursday by The Arizona Republic recommended that “several specific findings of our audit be further reviewed by the Arizona Attorney General for a possible investigation.”\n\nAmong those are questions about mail-in ballots from voters who moved in and out of the state prior to registration deadlines and allegations that more ballots were returned than went out.\n\nMail-in votes from voters who moved within Maricopa County prior to the registration deadline.\n\nMail-in votes from voters who moved out of Arizona prior to registration deadline.\n\nMail-in votes from voters who moved within Arizona but out of Maricopa County prior to registration deadline.\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n4 p.m.: Cyber Ninjas CEO confirms Biden win, makes recommendations\n\nDoug Logan, CEO of Florida-based cybersecurity firm Cyber Ninjas, confirmed in the beginning of his presentation that President Joe Biden won in Maricopa County in the company’s hand recount of votes.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump lost votes and Biden gained votes in the hand count results, widening Biden’s victory.\n\nLogan led the months-long review of all 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County. That included a complete recount of the presidential and U.S. Senate votes, and an examination of the ballots that included examining many conspiracy theories.\n\nHe started by explaining there is more to come from Cyber Ninjas, even after Friday. Under a settlement agreement with the county, the Arizona Senate is able to ask questions about the county’s routers and network logs. This is intended to double-check that the county’s voting machines and election results were not connected to the internet.\n\nLogan outlined several areas where he thinks the state and counties can better secure their election data.\n\nIn the draft report that was leaked to the media on Thursday, Cyber Ninjas did not say that they found any internet connections based on their examination of voting machines and the network information it already had access to.\n\n— Jen Fifield\n\n3:45 p.m.: Virginia, Georgia Republicans on hand for report\n\nSeveral members of the national “Election Integrity Caucus” flew to Phoenix for Friday’s review of the state Senate’s election audit, hoping to gather information they’ll use for election reviews in their own states.\n\nArizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers, R-Flagstaff, was a founding member of the group and traveled to Virginia last month to push for an Arizona-style audit there. Rogers said at the time that the group reminded her of the Continental Congress. She told conservative media it would be used to start audits like Arizona’s in every state.\n\nVirginia state Sen. Amanda Chase, a Republican who traveled to Phoenix to see the ballot review this summer, said the group was in the Senate gallery on Friday to “hear for ourselves what the Arizona brave legislators are going to show us today.”\n\nShe said she didn’t want the information “filtered through the fake media.”\n\nThe group expects to put out a press release this week after getting a briefing from the group’s Arizona delegation. Even if the final report is similar to draft reports that show Biden still won, “there are concerns that are out there in Virginia,” she said.\n\n“We said that no matter what the results were, we can do better,” she said. “I’ve been committed to fully finding out what happened so it never happens again.”\n\nYG Nyghtstorm, a Republican candidate for Congress in Georgia, is also part of the group. He said that when a large number of voters don’t trust the system, “you owe it to the electorate to some kind of investigation.”\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n3:15 p.m.: Engineer questions ballot signatures\n\nA controversial engineer tied to election conspiracies opened the Arizona Senate’s audit hearing Friday by raising questions about a series of “anomalies” found in Maricopa County mail-in ballots.\n\nShiva Ayyadurai, or \"Dr. Shiva\" as he is known to far-right adherents, said his review of ballots found thousands of ballot envelopes with missing signatures, scribbles and even some duplicates that might have been counted in the county’s 2020 election.\n\nShiva, who said he has four degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said his company, EchoMail Inc., reviewed 1.9 million mail-in ballots “for signature presence detection.” He outlined 11 so-called anomalies that he said deserve further review and suggested the Senate undertake an even broader audit.\n\nThe Arizona Senate signed a $50,000 contract with Ayyadurai on Aug. 27 to review signatures on the envelopes on early ballots sent to the county.\n\nAyyadurai gained prominence in the early days of the pandemic for spreading misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines. He criticized Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, as a tool of the pharmaceutical industry intent on making vaccines mandatory.\n\nIn a YouTube video that racked up more than 6 million views in 2020, Ayyadurai accused Fauci of being a \"deep state\" operative and falsely claimed vitamin C could be used to treat COVID -19.\n\nHe ran two unsuccessful campaigns for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts and has announced his intent to run again in 2024. After the 2020 primary, he wrongly claimed on Twitter the state had illegally deleted 1 million ballot images from his race.\n\nShiva, in a 50-minute presentation, laid out his findings for the Senate, which he ended by asking a series of rhetorical questions for county elections officials and making recommendations to the Senate.\n\nThe county did not provide data to Shiva for his review.\n\nShiva stopped short of accusing the county of wrongdoing, and even said at one point, “I don’t want to accuse that.” He also noted that “there could be an explanation of this” in regard to at least one anomaly.\n\nAmong his findings:\n\nThe county received and might have counted duplicate ballots.\n\nHis company detected more signature scribbles than the county reported.\n\nSome ballots came from voters with matching addresses and signatures but different voter IDs.\n\nBlank signature boxes were stamped verified and approved.\n\nThe number of blank signatures “surged” by 25% after Nov. 4 and through Nov. 9.\n\nShiva said determining whether these issues indicated fraud or not would require a more thorough audit of signatures.\n\n“A full signature verification audit is absolutely necessary,” he said.\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n2:45 p.m.: Fann presents Brnovich with 'urgent issues'\n\nBefore the first audit report was presented, state Senate President Karen Fann, R-Prescott, sent Attorney General Attorney Mark Brnovich a letter outlining five \"urgent issues\" that she had identified from the contractors' work.\n\nHowever, it was unclear how some of those issues would qualify for an investigation into broken laws, as many of them appeared to suggest system improvements.\n\nFor example, she suggested the state should have a team of cybersecurity experts to ensure election materials are protected. She recommended better maintenance of the voter-registration rolls and protocols to ensure election materials be preserved in the interest of potential future audits and transparency.\n\nShe called the signature-verification process “imperfect” and said signatures should only be accepted if they closely match the voter signature on file with elections officials. That appeared to be one of the issues that the attorney general could look into, Fann suggested.\n\nFann said the Senate is already at work on legislation to ensure Arizona has “an unimpeachable election process.”\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n2:35 p.m.: Celebrity news, sort of\n\nAnd now for a celebrity news break.\n\nShiva Ayyadurai, known as Dr. Shiva, who testified Friday about ballot signature verification was married for three years to Fran Drescher, best known as TV’s \"The Nanny.\"\n\n“The first year was bliss, the second year was agony and ecstasy, and the third year was just agony,\" Drescher told New York magazine.\n\nThe couple divorced in 2016.\n\n— Richard Ruelas\n\n2:25 p.m.: Democratic organization hits GOP for election doubts\n\nThe Democratic Attorneys General Association sought Friday to cast blame for undermining public confidence in elections far past Arizona.\n\nThe DAGA called out 18 Republican attorneys general, including Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, for refusing to condemn or actively spreading disinformation about alleged 2020 election problems.\n\nIn a news release timed with the review of the state Senate’s election audit, the Washington D.C.-based group pointed out that former President Donald Trump is pressuring Brnovich to launch a criminal investigation into the audit report.\n\nBrnovich, who is running for U.S. Senate, has walked a fine line between patronizing election deniers and claiming he’s just interested in ensuring fair elections. He antagonized audit critics last month after issuing a decision that Maricopa County officials had to comply with a Senate subpoena to turn over routers and network logs allegedly needed for the audit.\n\nThe 18 Republican attorneys general in some cases “explicitly poured fuel on the fire by joining lawsuits calling the election results into question — leading to things like today’s dangerous Maricopa County ‘audit,’” said DAGA co-chairs Massachusetts AG Maura Healey and Nevada AG Aaron Ford in a joint statement. “Their actions undermine the fabric of our democracy and Constitution, and we call on them to stop them immediately.”\n\nAs the state’s top legal officers, Republican AGs shouldn’t “pander to a dangerous, far-right political agenda” as they’re doing, and should “call out” the audit as a “dangerous political stunt meant to further divide this country.”\n\nBrnovich announced Friday that he would review the audit report’s alleged finding of election problems.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n2:15 p.m.: County GOP officials call for Ward to resign\n\nMaricopa County Supervisors Clint Hickman and Bill Gates called on Arizona Republican Party Chairwoman Kelli Ward to resign after her support for the ballot review.\n\nHickman and Gates, both Republicans, said her baseless claims of a fraudulent election, along with GOP electoral losses during her tenure as chair and promotion of conspiracies is harming the Republican Party.\n\nIn 2020, former President Donald Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden and Democrats picked up a U.S. Senate seat in Arizona.\n\nA state GOP spokesperson did not immediately respond to The Arizona Republic’s request for comment.\n\nWard and the state Republican Party have spent months fundraising off the ballot review, but it appears those funds have not paid for the audit, Hickman and Gates said.\n\nThey said her continued push of a false narrative is harmful to the Republican Party and democracy more broadly.\n\nThey also urged Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, who serves as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, to join them in their calls. A spokesperson for Ducey did not immediately comment.\n\n“She's made videos, she's questioned our integrity, she’s asked if maybe we should be picked up by law enforcement, she’s questioned the machinery and Dominion,” Hickman said. “If it comes out that Biden won by even more, Kelli Ward needs to go. It is a track record of losing. She's only won one race (as a state senator), and that was in Mohave County many years ago.\n\n“She has had an issue with creating a track record of victory and she’s been using the party apparatus to fundraise for something that rips apart our democracy, and that’s what this grift is.”\n\nGates said Ward’s leadership is doing long-term harm to the party and could further divide Republicans heading into the 2022 midterm elections.\n\n“She’s not focused on winning elections — she never has been,” Gates said. “She’s focused on tearing down other Republicans. She spends so much time doing that and those around her. And so, it's time to turn the page.”\n\nHe said the release of the Senate’s election review findings is a good opportunity to do so.\n\n“She’s going to continue to relitigate November 2020 and that is a recipe for disaster,” he said.\n\nWard narrowly won re-election to retain her position as chair in January after a race that went to a runoff.\n\n— Yvonne Wingett Sanchez\n\n1:40 p.m.: Fann still claims troubling problems\n\nDuring her opening remarks, Arizona Senate President Karen Fann, R-Prescott, acknowledged that draft reports of the ballot review were mostly correct, but said the public has not focused on the many irregularities uncovered in the review by Cyber Ninjas.\n\nDraft reports leaked Thursday showed Cyber Ninjas effectively confirmed Maricopa County’s final tally showing President Joe Biden defeated former President Donald Trump in Maricopa County, as the county reported 10 months ago.\n\nThe final numbers for each candidate differed slightly, and the Florida company hired by the Arizona Senate emphasized it found troubling irregularities as it went through the 2.1 million ballots.\n\nFann called the alleged irregularities a key part of ensuring election integrity. Fann assailed Maricopa County officials for resisting the audit as she originally envisioned it, and said the report presents matters still demanding attention.\n\n“The interesting fact is truth is truth, numbers are numbers, and we’ve said that from Day One,” she said. “What you have not seen and you have not heard is about the statutes that were broken, how chain of custody was not followed, how we had a number of issues, which is why people questioned the ballots in the elections.”\n\nCounty officials have long said they wanted an audit from an accredited firm. Cyber Ninjas has never before conducted an election review.\n\nState Sen. Warren Petersen, R-Gilbert, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, lamented the lack of cooperation during his opening remarks.\n\n“It is unfortunate that this is an incomplete audit,” he said.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n1:30 p.m.: Presentation draws Senate spectators\n\nSeveral Arizona state senators showed up to hear the ballot review presentation in person in the Senate's main chamber.\n\nSeated at their desks were Republican Sens. Paul Boyer of Glendale, Vince Leach of Tucson, Kelly Townsend of Mesa, Wendy Rogers of Flagstaff, and Nancy Barto of Phoenix.\n\nFloor privileges were granted to former lawmakers Anthony Kern and David Livingston.\n\nU.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., took a seat against the Senate's west wall.\n\nKern briefly served as an audit volunteer before being disqualified since it is against protocol for politicians to be reviewing ballots on which they were listed.\n\nOther senators said they would stay home and watch the proceedings online.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n1:10 p.m.: White House downplays ballot review\n\nDuring her regular press briefing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki seemed to downplay the draft results of the months-long ballot review:\n\n\"It confirmed what we have known for some time, and that millions and millions of people in the country know,\" she said Friday during a White House briefing, shortly before the Arizona Senate proceedings kicked off.\n\nAsked if there’s anything the federal government could do to address calls from Republicans pushing for similar reviews in other states, she said: “I’ll have to check and see if there’s anything substantive that we would have the power to do.”\n\n—Yvonne Wingett Sanchez\n\n1 p.m.: Cyber Ninjas reports about to be made public\n\nThe long-awaited ballot review results from Cyber Ninjas, the Florida company hired by the Arizona state Senate, are about to be posted.\n\nAfter leaked draft reports showed President Joe Biden won Maricopa County by a slightly wider margin over former President Donald Trump on Thursday, the big question is whether those reports were accurate.\n\nFor his part, Trump indicated in a statement on Friday that the report found “significant and undeniable evidence of FRAUD!” The fraud, he wrote in another statement, is “many more times than the so-called margin of “victory.’”\n\nDemocrats and election experts have eyed the draft reports warily, noting that Cyber Ninjas has never conducted an election audit before and the Arizona ballot review has been riddled with problems.\n\nIf the leaked reports are correct, they suggest the Cyber Ninjas tally was little different than the county’s certified results.\n\nIncluding Jo Jorgensen, the Libertarian candidate, the draft numbers were about 600 votes different than the county’s official results.\n\nWith nearly 2.1 million votes cast, that suggests Cyber Ninjas disagreed with one vote out of every 3,700 ballots counted.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\nState Democratic leaders launched a blistering attack on the draft reports of the state Senate's partisan election audit before the expected release of an official report today.\n\nMaricopa County Supervisor Steve Gallardo, Senate Minority Leader Rebecca Rios and House Majority Leader Reginald Bolding, Jr., addressed reporters outside of county headquarters in Phoenix, pulling few punches as they criticized the process and demanded accountability from Republican leaders who support it.\n\nGallardo described the audit as \"nonsense\" and a \"circus\" that has \"undermined democracy\" and cost millions of taxpayer dollars. He wasn't sure what would be in the final report presented by the Senate today, but predicted it would be \"BS.\"\n\n\"The one thing we're going to get out of the review is this: Our elections were safe, secure, and accurate, and (former President) Donald Trump lost Arizona, period,\" Gallardo said. \"And there is nothing else we can do, and nothing else any of the election experts can do to change the minds of the folks who can't accept the fact that their candidate lost.\"\n\nThe conspiracy promoters pushed Senate President Karen Fann, R-Prescott, into a process she had \"no control whatsoever\" of, and that decisions were being made by Trump-supporting groups and people.\n\nRios and Bolding, both Phoenix Democrats, predicted that the audit and the \"embarrassing\" way it turned out would negatively affect Republicans in important elections in 2022, such as the challenge to U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and the race for governor.\n\n\"We need to change the actual people who are running for office and let them know that they are so far to the radical right that it is not consistent with what Arizonans are asking for,\" Bolding said.\n\nRios said Republican lawmakers will use the report to justify new legislation designed to \"suppress the vote\" of people of color, senior citizens and disabled people.\n\n\"At the end of the day, they lost, and they know without suppressing the vote ... that they're going to continue to lose elections,\" she said.\n\nGov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, signed two bills in this year's legislative session that Democrats saw as creating significant obstacles to voting in the state, including one that changes the rules of the former Permanent Early Voting List.\n\nBolding said Ducey and other Republicans who may not have supported the audit, but didn't condemn it, either, can no longer \"hide\" from voters and would have to choose whether they would continue to tolerate, or more, election-conspiracy rhetoric.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n11:30 a.m.: Sen. Mark Kelly weighs in\n\nSen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., reiterated his stance that Arizona conducts professional and fair elections ahead of the Senate's 1 p.m. release of the ballot review findings.\n\nThe review of 2.1 million ballots in Maricopa County focused on both the presidential race and the 2020 U.S. Senate contest, where Kelly unseated Republican Sen. Martha McSally.\n\n“In the nearly ten months since this election was certified by Republicans and Democrats, I have been focused on doing my job — helping Arizona beat COVID-19 and rebuild our economy,\" a statement from Kelly to The Arizona Republic said. \"Our state does elections well. These baseless conspiracies should not be used to justify any further attempts to undermine our democracy.”\n\n— Yvonne Wingett Sanchez\n\n11:05 a.m.: 'Fed up' Patriot Party supporters rally at Capitol\n\nHundreds of people went to the state Capitol for a rally that organizers said was in support of medical freedom and election integrity hours before results from the audit by Cyber Ninjas was set to be presented to the Senate.\n\nThe Capitol area was a sea of American flags and signs condemning COVID-19 vaccine mandates. Booths were set up to sell shirts and hats, and to sign attendees up for the Patriot Party of Arizona.\n\nA speaker just after 10 a.m. asked attendees to put pressure on Gov. Doug Ducey to call a special session to address vaccine mandates, saying that people are “fed up.”\n\nSen. Kelly Townsend addressed the crowd and asked veterans and parents of a “vaccine-injured child” to stand with her, adding that she is both.\n\nTownsend described President Joe Biden’s administration as “fascist,” saying that she and others in attendance would not comply with vaccine mandates.\n\nSteve Daniels, chair of the Patriot Party of Arizona, said that legislators and candidates who spoke at the rally were asked to sign a pledge to support his group beforehand.\n\nA dustup happened after Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake entered the stage without having signed the pledge.\n\nDaniels showed her the contract as she took the stage and she declined to sign it, saying it would be “irresponsible” to sign it before reading it in its entirety.\n\nAfter some in the crowd continued heckling Lake, an organizer took the microphone and asked for them to allow Lake to finish.\n\n“I’m not afraid of bullies, guys,” Lake told the crowd.\n\nBefore appearing to cut her speech short, Lake expressed confidence that the results of the audit would show fraud. She said as governor she would “prosecute everyone involved” and push back against vaccine mandates.\n\n— BrieAnna J. Frank\n\n10:00 a.m.: Sen. Kyrsten Sinema weighs in\n\nU.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., weighed in on the draft results of the GOP Senate-ordered review of Maricopa County ballots, saying the 2020 election \"was a success\" and a \"demonstration of the will of Arizona voters.\"\n\nIn a written statement to The Arizona Republic ahead of the Senate's official release of the ballot review results, she thanked state and local election officials for their work. She noted the exercise could result in an erosion of public trust in the nation's election systems.\n\n\"It has been deeply troubling to see state leaders wasting time and taxpayer money sowing doubt about the election when no credible evidence of irregularities exists,\" her statement said. \".... The Arizona election produced bipartisan results, in which members of both parties won races — and these results have been confirmed by stakeholders across the political spectrum.\"\n\nEight challenges contesting the state's election results were heard by both federal and state courts, she noted. All were either dismissed or withdrawn.\n\n\"Those of us who are trusted with elected office are, first and foremost, public servants. We serve our constituents — we do not seek to substitute our personal ambitions for the will of the American people,\" she said.\n\n— Yvonne Wingett Sanchez\n\n9:30 a.m.: Congressional panel wants Cyber Ninjas CEO to testify\n\nA congressional committee that has for months been seeking information relating to the company conducting Arizona's long-running ballot review now wants the firm's CEO to testify next month about the matter.\n\nCiting his repeated \"obstruction,\" the U.S. House Oversight and Reform Committee sent a letter late Thursday to Doug Logan, the head of Cyber Ninjas, saying his appearance has become necessary to understand what it characterized as a \"questionable audit.\"\n\nThe Democrat-controlled panel's request came a day ahead of the scheduled release of his company's review for the Arizona Senate and signals the national concerns among Democrats over its implications. The committee wants him to testify at an Oct. 7 hearing.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n8:35 a.m., Sept. 24: What to expect as election audit results are presented\n\nIn a contentious battle between the Arizona Senate and Maricopa County supervisors earlier this year, the Senate prevailed in gaining access to the county's ballots and election materials.\n\nThe Senate's audit contractors recounted the 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County in the presidential and U.S. Senate races and examined each ballot. They also examined all ballot tabulating machines and reviewed signatures on mail-in ballot envelopes.\n\nFour reports are expected to be presented beginning at 1 p.m. Friday by contractors and Senate representatives. Senate President Karen Fann, R-Prescott, and Judiciary Chairman Warren Petersen, R-Gilbert, will preside over the event.\n\nDoug Logan, CEO of Cyber Ninjas, will present results on the hand count and examination of ballots.\n\nAudit spokesperson Randy Pullen will present results from a separate machine count of ballots.\n\nConspiracy theorist Shiva Ayyadurai will present results from a review of envelope signatures.\n\nSenate liaison Ken Bennett will report his observations on whether election law was followed.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n12 p.m., Sept. 23: GOP gubernatorial candidate wants statewide audit\n\nFormer Republican U.S. Rep. Matt Salmon — who is seeking the GOP nomination for Arizona governor — called for an election audit and canvass to expand across the state on Thursday, one day before Senate leaders overseeing the audit in Maricopa County are scheduled to make the results public.\n\nThough he has not seen the results of the election review, Salmon also used the impending announcement to pledge that if he is elected governor, he would “not sign any other bills, including the state budget, until additional, enhanced election protections” like requiring identification for all forms of voting are in place.\n\nSalmon — who declined to say who won the presidential race in Arizona when asked by The Arizona Republic — said he believes there were “serious discrepancies” in the election. Those call for a statewide audit, he said, to “identify and address the problems taking place in Arizona’s elections.”\n\nWhile Maricopa County’s votes helped hand the state’s electoral votes to Joe Biden by a small margin, Trump won 10 of Arizona's 15 counties, often by massive margins.\n\nPolling shows a majority of Arizona Republicans believe there was fraud in the election, making so-called “election integrity” an easy issue for Republican candidates like Salmon to support ahead of the August 2022 primary election.\n\nIn a Thursday podcast interview with former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, which was also recorded on video, Salmon told Bannon that “if we’re going to try to contest this election, we know it’s probably going to end up in the courts at some point and time and we need a lot more forensic evidence.” Salmon’s campaign did not immediately respond to a question about what new legal claims could be made.\n\nThe election result has been certified by Gov. Doug Ducey — also a Republican — and multiple court challenges were tossed out by Arizona courts.\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\n2:30 p.m., Sept. 22: Are plans for a 'nullification committee' afoot?\n\nA recent Phoenix meeting of the John Birch Society, which once was a group on the far fringes of the political right, turned into a shouting match over the election review and other issues.\n\nA video of the confrontation posted on Facebook by Daniel McCarthy, who has unsuccessfully run for office in Arizona, might be most notable for showing the elected officials and others who attended the meeting and what some of them had to say.\n\nOne state representative says during the raucous 12-minute video that he is working on a “nullification committee\" for elections laws while another says she is working to eliminate voting machines.\n\nBut before that, there were plenty of fireworks with McCarthy criticizing the election audit.\n\nThe video, which appears to be filmed by an associate of McCarthy, begins with him shouting at Senate audit liaison Ken Bennett as Bennett leaves the room. McCarthy asks if Bennett will provide the two dozen or so people there with an update.\n\nBennett says he has to leave for a meeting to receive a preliminary update on the audit, but McCarthy launches into an outburst that interrupts the meeting despite multiple participants asking him to be quiet.\n\n“A lot of power brokers in the state are here. A lot of people are quite curious about this grift that’s been running,” McCarthy says to Bennett. “Let’s have a conversation on what we can do to install some confidence rather than running a massive grift with an audit where you guys are raising a ton of money and the Republican Party is raising a ton of money, and there’s a bunch of shenanigans.”\n\nThe meeting appears to be in a private room at a restaurant. Bennett leaves after the brief exchange with McCarthy.\n\nMcCarthy asserts that the election was stolen from Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers in Arizona didn’t do enough to prevent the fraud. There has been no evidence of fraud in Arizona’s election, and multiple lawsuits over the matter were dismissed for lack of evidence.\n\nCorporation Commissioner Jim O’Connor takes little interest as he finishes his meal while the men shout across the room.\n\nMesa Republican Verl Farnsworth tries to quiet McCarthy, telling him his outburst is not on the agenda. The two exchange words.\n\nThe video then shows another Arizona Corporation Commissioner, Justin Olson, get up from his meal and leave.\n\nMcCarthy begins railing against COVID-19 vaccines and people who wear masks.\n\nGen. Michael McGuire is there, and McCarthy criticizes him for wearing a mask during an appearance with Gov. Doug Ducey. McGuire retired as director of the Arizona National Guard to run for the U.S. Senate. He keeps his back to McCarthy and doesn’t speak to him.\n\nRep. John Fillmore, R-Apache Junction, tells McCarthy the Legislature is working on a “nullification committee.”\n\nHe didn't explain what he meant by that at the meeting. Reached Thursday, Fillmore said the committee's duty would be to determine which federal laws were acceptable to the state, including election laws.\n\n\"With H.R. 1 where the federal government is trying to have some extreme overreach and take control of elections, there might be some reason there that states might want to nullify that position,\" Fillmore said.\n\nH.R. 1 passed the House in Congress but not the Senate. The law addresses voter access, election integrity and security, campaign finance, and ethics.\n\nIn the video, McCarthy then singles out Rep. Jacqueline Parker, R-Mesa, who explains that lawmakers have made vaccine mandates illegal and are working on election issues.\n\nParker says lawmakers are trying to eliminate the use of machines in voting.\n\n“We are working on that,” she says when asked specifically about machine voting. “Yes, we are trying to get rid of the machines.”\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\n5:45 p.m., Sept. 17: Details about audit report presentation are released\n\nAt the Sept. 24 roll out of the results of the review of Maricopa County's 2020 election, three men will present the results of their work.\n\nCyber Ninjas CEO Doug Logan will present the findings of the hand count done of the county's 2.1 million ballots — both how the votes added up for the presidential and U.S. Senate candidates and the number of ballots.\n\nAudit spokesman/fundraiser Randy Pullen will discuss the results of the machine count of ballots. Senate President Karen Fann ordered the count after she learned that the Ninjas' hand count of the number of ballots didn't match the official result.\n\nFann, R-Prescott, said the count would serve as a \"check\" on the Ninjas' work. The tally was done on high-speed paper counting machines that cost the Senate about $30,000. Pullen said his presentation would not take much time.\n\nChecking in via Zoom will be Shiva Ayyadura, whose firm, EchoMail, did a review of the signatures on mail-in ballot envelopes. \"Dr. Shiva\" as he is known to his followers, has subscribed to election conspiracies that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nAyyadura was hired by the Senate for the signature review on a $50,000 contract. He also was a subcontractor for the Cyber Ninjas, hired to review digital images of all 2.1 million ballots.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n4:35 p.m., Sept. 16: Election official seeks inquiry after voter data posted online\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer is asking Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich to investigate after voter registration records were posted online.\n\nVoter registration records known as the “voter file” are available to the public, but it's a felony to publish the information on the internet. The voter file includes the name, address and party affiliation of registered voters, along with some phone numbers. It shows whether the person has voted in recent elections but not the candidates and issues they supported.\n\n“It appears that in this case, information from a public records request may have been posted in violation of state law,” Richer said in a statement Thursday. \"I trust the Attorney General will look into this and take any necessary action.”\n\nRicher did not name the group responsible for the alleged violation, but an expansive list of voters remained accessible Thursday afternoon on a website posting podcasts, articles and other materials in support of the Republican Party.\n\nRicher and Brnovich are both Republicans.\n\n— Associated Press\n\n4:15 p.m., Sept. 16: Audit volunteers celebrate — just don't call it that\n\nState Sen. Wendy Rogers, R-Flagstaff, posted pictures on Twitter of a gathering for audit volunteers that apparently took place Wednesday evening at the American Way Market in Chandler, and Cyber Ninjas CEO Doug Logan was in attendance.\n\nLogan's smiling face was captured among Rogers' photos just hours after his lawyer told the Arizona Court of Appeals there was no way Cyber Ninjas could comply with a court order to produce emails, texts and other communications from the audit by Friday. Logan was just too busy, his lawyer said.\n\nLogan and his company on Aug. 25 were ordered by a court to preserve all such records in the event their legal battle to keep them secret was snuffed out by the courts, which is what happened this week when the Arizona Supreme Court declined to take up their appeal. It was the fifth court loss for the Senate in its attempts to withhold the documents.\n\nLogan's lawyer told the court that Cyber Ninjas probably needed 30 days to produce the records, partly because the company still was working on the audit report.\n\nWhen The Arizona Republic noted on Twitter that Logan was seen celebrating the audit that has yet to release results, Senate President Karen Fann took exception. She texted a reporter, writing that \"it was not a celebration party.\"\n\nFann, R-Prescott, was also photographed at the event.\n\nShe said it was planned to thank those who volunteered as observers at the audit. She didn't directly answer when asked whether the observers sent to the audit by the Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs were invited, but it seems unlikely.\n\nSo the \"event\" for \"thanking the people that worked on the audit,\" in Fann's words (which Rogers described as a \"reunion\"), was not a \"celebration.\" Noted.\n\nMeanwhile, a Maricopa County Superior Court judge asked Fann's lawyer in court Thursday when the final audit report would come out, and after a direct question from the judge, the lawyer said Sept. 24. Not long after he made that disclosure, television personality Christina Bobb from One America News posted on Twitter that the report would come out that day, as did Rogers.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\n3 p.m., Sept. 15: Maricopa County still mulling over subpoena request\n\nMaricopa County's Board of Supervisors has met three times in closed-door sessions trying to decide whether to further comply with Arizona Senate Republicans' election-related subpoenas that include a demand to access county routers.\n\nA county spokesperson said no action was expected Wednesday after the third closed-door meeting executive session.\n\nA lot is on the line. Attorney General Mark Brnovich told the supervisors last month they were breaking the law by not fully responding to the subpoenas. He is threatening to withhold state funding if the supervisors don’t comply by Sept. 27.\n\nThe state funding in jeopardy accounts for 42% of the county’s operating budget, affecting public safety, public health, courts, elections and all other county operations.\n\nSupervisors and other county leaders have been mum on what they might do, but a county spokesperson said last week the options include responding further, trying to negotiate with the senators or filing a lawsuit.\n\nThe county has given the Senate nearly everything asked for under the subpoenas, including the ballots and voting machines that launched the audit, but not the county’s routers.\n\nCounty officials have said it would be a security risk to hand over the routers. They also say the Senate’s contractors don’t need them — they already gave them the network logs, voting machines and other materials that would allow the contractors to ensure the voting system wasn’t connected to the internet during the November general election.\n\nThe county’s election system and voting machines don’t use routers to transmit election results, and an independent audit in February found that no internet connections occurred during the election.\n\n— Jen Fifield\n\nNoon, Sept. 15: Too busy to provide proof of voting irregularities?\n\nAfter former President Donald Trump's defeat in November, Matt Braynard, a former campaign staffer of Trump's, got national attention for the claims he made about voting problems in several states, including Arizona. His findings were mentioned recently in a controversial report by Liz Harris on voter canvassing in metro Phoenix.\n\nBut anyone looking for evidence that backs up Braynard's claims will have to wait.\n\nAs he told The Arizona Republic, he's busy until Sept. 18, the day he’ll lead the “Justice for J6” rally in Washington D.C. in support of more than 570 people who face federal charges for participating in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n“I'm in the political business and that means I can't drop everything I'm doing right now to satisfy some local reporter's questions,” said Braynard, the founder and executive director of Look Ahead America, a Trump-supporting voter outreach organization, in a Sept. 11 message to The Arizona Republic via social media. “I will let you know when I am free to address that stuff but I don't have any time right now.”\n\nHarris' report states that Braynard phone-surveyed Republican voters who didn't have a record of voting and allegedly found that half said they did actually vote. That finding, however, didn’t come with any data to back it up. And if Braynard has released such data, he’s not releasing it now.\n\nBraynard claimed in direct message that he “did release it but finding that out would require journalism.” He subsequently cut off communication.\n\nLaw enforcement officials expect about 700 people to show up for the D.C. rally this Saturday.\n\nIn December, Braynard’s supposed findings in Georgia were debunked in a virtual hearing with lawmakers when Democratic state Rep. Bee Nguyen explained how she’d checked on his multiple examples of claimed voter fraud and found them to be erroneous.\n\nHarris hasn’t yet released any voter data that could be used to verify the claimed canvassing results of her operation, either, and the only two specific examples she gave of problems withered under basic scrutiny.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n5:30 p.m., Sept. 14: Talk of Pima County canvassing raises questions\n\nState Rep. Mark Finchem, R-Oro Valley, recently told podcast host and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon that he’s \"talking to the Pima County GOP\" about canvassing voters there.\n\nIf so, that's news to the leader of the Pima County Republican Party.\n\nFinchem, who Monday received Trump’s endorsement in his campaign for Arizona secretary of state, made the remarks Sept. 10 following the release of a canvassing report by Liz Harris, a Chandler real estate agent, that relied on dubious statistics and unverifiable statements to advance the conspiracy theory of widespread election fraud.\n\nShelley Kais, chair of the Pima County Republican Party, said she’s not aware of any canvassing operation and nobody in the organization had discussed it, as far as she knows.\n\nSince December, Harris has led a team of election deniers into Valley neighborhoods to knock on doors and ask voters questions in what the U.S. Department of Justice has warned could be acts of voter intimidation.\n\nWhile the DOJ warning led the state Senate to cancel canvassing plans as part of the audit of Maricopa County votes, Harris has carried out the plan that Cyber Ninjas, the lead contractor for the audit, previously said was an “important” part of its scope of work.\n\nNow, Finchem, who was outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 and who calls himself the “vanguard” of voter integrity, claims he’s in discussions to launch a door-knocking operation in Pima County with “evidence that Dr. Shiva’s worked on.”\n\n“We hope to release that next week,” he told Bannon on Sept. 10. “It’s big.”\n\nFinchem had mentioned during a separate Aug. 24 interview with Bannon that “we’ve been conducting” an investigation into alleged problems with voting in Pima County. He didn’t return a message Tuesday inquiring about his statements.\n\nPresumably, in the Sept. 10 podcast, Finchem was talking about Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai, who helped give a presentation to Arizona lawmakers on Nov. 30 with Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, about supposed flaws in the election.\n\nAudit spokesperson and former Arizona GOP Chair Randy Pullen told The Arizona Republic last week that Finchem “hooked us up” with Ayyadurai. The Senate signed a contract with Ayyadurai in August to review signatures on the envelopes of 1.9 million early ballots sent to the county.\n\nThe Pima County Recorder’s Office didn’t return messages on Tuesday, and it’s unclear who, if anyone, has contracted Ayyadurai to investigate the 2020 election in Pima County.\n\nAsked if she thought widespread voting problems had occurred in Pima County in 2020, Kais said she “didn’t know enough about the process” to answer. Still, “irregularities” in the election are a “really huge issue,” she said. “We need to get to the bottom of it.”\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n5 p.m., Sept. 14: Supreme Court rejects appeal on Cyber Ninjas' records\n\nThe Arizona Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected the state Senate's bid to keep records from Cyber Ninjas and other contractors working on the election audit out of public view.\n\nAfter the decision was announced, Senate President Karen Fann, R-Prescott, said she was preparing to comply with an order from a lower court to release the documents.\n\nThe Senate had refused to turn over records from the audit that are in the possession of its contractor, Cyber Ninjas, and other subcontractors, even after two Maricopa County Superior Court judges in separate cases and the Appeals Court all ruled they are public documents.\n\nAfter the Appeals Court's ruling, the Senate asked the Supreme Court to weigh in. The justices discussed the matter in a private conference Tuesday and decided not to take it up.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\n11 a.m., Sept. 13: Report makes big claims about voters, offers no proof\n\nElection conspiracy theorists hailed the arrival of a report on a voter-canvassing effort trying to help the Arizona Senate's audit of the 2020 election.\n\nBut the report failed to include any way to verify its dubious findings, and the only two specific examples it provided of alleged ballot problems were swiftly debunked.\n\nThe woman behind the canvassing effort, Liz Harris, refused to release data by which her claims in the Sept. 8 report could be checked. The new report also claims that the canvass team \"can make sworn affidavits supporting these findings readily available,\" but Harris refused to release those, either, or comment about the report to The Arizona Republic.\n\nThe Maricopa County Recorder's and Assessor's offices ripped the report in a joint statement Friday, but noted that officials would investigate the findings — if they could.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n9 a.m., Sept. 13: GOP state senator targeted with threat\n\nA Republican state senator who has criticized the ongoing review of the 2020 election was threatened in an email sent the same day prominent conspiracy theorist Seth Keshel urged his followers to contact her.\n\nThe Sept. 9 email to Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, R-Scottsdale, begins with a racial slur.\n\nIt goes on to say, \"You have one chance to give the American people the Audit report or were coming for you, we know where you live, we know where you get groceries, and we know where your family lives. You better do the right thing or your [sic] going to feel the consequences. You Understand? We the people are no longer willing to play.\"\n\nIt's only the latest threat against an Arizona public official since Trump lost the November election here, sparking a backlash by supporters across the country who demanded a review of the results.\n\nThe Department of Public Safety's threat mitigation unit is reviewing the email, a department spokesperson said.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n10 a.m., Sept. 10: Many documents released by Senate inconsequential to audit\n\nThe Arizona Senate turned over thousands of mundane and inconsequential emails in response to a court order making records from its election audit public.\n\nAt the same time, it withheld texts, emails and memos between lawmakers and others, including Cyber Ninjas, the company contracted to lead the audit. The Senate provided a 269-page report listing specific documents it chose not to release because of what it called legislative privilege, attorney-client privilege or other privilege.\n\nThese documents could be critical to understanding what was behind the recount of 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County during the 2020 election.\n\nAmong the records released were thousands of copies of a subscription journal sent daily to legislators, chain emails from constituents, texts from media members and conspiracy-laden screeds from around the world.\n\nThe records were released on Aug. 31 in response to lawsuits filed by the Arizona Republic and a nonprofit watchdog group called American Oversight. A team of six Arizona Republic reporters spent several days going through each of the 22,000 documents.\n\nSeveral thousand records were copies of The Yellow Sheet, a subscription-only political tip sheet published by the Arizona News Service, along with emails from legislative staffers confirming it had been sent.\n\nEmails were almost exclusively in support of the Senate’s actions; out of a batch of 10,000 documents, a reporter found only two or three emails asking lawmakers to call it off.\n\nLawmakers were flooded with emails demanding they hire Jovan Hutton Pulitzer and other conspiracy theorists to do the audit. The requests came not only from across Arizona but also from states from Massachusetts to Oklahoma. Concerned citizens in Poland and Australia added their pleas to the chorus of emails, many of which had a form-letter feel.\n\nThe people behind these emails expressed confidence in the statements of conspiracy-minded data crunchers and appeared to have a blind hatred for local election officials. Many legislators seemed to pander to the writers.\n\nThe tone ranged from polite — \"Respectfully request the Senate use Col. Phil Waldron's firm along with Jovan Pulitzer auditing the ballots,\" wrote Gary Nunns, who did not identify if he was an Arizona resident — to outright demands: \"A forensic audit by Jovan Hutton Pulitzer is what we the people want and need period,\" Joe Gomes wrote to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Warren Petersen.\n\nSenate President Karen Fann often responded with a simple thank you message. To others, she gave brief updates about efforts to move the audit forward.\n\n— Robert Anglen, Mary Jo Pitzl, Ray Stern, Ryan Randazzo, Yvonne Wingett Sanchez\n\n6:45 p.m., Sept. 9: Draft reports expected by middle of next week\n\nSenate President Karen Fann confirmed Thursday that the full draft report of the audit the Senate commissioned earlier this year should arrive at the Senate by the middle of next week.\n\nThe long-anticipated draft was first expected to arrive in late August, but its completion was delayed by a COVID-19 outbreak among three of the Cyber Ninja auditors.\n\nThe draft report will be examined by the Senate’s nine-person legal review team, which will review it for “clarity, accuracy, proof and documentation of any findings,” Fann has said.\n\nIn addition, the legal review team is expecting reports on two other audit-related checks it ordered, according to Randy Pullen, the audit's spokesperson and one of its chief fundraisers. They are the machine count of the number of ballots cast in the election, and a review of the signatures on mail-in ballot envelopes.\n\nThe final reports will be delivered to the Senate Judiciary Committee and made public, although it is unclear how much time it will take to move from draft form to the final version.\n\nThe review team consists of Fann; Judiciary Chairman Sen. Warren Petersen, R-Gilbert; Senate legal counsel Greg Jernigan; contract Senate attorneys Kory Langhofer and Thomas Basile of Statecraft; Garth Kamp, the Senate’s senior policy adviser; audit liaison Ken Bennett, and audit spokesman Randy Pullen. Doug Logan, CEO of the Cyber Ninjas, is also on the team to provide answers and context.\n\nA special committee of the Senate Government Committee also will be required to review the final reports. The committee can recommend any statutory changes that might be needed in the wake of the audit and can request a special session of the Legislature to deal with any proposed bills.\n\nThe committee has not yet been formed because the law that authorized it doesn’t take effect until Sept. 29. When it is named, it will have to act fast: By law, its authority lapses on Dec. 31.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n4 p.m., Sept. 6: U.S. Senate candidate helped pay for audit security\n\nRepublican U.S. Senate hopeful Jim Lamon has emerged as a key behind-the-scenes player in the state Senate's long-running ballot review, from helping bankroll security to directing Ken Bennett to take a position as a spokesperson for the effort.\n\nLamon's involvement adds to an already lengthy list of conservative causes he has helped underwrite during his brief candidacy.\n\nThe solar company executive has said he has paid for security during the ballot inspections and directed Bennett to pause the work he was doing with Lamon to recruit Republican voters so he could help with the partisan election review.\n\nLamon’s partial name appeared in a text message released this week by the Republican-controlled state Senate related to its review of the 2020 election, an exercise Lamon has supported even before it began in earnest earlier this year.\n\nOn the campaign trail, as he met with GOP voters at pancake breakfasts and political meet-and-greets, Lamon has taken credit for helping inspire the ballot review. In one appearance, he said he “started pressuring” Senate President Karen Fann, R-Prescott, to pursue the efforts when legal efforts by electors — including him — to overturn the election came up short.\n\n— Yvonne Wingett Sanchez\n\n9 a.m., Sept. 6: Trump adviser helps funnel money to audit\n\nA prominent Republican attorney who advised President Donald Trump as he tried to overturn the 2020 election helped set up an escrow account to funnel money to companies working on the Arizona election audit.\n\nCleta Mitchell's role came to light as The Arizona Republic combed through documents the state Senate released after a court order. The documents provide previously unknown details on payments to companies and people participating in audit work and link the audit even closer to Trump.\n\nMitchell, who gained national attention for advising Trump during his January call to Georgia election officials in which he asked them to find votes in his favor, arranged for $1 million to be sent from the escrow account in late July to three subcontractors working under Cyber Ninjas, the Senate's lead contractor.\n\nThis adds to the millions of dollars in outside funding that has paid for the months-long partisan review of Maricopa County's ballots and voting machines. Republican leaders in the Senate ordered the unusual review, which has been funded mainly by \"Stop the Steal\" advocates and Trump allies.\n\n— Jen Fifield and Stacey Barchenger\n\n5 p.m., Sept. 5: Taxpayers pick up $425K in audit costs, with more coming\n\nTaxpayers are on the hook for nearly $425,000 for the costs of the audit of the 2020 election results Senate Republicans are conducting, with thousands of dollars more in bills yet to come, state records show.\n\nThe largest expense is for $223,000 in legal fees paid through July, followed by $68,100 for security costs at the state fairgrounds in May.\n\nThose security costs were contracted by the Guardian Defense Fund, a dark-money nonprofit started in February to \"fight back\" against allegations about the involvement of three Arizona Republican politicians in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nSenate President Karen Fann, who authorized the audit, acknowledged overall costs are climbing. But she said a lot of that is due to Maricopa County's refusal to cooperate with the audit, resulting in legal fees, unexpected security costs and rental charges.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n12:30 p.m., Sept. 5: State Senate hires conspiracy theorist for ballot review\n\nThe Arizona Senate has hired an election conspiracy theorist and anti-vaccine activist to conduct its review of voter signatures on mail-in ballot envelopes in Maricopa County.\n\nCyber Ninjas, the Senate's lead audit contractor, hired the same man to review images of all 2.1 million ballots cast in the 2020 election.\n\nShiva Ayyadurai, or \"Dr. Shiva\" as he is known to far-right adherents, was tapped for both reviews in the waning weeks of the audit process, records show. However, he had participated in discussions with Arizona Republicans about challenging the state's election results as far back as November.\n\nThe Arizona Republic found one of Ayyadurai's contracts among thousands of records the Senate released in response to a court order.\n\n— Robert Anglen and Jen Fifield\n\n7 p.m. Sept. 2: Audit workers get paid ... finally\n\nOne of the firms working on the audit left the project in May, but a payment dispute lingered for months, documents released by the state Senate show.\n\nWake Technologies apparently didn’t pay its subcontractors until it struck an agreement in late July with Cyber Ninjas, the lead contractor on the audit, and the dozens of people Wake had hired.\n\nAs of Aug. 16, records show, 21 subcontractors were mailed checks totaling $166,550. This was labeled as “round one” of payments; in all, Wake was responsible for 41 contractors who were paid hourly rates ranging from $50 to $125.\n\nWake’s role was to recount the 2.1 million ballots cast in the November 2020 election in Maricopa County. The firm worked at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum from early April until May 14, when the audit’s contract for the state fairgrounds property lapsed.\n\nIt is unclear from the settlement agreement what caused the payment delay. But late Thursday, audit spokesman Randy Pullen said Cyber Ninjas had fulfilled its contractual obligation to Wake.\n\n- Mary Jo Pitzl and Jen Fifield\n\n5 p.m., Sept. 1: 'At least 2 weeks' until a final audit report is ready\n\nAs the review of the Maricopa County election moves into its fifth month — at its start, Senate officials said the initial count would take just 30 days — one big remaining unknown is when will the public see the findings.\n\nAt a court status conference over public records Wednesday, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Michael Kemp asked Kory Langhofer, the attorney for the Arizona Senate, that burning question. When would the Cyber Ninja's preliminary report on the audit go to the Senate, Kemp wanted to know, and would the Senate seek to protect that from public disclosure as it has thousands of other records?\n\nSenate President Karen Fann, R-Prescott, announced last week that the preliminary report was delayed because Cyber Ninjas CEO Doug Logan and two other members of his team contracted serious cases of COVID-19. The Senate still hasn't received that document, Langhofer said.\n\nLanghofer said the preliminary report is expected to come in three volumes, and one volume is not yet written. He said it will be \"at least two weeks\" before a final report is produced.\n\nKemp engaged in some foreshadowing in the courtroom, anticipating a fight over the documents that the Senate said are not subject to release.\n\n\"I have a feeling there will be some substantial disagreements over whether documents are privileged or not,\" the judge said.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/15/live-politics-updates-joe-biden-inauguration-donald-trump-impeachment/4171874001/", "title": "Politics updates: More than 2 months after election, Vice President ...", "text": "Capitol Police acknowledge investigation into tours by lawmakers leading up to Capitol riot\n\nThe United States Capitol Police acknowledged Friday they were investigating tours by lawmakers at the Capitol in the days leading up to a Jan. 6 riot that left at least five people dead.\n\n\"The matter is under investigation,\" Capitol Police spokesperson Eva Malecki said.\n\nThe investigation comes after a group of over 30 House Democrats sent a letter to Capitol Hill law enforcement officials on Jan. 13 asking for them to investigate what they deemed suspicious groups in the Capitol leading up to the riot. The rioters at the Capitol on Jan. 6 had an \"unusually detailed\" knowledge of the Capitol's layout, the lawmakers said in their letter, and they wanted potential ties between the tour groups and the riot to be investigated.\n\nSeveral of the Democratic lawmakers told USA TODAY the groups they saw walking through the Capitol complex were wearing MAGA hats and had other clothing on that indicated their political affiliation.\n\nThe Capitol is currently closed to public tours, but lawmakers and staff have ignored some of the restrictions.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday members of Congress could face charges if it were found they \"aided and abetted\" the riot.\n\n— Nicholas Wu and Joey Garrison\n\nPence calls to congratulate Harris\n\nVice President Mike Pence phoned Vice President-elect Kamala Harris Thursday to offer his congratulations and any assistance before she is sworn in as his successor in less than a week, according to a source familiar with the call.\n\nThe phone call marked the first time the pair spoke since they faced off in the vice presidential debate before the election.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has refused to call President-elect Joe Biden as is customary for an outgoing president. He plans to skip Biden's inauguration and the ceremonial peaceful transfer of power between two presidents.\n\nTrump is expected to hold a farewell ceremony at Joint Base Andrews, located in Maryland just outside Washington, D.C., and leave the city before Biden is sworn in as president.\n\nPence and his family plan to attend the Jan. 20 inauguration as is typical of the outgoing administration.\n\n– Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump to hold departure ceremony Wednesday at Joint Base Andrews\n\nPresident Donald Trump will leave the White House Wednesday for Florida, shortly before President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, two sources familiar with his plans said on the condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet announced.\n\nTrump will hold a departure ceremony at Joint Base Andrews, the usual jumping-off point for Air Force One, before leaving, the sources said. Details of that ceremony are still under consideration, the sources said, but may include a color guard and 21-gun salute.\n\nJoint Base Andrews is located in Maryland just outside of Washington.\n\nThe president had already announced he would skip Biden’s inauguration, breaking with more than a century of tradition. That means Trump will also ditch the traditional helicopter lift from the U.S. Capitol, a potent moment of symbolism that underscores the peaceful transfer of power between two presidents. Vice President Mike Pence is set to attend the swearing-in.\n\nTrump’s unusual departure follows weeks in which he falsely claimed the election was stolen from him, whipped up an angry mob that went on to storm the U.S. Capitol and faced a historic second impeachment for those words in the House of Representatives.\n\n– John Fritze, David Jackson and Courtney Subramanian\n\nPelosi says charges possible if lawmakers gave help to rioters\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday allegations of suspicious tours in the days before the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol were being investigated and that members of Congress who \"aided and abetted\" the rioters could face charges.\n\nA group of over 30 House Democrats sent a letter to Capitol Hill law enforcement officials on Jan. 13 asking for them to investigate what they deemed suspicious groups in the Capitol leading up to the riot.\n\nAlthough the Capitol is currently closed to public tours, lawmakers and staff have flou some of the restrictions. Several of the Democratic lawmakers told USA TODAY the groups were wearing MAGA hats and other clothing that indicated their political affiliation. The rioters at the Capitol on Jan. 6 had an \"unusually detailed\" knowledge of the Capitol's layout, the lawmakers said, and they wanted potential ties between the tour groups and the riot to be investigated.\n\n\"If in fact it is found that members of Congress were accomplices to this insurrection, if they aided and abetted the crime, then there have to be actions taken beyond the Congress and in terms of prosecution for that,\" Pelosi said Friday.\n\nThe investigation is still ongoing, but Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who chairs a key panel overseeing funding for the Capitol Police, noted Friday on MSNBC \"just a member of Congress giving a tour is not in and of itself some kind of criminal act.\" But the presence of the groups when the Capitol was mostly closed to outside groups could arouse suspicion, he said.\n\nPelosi declined to say when the impeachment case against President Donald Trump would move to the Senate, leaving it unclear when a trial might occur.\n\n\"Right now, our managers are solemnly and prayerfully preparing for the trial, which they will take to the Senate,\" Pelosi told reporters at her weekly news conference. \"You'll be the first to know when we announce\" that the article had been sent to the Senate.\n\nThere isn't a rush for Pelosi to transmit the article, which charges Trump with inciting an insurrection, to the Senate since Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has already said the chamber would not be able to take up the matter until next week when senators are back in town. The House must officially transmit the impeachment article to the Senate before the chamber can start a trial.\n\nDemocrats have been meeting to discuss strategy in the case, including the timing in which to send the article. The Senate will be back in town on Tuesday. If the House sent the article on that date, Trump's trial would begin Wednesday – the day of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.\n\nThe inauguration plans have been strikingly scaled back from previous presidential swearing-in ceremonies, but Pelosi insisted that was in response to the coronavirus pandemic, not in response to the threat from insurrectionists.\n\n\"I think it's important for people to know that this is not a concession to the terrorists. It is a recognition of the danger of COVID,\" she said.\n\n– Nicholas Wu and Christal Hayes\n\nThe Backstory:Handcuffs, explosives and cries for help. Chilling details from inside the Capitol riot.\n\nJustice watchdog opens inquiry into preparations, response to Capitol riots\n\nThe Justice Department’s inspector general is launching an investigation into how the agency prepared and later responded to the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol attack, where rioters overwhelmed police in the first mass breach of the iconic building in more than 200 years.\n\nIn a coordinated review with the departments of Defense and Homeland Security, the inquiry will examine whether threat-related information was appropriately shared with the U.S. Capitol Police and other agencies in advance of the assault that left five dead, including a Capitol police officer.\n\nEarlier this week, FBI officials confirmed that the bureau issued a dire warning on the day before the riots. It said violent extremists were planning an armed uprising in Washington, a plot the attackers described as a \"war\" to coincide with Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory.\n\nAssistant FBI Director Steven D’Antuono has said that the intelligence report, prepared by the bureau’s office in Norfolk, Virginia, included a \"thread on a message board\" that could not be attributed to an actual suspect.\n\nD’Antuono has said the information was shared within \"40 minutes\" with the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which includes the U.S. Capitol Police.\n\n\"The DOJ (inspector general) also will assess whether there are any weaknesses in DOJ protocols, policies, or procedures that adversely affected the ability of DOJ or its components to prepare effectively for and respond to the events at the U.S. Capitol,\" the agency’s watchdog said in a Friday statement.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nGOP Sen. Lankford apologizes to Black Oklahomans for contesting election results\n\nOklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford issued an apology to his home state's Black residents for challenging President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. Lankford’s apology comes after Black Tulsans called on Lankford to step down from a reconciliation committee for the 1921 Tulsa riots.\n\n\"I can assure you, my intent to give a voice to Oklahomans who had questions was never also an intent to diminish the voice of any Black American,\" Lankford wrote in a statement.\n\nIn the months after President Donald Trump’s election loss, the president and his allies levied unfounded conspiracy theories of widespread voter fraud that centered on heavily Black cities and regions. Many denounced the accusations as reckless and racist, and the unfounded allegations help fuel the anger that erupted in violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\n\"We reject the careless rhetoric and failures of leadership that facilitated, and arguably, incited, the lawless mob action that resulted in property damage, injury, and death, and sullied our internationally-admired democracy,\" the reconciliation commission said on Wednesday.\n\nThe 1921 Tulsa riot was a state-aided attack in which the city’s white residents massacred residents of the city’s once-thriving Black community. It is among the worst acts of racial violence in American history.\n\nLankford was among the Republican senators who cast doubts about the election in support of the president. Though he originally stated he would contest the certification of the election, Lankford reversed course after a pro-Trump mob ransacked the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn the election.\n\n\"While we disagree – and disagree strongly at times – we do not encourage what happened today, ever,\" Lankford said after the attack. \"We are headed tonight towards the certification of Joe Biden being the president of the United States and we'll work together in this body to be able to set a peaceful example for the days ahead.\"\n\nIn his letter to Black Tulsans, Lankford, a former Baptist minister, said, \"Today, I am asking my friends in North Tulsa for grace and an opportunity for us to show the state what reconciliation looks like in moments of disagreement.\"\n\n\"Being a part of the effort to shine a light on North Tulsa is an honor and a responsibility for me,\" he wrote. \"It is my mission, and I will continue working to support you for many years to come.\"\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\nGOP Sen. Tuberville: Biden inauguration should have been delayed because of COVID-19\n\nDays before President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., suggested the event should have been postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, even though Jan. 20 is enshrined in the Constitution as the date for the transfer of presidential power.\n\n\"We probably could have had a swearing-in and done an inauguration a little later on after we got this virus behind us a little bit. But again, we’re talking about Washington, D.C.,\" the former football coach told Birmingham TV station CBS 42.\n\nTuberville was one of six Republican senators who objected on Jan. 6 to the affirmation by Congress of Biden’s Electoral College win – a vote that took place hours after a violent pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol aimed at disrupting the count.\n\nThe Constitution’s 20th Amendment requires that the terms of a new president and vice president begin \"at noon on the 20th day of January.\"\n\n– Caren Bohan\n\nRep. Brady says Biden COVID relief plan ‘does nothing’ to save economy\n\nRep. Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, on Thursday evening criticized President-elect Joe Biden’s COVID-19 relief package, saying that it does not strengthen the U.S. economy.\n\n\"President-Elect Biden launches yet another economic blind buffalo that does nothing to save Main Street businesses, get people back to work, or strengthen our economy,\" Brady, R-Texas, said in a statement. \"Special interests and liberals are cheering. The jobless and Main Street are left shaking their heads.\"\n\nBiden’s proposal includes investing $20 billion in a national vaccination program, $1,400 stimulus checks and raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nAlthough Democrats hold a slim majority in the House and Senate, Biden will likely have a tough time getting his $1.9 trillion relief package through Congress. House Democrats currently hold a narrow 222-to-211 majority and the Senate is split 50-50 Democrat and Republicans, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as the tie-breaking vote.\n\nWhile Republicans on Capitol Hill have opposed sending larger stimulus checks to Americans, some Democrats have also criticized Biden for his stimulus proposal.\n\nIn December, Brady was quick to criticize the CASH Act, which would have increased the $600 stimulus check that were in the bipartisan relief legislation passed in December to $2,000.\n\n\"Will this stimulate our local economies? Not a lot,\" Brady said on the House floor in December. He said the money would \"go to pay down credit card debt, or savings, or even make new purchases online at Walmart, Best Buy, or Amazon.\"\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden picks Kessler to lead vaccine effort\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden chose Dr. David Kessler, a former head of the Food and Drug Administration who helped lead the development of drugs to combat the AIDS epidemic in the 1990s, to shepherd vaccine distribution for COVID-19, the Biden transition team announced Friday.\n\nKessler will replace Dr. Moncef Slaoui, a researcher and former drug company executive, to head Operation Warp Speed. Kessler’s responsibilities will cover manufacturing, distribution and the safety and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic.\n\nThe pace of vaccination distribution has fallen below expectations. Biden’s goal is to provide 100 million vaccinations during the first 100 days of his administration starting Jan. 20. Twenty-two million doses have been distributed and 6.7 million administered as of Jan. 8, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"We are in a race against time, and we need a comprehensive strategy to quickly contain this virus,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nMore than 385,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, with more than 4,300 on Tuesday alone.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nSenate Intel Committee postpones confirmation hearing for Biden’s spy chief\n\nIt’s not clear if President-elect Joe Biden will have any of his national security nominees confirmed by Day 1 of his presidency, a break with past practice.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee was supposed to hold a hearing Friday for Biden’s chief intelligence nominee, Avril Haines. But at the last minute, the committee announced a delay, without specifying the reasons.\n\n\"Despite the unusual circumstances on Capitol Hill, the committee is working in good faith to move this nominee as fast as possible and ensure the committee's members have an opportunity to question the nominee in both open and closed settings,\" the committee’s acting chairman, GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, and vice chairman, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, said in a joint statement late Thursday night.\n\nRubio and Warner said the hearing would take place on Jan. 19. Biden will be sworn in on Jan. 20.\n\n\"We are disappointed the hearing was delayed, particularly given the urgency to have national security leaders in place in this time of crisis,\" said Ned Price, a spokesman for the Biden transition. \"Nevertheless, DNI-designate Haines eagerly awaits the opportunity to answer the Committee's questions next week.\"\n\nThe Senate is currently led by Republicans, but Democrats are poised to gain the majority after Jan. 20.\n\nTwo newly elected Democrats from Georgia will be sworn in after the results of that state’s runoff are certified – likely toward the end of next week – and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will be able to cast a tie breaking vote in the 50-50 chamber.\n\nFor now, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell controls the schedule, under which the Senate will not fully reconvene for business until Jan. 19. Two other key Biden nominees are set to have hearings on that day: Lloyd Austin, his pick to lead the Pentagon, and Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden’s choice to serve as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen and Bart Jansen\n\nBiden to name CIA veteran David Cohen as No. 2 at the spy agency\n\nPresident-election Joe Biden will announce another key national security appointment Friday, naming David Cohen to be deputy director of the CIA, the Biden transition announcedy.\n\nCohen has held the job before – from 2015 to 2017 – when he helped to manage the agency’s global operations and led foreign intelligence collection, covert action and other espionage activities. An attorney by training, Cohen is an expert in tracking financial crimes, terrorism funding networks in particular, which he did as a top official at the Treasury Department.\n\nBut none of those skills came into play for his most public role: as an extra on the HBO series \"Game of Thrones.\" Cohen snagged the cameo last year, appearing in the soup line as a nameless Winterfell resident during an April 2019 episode.\n\n“A perk of working for CIA is world travel. Apparently that sometimes extends to other realms … ,” the CIA tweeted from its official account shortly before the show aired. \"'Little birds,' be on the lookout for a former deputy director of ours wandering through #Westeros in tonight’s episode of #GameOFThrones.\"\n\n\"Way to blow my cover!\" Cohen tweeted in response.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nBiden picks Jaime Harrison for DNC chair\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden on Thursday announced his picks for Democratic leadership, including Jaime Harrison, a U.S. Senate candidate from South Carolina in November's election, as Democratic National Committee chairman.\n\nThe move comes ahead of the 2022 election cycle in which Democrats will look to retain control of the Senate and House.\n\nHarrison, who previously chaired the South Carolina Democratic Party, lost to Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. by 11 percentage points in the November election. It was a disappointing finish after Harrison brought in a record fundraising haul, but one that built his name in the party’s ranks.\n\nThe DNC is set to vote on its leadership next week. Voting will close Thursday.\n\nHarrison would replace Tom Perez, who opted against running for a second term. Harrison unsuccessfully ran for DNC party chair against Perez in 2017. Although Harrison isn’t guaranteed the leadership position, the party historically defers to the president’s choice.\n\nBiden also announced other DNC officers that include three women he considered for vice president who turned into key campaign surrogates: Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Michigan Gov. Whitmer and Illinois U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth. Each were named party vice chairs along with Rep. Filemon Vela Jr. of Texas.\n\n\"This group of individuals represent the very best of the Democratic Party,\" Biden said in a statement. \"Their stories and long histories of activism and work reflects our party’s values and the diversity that make us so strong.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhat's in Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion spending package aims to speed distribution of the coronavirus vaccines and provide economic relief caused by the pandemic.\n\nThe package proposal includes investing $20 billion in a national vaccination program, $1,400 stimulus checks and expanding unemployment insurance supplements to $400 per week.\n\nBiden’s proposed relief package comes several weeks after Congress passed a $900 billion COVID-19 relief package in December, which the president-elect said at the time was a \"down payment.\"\n\nThe plan also includes:\n\n$170 billion to help reopen schools, as well as provide financial relief to students\n\nExpand to 14 weeks paid sick and family and medical leave\n\n$25 billion in rental assistance and an additional $5 billion to cover home energy and water costs\n\nExtending the 15% Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit increase to September 2021\n\n$15 billion for grants to more than 1 million small businesses\n\nA $20 billion investment to Indian Country to support tribal governments' response to the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nRead the full story.\n\n— Rebecca Morin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/15"}]}

That's part of the campaign to liberate Luhansk province, which has been under Russian control since July.\n\nIt promises to be a tough, bloody pursuit. Andrei Marochko, a military leader for a local separatist group, confirmed the Ukrainian advance in Luhansk, calling the situation “really difficult.”\n\nBut Haidai said the expelled Russians had returned Wednesday to Kreminna -- a city of 18,000 in the western part of Luhansk where Ukrainians had raised their flag -- and “tore down the flags and are demonstrably showing that they’re there.”\n\nHaidai added that Russian forces continued to heavily shell their counterparts in the region, knocking down internet service.\n\nEU Commission chief heads to Kyiv, lauds 'bravery of Ukrainians'\n\nAs European consumers grapple with electricity prices that have skyrocketed up to fivefold the cost of a year ago mostly because of the Russian invasion, Ukraine's stunningly successful counteroffensive in the northeast may help validate the sacrifice.\n\nIn her State of the European Union address Wednesday, European Union Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen said she would visit Kyiv later in the day as a sign of support for the Ukrainians, adding that the bloc is committed to the cause and will open its markets more to the country's products.\n\n“We have seen in the last days the bravery of Ukrainians paying off,” said von der Leyen, who was dressed in the colors of the Ukrainian flag and characterized the war as “autocracy against democracy.”\n\nShe also called for reshaping the way the EU sets electricity prices because the current system is “not doing justice to consumers anymore.”\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/09/15/could-ukraine-win-war-against-russia/10365025002/", "title": "Turning point in Ukraine war?

Despite the horrors befalling their city after Russia invaded Ukraine, they filed along in an orderly fashion.\n\nSuddenly, Kiriukhina heard a whistling sound overhead. After glimpsing something out of the corner of her eye, she shouted for everyone to get down. The line was quickly drenched in blood, the air filled with screams.\n\nA Smerch rocket lodged in a car in Kharkiv. Alex Platt/CNN\n\nMoscow had just launched one of its notorious 300mm Smerch cluster rockets – a projectile that unleashes 72 submunitions over an area the size of a football pitch – hitting Kiriukhina and her neighbors.\n\nThe torrent of shrapnel cut Kiriukhina’s leg, hand and forehead. A man nearby lost two of his fingers.\n\n“I could feel that my leg and my hip got ruptured. My arm got hit and I couldn’t feel my head,” Kiriukhina told CNN.\n\nThe 56-year-old was taken to hospital in a wheel barrow and was hospitalized for ten days.\n\nVideo uploaded to social media showed a woman putting on a brave face as her leg bled out.

Alex Platt/CNN\n\nThey were not the only Smerch rockets fired into Kharkiv over a key 48-hour period in late February, as Russian troops battled to seize the city from Ukrainian forces. And Ukraine is not the first battleground where Russian forces have deployed cluster munitions to devastating effect against civilians.\n\nTo survivors of Syria’s yearslong civil war, the scenes in Kharkiv echo countless others carried out by Russia after it intervened to aid President Bashar al-Assad in 2015.\n\nThrough analysis of satellite imagery in collaboration with the Centre for Information Resilience (CIR) and on-the-ground investigations, CNN has identified the rocket artillery brigade that launched the cluster munitions attack in residential districts of Ukraine’s second city on the day Kiriukhina and her neighbors were attacked. That brigade reports directly to same military leader – Colonel General Alexander Zhuravlyov – who oversaw one of the most brutal chapters of Syria’s war.\n\nCNN traced 11 Smerch rockets that landed in Kharkiv on February 27 and February 28 back to Russia’s 79th Rocket Artillery Brigade, based in Russia’s Belgorod region.\n\n\n\nSmerch cluster rocket attacks in Kharkiv - (CNN investigated attacks on Kharkiv on February 27-28 and confirmed that 11 locations were impacted by cluster munitions. The United Nations said at the end of March that there were at least two dozen cluster munition attacks on Ukraine since the start of the invasion.)\n\nThat brigade reports directly to the leadership of the Russian military’s Western Military District (WMD), one of five military districts in the Russian military, based in the western part of Russia.\n\nMultiple military experts told CNN that Zhuravlyov – the Russian equivalent of a theater commander in the US military – is the only officer with the authority to order a Smerch rocket attack in his district. As a high-value weapon, it needs senior sign-off.\n\nThe Kremlin and the Russian Ministry of Defense have not responded to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nLessons from Syria\n\nZhuravlyov, 57, was commissioned as a Soviet officer in the 1980s when he served in the former Czechoslovakia with a group of Russian forces. After the USSR collapsed, he returned to Russia, initially serving with tank units.\n\nDeployed to Syria three times, he first became the commander of Russian troops in the country during his second stint in July 2016. Before he assumed the post, Moscow was mired in a bloody fight to capture rebel-held eastern Aleppo, making steady advances against the armed opposition.\n\n\n\nZhuravlyov’s leadership catalyzed the assault on eastern Aleppo. After he took the reins, the Russian military rapidly ramped up its attacks on the rebel-held territory and completed the siege of the densely populated city, exacting a large death toll and setting the wheels in motion for a tactic that has defined Russia’s intervention in Syria: besiege, starve, bombard and grind into submission.\n\nHis period of command also saw a dramatic increase in documented cluster munition attacks in Aleppo.\n\nAccording to the Violations Documentation Center, which documents human rights violations in Syria, cluster munitions were used 137 times in Aleppo between September 10 and October 10, 2016, a 791% increase on the average number of cluster munition attacks in the previous eight months.\n\nIn 2015, Russia’s Defense Ministry denied using cluster munitions in Syria.\n\nIt was an escalation which aid groups sought to draw the world’s attention to. At the time, Save the Children’s then-Syria director, Sonia Khush, said in a statement: “there are young children with freshly amputated limbs or with ball bearings embedded in their muscle tissue because of the use of these appalling and indiscriminate weapons.”\n\nIn Kharkiv, CNN spoke to dozens of eyewitnesses in several of the neighborhoods targeted by 11 Smerch rocket attacks that occurred on February 27 and 28.\n\nThey recalled the death and destruction that the cluster munitions wrought on their city. The streets were covered with wounded people, burning cars and broken glass. One eyewitness said that up to a dozen people were injured in his apartment building alone in a single Smerch rocket attack.\n\n“I don’t know what exactly this was, but it was all over the district. These small bits that explode and spread dangerous shrapnel all over,” said Yuriy Braiko, an IT program analyst who lives in Kharkiv. “They create a lot of tiny shrapnel which gets into various places, windows and people.”\n\nRocket remnants seen in Kharkiv by CNN and the burn marks left by the projectiles revealed the incoming direction of the attack, which CNN traced back to Russia’s Belgorod region, near the border with Ukraine.\n\nCNN visited a site where Ukrainian officials had collected large piles of exploded and unexploded ordnance. Mark Hiznay, a weapons expert and the associate arms director for Human Rights Watch, reviewed images from the site and said the photographs indicated that the cluster munition attacks had happened at a scale not seen in years.\n\n“There are a lot of cluster munitions used in a scale that was probably beyond what we saw in south Lebanon in 2006,” Hiznay said, referring to the 2006 war between Lebanon and Israel, during which the Israeli military dropped an estimated 4 million submunitions on south Lebanon, according to the United Nations.\n\n“It’s not like the movies where you see the missile before the bomb hits. You’ll just all of a sudden have 72 submunitions detonating across a football pitch,” said Hiznay. “So that’s why people are literally cut down in midstride from these things. You don’t have a lot of burns. You don’t have blast injuries. It’s just nasty, bloody fragmentation.”\n\nCluster bombs are banned under an international treaty — the 2010 Convention on Cluster Munitions — that prohibits the use, transfer, production and stockpiling of the weapons. The treaty cites the failure of many submunitions to explode on impact, leaving dangerous ordnance in fields and urban areas that could kill or maim people. Russia, Ukraine, the United States and Israel are among the countries who are not signatories to the treaty.\n\nBut an attack of any kind that indiscriminately attacks civilians, as CNN’s on-the-ground investigation reveals happened on February 27 and 28, would appear to be a war crime, according to multiple experts interviewed.\n\n“The extrajudicial murders and the bombardment of the civilian population, that is neither a military necessity nor proportional to the threat they are facing, are against the Geneva Conventions,” said Foreign Policy Research Institute fellow Philip Wasielewski.\n\n“And based on the Geneva Conventions standard of command responsibility, General (Zhuravlyov) is culpable as well as anyone else in his chain of command.”\n\n‘The wounds are the same’\n\nA doctor who treated the war wounded in both conflicts has been struck by the similarities. People arrived at the Kharkiv hospital pockmarked with shrapnel, skin and muscle damage, amputations, open fractures and head trauma.\n\nSyrian-American orthopedic surgeon Dr. Samer Attar, who worked in Aleppo as Zhuravlyov’s forces besieged the city, travelled to Ukraine from his hometown of Chicago hoping to help Ukrainian doctors cope with the unfamiliar tide of traumatized war-wounded.\n\nDr. Samer Attar treated cluster munition wounds in eastern Aleppo and traveled to Ukraine to treat injured people in Kharkiv. \"The wounds are the same,\" he told CNN. Alex Platt/CNN\n\nAttar described the wounds he treated in Kharkiv and those he saw in Aleppo in 2016 as “the same.”\n\n“You can hear the air-raid sirens but everyone here has learned to remain still and steadfast and carry on,” he said. “It never stops outside and neither does the work.”\n\nIn December 2016, the rebels who were holed up in eastern Aleppo finally surrendered and Syrian government and Russian forces recaptured the territory.\n\nA street in the rebel-held Salihin neighborhood of Aleppo is littered with debris on September 11, 2016, after Russia attacked the residential area with cluster bombs. brahim ebu Leys/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nWith the end of the battle for Aleppo, Zhuravlyov left the helm of the Russian military in Syria and returned to Russia. He was awarded the highest honors bestowed on a Russian officer – the Hero of the Russian Federation.\n\nHe was twice promoted the following year and became commander of the Western Military District – the same division that wreaked death and destruction on Kharkiv and other parts of Ukraine – shortly after his third stint in Syria in 2018.\n\n“The results Zhuravlyov achieved in Syria were exactly what the Russians wanted, hence his reward with the top medal and the top postings one can get,” said Russian military expert Wasielewski. “It’s what Napoleon said: ‘a general’s reward is not a bigger tent but a bigger command.’”\n\nZhuravlyov later said in an interview that Syria had taught him about the value of “military ingenuity,” and that the lessons learned there were being integrated as an “organic component” of all Russian military training.\n\nVladimir Putin shakes hands with Zhuravlyov at the Kremlin in Moscow on March 23, 2017. kremlin.ru\n\nAnother Russian general who served in Syria alongside Zhuravlyov – Lieutenant General Aleksei Zavizion – was appointed Zhuravlyov’s deputy in the Western Military District in the same month Zhuravlyov assumed his current position. Just a year before, Zavizion had allegedly led a group of separatist fighters after they wrested territory from Ukrainian government forces in the country’s eastern-most Donbas region, according to Ukraine’s military intelligence.\n\nUkraine’s military intelligence also accuses Zavizion of being behind multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) attacks on civilian areas in the Donbas region. In 2017, Ukraine indicted Zavizion for alleged war crimes.\n\nCNN cross-referenced its findings regarding the two Russian generals with Ukraine’s military intelligence who confirmed that they have accused the men of being responsible for apparent crimes against civilians in Kharkiv and elsewhere.\n\nNeither Zhuravlyov nor Zavizion have been sanctioned by the international community.\n\n“Colonel General Alexander Zhuravlyov should have been sanctioned for his actions in Syria,” a leading human rights lawyer at the law firm Payne Hicks Beach, Matthew Ingham, told CNN. “It is a shame that there was not a stronger response to alleged war crimes at that stage, because that may have affected Putin’s Ukrainian strategic calculations from the outset.”\n\nZhuravlyov also was involved in high-level defense talks with British military officials in Moscow in 2017, after his role in the siege of Aleppo was publicly known. The UK defense ministry told CNN that a statement it issued in 2017 “made it clear” that they supported military to military dialogue to minimize risk and miscalculation.\n\nMeanwhile, as Russia’s invasion continues into its third month and the offensive on the east of the country intensifies, bombs rain down on Kharkiv and much of the city has been hollowed out of its inhabitants.\n\nThe facades of many apartment buildings have been stripped off. Residents who remain have been driven underground to sprawling encampments in the city’s subway system.\n\nAfter she recovered from the February 28 Smerch rocket attack, Kiriukhina fled Kharkiv, hoping to erase the “horror film” scenes from her mind.\n\nNow when she’s out in public, she wears a beret to conceal the scars from her wounds.\n\n“I was in a good mood. The weather was pleasant. The sun was shining. No one would have thought that such horror would swoop down in just seconds,” she said.\n\n“From the bottom of our hearts and souls we wish for punishment for these crimes. Somehow justice will prevail.

He demonstrated that trait again Tuesday when he made a video appearance at the opening ceremony of the Cannes Film Festival in France.\n\nIf Zelenskyy's presence was surprising, his words were powerful, prompting the audience at the Palais des Festivals to give him a standing ovation, according to France24.com.\n\n\"Hundreds of people are dying every day. They won't get up again after the clapping at the end,\" Zelenskyy said in the prerecorded message. \"Will cinema keep quiet, or will it speak up?''\n\nZelenskyy alluded to the 1940 film \"The Great Dictator,'' featuring Charlie Chaplin playing the two leading roles. Released during World War II, the movie satirizes Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.\n\n\"Chaplin's dictator did not destroy the real dictator, but thanks to cinema, thanks to this film, cinema did not stay quiet,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We need a new Chaplin to prove today that cinema is not mute.''\n\nTreasury Secretary Yellen says war should hasten transition to clean energy\n\nThe energy security emergency facing Europe and the world because of the war is a moment to rapidly accelerate the transition to clean energy, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday. Yellen, in a prepared speech for the Brussels Economic Forum, called the war a \"wake-up call\" for energy security and said that \"no country controls the wind and the sun.\" Europe's dependence on Russian energy has complicated efforts to sting Moscow with harsh economic sanctions.\n\n\"Let’s make sure that this is the last time that the global economy is held hostage to the hostile actions of those who produce fossil fuels,\" Yellen said. \"This will happen again if we don’t change our approach.\"\n\nInternational court sends 42 experts to Ukraine for war crimes probe\n\nThe chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court said Tuesday that he has deployed a team of 42 investigators, forensic experts and support personnel to Ukraine. Prosecutor Karim Khan said the team, working with the Ukrainian authorities, will connect crime scene investigations and strengthen \"hard evidence.\"\n\nTo be classified as crimes against humanity, attacks have to be part of what the ICC’s founding treaty calls “a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population.” Thousands of Ukrainian civilians are believed to have died since the Russian invasion began less than three months ago.\n\n\"It is essential that we demonstrate to survivors and the families of victims that international law is relevant,\" Khan said in a statement, pledging to \" bring them some measure of solace through the process of justice.\"\n\n$40B funding for Ukraine nears approval\n\nCongress is poised to approve more than $40 billion in emergency funding to support Ukraine, an amount nearly three times greater than what the U.S. has already committed in military, humanitarian and other assistance to beat back Russia's invasion.\n\nAlong with the $13.6 billion passed in March, the combined $53.7 billion is about 81% of Russia’s 2021 defense budget, and more than one-quarter the size of Ukraine’s pre-war economy. The funding does not include the cost of reconstruction, which has been estimated at $600 billion. Paul Stephan, a University of Virginia law school professor who has worked at the State and Defense departments, was wary of proposals to use frozen Russian assets for rebuilding Ukraine.\n\n“Russia will not always be a pariah,” Stephan wrote in a recent analysis for Lawfare. “When it returns to the fold, it will want its money back.”\n\nBiden to meet with leaders of Sweden and Finland\n\nPresident Joe Biden will meet at the White House with the leaders of Sweden and Finland on Thursday to discuss those nations’ application for membership in NATO, the White House announced Tuesday. The meeting with Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson of Sweden and President Sauli Niinistö of Finland comes days after both countries announced they would seek entry into the alliance. Their applications must be approved by all current members, however, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has raised objections.\n\nStill, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Tuesday reiterated Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s comments Sunday that there is strong support within NATO for Sweden and Finland to join and there are ongoing conversations with Turkey.\n\n“We have every confidence that there will be a consensus,” Jean-Pierre said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nRetired colonel on Russian TV: War is going badly and will 'frankly, get worse'\n\nA retired Russian colonel broke from the Kremlin narrative of the war in Ukraine this week, warning on Russian TV that as the West ramps up its arms deliveries \"a million armed Ukrainian soldiers needs to be viewed as a reality of the very near future.\" Thus the Russian's military struggles are likely to \"frankly, get worse,\" Mikhail Khodaryonok said.\n\nKhodaryonok said Russia faced \"full geopolitical isolation.\" The Russian TV host, Olga Skabeyeva, known as the \"Iron doll of Putin TV\" for her fiercely pro-Kremlin takes, suggested that the isolation was only from the West. But Khodaryonok said support from China and India was not as unconditional as the support Ukraine was receiving from the U.S. and its allies.\n\n\"Virtually the entire world is against us,\" he said, as translated by the BBC's Francis Scarr. \"And it's that situation that we need to get out of.\"\n\nKhodaryonok also dismissed claims that the Ukraine military includes relatively few professional soldiers and was suffering from low morale.\n\n\"A desire to protect one's homeland, in the sense that it exists in Ukraine, it really does exist there,\" he said. \"They intend to fight until the last man.\"\n\nUkraine military command lauds value of steel mill holdout\n\nHundreds of Ukraine fighters who held on for weeks at the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol were able to keep Russia from shifting up to 20,000 personnel to other locations in Ukraine, the Ukrainian military said in a statement. That gave the military \"the opportunity to prepare and create the defensive frontiers on which our troops are still present today,\" the statement said.\n\n\"We got the critically needed time to build reserves, regroup forces, and get help from partners,\" the statement said.\n\nThe most important joint task of all Ukraine and the whole world is to save the lives of Mariupol defenders, the statement added: \"We will fight for you on all fronts as devotedly as you defend the country.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/04/ukraine-russia-invasion-live-updates/9369419002/", "title": "Ukraine recap: Putin 'fake' news ban; oligarch's yacht detained", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Friday, March 4. Follow here for the latest updates and news from Saturday, March 5, as Russia's invasion continues.\n\nThe Russian advance on Kyiv remained largely stalled on Friday while a fire at Europe's largest nuclear power plant was extinguished following a Kremlin attack that drew worldwide condemnation.\n\nOther Russian offensives were pushing ahead. An armed force in southern Ukraine made significant gains in an attempt to cut off access to the sea.\n\nThe attack on the Zaporizhzhia power plant facility caused a fire and widespread fears of a disaster similar to the 1986 Chernobyl accident, which occurred about 65 miles north of the Ukrainian capital. Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine tweeted, \"If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl!\"\n\nThere were no indications of radiation leaking, according to a senior U.S. Defense Department official. Nuclear power plants are not designed to withstand military attacks, underscoring the recklessness of the assault, added the official, who discussed intelligence reports on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe Russians apparently captured the plant with an eye toward controlling the Ukrainian population, a senior U.S. Defense Department official said. Operating the plant would allow them to deliver power, or to withhold it to punish Ukrainians.\n\nAt an emergency Security Council meeting after the attack, Ukraine’s U.N. ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya accused Russia of committing \"an act of nuclear terrorism.\"\n\nHe told the council his Russian counterpart was lying over a claim that a “Ukrainian sabotage group” was responsible for setting fire to a training facility at the plant. He said several buildings were damaged and one part of the facility was experiencing an outage.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian advance on the capital of Kyiv remained largely stalled about 15 miles from the city center, the official said. Ukrainian forces have hindered its progress by blowing up a key bridge and attacking vehicles in the convoy that stretches for 40 miles. Though bogged down, the Russians continue to shell Ukrainian cities, striking residential areas and civilian infrastructure, the official said.\n\n— Tom Vanden Brook, Ryan Miller and Christal Hayes\n\nLatest developments:\n\n►Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will talk to U.S. senators on a video conference call Saturday morning, according to a person familiar with the invitation from the Ukrainian embassy.\n\n► A Russian major general was killed in action fighting in Ukraine, a blow to the Kremlin and a rare occurrence for such a senior military official. Maj. Gen. Andrei Sukhovetsky, the commanding general of the Russian 7th Airborne Division, was killed earlier this week. The death was a rarity in modern times. Since the end of the Vietnam War, only one U.S. general has died in a combat zone. Maj. Gen. Harold Greene died in Afghanistan in 2015.\n\n► Ukraine's military has begun enlisting civilian drone pilots to help with surveillance in the effort to repel Russia's invasion. Armed forces leaders have asked enthusiasts to donate aircraft and, if they are experienced flyers, to volunteer as pilots.\n\n►NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Russian forces had used cluster bombs and that the organization had \"seen reports of the use of other types of weapons which would be in violation of international law,\" calling it \"inhumane.\"\n\n►Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said on Facebook the country's navy intentionally sank its flagship frigate, Hetman Sagaidachny, which was under repair, to prevent Russian capture.\n\n►Talks on Thursday between Russia and Ukraine yielded a tentative agreement to set up safe corridors to evacuate citizens and deliver humanitarian aid.\n\n►The Pentagon said it established a direct communication line Tuesday with the Russian ministry of defense “for the purpose of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalation.”\n\n►Ukraine-born film star Mila Kunis and her husband, Ashton Kutcher, announced Friday they are launching a GoFundMe account to provide aid and shelter for the war-ravaged nation, and will match up to $3 million in contributions. According to Global News, Kunis said she takes pride in being an American, \"but today I have never been more proud to be a Ukranian.\"\n\nQuick links:\n\nGET THE LATEST UKRAINE UPDATES:We'll email you the latest news once a day\n\nVISUALS:Mapping and tracking Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\n'BOMBS, BOMBS, BOMBS':Ukrainian refugees describe harrowing journey to Poland\n\nWHAT IS AN ARMISTICE? Here's what you need to know during talks between Russia and Ukraine\n\nRussia reports ceasefire in two areas of Ukraine\n\nThe Russian military will observe a ceasefire in two areas of Ukraine starting Saturday to allow civilians to evacuate, Russian state media reported, but there was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine. It would be the first breakthrough in allowing civilians to escape the war.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry statement said it has agreed on evacuation routes with Ukrainian forces to allow civilians to leave the strategic port of Mariupol in the southeast and the eastern town of Volnovakha “from 10 a.m. Moscow time.” It was not immediately clear from the vaguely worded statement how long the routes would remain open.\n\nThe head of Ukraine’s security council, Oleksiy Danilov, had called on Russia to create humanitarian corridors to allow children, women and the elderly to escape the fighting, calling such corridors “question No. 1.”\n\n— Associated Press\n\nItaly detains oligarch's yacht in sanctions crackdown\n\nA billionaire's superyacht was detained Friday by Italian authorities in furtherance of European Union sanctions levied against oligarchs stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg, a 215-foot vessel named \"Lady M,\" owned by Alexei Mordashov, was docked in Imperia, a Ligurian Sea port near the French border.\n\nMordashov is among six Russians who were targeted for sanctions on Monday by the European Union. He is the primary shareholder and chairman of Severstal, a Russian company, with holdings in television, energy and mining, and was recently listed by Forbes as the second-wealthiest person in Russia. Earlier this week, he told the Russian news agency, TASS, he did not understand why he's been targeted, claiming he has \"absolutely nothing to do with the emergence of the current geopolitical tension.”\n\n— Dennis Wagner\n\nPence: No room in GOP for 'Putin apologists'\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence told Republicans “there is no room in this party for apologists for Putin” during an event with the party's top donors.\n\nPence directed his comments toward members of the GOP who have failed to take Russian President Vladimir Putin to task for his brutal assault on Ukraine. Pence urged the party to move on from the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“Where would Russian tanks be today if NATO had not expanded the borders of freedom? There is no room in this party for apologists for Putin,” Pence said. “There is only room for champions of freedom.”\n\n— Chelsey Cox\n\nZelenskyy energizes protesters across Europe in rousing speech\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered a rousing speech on video to crowds of demonstrators Friday night in major European cities.\n\nZelenskyy urged listeners to rally behind Ukraine in its resistance against Russian invaders, telling them, \"Don't turn a blind eye to this... If we fall, you fall. And if we win -- and I'm sure we will win -- this will be a victory for the whole democratic world.\"\n\nThe video was shown in Paris, Frankfurt and Lyon, among other cities. In Prague, the capital and largest city in the Czech Republic, footage posted on social media showed throngs of pro-Ukraine demonstrators filling several blocks, cheering as Zelenskyy spoke.\n\n— Dennis Wagner\n\nSky News journalists fired on by Russian forces\n\nA British news team in Kyiv came under fire this week from what they reported was a Russian \"death squad\" as they attempted to cover the war in Ukraine's capital.\n\nSky News chief correspondent Stuart Ramsey was wounded during the ambush and a camera operator took two bullets to his body armor despite repeatedly identifying themselves as media.\n\nA harrowing video of the incident shows the five-person crew motoring along a deserted, war-torn street when their vehicle is disabled by an explosion. Gunfire erupts and the windshield is shattered as they repeatedly cry out, \"Press!\"\n\n\"Somehow, we've got to get out of there, but the bullets keep coming,\" Ramsey says on the video. Shots continue for nearly three minutes before the journalists manage to escape down an embankment and into a nearby warehouse. Sky News' website does not identify the date of the incident or the severity of Ramsey's wound but says team members have returned safely to the United Kingdom.\n\n— Dennis Wagner\n\nVP Harris to travel next week to Poland and Romania\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is heading to Poland and Romania to demonstrate NATO strength and unity and show U.S. support for the alliance’s eastern flank in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHarris will travel next Wednesday through Friday to Warsaw and Bucharest for meetings with the leaders of Poland and Romania. The leaders are expected to discuss continuing support for the people of Ukraine through security, economic and humanitarian assistance and the decision to impose severe economic consequences on Russia and those complicit in the invasion, the vice president’s office said.\n\n“The vice president’s meetings will also focus on how the United States can further support Ukraine’s neighbors as they welcome and care for refugees fleeing violence,” Harris’ spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nBiden examining ban on Russian oil as pressure builds\n\nThe White House said Friday it was weighing a ban on Russian oil imports amid growing bipartisan calls for President Joe Biden to sanction Russia’s energy sector as Vladimir Putin escalates fighting in Ukraine.\n\n“We are looking at options we could take right now to cut U.S. consumption of Russian energy,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. “But we are very focused on minimizing the impact of families. If you reduce supply in the global marketplace, you are going to rise raise gas prices.”\n\nBy leaving open a ban on Russian oil imports, the White House softened its stance from Thursday when Psaki rejected the idea for being against the “strategic interest” of the U.S.\n\nSens. Joe Manchin, D-W.V. and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, on Thursday introduced the Ban Russian Energy Imports Act, which would prohibit the importation of Russian crude oil, petroleum, liquefied natural as and coal from Russia. The legislation has 16 additional Senate co-sponsors spanning both parties.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she also supports the bill. “I’m all for that. Ban it,” the speaker said Thursday.\n\nIn 2021, the U.S. imported an average of 209,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Russia, according to the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, accounting for 3% of all U.S. crude oil imports and 1 percent of the total crude oil produced by American refineries.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nUS does not advocate for killing Vladimir Putin, White House says\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki categorically rejected an idea posed by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham that implied someone in Russia should assassinate Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"No, we are not advocating for killing the leader of a foreign country or a regime change,” Psaki said during a press briefing. “That is not the policy of the United States.\"\n\nIn his tweet, Graham called for someone to “take this guy out,” in reference to Putin and said it would be a \"great service\" to Russia and the world at large.\n\n\"That is not the position of the United States government and certainly not a statement you'd hear come from the mouth of anybody working in this administration,\" Psaki told reporters.\n\n— Chelsey Cox\n\nVladimir Putin outlaws spread of 'fake' news against Russia's position\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has signed a bill introducing a prison sentence of up to 15 years for spreading information that goes against the Russian government’s position on the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe bill criminalizing the intentional spreading of what Russia deems to be “fake” reports about the war was quickly rubber-stamped by both houses of the Kremlin-controlled parliament earlier Friday.\n\nThe new law led to a a slew of prominent outlets announcing the suspension of the work of its journalists in the country, including CNN, Bloomberg News, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and the BBC.\n\n\"The legislation appears to criminalize the process of independent journalism,\" Tim Davis, BBC's publications director said. \"It leaves us no other option than to temporarily suspect the work of all BBC News journalists and their support staff within the Russian Federation while we assess the full implications of this unwelcome development.\"\n\nRussian authorities have repeatedly decried reports of Russian military setbacks or civilian deaths in Ukraine as “fake” reports. State media outlets refer to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a “special military operation” rather than a “war” or “invasion.”\n\nThe law includes sentences of up to three years or fines for spreading what authorities deem to be false news about the military, but the maximum punishment rises to 15 years for cases deemed to have led to “severe consequences.”\n\nRussia blocks access to Facebook, Twitter in country\n\nRussia's media regulator made back-to-back announcements Friday that it was blocking access to both Facebook and Twitter across the country.\n\nThe news came amid a crackdown on media sources in Russia as the country passed a law allowing for 15-year prison sentences for intentionally spreading “fake” information about military action.\n\nRussian communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, said it cut access to Facebook over its alleged “discrimination” of the Russian media and state information resources. It said the restrictions introduced by Facebook owner Meta on the RT and other state-controlled media violate Russian law.\n\nThe agency followed up with cutting access to Twitter to be in line with the Russian Prosecutor General’s office decision. The watchdog has previously accused Twitter of failing to delete the content banned by the Russian authorities and slowed down access to it.\n\n\"We will continue to do everything we can to restore our services so they remain available to people to safely and securely express themselves and organize for action,\" said Nick Clegg, president for global affairs for Facebook's parent company Meta.\n\nClegg said Monday the company wasn't pulling its platforms from Russia on its own accord because Russian people were using them to protest the war. Clegg said Russia had been \"throttling\" the platform, though, to prevent protests.\n\n1.2 million refugees have fled Ukraine, UN says\n\nMore than 1.2 million refugees have fled from Ukraine since the conflict began, the United Nations' refugee agency said Friday.\n\nThursday, more than 165,000 people left the country, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nMost leaving are women, children and older people , said spokesperson Shabia Mantoo, and the majority are fleeing to Poland, though others have gone to Hungary, Moldova, Slovakia and Romania. Some have also fled to Russia and Belarus.\n\nHowever, an increasing number of reports indicate people of color fleeing Ukraine are facing discrimination at the border. The crisis highlights a double standard in the way nations treat refugees based on country of origin, race, religion and more, academics and refugees say. Many of the same European nations that turned away refugees from the Middle East, Africa and Asia in the past are now largely welcoming refugees from Ukraine.\n\n— Ryan Miller and Grace Hauck\n\nZelenskyy blasts NATO over refusal to implement no-fly zone\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a defiant and emotional speech, condemned NATO over its refusal to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine and said the move would only embolden Russia.\n\n“All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity,” he said in a nighttime address. “The alliance has given the green light to the bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages by refusing to create a no-fly zone.”\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Friday the military organization would not implement a no-fly zone or place troops on the ground in Ukraine over fears it could provoke widespread war throughout Europe with nuclear-armed Russia.\n\n\"Allies agree that we should not have NATO planes operating over Ukrainian airspace or NATO troops on Ukrainian territory,\" Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels after chairing a meeting of NATO foreign ministers, describing it as a \"painful decision.\"\n\nStoltenberg said bringing NATO troops or planes to Ukraine would only further escalate the conflict and bring about more destruction. \"If we did that, we'd end up with something that that could end in a full fledged war in Europe involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering,\" he added.\n\nUN Human Rights Council to set up panel for Ukraine\n\nA three-person expert panel will monitor potential human rights violations in Ukraine after an overwhelming vote from the United Nation's Human Rights Council.\n\nThe U.N.'s top human rights body voted 32-2, with 13 abstentions, to create the international panel. Only Russia and Eritrea opposed the resolution, with China abstaining.\n\nIn a tweet, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the creation of the panel, saying, \"Russian war criminals will be held accountable.\"\n\nInternational law experts have raised concerns about war crimes, including the targeting of civilians, and the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, which is separate from the U.N., said earlier this week he was also opening an investigation.\n\nWestern leaders condemn Russian attacks at Ukraine power plant\n\nThe office of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he will seek an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting after Russian troops in Ukraine attacked a nuclear power plant and sparked a fire.\n\nJohnson’s office says he spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the early hours of the morning. He says Britain will raise the issue immediately with Russia and close partners.\n\n“The Prime Minister said the reckless actions of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe,” Johnson’s office said in a statement. “He said (the United Kingdom) would do everything it could to ensure the situation did not deteriorate further.”\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he also spoke with Zelenskyy about the attacks on the power plant.\n\n“These unacceptable attacks by Russia must cease immediately,” he said on Twitter.\n\nChina also said it is “seriously concerned about the safety and security” of nuclear facilities in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainians in US granted temporary protection from deportation\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security on Thursday announced temporary protected status (TPS) for Ukrainians living in the United States, which will shield them from deportation for the next 18 months, as Ukraine battles ongoing attacks from Russia.\n\n“Russia’s premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine has resulted in an ongoing war, senseless violence, and Ukrainians forced to seek refuge in other countries,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. “In these extraordinary times, we will continue to offer our support and protection to Ukrainian nationals in the United States.”\n\nIndividuals must have continuously lived in the U.S. since March 1 to be eligible for TPS, DHS said. That would apply to approximately 30,000 Ukrainian nationals. Those who attempt to travel to the U.S. after March 1 do not qualify for TPS.\n\n— Rebecca Morin\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/18/europe/russia-bloggers-ukraine-criticism-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Setbacks in Ukraine trigger rare criticism of Russia's war effort by ...", "text": "Lviv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nThe Russian army’s performance in Ukraine has been less than impressive according to Western intelligence assessments – and that viewpoint is gaining ground among some in Russia itself.\n\nThree Russian military bloggers have suddenly launched into damning criticism of the operation, and especially the debacle of a failed crossing of the Siverskyi Donets river last week. The three bloggers combined have more than three million subscribers on Telegram.\n\nA prominent former officer who regularly appears on state television also weighed in with a gloomy view of Russia’s military prospects in Ukraine.\n\nSuch public criticism of the military operation in Ukraine is very rare. The Kremlin insists the campaign is on schedule.\n\nThe carping appears to have been triggered by a catalog of setbacks, the worst being the disastrous attempts to cross the Siverskyi Donets crossing last week. Satellite imagery shows at least 70 Russian armored vehicles and tanks were destroyed and hundreds of soldiers may have been killed.\n\nOn the evening of May 12, prominent Russian military correspondent Yuri Kotenok reposted accounts and images of the failed crossing, including one from a Ukrainian source.\n\nKotenok, who has nearly 300,000 subscribers to his Telegram channel, reposted one account that castigated the Russian officer responsible and blamed him for crowding so many vehicles in a small area by the river.\n\nIn response to criticism from some subscribers, Kotenok retorted: “If you want fairy tales, then you have come to the wrong place. In such a case you should go to officialdom.”\n\nHe said his role was “to provide with correct assessment, to speak good of the good, and bad of the bad, but to say the TRUTH.”\n\nKotenok even had a dig at Russian television coverage. “If you want to sit in a warm bath and ‘fight’ softly and soothingly, then you are welcome to the television. There you will find a lot of things for the delight of your ears and eyes,” he said.\n\nThe correspondent has been on the frontlines of other conflicts and said that he carried shrapnel in his body, before concluding: “In war it happens that we suffer losses. Know this and … be silent if you have nothing to say in essence.”\n\nSmoke rises from what appears to be a makeshift bridge across the Siverskyi Donets River in a handout image from Ukrainian Airborne Forces Command, provided on May 12, 2022. Ukrainian Airborne Forces Command/Reuters\n\nCalls for change\n\nSeveral other popular Telegram accounts in Russia picked up the theme.\n\nIn a series of posts, blogger Vladlen Tatarskiy blamed the Russian commander of the operation. “Until we find out the name of this ‘military genius’ who wasted the BTG [battalion tactical group] near the river and he publicly answers for this, there will be no reforms in the army,” he wrote.\n\n“The offensive in the Donbas is being hampered,” he said, “not only due to the lack of effective intelligence from UAVs [drones], but also due to such generals.”\n\nHe said he’d been warning for 18 months that Russian forces lacked both strike and reconnaissance drones.\n\nTatarskiy told CNN that he was not criticizing the entirety of what the Kremlin calls Russia’s “special military operation” but “individual episodes,” and he still believed Russia would achieve its goals in Ukraine. “I will personally make every effort to it,” he added, speaking to CNN by text message.\n\nNevertheless, he also called for broad change. “All the areas need to be improved,” he said. “Each war reveals some drawbacks, shortcomings, or false experiences, experiences that need to be adjusted to the modern realities. So absolutely all spheres need reform,” said Tatarskiy.\n\nAnother Telegram blogger sharing his views goes by the name “vysokogovorit,” and has nearly 400,000 subscribers.\n\n“Didn’t the commander of the crossing at Bilohorivka have information that in the third month of the war, it was not permissible to move in large convoys, and let alone to accumulate them in a narrow fire-swept area in front of a water barrier?” he posted.\n\n“How much of an idiot do you have to be to not understand this? Although this may not be idiocy, but direct sabotage.”\n\nVysokogovorit said he’d been part of a river crossing near Izium. “So I know what I’m talking about.”\n\nBlogger Yuriy Podolyaka, who has more than two million subscribers, echoed the criticism and later posted that the Russian Defense Ministry had conducted an analysis of the pontoon bridge disaster and that lessons were being learned. CNN cannot verify his claim.\n\nThe outbursts from such popular Telegram channels were as brief as they were unexpected. All three accounts quickly returned to familiar themes such as alleged atrocities of the Ukrainian army. But the fact that they even aired such views and have not been taken out of circulation has surprised some observers.\n\nA Russian military convoy moves on a highway in an area controlled by Russian-backed separatist forces near Mariupol, Ukraine, on April 16, 2022. Alexei Alexandrov/AP\n\n‘Informational sedatives’\n\nDoubts about the course of the Russian operation have even emerged on one of state television’s flagship shows. On Monday’s edition of Rossiya One’s 60 Minutes, retired colonel Mikhail Khodarenok warned that “the situation for us will clearly get worse.”\n\nKhodarenok rejected the claim that the Ukrainian armed forces are in crisis and on the verge of a “moral collapse” – describing such propaganda as “informational sedatives.” “To put it mildly, this is not true,” he said.\n\nDespite pushback from the show’s presenter, Khodarenok estimated that Ukraine could arm one million people. And with the US Lend-Lease military aid program beginning soon, he said, along with European assistance, “we really need to treat this million Ukrainian soldiers as a reality in the near future.”\n\nUkrainian soldiers’ morale is more important than their training, he insisted. “The desire to defend their motherland as they understand it in Ukraine very much exists,” he said.\n\n“Ultimately victory on the battlefield depends on the high morale of troops who are spilling blood for ideas they are ready to fight for,” Khodarenok added – possibly hinting at continuing reports of low morale in some Russian units in Ukraine.\n\nKhodarenok also took a critical view of Russia’s broader situation. “We are in total geopolitical isolation, the whole world is against us but we don’t want to admit it,” he said. “As far as China and India are concerned, their support for us isn’t so unconditional.”\n\nAnother critical voice is a former commander in the separatist Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) militia, Igor Strelkov – who was the DPR’s self-proclaimed minister of defense when the Malaysian airliner MH17 was allegedly shot down by men under his command in 2014.\n\nStill influential in the DPR, Strelkov wrote Monday that “the widely advertised late-April and early-May operation to defeat the Donetsk group of the enemy has FAILED.”\n\nService members of pro-Russian troops drive armored vehicles near Novoazovsk in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region on May 6, 2022. Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters\n\nIn a long screed, Strelkov said that “only tactical successes have been reached. Not a single large locality has been liberated…It’s clear now that by early summer Donbas will not be fully liberated.”\n\nStrelkov, whose Telegram channel has nearly 400,000 followers, said that the Russian high command was too obvious in its approach and lacked any element of tactical surprise.\n\nBesides “individual examples of ‘outstanding lunacy’” – such as the attempt to cross the river, Strelkov said that “the losses incurred in daily offensive battles (that do not end with the enemy’s defeat) cannot be quickly compensated by trained replacements.”\n\n“No one knows where [Ukraine] will strike and when our troops will finally run out of steam (although this can also be predicted which I’m not going to do),” he added pessimistically.\n\nThese rare voices of criticism in Russia and the DPR almost certainly do not portend any change of strategy on the part of the Kremlin, but their airing as Ukraine presses a counteroffensive in the northeast is in stark contrast to the monopoly of the state over media coverage of the invasion.", "authors": ["Tim Lister Taras Zadorozhnyy", "Tim Lister", "Taras Zadorozhnyy"], "publish_date": "2022/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/11/europe/ukraine-donbas-battle-russia-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Russia has appointed a new general for Ukraine. Can Moscow ...", "text": "Lviv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has a new general overseeing his war in Ukraine, and his military commanders are signaling a new phase in the war: an all-out effort to take and hold the portions of Ukraine’s Donbas region still under Ukrainian control.\n\nUkrainians seem to be taking that threat at face value. In the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, local officials have been urging many communities to evacuate, opening up humanitarian corridors for civilians to leave for safer parts of Ukraine.\n\nIn northeastern Kharkiv region, authorities are evacuating the towns of Barvinkove and Lozova. In Dnipro, a regional capital in east-central Ukraine, the mayor, Borys Filatov, has requested that women, children and the elderly leave.\n\n“The situation is gradually heating up in Donbas, and we understand that April will be quite hot,” Filatov said recently. “Therefore, a huge request: Everyone who has the opportunity (as I have said repeatedly) to leave – first of all, this applies to women, children, and older people who are not involved in the work of critical infrastructure.”\n\nA satellite image from Maxar Technologies shows what appears to be an 8-mile-long Russian convoy to the east of Kharkiv. Maxar Technologies\n\nCan Russia mount a terrifying new offensive in the east? The latest satellite images collected and analyzed by Maxar Technologies show an 8-mile-long Russian military convoy making its south through the eastern Ukraine town of Velkyi Burluk, to the east of the city of Kharkiv.\n\nIn remarks on national television Saturday, Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s Interior Minister, said Kharkiv was “being shelled practically all day long” and that a Russian offensive was expected in the Kharkiv region, from the direction of Izium.\n\nMilitary experts and western officials have also speculated that Putin’s generals are feeling the pressure to deliver some sort of results ahead of May 9, when Russia marks Victory Day, the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. But a fresh analysis from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a US-based think tank, casts some doubt on Russia’s ability to concentrate the forces needed to make a breakthrough in the Donbas.\n\n“We assess that the Russian military will struggle to amass a large and combat-capable force of mechanized units to operate in Donbas within the next few months,” the analysis states. “Russia will likely continue to throw badly damaged and partially reconstituted units piecemeal into offensive operations that make limited gains at great cost.”\n\nMilitary analysts and observers say Russia may struggle to reorganize forces that have been battered by the Ukrainian military, particularly in the defense of Kyiv and northern Ukraine.\n\nBefore the invasion, Russia had arrayed approximately 120 battalion tactical groups around Ukraine. According to one European official, about a quarter of those forces are “effectively inoperable” after heavy casualties and the destruction of hardware. A US defense official on April 8 gave a slightly different estimate, saying Russian forces were now “below 85 percent of their assessed available combat power” assembled ahead of the February 24 invasion.\n\nThose US defense estimates, ISW said, “unintentionally exaggerate the Russian military’s current capabilities to fight.”\n\nAccording to ISW, “the dozens of Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) that retreated from around Kyiv likely possess combat power that is a fraction of what the numbers of units or total numbers of personnel with those units would suggest. Russian units that have fought in Ukraine have taken fearful damage.”\n\nA commander with a track record of brutality\n\nArmy General Alexander Dvornikov, the commander of Russia’s Southern Military District, has been named as theater commander of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine, according to a US official and a European official.\n\nDvornikov, 60, was the first commander of Russia’s military operations in Syria, after Putin sent troops there in September 2015 to back the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nDuring Dvornikov’s command in Syria from September 2015 to June 2016, Russian aircraft backed the Assad regime and its allies as they laid siege to rebel-held eastern Aleppo, bombarding densely populated neighborhoods and causing major civilian casualties. The city fell to Syrian government forces in December 2016.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2003 Dvornikov served in Russia’s lengthy pacification campaign in the north Caucasus, including the Second Chechen War, which left the regional capital of Chechnya, Grozny, in ruins.\n\nRussian forces have used a similarly heavy-handed approach in parts of Ukraine, striking residential buildings in major cities and demolishing much of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol.\n\nDvornikov was awarded the title of “Hero the Russian Federation” by the Kremlin in March 2016 for his services.\n\nThe appointment of a new overall commander to lead Russia’s war in Ukraine appears to be an effort to remedy another problem that has hampered Russian forces: lack of coordination.\n\n“The Russians are apparently attempting to resolve one of the problems from which their initial invasion suffered by making Southern Military District Commander General Alexander Dvornikov the single overall commander of operations in Ukraine,” ISW stated.\n\n“This simplification of the Russian command structure may not resolve all of Russia’s command problems, however… Russian forces will likely continue to struggle to establish coherent and efficient command and control arrangements for the foreseeable future.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean the coming weeks will be easy for Ukrainian forces fighting in the east. ISW said Russia’s military “likely will make gains nevertheless and may either trap or wear down Ukrainian forces enough to secure much of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, but it is at least equally likely that these Russian offensives will culminate before reaching their objectives, as similar Russian operations have done.”\n\nIn remarks Sunday, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine was prepared for intense fighting.\n\n“Ukraine is ready for big battles,” said Podolyak. “Ukraine must win them, particularly in Donbas. And after that, Ukraine will get a more powerful negotiating position, from which it can dictate certain conditions. After that, the presidents [of Ukraine and Russia] will meet. That may take two or three weeks.”\n\nThe next weeks may prove if that is an overly optimistic scenario. But it presents what appears to be a negotiating position, as much as a military assessment: Putin can talk now, or risk being significantly weaker later.", "authors": ["Nathan Hodge"], "publish_date": "2022/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/03/europe/bucha-ukraine-civilian-deaths-intl/index.html", "title": "Bucha: Bodies strewn across street in Kyiv suburb as Ukraine ...", "text": "Lviv, Ukraine (CNN) The lifeless bodies of at least 20 civilian men line a single street in the town of Bucha near the Ukrainian capital .

A third man lies in the middle of the road, near the charred remains of a burned-out car.\n\nThe shocking images of the carnage in Bucha were captured by Agence France-Presse on Saturday, the same day Ukraine declared the town liberated from Russian troops. Accounts of alleged Russian atrocities are emerging as its forces retreat from areas near Kyiv following a failed bid to encircle the capital.\n\nThe town of Bucha has endured five weeks of near-constant firefights. Now officials and human rights groups are blaming the civilian deaths on the departed Russian forces.\n\n\"Corpses of executed people still line the Yabluska street in Bucha. Their hands are tied behind their backs with white 'civilian' rags, they were shot in the back of their heads. So you can imagine what kind of lawlessness they perpetrated here,\" Bucha mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk told Reuters on Saturday.\n\nUkrainian soldiers are pictured in Bucha on Saturday, after Russian troops retreated from the area.\n\nIn a video address Sunday after the reports out of Bucha, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for an end of Russian \"war crimes.\"\n\n\"The world has already seen many war crimes. At different times. On different continents. But it is time to do everything possible to make the war crimes of the Russian military the last manifestation of such evil on earth,\" he said.\n\nZelensky called on Russian leaders to be held accountable for the actions of the nation's military.\n\n\"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being fulfilled. Such orders. Such a fulfillment. And joint responsibility. For these murders, for these tortures, for these arms torn off by explosions that lie on the streets. For shots in the back of the head of tied people. This is how the Russian state will now be perceived. This is your image,\" Zelensky said.\n\nThe alleged atrocities in Bucha have drawn international outrage, with Western leaders, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken , calling for war crimes investigations and increasing sanctions on Russia.\n\nCNN has not been able to independently confirm the details around the men's deaths.\n\nIn his address, Zelensky announced a \"mechanism of justice\" would be established to investigate crimes committed by Russian soldiers in Ukrainian territory. The mechanism would be supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Prosecutor General's Office, the National Police, the Security Service, the Intelligence Service and other government branches, he said.\n\n\"This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world bring to concrete justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people,\" he said.\n\nZelensky said he will provide more information on the state of Ukrainian territory that was occupied by Russian forces.\n\n\"All partners of Ukraine will be informed in detail about what happened in the temporarily occupied territory of our state. War crimes in Bucha and other cities during the Russian occupation will also be considered by the (United Nations) Security Council on Tuesday,\" he said.\n\nHe also noted that efforts are underway to restore electricity and water to Bucha, as well as reestablishing medical institutions and infrastructure.\n\nZelensky once again invoked the need for stronger sanctions against Russia.\n\n\"There will definitely be a new package of sanctions against Russia. But I'm sure that's not enough. More conclusions are needed. Not only about Russia, but also about the political behavior that actually allowed this evil to come to our land,\" he said.\n\nAsked during an appearance earlier Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" if Russia was carrying out genocide in his country, Zelensky said: \"Indeed. This is genocide.\"\n\n\"The elimination of the whole nation, and the people. We are the citizens of Ukraine. We have more than 100 nationalities. This is about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities,\" he said.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has claimed the extensive footage of Bucha was \"fake,\" saying \"not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions\" during Russia's occupation of the city. \"In the settlements of the Kiev region, Russian military personnel delivered and issued 452 tons of humanitarian aid to civilians,\" it said in a statement.\n\nA separate statement claimed the footage was staged. \"Stories about Bucha appeared in several foreign media outlets at once, which looks like a planned media campaign,\" the statement said. \"Taking into account that the troops left the city on March 30, where was the footage for four days? Their absence only confirms the fake.\"\n\nThe Russian government has consistently responded to allegations of civilian casualties inflicted by Russian forces with blanket denials. After the Russian air force bombed a maternity hospital on March 9, Russian officials attempted to cast doubt on widespread media reports, with one Russian diplomat accusing a victim of the bombing -- a woman who escaped from the bombing, bloodied and still pregnant -- of being an actor and not a real victim.\n\nMass grave\n\nThe toll of the Russian invasion was apparent at a mass grave in Bucha. People cried as they attempted to locate the bodies of lost loved ones at a grave located in the grounds of the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints on Sunday, according to a CNN team at the scene.\n\nBucha residents told CNN that bodies were first buried in the grave in the first few days of the war. They believe 150 people are buried in the site, many of whom were civilians killed in the fighting around Bucha.\n\nCNN saw at least a dozen bodies in body bags piled inside the grave. Some were already partially covered.\n\nThe mayor of Bucha said in public remarks Saturday that up to 300 victims could be buried at the site.\n\nCNN was unable to independently verify those numbers or the identities and nationalities of those buried in the grave.\n\nThe earth on the church grounds appeared to have been recently moved so it is feasible that more bodies could be buried there.\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Sunday that reports emerging from towns in the Kyiv region revealed a \"post-apocalyptic picture\" of life under Russian occupation.\n\n\"This is a special appeal aimed at drawing the world's attention to those war crimes, crimes against humanity, which were committed by Russian troops in Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel,\" Arestovych said. \"These are liberated cities, a picture from horror movies, a post-apocalyptic picture.\"\n\n\"Victims of these war crimes have already been found, including raped women who they tried to burn, local government officials killed, children killed, elderly people killed, men killed, many of them with tied hands, traces of torture and shot in the back of the head. Robberies, attempts to take gold, valuables, carpets, washing machines. It, of course, will be taken into account by the Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine and law enforcement agencies and international criminal courts.\"\n\nBodies lie in a street in Bucha on Saturday. A portion of this photo has been blurred to protect the victim's identity.\n\nThe evidence of apparent atrocities in Bucha came as Human Rights Watch (HRW) announced it had documented allegations of war crimes in the occupied areas of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Kharkiv regions.\n\nHRW said Sunday that the allegations include \"a case of repeated rape; two cases of summary execution, one of six men, the other of one man; and other cases of unlawful violence and threats against civilians between February 27 and March 14, 2022.\"\n\nIn Bucha, Russian forces \"rounded up five men and summarily executed one of them\" on March 4, HRW wrote. A witness told the group that soldiers forced the men to kneel on the road and pulled their shirts over their heads, before shooting one of the men in the back of the head.\n\nHRW also alleges that on February 27, six men were rounded up in the village of Staryi Bykiv in the Chernihiv region and later executed.\n\nIn Malaya Rohan, a village in the Kharkiv region, a Russian soldier repeatedly raped a woman in a school where she was sheltering with her family on March 13, the victim told HRW. \"She said that he beat her and cut her face, neck, and hair with a knife,\" HRW wrote. The woman fled to Kharkiv the following day, \"where she was able to get medical treatment and other services.\"\n\nAnd in the village of Vorzel, 31 miles northwest of Kyiv, Russian soldiers \"threw a smoke grenade into a basement, then shot a woman and a 14-year-old child as they emerged from the basement, where they had been sheltering,\" HRW said.\n\n\"The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians,\" Hugh Williamson, HRW's Europe and Central Asia director, said in the statement. \"Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces' custody should be investigated as war crimes.\"\n\nCNN has not independently verified the details of the HRW report and has requested comment from the Russian defense ministry.\n\nSunday's developments in Ukraine have hastened calls for war crimes investigations.\n\nBlinken said the State Department would help document any atrocities the Russian military committed against Ukrainian civilians.\n\n\"You can't help but see these images as a punch to the gut,\" he told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union\" Sunday, when asked about the civilian killings in Bucha.\n\n\"Since the aggression, we've come out and said that we believe that Russian forces have committed war crimes, and we've been working to document that, to provide the information we have to the relevant institutions and organizations that will put all of this together.

The Azov battalion had by then been integrated into the Ukrainian National Guard.\n\nAn effective fighting force that's very much involved in the current conflict, the battalion has a history of neo-Nazi leanings, which have not been entirely extinguished by its integration into the Ukrainian military. ​\n\nIn its heyday as an autonomous militia, the Azov Battalion was associated with White supremacists and neo-Nazi ideology and insignia. It was especially active in and around Mariupol in 2014 and 2015. CNN teams in the area at the time reported Azov's embrace of neo-Nazi emblems and paraphernalia.\n\nAfter its integration into the Ukrainian National Guard, amid discussions in the US Congress about designating the Azov Movement a foreign terrorist organization, Ukraine's then minister of internal affairs, Arsen Avakov, defended the unit. \"The shameful information campaign about the alleged spread of Nazi ideology (among Azov members) is a deliberate attempt to discredit the 'Azov' unit and the National Guard of Ukraine,\" he told the online newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda in 2019.\n\nThe battalion still operates as a relatively autonomous entity. It has been prominent in defending Mariupol in recent weeks, and its resistance has been widely praised by members of the government.\n\nFor Putin, who has falsely claimed Ukraine's government is run by \"drug addicts and neo-Nazis,\" Azov presents an obvious target. Moscow has given the regiment an outsized role in the conflict, routinely accusing it of human rights abuses.\n\nOn March 7, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations blamed the Azov regiment for blocking an evacuation corridor in the besieged port city, saying they were using \"citizens as a human shield.\" That claim has been repeated consistently in Russian media.\n\nThe same day, Azov major Denis Prokopenko said in a video shared on the regiment's Twitter account that the \"attempts to organize a safe corridor for the (relocation) of civilian people... failed because of several actions of the enemy (Russian forces) in the assembly area.\"\n\nAfter the bombing of a Mariupol theater that was sheltering civilians and had \"children\" written in Russian on the ground on either side of the building, the Russian Defense Ministry accused \"militants of the nationalist 'Azov' battalion\" of carrying out the attack. ​\n\nIn the Russian disinformation playbook, the Azov movement is a tempting target -- one where fact and disinformation can be elided.\n\nKyiv citizens take part in military training for civilians conducted by Azov regiment veterans on February 6, 2022.\n\nThe existence of an identifiably Azov element within the Ukrainian armed forces -- and an effective element at that -- poses uncomfortable questions for the Ukrainian government and its Western allies, which continue to send arms to the country.\n\nCNN has reached out to ​Ukraine's defense ministry for comment.\n\nIn the not-too-distant past, Azov's leadership openly espoused ​White supremacist views and cultivated links with similarly minded groups and individuals in the West.\n\nIn 2010, Andriy Biletsky, now leader of the National Corps, the Azov movement's political wing, reportedly said his goal was to \"lead the White races of the world in a final crusade.\"\n\nIn a statement to CNN, the Azov regiment said it \"appreciates and respects Andriy Biletsky as the regiment's founder and first commander, but we have nothing to do with his political activities and the National Corps party\" -- adding the former commander never made such comments.\n\nThe statement said that Azov's \"motivation has always angered Russia. Therefore, disinformation attacks on the AZOV Regiment have not stopped since 2014.\"\n\nIt added that the movement has \"repeatedly denied allegations of fascism, nazism and racism,\" and have Ukrainians of all different backgrounds including \"Greeks, Jews, Crimean Tatars, Russians\" who \"continue to serve in AZOV.\"\n\n\"Most of them are Russian-speaking, most are Orthodox. But there are Catholics and Protestants, Pagans and those who profess Islam and Judaism, and there are atheists,\" Azov asserted.\n\nIt noted that the Azov regiment's role is as \"a special unit of the National Guard of Ukraine, and is subordinated exclusively to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief -- the President of Ukraine, by the way, a Jew.\"\n\n\"It would be absurd to think that we are united by the idea of white racism or nazism,\" the Azov statement added.\n\nDespite the Azov movement's international notoriety, Ukraine \"is not a cesspit for Nazi sympathizers,\" according to Alexander Ritzmann, a senior adviser at the Counter Extremism Project (CEP), based in Berlin.\n\nHe noted that in the last elections in Ukraine in 2019, Azov's political wing only won 2.15% of the vote, and Biletsky lost his seat in parliament.\n\nPlus -- Ritzmann says -- there are far-right actors prominent in Russia, too. \"There is a far-right extremist problem on both sides in the conflict, but there seems to be a bias in only reporting on Ukraine's far-right problem,\" he said.\n\nAzov's beginnings\n\nThe Azov Battalion was formed in 2014, the same year Russian-backed rebels began seizing territory across Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, and Russia invaded and captured Crimea. At the time, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense encouraged volunteer battalions to join the resistance campaign and help its struggling army.\n\nThe battalion's role in recapturing Mariupol in June 2014 from Russian-backed forces brought it \"hero status\" in Ukraine, said Ritzmann.\n\nBut that status came with baggage -- the far-right views of some members and neo-Nazi insignia. These included the black sun, \"a pagan symbol appropriated by Nazis for their pseudo-religion,\" and the Wolfsangel, \"a symbol that far-right extremists have also adopted,\" Ritzmann said.\n\nAndriy Biletsky, the leader of the National Corps political party, reportedly said his goal was to \"lead the White races of the world in a final crusade.\"\n\nAzov's leaders have denied the neo-Nazi associations, saying the Wolfsangel \"N\" and \"I' mean \"national idea.\"\n\nEven though the Azov Battalion was co-founded by Biletsky, who previously led the radical right group Patriot of Ukraine, the group was armed by the state and partly funded by local oligarchs in eastern Ukraine. That funding included money from the Jewish tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky, Ritzmann said. The US State Department sanctioned Kolomoisky in March 2021. The previous year, the US Justice Department placed him under investigation on accusations of embezzlement and fraud. ​\n\nCNN has reached out to Kolomoisky's lawyer for comment.\n\nInternational outreach\n\nWhen the Azov Battalion was brought under the command of the Ministry of Internal Affairs as a regiment in 2014, \"politically motivated fighters like (Andriy) Biletsky left and founded the Azov movement so they can do their ultra-nationalist, far-right work, which they were not allowed to do in the Ukrainian military,\" Ritzmann said.\n\nThe political party Biletsky formed, the National Corps, which the US Department of State described in 2018 as a nationalist hate group, \"is essentially the spine of what we today call the Azov movement,\" Kacper Rekawek, a research fellow with the Center for Research on Extremism (C-REX) at the University of Oslo, told CNN.\n\n\"The Azov movement is a dangerous key player of the transnational extreme-right and has served as a network hub for several years now, with strong ties to far-right extremists in many European Union countries and the United States,\" Ritzmann said.\n\nNationalist activists light flares and shout anti-Russian slogans during a demonstration in front of President Volodymyr Zelensky's offices in Kyiv on October 14, 2020.\n\nOlena Semenyaka, the head of the National Corps' international department, attended a festival in 2018 organized by German neo-Nazis; and in 2019 she spoke at the far-right Scanza Forum in Sweden alongside British neo-Nazi Mark Collett.\n\nSince forming in 2014, the ​Azov movement has grown to include a militia, summer camps for kids and paramilitary training centers. It runs activities, including music festivals, political events and mixed-martial-arts tournaments, as it promoted itself in the international far-right space.\n\nThe National Corps has repeatedly demonstrated its disdain for liberal values in its treatment of minority groups -- with few repercussions.\n\nA 2018 US State Department report found that the movement's militia \"attacked and destroyed a Romani camp in Kyiv after its residents failed to respond to their ultimatum to leave the area within 24 hours,\" in full view of the local police.\n\nThe 'Death Star'\n\n\"People always assume it (the Azov regiment and Azov movement) is one Death Star,\" Rekawek said. \"Year by year, the connections (between the regiment and the movement) are looser,\" he said, explaining that the battalion's ranks now include Ukrainians who have no affinity with its neo-Nazi past.\n\nRitzmann says the far-right element in Ukraine's army is no different to what's been detected in other militaries, such as in Germany and the US\n\n\"Presumably, far-right extremists serve in the Ukrainian military as they do in all other militaries -- valid data regarding the exact numbers are not available,\" he said.\n\n\"Back in 2015, the Azov Regiment itself claimed to have between 10% and 20% far-right extremists in their ranks,\" but those figures are possibly smaller today, he said.\n\nBut the regiment still uses the Wolfsangel symbol, and leaders of the Azov movement, who used to be commanders in the unit, continue to visit it, said Oleksiy Kuzmenko, a Ukrainian-American investigative journalist focusing on the Ukrainian far-right.\n\n\"The current leader of the Azov Regiment, Denis 'Redis' Prokopenko, is part of the core of the Azov movement since 2014, and served under commanders who went on to lead the Azov movement political and street wings,\" Kuzmenko told CNN.\n\nProkopenko's deputy, Svyatoslav \"Kalyna\" Palamar, has explicitly praised the movement's founder, Biletsky, as \"a leader who 'finds sponsors that really invest money' into the regiment,\" Kuzmenko said.\n\nIn this photo taken outside Kyiv on July 14, 2017, a student at a paramilitary camp for children calls the rank to attention.\n\nKuzmenko points out that as of 2021, the regiment was \"actively involved in the training of the movement's youth leaders,\" and its website has a link to the movement's YouTube channel.\n\n\"Ukraine and (the) West's inaction on these issues paved the way for Putin to quite literally weaponize them against Ukraine in an attempt to justify his aggression,\" Kuzmenko said.\n\n\"While it's correct to point (out that) Ukraine's far-right has minimal electoral support, they (Azov) have enjoyed near impunity for violence aimed at minorities, were unchecked in their efforts to build influence in military and security forces, and have been normalized by Ukraine's senior leaders,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement to CNN on Wednesday, Prokopenko said: \"Whoever calls us Nazis is deeply mistaken. We have young brave soldiers who give their lives for the independence of Ukraine and throw themselves under enemy tanks.\"\n\nForeign fighters\n\nSince it formed, the Azov movement has recruited foreign fighters motivated by White supremacism to fight in Ukraine, experts say. Russia's full-scale invasion of the country, and Zelensky's call for foreign volunteers to join the fight, have raised concerns about radicalization in the war.\n\n\"My concern is that people, especially far-right extremists in Europe, (will gain) combat experience and training in the Ukrainian theater and then use that for terrorist attacks in Europe proper,\" Colin P.

What ...", "text": "On Labor Day weekend in 2020, the campgrounds and trailer parks around the Grand Canyon were quiet. With excessive heat warnings throughout the country and restrictions in place to slow the spread of a deadly virus, the holiday weekend was different from years past. Still, a steady stream of RVers and campers rolled in and out of the campgrounds on the South Rim.\n\nBut those who had come to see one of the nation’s most treasured natural wonders were met with a hazy view. One morning, the other side of the Canyon was barely visible. The striking definition of ridges, the red and orange palettes the Canyon is known for had been flattened by a smoky, at times opaque, haze.\n\nSmoke from some of the largest and hottest wildfires in history in California, Oregon and Washington had blanketed the West, and even reached the East Coast.\n\nFor some, the haze was reminiscent of the 1990s, when the Grand Canyon had often been similarly obscured. Pollution from Los Angeles, vehicles, coal-fired power plants and controlled burns seriously impaired the view at the Canyon at least 75 days a year, dulling its colorful vistas into a muted, murky landscape.\n\nHaze in the Grand Canyon was a particular concern for Arizona, the Grand Canyon state. At the time, Arizona led efforts to address smog in the Canyon, initiating partnerships with other Western states and spurring federal policies that greatly improved both visibility at the Grand Canyon and air pollution across the country.\n\n“The Grand Canyon is like the canary in the coal mine,” said Roger Clark, a program director for the Grand Canyon Trust and an active member in the regional haze work from its earliest stages. “Visibility issues are an early warning sign of things going awry in the atmosphere.”\n\nBy the early 2000s, the partnership of Western states established out of the Grand Canyon haze work was tapped to address another phenomenon just entering mainstream consciousness: climate change.\n\nGrowing concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on the planet led Arizona to develop a comprehensive state climate action plan. Other states soon followed.\n\nToday, the effects of climate change on Arizona have become almost as evident as the smoke hanging over the canyon: dwindling snowpack and extreme drought are stretching Colorado River supplies thin, summer temperatures are getting hotter and increasing heat-related deaths, and more destructive wildfires are scorching landscapes and lives. Temperatures in Maricopa County alone have risen by nearly 2 degrees Celsius since record-keeping began in 1895.\n\nBut Arizona is not the leader it was 15 years ago when the state led the West on regional haze and then climate policy.\n\nCities have largely taken the lead on climate policies. In recent years, the governor and the Legislature have taken no cohesive action, enacting laws that prohibit mitigation efforts at a local level. One state law even prevents state agencies from monitoring greenhouse gases.\n\n“The state first and foremost needs to stand up and say that we have an issue with climate,” said Coral Evans, the mayor of Flagstaff, the first city in the state to declare a climate emergency. “That leadership needs to be there. We don't talk about climate change. Maybe a lot of people in leadership in our state don't have the lived experience that I have. I’m third generation. I grew up here. Things are definitely different.”\n\nPOLL: Most Arizonans want government to act on climate change\n\nA plan to act\n\nOn a hot day in August 2006, Steve Owens steeled himself before entering the governor’s office. As the director of the state Department of Environmental Quality, it was his job to brief then-Gov. Janet Napolitano on the state’s new climate action plan.\n\nHe and a coalition of dozens of stakeholders — businesspeople, scientists, environmentalists, energy experts, ranchers, river runners, auto industry executives — had worked for more than a year to develop a set of 49 policy recommendations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Arizona.\n\nThat day, Owens expected to defend the economic viability of the plan. Instead, the governor asked why the goals — reduce emissions to 2000 levels by 2020 and 50% below 2000 levels by 2040 — weren't more aggressive.\n\nNearly two decades ago, Arizona emerged as a national leader in developing strategies to combat fossil fuel-driven climate change. A wave of Democratic governors who were concerned about the issue were elected across the West. Republican governors like Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Jon Huntsman of Utah were vocal about wanting to lead on climate and environment issues.\n\nThe momentum was a response to federal inaction: In 2001, the George W. Bush administration announced that it would not implement the Kyoto Protocol, a landmark international treaty signed in 1997 that required nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. At the start of his second term, Bush passed numerous policies at the behest of polluting industries who didn’t want more regulation.\n\nBy 2005, the issue drew attention at a more local level. It turned out to be “a watershed year for states deciding it was time for them to step up on climate change,” said Patrick Cummins, senior policy advisor at Colorado State University’s Center for the New Energy Economy.\n\nThat year, Napolitano signed an executive order to create a state climate action plan, one of the first in the nation at a state level.\n\nIn the previous decade, Arizona had added fossil fuel pollutants to the atmosphere more than any other state. Between 1990 and 2005, Arizona’s emissions shot up a staggering 56%, a rate of increase three times the national average. The numbers gave Napolitano compelling reason to act.\n\n“It was a realization that climate was a really big deal and that we needed to have a plan, that we needed to put some intentionality into it,” Napolitano said in a recent interview. Napolitano recently resigned as the President of University of California to teach as a tenured professor at UC Berkeley's Goldman School of Public Policy.\n\n“It seemed to me that this was an area that Arizona needed to take up and also could be a leader in,” she said.\n\nA string of states followed: New Mexico, the Carolinas, Michigan, Florida, Pennsylvania all developed their own climate plans. Arizona dipped its toes into international climate collaboration, too: A few months after Napolitano’s executive order, Arizona and the Mexican state of Sonora declared they would work together to address emissions in the borderlands.\n\n“This had been just something done by governors in the Northeast and the West Coast and not by the heartland. Arizona was the first southwestern state to do this and one of the first red states in the country, period,” said Thomas Peterson, President of the Center for Climate Strategies. The Washington D.C.-based non-profit has worked with more than 20 states across the US and with countries around the world to develop strategies to lower emissions and achieve economic goals.\n\nThe organization leads states to find a consensus on policies and prepared the emissions inventory, forecast, and economic impact analyses for Arizona’s 2006 plan.\n\n“Arizona demonstrated that a very diverse group of stakeholders could reach agreements on a substantial list of things to do to address emissions,” Peterson said.\n\nSeven northeastern states had already signed a memorandum to create the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the first mandatory market-based program in the US to reduce emissions. Launched in 2009, it continues to be lauded for showing that economic growth can coincide with emissions reductions.\n\nIn 2007, Arizona attempted to spearhead a similar regional approach. Governors of three West Coast states, along with Arizona and New Mexico, signed a memorandum of understanding directing their environmental agencies to design a market-based mechanism to achieve regional emissions goals, what was known as a cap-and-trade program. Republican strongholds Utah and Montana signed on to the program too and the Western Climate Initiative was born.\n\nIn developing the 2006 plan, Arizona found that the transportation and electricity sectors accounted for nearly 40% each of the state’s total emissions. Cities were in a long-running fight with bad air pollution. Passenger vehicles were then and remain a main driver of the state's ozone pollution.\n\nAt the time, Napolitano and ADEQ officials determined that adopting the more stringent California Clean Car standards was necessary, especially in light of Arizona’s rapid growth in both population and vehicle use. The tailpipe standards would not only lower planet-heating emissions, but also help the state meet the stricter ozone standards announced by the Bush Administration in 2008.\n\n“While this regulation alone will not substantially reduce or reverse ongoing global climate change, it is inconceivable that those reduction targets could be achieved without actors like the state of Arizona undertaking reductions like this,” ADEQ stated in its final rulemaking.\n\nMany major policy recommendations from the plan were adopted by other states, helping the US make a significant dent in its emissions over the years. In fact, state policies have had a greater impact than the Great Recession in lowering national emissions.\n\n“There was this period when there was this enormous wave of action,” said Peterson. “But the action didn't get fully implemented and there's all this unfinished business. And that is the failure.”\n\nCLIMATE DISCUSSION: Republic panel talks about threats, solutions\n\nMomentum breaks down\n\nThe Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora were on the verge of signing on to the Western Climate Initiative when the Great Recession hit. By the time the Initiative launched in 2012, Arizona had already pulled out of the cap-and-trade program.\n\nWhen Napolitano was appointed to serve in the Obama Administration as Secretary of Homeland Security in 2009, Republican Jan Brewer landed in the governor’s office. The recession, California’s growing regulatory environment, and President Barack Obama’s election rapidly transformed the state’s political landscape.\n\n“2009-10 was a time in Arizona dominated by optimism about solar energy, skepticism about ‘cap and trade,’ and concern about California and the federal government determining Arizona’s environmental and economic competitiveness,” Ben Grumbles, the ADEQ director appointed by Brewer after Owens left for the EPA, wrote in an emailed statement to The Republic.\n\nHe now serves as Maryland’s Secretary of Environment and is an officer for the regional carbon market program in the northeast.\n\nOn Feb. 1, 2010, Brewer signed an executive order to pull Arizona from the Western Climate Initiative, saying the program would cripple the state’s economy. Two months later, she signed a law that prevented any state agencies from even monitoring greenhouse gas emissions. The law remains on the books today.\n\nIn a final blow to the momentum of the Napolitano era, Brewer signed an order that, in 2012, blocked the state from adopting California’s clean car standards. The Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry celebrated the repeal as vindication from California’s “overbearing regulatory environment.” Environmentalists decried the move.\n\n“Brewer and I had very different ideas about what Arizona needed and what good public policy was,” Napolitano said. “She focused on the immigration agenda almost to the exclusion, it seems, of everything else.”\n\nBrewer declined to be interviewed for this story.\n\nBrewer’s signing of SB 1070, an anti-immigration law, plunged Arizona into political chaos and landed the state in the national spotlight. The rise of the Tea Party and increasing political polarization across the nation pushed climate change to the sidelines and made it increasingly a partisan issue.\n\nDuring the Bush years, John McCain had been the only Republican senator to push for climate change legislation, but after his electoral defeat in 2008, he reverted to the party line and played a large role in blocking any climate legislation from reaching the senate floor.\n\nSince that time, there has been no comprehensive climate action from the governor or the Legislature. With the Trump Administration’s repeal of Obama-era clean car standards, despite the EPA’s finding that the rollback could lead to an additional 444 to 1,000 premature deaths from increased air pollution, the federal government has created an even lower backstop for a state already struggling to mitigate bad air.\n\n“Arizona was really standing out because of all the things we were doing,” Owens recalled. “It’s disappointing, the things that could have been done in the last 10, 15 years. With drought conditions that still persist, the record heats we continue to have, the Colorado river drying up, you would think people would be more concerned. But the people who are in positions to do something about it are in complete denial.”\n\nEmissions and climate change today\n\nWhen Flagstaff Mayor Coral Evans was a kid, she swam in the Rio de Flag every summer. The river flowed behind her grandfather’s house, its cool waters a welcome summer respite. By the time Halloween came around, winter had usually settled over the city. Sometimes the snow lasted through April.\n\nToday, Evans lives in the house her grandfather built in 1942, but the river behind it no longer flows like it used to. The heavy winters of Evans’ childhood are rarer. Ski resorts now spray manufactured snow onto the mountains to mark the beginning of ski season. The temperate summers Evans grew up with are warmer; every year, temperatures inch closer to reaching 100 degrees for the first time.\n\n“I have had the ability to experience firsthand the changes caused by this climate crisis we're experiencing,” said Evans, who is running for a seat in the state House as a Democrat. “The local impact of the climate crisis is devastating and is directly impacting our quality of life and our economy right now.”\n\nArizona’s carbon emissions aren’t as dire as the 2006 climate plan anticipated they would be. The plan predicted a whopping 148% increase in emissions by 2020 if Arizona failed to implement any of the recommended policies.\n\nJust before the Great Recession hit, Arizona had increased its emissions from 2000 levels by 20% . In 2008, the state spewed an all-time high of 102 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nThe recession, combined with improving technology over the years and utilities shifting to a more robust renewable energy portfolio, tempered the state’s emissions rate and led to a decrease in total emissions to 2000 levels by 2017, according to the US Energy Information Administration, the best state-level greenhouse gas emissions data in the absence of a state-run greenhouse gas inventory.\n\nStill, Arizona is falling behind in the West when it comes to proactive climate policy. In 2018, voters in Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada elected Democratic governors and legislatures. Soon after, Colorado joined California’s clean car standards. New Mexico and Nevada are moving to do the same. Earlier this year, a climate report ordered by the Utah Legislature developed a roadmap for tackling climate change and pollution.\n\nWhile climate change is a global problem, some of the most innovative and effective solutions in addressing emissions have come from the state and regional levels, and have even incentivized stronger action from the federal government.\n\n“It makes a national program more inevitable when enough states are doing it, so state action and state leadership is going to continue to be important,” said Cummins. “But ultimately when you look at what the scientists are telling us about cutting emissions in half by 2030, getting to net zero by 2050—this requires a national mobilization.”\n\nLocal efforts, state sabotage\n\nArizona’s cities and counties have taken the lead on climate action in the absence of state and national leadership. Flagstaff, Phoenix, and Pima County all conduct their own regular greenhouse gas emissions inventories. Maricopa County published its first inventory this year. Flagstaff, Phoenix, Tempe, and Tucson have either already implemented or are in the process of developing their own climate action plans. Over the years, the cities have enacted innovative policies to reduce their respective carbon footprints.\n\n“Phoenix is home to 1.7 million people, so we are larger than 10 states,” said Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego in a recent interview. “Cities are the branch of government that are closest to our residents. We hear what they need and what they want. If we lead, it really can make a difference. I would love to see the Legislature give us more tools to be able to respond to our residents rather than restrict our ability.”\n\nIn recent years, the Legislature has passed multiple bills that hinder climate action on a local level. In 2014, the Legislature outlawed plastic bag bans in cities and towns. In 2015, the Legislature prohibited cities from requiring energy benchmarking for commercial buildings, a move that Tempe council member Lauren Kuby called a “slap-in-the face to local decision making.”\n\nThis year, in what many called a reflex response to California policies, a state law was fast-tracked through the Legislature and signed by the governor in February to prevent Arizona’s cities and towns from banning natural gas or other fossil fuels in buildings.\n\n“The Legislature has the potential to be a driving force to create an equitable approach to water insecurity and extreme heat,” Kuby wrote in response to emailed questions from The Republic.\n\n“Arizonans, as well as cities, businesses, and nonprofits are way ahead of the AZ Corporation Commission, Legislature, and the Governor in thinking and acting proactively to address the climate emergency,\" she said. \"Extremists in the Legislature are not only content to do nothing, they attempt to squash cities that are innovating to address the climate crisis.”\n\nIn recent years, the Arizona Corporation Commission repealed rooftop solar incentives. Though the state’s major utilities have announced fairly ambitious clean energy goals, the commission has not increased its renewable-energy and energy-efficiency standards since the mid-2000s.\n\nSome lawmakers have attempted to push legislation to require action at a state level. In this last Legislative session, Democrats Kirsten Engel and Juan Mendez introduced bills in the House and Senate respectively to develop a state climate action plan and greenhouse gas inventory. The bills died before ever reaching the Senate floor.\n\n“Fundamentally, we need a state Sustainability Commission and an Arizona Office of Sustainability,” Kuby wrote. “If the State of Florida can dedicate an office to incubating policies that mitigate or adapt to climate change, then Arizona, with a history of coming together on contentious water issues, should be able to agree that we need coordinated sustainability policy at the state level.”\n\nIt was only last year that Governor Doug Ducey publicly acknowledged climate change was influenced by human activity. In the past several years, Ducey has taken some action on environmental issues plaguing the state, particularly water issues. In January 2019 he signed an executive order to create a council to address long-term concerns about a drier future in Arizona beyond the issues involving the Colorado River.\n\n“Governor Ducey believes we have a responsibility to protect the environment, and that doing so is tied to our economy and quality of life,” a spokesperson for the governor wrote in an email to The Republic. “At the same time, we are mindful of how any proposed policies impact our economy, taxpayers, small businesses, everyday Arizonans and energy costs. ADEQ is an entire state agency devoted 365 days a year to protecting our environment and our air and water.”\n\nThe governor declined to be interviewed for this story and didn’t respond to specific questions from The Republic.\n\nEvery year, ADEQ spends millions of dollars on a variety of travel reduction, vehicle efficiency and lawn equipment replacement initiatives to improve emissions. But the agency has no authority to address carbon dioxide emissions, one of the main greenhouse gases.\n\nADEQ spokesperson Caroline Oppleman pointed to partnerships with utilities, the private sector, and advancements like evolving electric vehicle and hydrogen fuel cell technology as ways Arizona will lower its carbon footprint in coming years.\n\nThe market-driven shift from coal dominance will also improve emissions, Oppleman said. The closure of the Navajo Generating Station in November 2019 alone reduced Arizona’s emissions by 13.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to ADEQ. Roughly a third of Arizona's energy production is already from non-fossil fuel alternative sources, including Palo Verde nuclear generating station, said Oppleman.\n\n“Our goal with all these efforts has been to take the politics out of it, and focus on good policies that are bipartisan and good for the state of Arizona,” Ducey’s spokesperson wrote.\n\nThe reliance on the federal government and natural market swings will have positive impacts, but those actively working toward solutions say waiting on the market isn’t enough.\n\n“We're implementing climate policy by implementing utility energy policy and transportation policy,” said Jeff Schlegel, a member of the 2006 climate action plan working group and a state energy policy consultant. “The prospects for the Commission improving the energy rules and in so doing, making progress on climate change is probably the best thing that we have going right now.”\n\nOn the transportation side, Schlegel said, a combination of the market and EPA requirements for ozone standards, and other air quality issues in the Valley will also help improve emissions policies.\n\n“It's just a matter of whether you have it three to five years earlier because of some good policy,” Schlegel said. “But not only is the Legislature not taking positive action to address the crisis, they're preventing local municipalities from taking their own action, which is bizarre coming from a political party that claims it is in favor of local control.”\n\nSTUDY: Phoenix will feel more extreme heat as climate changes\n\nTime to act\n\nTime is running out. In 2018, the world’s leading climate scientists warned the world had to take drastic action within 12 years to slow the rate of global warming and keep it at a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius. Beyond that, every degree has increasingly dire consequences.\n\nThe world has already warmed more than one degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution and is on track to reach 3 degrees of warming by the end of the century if major reductions in emissions aren’t achieved.\n\nThe Paris climate agreement, an international treaty to lower greenhouse gas emissions hoped to restrict warming to two degrees. In 2017, the Trump Administration announced the U.S., one of the largest emitters of planet-heating emissions in the world, would no longer participate in the agreement.\n\nFor all living organisms, the faster climate changes, the more difficult it is to adapt to it. When climate change is too rapid, as it has become with the help of human-caused emissions, species start going extinct.\n\nCoral reefs would largely die off with two degrees of warming. Three degrees could result in the loss of many coastal cities. Four degrees could reduce the flow of the Colorado River to a trickle. Five degrees could leave huge swathes of the planet uninhabitable.\n\nThere will also be economic impacts. A 2017 study found the U.S. could lose 2.3% of its GDP for each degree Celsius increase in global warming.\n\nThe Southwest, already the hottest and driest region in the United States, is warming at a faster rate than other parts of the country. Maricopa County's average temperature has increased by 1.9 degrees since 1895. This gradual climate change means longer, hotter summers, experts say, as the monsoon pattern arrives later.\n\nStates can have tremendous power to make a difference, especially in the U.S., which is second only to China in its contribution to planet-heating emissions.\n\n“The states need to be taking the initiative on this because the federal government right now certainly isn't,” said Owens, the former ADEQ director. “While an individual state can only do so much, it's extremely important for an individual state to do as much as it can.”\n\nPolitical polarization in the last decade has made large-scale action difficult, but many see bipartisan consensus as the only way forward.\n\n“The state of Arizona and the federal government can’t continue ignoring this issue,” said Tucson Mayor Regina Romero in a phone interview. “We are at a point where it’s all hands on deck. Democrats, Republicans, the business community, elected officials, students and scientists can work together to plan for the future, invest in green, renewable infrastructure that creates jobs. It is an economic opportunity for us and at the same time, we will be doing something good for our environment.”\n\nIn September, Tucson formally declared a climate emergency and will implement a decade-long plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030.\n\nThe need to remove politics from the climate conversation is something many from both sides of the aisle agree needs to happen. This year, representatives from Arizona’s utilities, business community, and political leaders met in a forum to discuss the state’s direction on energy.\n\n“The consensus was clear: the value of diversifying our energy portfolio and expanding our utilization of renewable energy options is not a left or right question, but an imperative that will have significant impacts on our state,” Jaime Molera, a Republican and former state official, and Glenn Hamer, the president of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry, wrote in a joint op-ed in The Arizona Capitol Times in February.\n\nDiscourse may be the first step, but the science shows the window for meaningful action is rapidly closing.\n\n\"Climate is the great convener. Our livelihoods and environment should not be partisan,\" said Kuby. \"We need to elect people who are not beholden to corporate interests, who reflect the people and the science that we are in a climate crisis and must take action.”\n\nErin Stone covers the environment for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

But candidates haven't said much about climate change.\n\nEven as rising temperatures are sapping water supplies in the desert Southwest and leading to more dangerous heat waves, the subject of human-caused climate change — and what Arizona could do to combat it and prepare for the effects — has been largely absent from the stump speeches, debates and tweets.\n\nSome political observers say candidates may be reluctant to raise the issue because it turns the focus on long-term threats that may not feel like an immediate concern. Candidates may also feel the subject is too politically divisive, or it is not among the top concerns of the voters they're targeting.\n\nBut polls have shown that climate change is a concern for a majority of Arizonans. In a statewide survey of 800 people last year, 69 percent agreed with the statement that \"the state government needs to do more to combat climate change.\"\n\nNearly two-thirds of those surveyed in the poll, conducted for the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust in conjunction with The Arizona Republic, agreed that climate change is one of the most serious problems facing the world today.\n\nSEE ALSO:UN report: 'Unprecedented changes' needed to protect Earth\n\nMORE: Arizonans overwhelmingly support action in air, water, climate change\n\nGlobal warming ought to be front and center for Arizona politicians, said Angelina Luangphon, an Arizona State University student.\n\n\"It's difficult to hold them accountable if they're not talking about climate change,\" she said. \"No one is talking about it enough.\"\n\nLuangphon is working as an intern with Defend Our Future, a climate change advocacy group, and regularly talks with students on campus about how they can register to vote. She said she worries about declining air quality, worsening drought, intensifying wildfires and rising temperatures.\n\n\"Climate change is something that is affecting our everyday lives right now,\" she said.\n\nSurveying the candidates\n\nTo find out where candidates stand on issues related to climate change, The Arizona Republic emailed three questions to 16 candidates who are running for selected statewide and legislative offices. Ten responded.\n\nGov. Doug Ducey acknowledged that the climate is changing and said: \"There's no doubt that we're part of what goes on in the ecosystem and the environment.\"\n\nThe Republican incumbent touted his administration's approach when asked how Arizona should address climate change.\n\n\"In Arizona, we're doing things the right way,\" Ducey said in the emailed response. \"The combination of our balanced energy portfolio, market forces associated with natural gas and our forward-looking utilities have put us on a path to achieve carbon reduction goals without additional regulations.\"\n\nDemocratic challenger David Garcia argued that Arizona should be doing much more about climate change, including further promoting solar energy.\n\n\"I believe that climate change is a real and urgent threat and that politicians who do nothing about it put us and future generations at risk,\" Garcia said in his written response. \"Not only does lack of action threaten the future of our state and the planet, it also ignores an opportunity to make Arizona the nation's leader in solar energy.\"\n\nGarcia and Ducey also differed on how the state should manage its diminishing water supplies and on what Arizona should do to reduce the number of heat-related deaths.\n\nREAD THE RESPONSES: How candidates answered questions about climate, water\n\nState climate change plans\n\nSome states, such as California, have issued state-specific reports on climate change, summarizing the latest research on how rising temperatures are likely to affect water supplies, agriculture, wildfires and health, and laying out strategies for preparing for the effects. California's newly published Fourth Climate Change Assessment warned that heat waves in cities could cause two to three times more heat-related deaths by 2050.\n\nIn Arizona, the state government hasn't recently done a similar statewide climate change assessment.\n\nMore than a decade ago, Democratic Gov. Janet Napolitano took a different approach.\n\nShe signed an executive order in 2005 establishing the state's Climate Change Advisory Group. In the document, Napolitano cited concerns about \"the potential for prolonged drought, severe forest fires, warmer temperatures, increased snowmelt, reduced snow pack and other effects.\"\n\nThe appointed advisory group, led by state officials, was tasked with developing an \"action plan\" for reducing greenhouse gas emission in the state. The group recommended a list of actions including boosting the use of clean energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 2000 levels by 2040.\n\nWhen Napolitano left office in 2009, the climate initiative was abandoned by Republican Gov. Jan Brewer and her administration.\n\n\"The state of Arizona has taken a number of steps backwards,\" said Stephen Owens, who chaired the advisory group and was director of the state Department of Environmental Quality under Napolitano. \"It's always one step forward, two steps back in Arizona, it seems, with addressing climate change.\"\n\nDuring Napolitano's tenure, the state adopted stricter emissions standards for cars sold in Arizona. Brewer's administration repealed those standards.\n\nHer administration also pulled out of the Western Climate Initiative, a regional effort Napolitano had joined with with governors including Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Bill Richardson of New Mexico.\n\nIn the years since, Arizona's 2006 climate action plan has fallen by the wayside, including its ambitious goals for reducing emissions.\n\n\"When Governor Napolitano was in office, Arizona was really a leader on this issue. And unfortunately, it's sort of completely dropped off the radar in this past decade,\" Owens said. \"Arizona could play a leadership role again, and it ought to be, given the impacts of climate change.\"\n\nMORE:Measure would require utilities to get half of power from renewable sources\n\nGetting hotter and drier\n\nThe effects of warming are being seen in everything from warmer summer nights to the decreasing flow of the Colorado River.\n\nIn the Phoenix area, local officials determined that heat killed 172 people last year, a record for a second consecutive year. The rising numbers of heat-related deaths have come as summers have grown hotter, and as the city's growing expanses of asphalt and concrete have contributed to the urban heat-island effect.\n\nIn the 1980s, Phoenix's average June-August high was slightly over 105 degrees. During the past 10 years, the average high was about 106 degrees, nearly 1 degree hotter.\n\nScientists have found that global warming is also contributing significantly to drought in the Southwest and the dwindling flow of the Colorado River. In one recent study, scientists calculated that about half the trend of decreasing runoff in the Upper Colorado River Basin from 2000-2014 was the result of unprecedented warming across the region.\n\nWith reservoir levels near historic lows on the Colorado River, Arizona water officials have been leading talks to try to reach a set of agreements for cities, farmers and tribes to share in water cutbacks. Such a deal would clear the way for Arizona to participate in a larger drought-contingency plan with California and Nevada to prevent the level of Lake Mead — which is now just 38 percent full — from dropping even further.\n\nMORE:With shortage looming, officials look to reach Colorado River drought deal\n\nClimate change as a state issue\n\nDucey and Garcia, the candidates for governor, have repeatedly debated how Arizona should be managing water and dealing with the anticipated shortage. Garcia has occasionally mentioned climate change during the race. But as with other candidates, when Garcia and Ducey have publicly debated water policy, they've often not touched on the role of climate change.\n\n\"It's harder to hold them accountable if they don't even have to talk about climate change,\" said Sandy Bahr, director of the Sierra Club's Arizona chapter.\n\nAfter President Donald Trump announced plans to pull out of the Paris climate accord, the Sierra Club sent a letter to Ducey with about 2,000 signatures, urging him to commit the state to a goal of reducing emissions in line with the agreement. But Ducey wasn't among the governors and mayors who voiced support for continuing to pursue such goals.\n\n\"Gov. Ducey has said very little about climate change the whole time he's been in office,\" Bahr said. \"He's really gotten a pass.\"\n\nState and local elected officials will sometimes treat climate change as a national or international problem that's too big for them to tackle, Bahr said, and that \"sends a message to the public that there's little we can do, when indeed there is a lot we can do.\"\n\nShe said more discussion about climate change during the election season could help the state prepare to address heat-related deaths and plan for limited water supplies.\n\n\"If they don't have to address it in elections, then it's too easy for it to fall off the to-do list when they get into office,\" Bahr said. \"If it's an issue during the elections, then it's much more likely that there'll be a plan.\"\n\nMORE:Heat killed a record number of people in Phoenix last year\n\n'Hard to talk about'\n\nThe lack of discussion about the subject among Arizona politicians reflects a disconnect that exists across the country, said Sonja Klinsky, an assistant professor at Arizona State University's School of Sustainability.\n\n\"We have this interesting juxtaposition of people saying they are concerned with climate change and politicians not making it into much of an issue,\" she said. \"Its very long-term nature makes it very hard to talk about.\"\n\nBecause of that, the issue often falls lower on the priority list during campaigns, Klinsky said. It doesn't help, she said, that the climate issue has become so divisive and polarizing.\n\n\"I have many people come up to me and say things like, 'I would love to go up to neighbors and talk about this, but I'm scared doing it. I don't want it to be a political conversation,'\" Klinsky said. \"They don't know how to have this conversation in a constructive way because it has become so highly polarized.\"\n\nDavid Sailor, director of ASU's Urban Climate Research Center, said everyone who lives in Phoenix experiences the extreme summer heat, but the serious dangers posed by heat often aren't top of mind for most people.\n\n\"They don't see it as a major day-in and day-out concern. I think politicians tend to jump on those day-in-day-out concerns,\" Sailor said. \"Things they're going to propose are typically driven by the political cycle, they're not looking at the next 10, 20 or 30 years.\"\n\nBecause climate change is unfolding over decades, he said, it can seem less immediate and take a backseat to other hot-button issues, like the opioid addiction crisis.\n\n'Brutal consequences' on the way\n\nYet scientists warn that emissions of greenhouse gases have put the world on a course toward continued warming and that limiting the temperature increase to goals laid out in the 2016 Paris Agreement would require unprecedented changes in the coming years.\n\nIn a new assessment on Monday, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said the consequences of human-caused warming so far include more severe droughts and floods, heat waves, coral bleaching and shrinking Arctic sea ice, among other changes.\n\nThe report, which was written by 91 scientists and based on more than 6,000 scientific references, says the planet is now on a course to pass 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) of warming around 2040, if not sooner, and that limiting the temperature rise to that level would require “rapid and far-reaching” transitions. Global human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide would need to fall by about 45 percent by 2030, and then reach “net zero” around 2050.\n\n“We have to move immediately,” said Diana Liverman, a University of Arizona professor of geography and development who was among the authors of the report. “Every year of delay increases the chances of having to live through some very high temperatures, and it’ll increase the cost of making the changes later. And changing infrastructure doesn’t happen overnight.”\n\nThe report also said that if warming is held to the target, some of the worst effects could still be prevented. For example, the world’s remaining coral reefs are projected to decline by 70-90 percent with warming of 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, but they’re projected to be wiped out if the world gets 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) warmer.\n\nWith rising temperatures contributing to the extreme drought and intense wildfires that have raged across the West, some people in Arizona see climate change as an increasingly unavoidable topic in politics — and one that young voters in particular may push to the forefront.\n\n\"In Arizona we're definitely in a position to where we're feeling the effects,\" said Nick Petrusek, the state director of Defend Our Future, the advocacy group at ASU. \"This is the generation that's really going to start facing some of the most brutal consequences of our indecision.\"\n\nClashing views in the Senate race\n\nIn Arizona's U.S. Senate race, Republican candidate Martha McSally and Democratic candidate Kyrsten Sinema have taken sharply different stances on environmental issues as members of the House.\n\nThe League of Conservation Voters, which advocates for action on climate change, analyzed the environment-related votes in the House last year and said it considered 80 percent of Sinema's votes \"pro-environment.\" The group said 11 percent of McSally's votes were \"pro-environment.\"\n\nIn response to the questions from The Republic, Sinema said she supports \"thoughtful and reasonable approaches to reduce climate pollution while ensuring Arizona families and businesses have affordable, reliable energy to power our economy into the future.\"\n\nShe said she has supported more solar energy development and \"common sense policies like the renewable tax credit, energy efficiency incentives, and state-level renewable portfolios that reduce emissions and provide a smooth transition to cleaner sources of energy.\"\n\nMcSally said the U.S. has made progress in dealing with climate change, but through technological advances, not regulation.\n\n\"Crushing regulations, such as the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan and the Waters of the United States, only serve as federal overreaches that further burden Arizona's small businesses and farmers and harm those in poverty with increased utility bills,\" McSally said in an emailed response.\n\n\"I have fought back against these harmful regulations to provide Arizona with needed flexibility and relief from Washington bureaucrats who do not fully understand the environmental and economic realities of our state,\" she said.\n\nOne of the biggest climate-related measures on the Arizona ballot is Proposition 127. The ballot measure would amend the state constitution to require regulated electric companies to get half of their power from renewable sources like solar and wind by 2030.\n\nLiverman, the University of Arizona professor, isn't taking a position one way or the other on the ballot measure. But she said Prop 127 \"would keep us in line with what the IPCC report is recommending.\"\n\nFor now, the Arizona Corporation Commission requires electric companies to get 8 percent of their power from renewable energy sources — a requirement that increases to 15 percent by 2025.\n\nOther states have been taking quicker steps to cut emissions from fossil fuels. In California, lawmakers passed a bill in August that will require the state to get 100 percent of its electricity from carbon-free sources like solar and wind by 2045.\n\nIan James writes about water and the environment for The Arizona Republic.

Researchers at Arizona State University’s Morrison Institute for Public Policy designed the questionnaire and analyzed the results.\n\nThe poll followed a similar survey in March 2017 and was aimed at gauging public opinion about environmental issues.\n\nPeople’s responses on climate change mirrored the 2017 results when “agree” and “strongly agree” were lumped together. But there was a dramatic increase in the number who said they strongly agree the government needs to do more on climate.\n\n“There has been a significant shift in intensity,” said Steve Kilar, communications director for the Morrison Institute. “More people now strongly agree that the federal government needs to do more to combat climate change.”\n\nFor the federal government, that group increased to 51% from 38% three years earlier. And for the state government, the “strongly agree” contingent grew to 45%, up from 33% in 2017.\n\nThe poll was conducted in January, months before this summer’s record-breaking heat, giant Western wildfires and mysterious die-offs of migratory birds in the desert Southwest. The historic calamities of this extreme summer might significantly influence the results if the same questions were asked this month.\n\nEven as the survey found growing and widespread public concern about climate change, it also showed a partisan divide persists. For example, 98% of Democrats said they agree that climate change “is one of the most serious problems facing the world today.” Among Republicans, only 36% agreed with that statement.\n\nWhen all political affiliations are included, including those who described themselves as independents, 69% said they see climate change as one of the world’s most serious problems.\n\nThe representative sample of registered voters was selected to match the political and demographic characteristics of Arizona, including party affiliation, age, race and gender. Phone interviews were conducted in English or Spanish, and the poll had an overall error margin of 3 percentage points.\n\nNearly seven in 10, or 66%, said they believe “the governor and Legislature should require further regulation to reduce greenhouse gases.” That was up from 60% in 2017.\n\nThe results parallel the findings of other polls showing Americans are increasingly concerned about the heating of the planet caused by the burning of fossil fuels. Recent nationwide surveys by the Pew Research Center have found that about two-thirds of Americans say the federal government is doing too little to reduce the effects of climate change and that 62% of Americans say global climate change is affecting their community.\n\nIn Arizona, a recent poll by Colorado College’s State of the Rockies Project found that 64% think action should be taken to address climate change.\n\nAnother poll, conducted online in mid-September by Morning Consult on behalf of EDF Action, asked 400 Arizona registered voters their views about recent wildfires, heat waves and climate change. The survey found that 80% said they are concerned about the wildfires and heat waves affecting large parts of the U.S., and 76% said recent events like wildfires have made them more concerned about the effects of climate change.\n\nThe Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust, which also supports The Arizona Republic’s environmental coverage, partnered with ASU’s Morrison Institute on the poll to track how public attitudes on environmental issues have changed since 2017.\n\nIn the 2017 survey, 34% said they believed Arizona has “enough water to cover all its needs into the foreseeable future.” In the January survey, only 19% said they believe Arizona “has enough water to cover its needs for the next 50 years,” while the majority said they aren’t confident the state has sufficient water resources.\n\nThat apparent change in public opinion has coincided with severe drought compounded by rising temperatures along the Colorado River.\n\nArizona gets nearly 40% of its water from the Colorado. The state began taking less water from the river this year under a three-state agreement aimed at boosting the level of Lake Mead, where the water level is now at just 40% of the reservoir’s full capacity.\n\nMeanwhile, scientists have found that warmer temperatures are sapping the flow of the Colorado and that the river could lose about a fourth of its flow by 2050 as global temperatures continue to rise.\n\nIn the poll, nearly two-thirds of voters (64%) said they believe Arizona will face a water shortage at some point in the next 50 years.\n\nNearly nine in 10 voters (87%) said they believe environmental issues facing the state are “serious” or “very serious,” up from 81% in 2017.\n\nWhen asked which of a list of areas should be the top priority for the governor and the state Legislature, voters chose the environment — specifically “protecting the state’s air and water quality, land use and wildlife” — among the top three priorities, after “improving the public education system” and “making health care more accessible and affordable.”\n\nMost people also said they are concerned about water pollution in rivers and reservoirs, and about air quality in cities.\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE CONCERNS: Many candidates still aren't talking about issue\n\n“Arizonans clearly understand that we can’t take water for granted,” said Sarah Porter, director of Arizona State University’s Kyl Center for Water Policy.\n\nShe said the results reflect Arizonans’ high level of concern about natural resource issues. Other polling by the Morrison Institute since 2015 has shown people in the state care and worry about water resources, Porter said.\n\n“There’s an opportunity for Arizonans to work together to create policies that address these concerns,” Porter said.\n\nPorter noted that federal officials’ latest projections show increased risks of the Colorado River’s reservoirs hitting shortage levels within five years. She said Arizona’s water officials “are trying to plan for a hotter, drier future.”\n\nThe survey didn’t ask people their views about extreme heat. But the heat this summer obliterated records in Arizona and across the Southwest.\n\nFrom June through August, Phoenix baked through its hottest summer in recorded history. The average high in August hit a record 110.7 degrees.\n\nThis year, Phoenix has had a record 53 days with temperatures reaching 110 degrees or hotter, shattering the previous record of 33 days, set in 2011.\n\nOver the past decade, extreme heat has increasingly turned deadly for people in the Phoenix area. The most vulnerable include people living in poverty and who are homeless, as well as older people, those without air conditioning and those who depend on public transit.\n\nLast year, Maricopa County health officials reported that 197 people died of heat-related causes, a record for a fourth straight year.\n\nSo far this year, county officials have confirmed 70 deaths linked to heat, while 271 additional deaths are listed as cases “under investigation.”\n\nA discussion about climate change and Arizona’s future\n\nJoin The Arizona Republic for a discussion about climate change and Arizona’s future.

But WHO's call for a booster moratorium comes as infections are surging across the U.S. – driven by the highly contagious delta variant – where vaccine is plentiful but vaccine hesitancy remains a serious concern.\n\nMore than 90% of new coronavirus infections across the U.S. are from the delta variant, according to the latest data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The primary delta strand accounted for 83.4% of infections in the two-week period that ended July 31, the CDC says.

That's almost twice as many as the 39,000 infections from the previous week. For perspective, about 79,000 Americans of all ages tested positive in a week of late June.\n\nSpring Schmidt, deputy director of the St. Louis County health department, said Wednesday about one in five current total cases in county hospitals have been people under 19, some of them in intensive care.\n\nOchsner Health, Louisiana’s largest hospital system, said it had no pediatric COVID patients several weeks ago, but the last two weeks the number has ranged from five to 15. Dr. William Lennarz, head of pediatrics at Ochsner Hospital for Children, said that doesn’t mean the delta variant is disproportionately affecting children.\n\n\"What is different is that children now make up the most susceptible population because children under 12 are 100% not vaccinated,” he said.\n\nForeign visitors to US may be required to get vaccine\n\nNearly all foreign visitors will be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 before entering the U.S., according to a plan the Biden administration is working on, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe requirement would come as part of the administration’s phased approach to easing travel restrictions for foreign citizens to the country. No timeline has yet been determined, as interagency working groups study how and when to safely move toward resuming normal travel.\n\nThe administration has kept in place travel restrictions that have severely curtailed international trips to the U.S., citing the spread of the delta variant of the virus.\n\nLos Angeles considering proof-of-vaccine requirements\n\nOfficials in the city of Los Angeles are considering a proposal that would require people to show proof they've been vaccinated to enter restaurants, museums, gyms and other public spaces, following in the footsteps of New York City, which became the first in the country to require proof of the COVID-19 vaccine to enter many indoor public spaces this week.\n\n\"Hard-working Angelenos, their customers and the general public deserve to be safe in public spaces,\" said City Councilmember Mitch O'Farrell, who introduced the proposal alongside council President Nury Martinez.\n\n\"It's incredibly important that we take every step we can to incentive people who haven't gotten the vaccine to get it. It's also crucial that people who have followed public health advice and gotten the shots, that they be able to move as freely as possible,\" said mayoral candidate L.A.

That makes Denver Public Schools the first large district to issue such a mandate. The district has about 92,000 students and more than 10,000 workers.\n\nMayor Michael Hancock's public health order issued this week has some teeth, considering it comes with the threat of termination for those who don't comply. The only exemptions will be for medical or religious reasons.\n\n“There might be some folks who may lose their jobs behind this,” he said, according to the Denver Post.\n\nOther large school districts, including New York City's, have said school staff need to be vaccinated or otherwise undergo regular testing for the virus. But in Denver, school employees who don’t want to be vaccinated won’t have that option.\n\nDenver’s mandate applies to staff at all the city’s education institutions, including public and private K-12 schools, colleges and universities.\n\nDan Domenech, the executive director of the School Superintendents Association, said Denver may be the first to issue such a requirement of school staff, but it won't be the last. \"I'm sure others will follow,\" he said.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nSturgis Motorcycle Rally returns, and delta will be there\n\nRemember all the hand-wringing about the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally being held amid a pandemic last year? Well, the massive annual gathering of bikers in South Dakota is back this year, now with the highly infectious delta variant threatening to turn the event into a superspreader of huge proportions.\n\nAbout 700,000 people are expected to attend the rally, which starts Friday and has become a haven for people eager to escape coronavirus precautions. Those hardly deterred participants last August, when roughly 460,000 attended. Masks were mostly ditched as bikers crowded into bars, tattoo parlors and rock shows.\n\nContact tracers reported 649 infections from every corner of the country linked to the 2020 rally, including one death. A team from the CDC concluded in a published study that the gathering “had many characteristics of a superspreading event.”\n\n“The rally is a behemoth and you cannot stop it,” said Carol Fellner, a Sturgis resident who worried that this year’s event would cause a fresh outbreak of cases. “I feel absolutely powerless.''\n\nVaccinated people more wary of delta variant than unvaccinated\n\nDespite the risk the delta variant poses to the unvaccinated, it's the people inoculated against COVID-19 who are more concerned about the highly contagious version – and more likely to change their behavior, according to a new poll released Wednesday. Vaccinated adults are nearly twice as likely to worry that new variants such as delta will worsen the pandemic nationally and locally, according to the latest tracking poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe telephone survey of 1,517 adults was conducted from July 15-27, before the CDC said vaccinated people should mask up indoors in areas with “substantial” levels of COVID-19 transmission. About one in five unvaccinated adults said variants have made them more likely to get vaccinated.\n\n“Seeing their friends get sick and local hospitals fill up again with COVID patients may speed them along,” foundation CEO Drew Altman said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSome educators, state politicians at odds over masks in schools\n\nThe delta variant has driven a sharp surge in U.S. infections and hospitalizations that has educators across the nation wary as the new school year approaches. The U.S. Department of Education's road map for return to school includes guidance for wearing masks that in many school districts is pitting educators against state officials.\n\nIn Florida, Duval County Public Schools will have a mask mandate with an opt-out option, even as Gov. Ron DeSantis threatens district funding if schools issue one. In Tennessee, Shelby County Schools will keep a mask mandate in place, even start school remotely depending on cases this fall. The state's House speaker has threatened to call a special session prohibiting it.\n\nAnd a contingent of Democratic lawmakers from Oklahoma is calling for a special legislative session to repeal a new law that prevents school districts from imposing mask mandates unless a state of emergency is in effect. Tulsa Public Schools expect but don't require masks at all times for students and staff, regardless of vaccination status.\n\n“What has to happen before we take COVID seriously?\" Democratic House Minority Leader Emily Virgin said. \"We have children in ICU.\"\n\nLollapalooza fest in Chicago: Safe or a 'recipe for disaster'?\n\nAs COVID-19 cases surged in the U.S. last weekend, Chicago's downtown was a sea of mostly unmasked humanity as hundreds of thousands crowded together for the outdoor music festival Lollapalooza. More than 385,000 people packed the four-day event. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot defended the decision to hold the festival, citing pandemic precautions that required concertgoers show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test and to wear a mask. Lollapalooza said 90% of attendees on the first day of the event proved they were vaccinated. Lightfoot said hundreds were turned away.\n\nStill, some experts sounded an alarm. Tina Tan, a Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine professor, called the festival “a recipe for disaster.”\n\n\"You're less able to transmit COVID in an outdoor space, but that doesn't mean that you can pack 100,000 people into a small, enclosed space where they're on top of each other and expect nobody's going to transmit,\" Tan said. \"That's not how it works.\"\n\n– Adrianna Rodriguez and Christine Fernando\n\nFourth wave of virus overwhelming hospitals in vaccine-hesitant areas\n\nA fourth wave of COVID-19 is threatening to overwhelm U.S. hospitals in regions where large swaths of unvaccinated people provide little resistance to the highly contagious delta variant. Nowhere is the strain more apparent than Florida, which reached a new peak Tuesday of 11,515 people hospitalized with COVID-19, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHospitals in Jacksonville and Orlando last week crashed through their pandemic peaks, and hospitals in Miami-Dade County are at or approaching record coronavirus hospitalizations this week, said Mary Mayhew, CEO of Florida Hospital Association. And cases continue to surge: 110,477 residents tested positive for COVID-19 for the week ending July 29, foreshadowing more people needing hospital care in the weeks ahead.\n\n\"The delta variant is ripping through the unvaccinated,\" Mayhew said.\n\n– Ken Alltucker\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/15/manure-power-snakes-bed-castle-stair-collapse-news-around-states/117529466/", "title": "Manure power, snakes under a bed: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed failed U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore’s $95 million lawsuit targeting comedian Sacha Baron Cohen filed after Moore complained he was tricked into an interview that lampooned sexual misconduct accusations against him. Judge John Cronan wrote that Moore signed a clear disclosure agreement that prohibited any legal claims over the appearance. He added that the absurd segment – in which the comic demonstrated a so-called pedophile detector that beeped when it got near Moore – was “clearly a joke” and that no viewer would think the comedian was making factual allegations against Moore. “The court agrees that Judge Moore’s claims are barred by the unambiguous contractual language, which precludes the very causes of action he now brings,” Cronan wrote. The lawsuit centered on Moore’s unwitting appearance on the comic’s “Who is America?” show. The segment ran after Moore faced misconduct accusations that he had pursued sexual and romantic relationships with teens when he was a man in his 30s. He has denied the allegations. Moore, a Republican sometimes known as the Ten Commandments judge known for hard-line stances opposing same-sex marriage and supporting the public display of Ten Commandments, faced the accusations during his 2017 Senate race.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: More than 13 Indigenous communities, including seven in Alaska, will split $12 million for energy cost reduction efforts, officials announced. U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm announced the grants during a teleconference Tuesday. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Keolani Booth, a Metlakatla Indian Community Tribal Council member, also participated in the event. They said the grant funds would help American Indian and Alaska Native communities reduce costs and move toward more sustainable energy production, the Juneau Empire reports. “We want to thank the federal government for its investment into our community,” Booth said. “This opens up many new options.” Metlakatla will use its grant of more than $1 million to complete an electrical intertie project to Ketchikan that is expected to lower prices. Booth, in a statement, said the project has been in the works for about 20 years and is becoming a reality because of the assistance of state and federal politicians. Other Alaska communities receiving grants are the Akiachak Native Community; the Native Village of Kipnuk; the Native Village of Diomede; the Native Village of Noatak and the Northwest Arctic Borough; the Village of Aniak; and the Village of Chefornak.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A new energy facility scheduled to open in December southwest of the city will capture methane from cow manure and reuse the biogas as renewable natural fuel. Facility stakeholders said the process will capture harmful gases that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere and exacerbate climate change. The project is a partnership between West Virginia-based renewable energy company Avolta and the Butterfield Dairy Farm in Buckeye. Southwest Gas Holdings Inc. will help transport the gas for sale to other outlets. A handful of renewable natural gas facilities have sprouted up in the Southwest, including in Arizona and California in recent months. The Avolta facility is one of at least five renewable natural gas plants in or coming to Arizona. Others are expected to open in Tucson, Gila Bend and Maricopa. Unlike electric utilities in Arizona, which must generate 15% of their energy from renewable sources by 2025, Southwest Gas has no such required standard, according to the newspaper. Still, the gas utility is partnering with five facilities in Arizona and California. Spokespeople said the utility company is committed to partnering with more renewable natural gas developers.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported its biggest one-day jump in COVID-19 cases in five months Tuesday as Arkansas held its dubious distinction of having the most new cases per capita in the country. The Department of Health said the state’s cases rose by 1,476 to 358,949 since the pandemic began. It was the biggest one-day jump reported since Feb. 5’s 1,824 cases. Arkansas’ cases have continued to surge, fueled by the delta variant of the coronavirus and the state’s low vaccination rates. The state ranks No. 1 in the nation for new daily cases by population, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. Only 35% of the state’s population is fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations rose by 41 to 606. Twenty-two percent of the state’s hospital beds and about 6% of its intensive care unit beds are currently available, according to the Department of Health. There are 240 COVID-19 patients in the state’s ICUs. Ninety-eight COVID-19 patients are on ventilators. The state’s COVID-19 deaths rose by 15 to 5,970. Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is touring the state holding town halls aimed at encouraging COVID-19 shots, tweeted that 98.3% of those hospitalized in the state since January were unvaccinated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: When the state told school districts they must still require masks for students and teachers indoors, it left no room for doubt about enforcement: If students refused, schools were to send them home. But hours after that announcement Monday, public health officials in Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration abruptly changed course and said school districts would decide for themselves how to enforce the mask mandate. The reversal marked a bumpy rollout of the state’s new coronavirus rules for California’s schools, which are required to resume in-person instruction for the upcoming school year. Speaking after an event in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Newsom downplayed the reversal, saying enforcement of mask-wearing has “always been a local responsibility.” “All (the Department of Public Health) did was clarify that local responsibility, which is consistent with all the prior rule-making that has been in effect on mask-wearing going back to last year,” Newsom said. But Troy Flint, spokesman for the California School Boards Association, said the updated rule “is a huge difference in terms of how districts would operate and how the public is going to receive this guidance.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state has launched a four-year study of American bald eagles to determine how the protected raptors have adapted to population growth along the metropolitan Front Range and identify planning measures that could ensure the bird’s future. Colorado Parks and Wildlife said the study, involving biologists and volunteers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bird Conservancy of the Rockies among others, will monitor nesting sites, food sources such as prairie dog colonies, reproduction, and migration from the Denver area north to the Wyoming border. Between 25 and 30 eagles are being fitted with transmitters using cellular communications networks to provide real-time data on eagle movements. CPW estimated there are more than 90 breeding pairs of bald eagles in the corridor. There were none at the end of the 1970s and only three in all of Colorado. That recovery – mirroring a nationwide trend – came after federal and state protections including banning the pesticide DDT. The eagle’s growth has coincided with rapid urban development. Denver’s metropolitan area has nearly 3 million people, and CPW said nearly 750,000 additional people are projected to make the Front Range their home by 2029.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State lawmakers voted Wednesday to again extend Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s emergency declarations first issued in March 2020 during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite pushback from Republicans and some Democrats who argued it’s time to get back to normal. The House of Representatives and Senate, both controlled by Democrats, passed separate resolutions during Wednesday’s special session. “I know that people have COVID fatigue. People want to continue to move back with returning to normalcy, and we are doing that,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford. “This resolution will allow that to happen while still allowing us to act in the best interest of public health.” The resolution in the House passed on a 73-56 vote, with nine Democrats joining all the Republicans in opposition. In the Senate, the resolution passed on a 19-15 vote, with four Democrats joining the GOP in voting “no.” The Democratic governor had asked the General Assembly to renew his declarations of public health and civil preparedness emergencies through Sept. 30, noting he is only seeking to extend 11 executive orders. That’s compared to a high of more than 300 at one point during the crisis.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: DuPont Co. and two spinoffs will pay at least $50million to the state to help clean up toxic chemicals, the Delaware Department of Justice announced Tuesday. It’s the first time the state’s Department of Justice has resolved environmental damage claims on behalf of the state. The settlement will pay for environmental restoration, improvement, sampling and analysis, community environmental justice and equity grants, and other natural resource needs, the department said. DuPont and Corteva, previously the agriculture division of DowDuPont, will each contribute $12.5 million. Chemours, DuPont’s former performance chemicals unit, will contribute $25 million. The three companies reached a cost-sharing agreement earlier this year. They will fund up to an additional $25 million if they settle similar claims with other states for more than $50 million. The settlement resolves their responsibility for damage caused by releases of historical compounds including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. They include perfluorooctanoic acid, which was used in the production of Teflon, and have also been used in firefighting foam, water-repellent clothing and many other household and personal items. They are sometimes referred to as “forever chemicals” because of their longevity in the environment.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Nellie’s Sports Bar reopened nearly a month after it closed due to ongoing protests outside after a video showed a security guard dragging a woman out of the establishment by her hair, WUSA-TV reports. But people were outside the establishment Tuesday forming a human chain at the door to dissuade customers from going inside. Nellie’s let go of the security company whose officer was recorded dragging Keisha Young out of the bar June 13, in the wake of the video being released on social media. Protests are planned for Friday evening by a group that is still frustrated about what happened in June, during Pride Month, at the well-known LGBTQ bar. ABRA, the district agency tasked to issue and renew licenses, assigned an investigator to the case. The Alcoholic Beverage Control Board held a closed meeting to review the report and referred the case to the District’s Office of Attorney General. Young claimed the issue started when security misidentified her for another woman whom they wanted to leave for allegedly bringing in a bottle from outside. The investigator determined Nellie’s had a difficult time removing patrons through a crowd as they pushed and shoved into other people and got involved in the altercations.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Norwegian Cruise Line is challenging a new state law that prevents cruise companies from requiring passengers to show proof of vaccination against COVID-19. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Miami federal court, contends that the law jeopardizes safe operation of cruise ships by increasing risk of contracting the coronavirus. Norwegian intends to restart cruises from Florida ports Aug. 15 with vaccinations required for all passengers. Norwegian wants a judge to lift the ban by Aug. 6. The law imposes a fine of $5,000 each time a cruise line mandates that a passenger provide vaccination proof. Norwegian claims it violates federal law and several constitutional rights. The company, officially known as Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, says it won’t be able to sail from Florida unless a judge acts to block the law. “The result would be a devastating, unrecoverable loss for everyone – not only for NCLH’s business but also for tens of thousands of passengers, employees, and stakeholders who all benefit from NCLH resuming safe operations as planned,” the lawsuit says. The lawsuit names as a defendant Florida’s surgeon general, Dr. Scott Rivkees. He is an appointee of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose spokeswoman said the cruise line’s policy discriminates against children under 12 and others who are not vaccinated.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta: In a nightmarish scenario, a couple found 18 snakes under their bed. Instead of killing the creatures, the husband carefully plucked them off the ground, dropped them in a bag and relocated them to a nearby creek. Augusta resident Trish Wilcher told WJBF-TV that as she and her husband, Max, were about to go to bed Sunday, she saw what she thought was some fuzz on the floor. She said it moved when she reached down. “And then a second later another piece moved,” Wilcher said. “And I went to my husband: ‘We have snakes!’ ” The couple found a mother snake with 17 recently hatched babies under their bed. Max Wilcher used a grabber tool to place each one in a linen bag. The ordeal took until around midnight. “He brought them out there to the creek area and released them there,” Trish Wilcher said. Outside of finding a place to lay their eggs, there’s another reason snakes may want to share human spaces. Camilla Sherman, an environmental educator for the Phinizy Center for Water Sciences, said snakes sometimes move into homes to hunt rodents. “If you have a mouse problem, the snakes are going to come and try to help you with that,” Sherman said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A City Council member has proposed banning unpermitted parking in an Oahu neighborhood while the state closes a popular trail nearby for two years to conduct repairs. The state plans to close Maunawili Falls Trails in Kailua starting Thursday so that it and a private landowner can preserve historic and cultural sites. It also plans to build parking and comfort stations. The trail takes hikers through a lush forest to a waterfall. As the trail has grown in popularity, neighbors have struggled with hikers parking illegally and trespassing, as well as urinating in their yards and leaving behind dirty diapers. Chris Nakamatu of the Maunawili Estates Community Association said about 1,000 people use the trail on the weekends. City Council member Esther Kia’aina, who represents the area, told Hawaii News Now she doesn’t expect people to stop coming when the trail closes, so she’s calling for a ban on unpermitted parking in the neighborhood during the closure. The city already restricts parking for those without permits in a Kalihi neighborhood, she said. “I think that this is the best way to balance the community’s needs with those that are trespassing,” Kia’aina said. Neighbors say they support measures to control the crowds and revive the trail.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Residents and visitors need to help prevent wildfires in what could be a challenging season with continued high temperatures and most of the state in drought, Gov. Brad Little said. The Republican governor said Tuesday that there’s a potential for multiple giant wildfires in Idaho that use up firefighting resources and leave some areas unprotected. He spoke at an outdoor news conference hazy with smoke from wildfires from nearby states. “My fear is that we will have some of these great big mega-fires that start creating their own weather, like the one that is over in Oregon, where I think a lot of this smoke is coming from, that basically endanger communities; they endanger firefighters; they endanger precious wildlife and watershed capacity,” he said. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years, and scientists have long warned that the weather will get wilder as the world warms. Special calculations are needed to determine how much global warming is to blame, if at all, for a single extreme weather event. Little has already tapped the Idaho National Guard in what could be the worst wildfire season in the state in years. That includes the use of helicopters that can fight fires, transport firefighters or deliver supplies.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Five people were rushed to area hospitals after being shot Wednesday afternoon on Chicago’s South Side, about 12 hours after another shooting elsewhere in the city wounded five other people, police said. Tom Ahern, a spokesman for the Chicago Police Department, said he did not know the conditions of the victims who were shot just after noon. He also did not yet know the ages of the victims, but he said he did not believe that any of them were children. No arrests have been made, he said. Just after midnight Wednesday, five other people – four women and a man – were shot as they stood outside in the Garfield Park neighborhood on the West Side. “A group was standing outside when they were approached by an unidentified male … who produced a handgun and began shooting. The victims attempted to flee the scene once the shooting began,” police said in a statement. Four of the victims, who range in age from 18 to 29, were taken to hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries. A fifth victim, a 34-year-old woman, was shot in the leg but refused to be taken to a hospital, police said. And about 7:30 p.m. Tuesday in the West Humboldt Park neighborhood, a 2-year-old boy and 32-year-old man were critically wounded when someone pulled up in front of a home near which they were standing and opened fire.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The leaders of two now-closed online charter schools are accused in a new lawsuit of defrauding the state of more than $150 million by padding their student enrollments and inappropriately paying money to a web of related businesses. The lawsuit announced Monday by the state attorney general’s office comes nearly two years after Indiana Virtual School and Indiana Virtual Pathways Academy shut down amid a state investigation that found the two online schools improperly claimed about 14,000 students as enrolled between 2011 and 2019, even though they had no online course activity. The lawsuit seeks repayment of about $69 million it claims the schools wrongly received in state student enrollment payments. It also seeks $86 million that officials say the schools improperly paid to more than a dozen companies linked to them by common business officers or relatives and did so with little or no documentation. “This massive attempt to defraud Hoosier taxpayers through complex schemes truly boggles the mind,” Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, a Republican, said in a statement. A state audit linked much of the misspending to Thomas Stoughton, who headed the online schools from 2011 to 2017 and owned or had business associates who operated about a dozen companies that received school payments.\n\nIowa\n\nAltoona: Workers used a crane Tuesday to remove a boat from an amusement park ride as part of the investigation into an accident that killed one boy and critically injured his brother. The boat, which weighs over 1,700 pounds, was removed from the human-made channel on the Raging River ride so that inspectors and engineers could have a closer examination, Adventureland Park attorney Guy Cook said. The boat was placed on a trailer and taken to a secure location, as the investigation into the “tragic and extremely unusual accident continues,” he said. The boat was carrying six members of a Marion, Iowa, family at the park in Altoona when it unexpectedly overturned on the evening of July 3, trapping two brothers under the water for minutes. Michael Jaramillo, 11, died of his injuries the next day, while 16-year-old David Jaramillo remains hospitalized in critical condition. David Jaramillo is still heavily sedated and hooked up to oxygen, unable to talk or see for the moment, said family attorney Ryan Best. His father, also David Jaramillo, was undergoing surgery Tuesday on bones he broke in his shoulder when the boat overturned, before he was able to free himself, Best said. Michael Jaramillo’s funeral is scheduled for Saturday at a Des Moines church.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A Republican lawmaker questioned Tuesday whether Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration made unemployment fraud worse by not conducting adequate background checks on hundreds of people hired to help with a surge of claims during the pandemic. Sen. Caryn Tyson, of Parker, raised the issue as the state prepared to launch a new investigation of unemployment fraud. Tyson serves on a new council created by the GOP-controlled Legislature to oversee a modernization of the Kansas Department of Labor’s aged computer system and to audit fraud and its effects. The state Department of Labor has estimated fraudulent claims last year totaled $290 million, but a report by the Legislature’s auditing arm estimated $600 million. The council on Tuesday discussed the scope of its audit so the state can take bids from private firms for the work, with a preliminary report due May 1, 2022. The final report is expected by September next year. The council expects to set the audit’s scope next week, but Tyson said auditors should examine possible “holes or flaws in the human side” of computer security, particularly given the big expansion of the department’s workforce.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Bourbon tourism is getting another boost from a distillery in the city. Angel’s Envy says it will be able to accommodate twice as many guests once an $8.2 million expansion is completed next spring at its downtown Louisville site. The craft distiller says the project includes a new event space and bar, a larger retail space, and several new tasting rooms. The distillery will remain open to the public throughout the construction. “Angel’s Envy is a prime example of how Kentucky’s signature bourbon industry immensely benefits our commonwealth by attracting visitors to the state while creating quality opportunities for Kentuckians,” Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. Kentucky is home to 66 spirits operations employing more than 5,100 people full time statewide, Beshear’s office said. In 2020, the industry announced 20 projects in Kentucky, totaling more than $300 million in new investment. Kentucky crafts 95% of the world’s bourbon supply, according to the Kentucky Distillers’ Association.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Efforts to mitigate COVID-19 at large events – including mask mandates or requirements that attendees be vaccinated or have a negative coronavirus test – will likely continue into the fall because of low state vaccination rates and the spread of dangerous virus variants, the city’s health director said Tuesday. Dr. Jennifer Avegno’s remarks came at a news conference focusing on the city’s efforts to encourage vaccinations in a state that has one of the nation’s lowest inoculation rates. Louisiana health officials on Tuesday said COVID-19 cases are surging, largely among unvaccinated people, as the more easily transmissible delta variant spreads in the state. Avegno’s remarks come as the city looks to a new NFL and college football season and the return of major entertainment events such as the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, which was postponed from its usual spring dates. The city currently allows major events to have full capacity if there is a mask requirement or if attendees are required to have either a vaccination or a negative virus test. “I think folks should expect that that might the case in the fall,” Avegno said. “We would all love to have large events that did not require some degree of mitigation. And before delta I was maybe a little more confident that we would get there.”\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A bill that aimed to eliminate the state’s privately owned electric utilities by buying them out and replacing them with a consumer-owned utility was vetoed Tuesday by Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, likely spelling the end of the proposal this legislative session. Mills acknowledged that the performance of Central Maine Power and Versant Power has been “abysmal” but said the proposal to send them packing – with voters getting the final say – was “deeply flawed” and “hastily drafted and hastily amended.” “I certainly agree that change is necessary. No question about that. And I remain open to considering alternative proposals,” she said. The bill’s chief sponsor, Rep. Seth Berry, D-Bowdoinham, disputed the governor’s characterization of the proposal, arguing that it was thoroughly vetted over the past three years. And it isn’t going away. A coalition will be launching a referendum drive to put the proposal before voters anyway next year, instead of this fall. Supporters said it’s time to replace Central Maine Power and Versant Power, which are owned by corporations in Spain and Canada, with an entity that works in the interest of Mainers instead of shareholders. The new entity, Pine Tree Power, would keep rates low, respond faster to outages and support clean energy projects, they said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Grow & Fortify is looking to make it easier for craft alcohol fans in the state to track their endeavors. The Maryland-based agricultural cooperative launched the Maryland Craft Beverages app Wednesday. It allows users to plan future stops, track locations they have visited and participate in industry-tailored passports, according to a press release. The app will include trails dedicated to beer, wine, spirits, cider and mead. A directory in the app will feature active members of the Brewers Association of Maryland, the Maryland Distillers Guild and the Maryland Wineries Association. Through the app, Grow & Fortify hopes to connect users with local tasting rooms and boost revenue for beverage producers in Maryland, according to the release. The app will replace the annually printed Maryland Craft Beverage map that Grow & Fortify previously distributed at tourist destinations around the state. Daruma Tech developed the app, which will be available for free in the Apple and Google Play stores.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The rise of hybrid and remote work during the past year and a half is just one of the ways the future of business in Massachusetts could change in the post-pandemic years, shifting the state’s economic “center of gravity” away from the greater Boston core, according to a report released Tuesday by the Baker administration. Even as COVID-19 concerns ease, public transit ridership likely won’t return to pre-pandemic levels, with the steepest decline likely in commuter rail, according to the report, which found business travel may also fall compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. The report anticipates that changes in the economic landscape will require sweeping workforce training programs to connect workers with key skills for the future economy, with as many as 400,000 people needing to transition to different occupations or occupational categories over the next decade. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said the state needs to “turbo-charge” those training programs. The governor also said the state needs to increase the production of new housing and support downtown economies, as well as adapt to new transportation demands and promote flexibility in child care options, including increased child care subsidies for lower-income families.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlint: A federal judge listened Tuesday to residents who were victims of the city’s lead-contaminated water, a step in determining whether she should sign off on a $641 million deal that would settle claims against the state. More than a dozen people without lawyers signed up to speak, all in opposition. Thousands more are represented by attorneys who negotiated the settlement with Michigan and other parties and urged approval a day earlier. “This is a little unusual,” said U.S. District Judge Judith Levy, who left her courthouse in Ann Arbor for a courtroom 55 miles away in Genesee County. The settlement fund includes $600 million from Michigan and $20 million from Flint. But attorneys are seeking $200 million in fees. “The lawyers are making out like fat rats,” Audrey Young-Muhammed complained to the judge. Money would be available to every Flint child who was exposed to the water, adults who can show an injury, landlords, business owners, and anyone who paid water bills. More than 50,000 people have filed claims in a city with a population of roughly 95,000. Kids are supposed to get 80% of the money. Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement that the deal provides relief and prevents a “drawn out legal back-and-forth.” But the Rev. Freelon Threlkeld, addressing the judge, described the settlement as “some crumbs.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources says it won’t consider holding a wolf hunting or trapping season until 2022 at the earliest. The agency said in a statement last week that it’s taking longer than expected to update its 20-year-old wolf management plan, and it’s now expected to be done by March. “We will use our updated plan as we determine whether and how to use various management tools to ensure continuation of a healthy and sustainable wolf population in Minnesota,” the statement said. “Consideration of whether to hold hunting or trapping seasons will be guided by the updated plan.” Then-President Donald Trump’s administration in November ended Endangered Species Act protections for gray wolves in most of the United States, leaving states and tribes in charge of overseeing the animals. Minnesota held wolf seasons from 2012 to 2014 until courts blocked them. Some states moved quickly to liberalize hunting and trapping rules. The Center for Biological Diversity praised Minnesota for moving deliberately. Collette Adkins, the Arizona-based group’s carnivore conservation director, said Minnesota had “wisely prioritized first updating the management plan to reflect new science and the values of all Minnesotans.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Some residents with overdue water bills could be eligible for support through a new program the city announced this week. Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba on Monday said the city wants to help residents catch up on past-due bills and offer potential debt forgiveness. It will apply to low-income residents, those with water issues related to faulty equipment and individuals affected by weather events. Lumumba said money recouped through the program could be used to fix widespread infrastructure issues with the water system. City water customers owe more than $100 million in unpaid bills. “The city’s water woes have been well-chronicled,” Lumumba said at a briefing outside City Hall. “I’m asking all residents become a part of the program. If you qualify under the low-income program, you can look forward to turning the page.” The payment plans providing customers with additional time to make payments on their water bills will go into effect July 19. For those with large debt, the plan will allow residents to pay a monthly amount with an additional $10 tacked on over several months to cover past-due bills. Provided the resident pays on a timely basis, some debt can be forgiven, Lumumba said.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: College and university officials in the state will be able to raise tuition as much as they want under legislation Republican Gov. Mike Parson signed Tuesday. Currently, public colleges and universities can only raise tuition a limited amount to keep up with inflation, compensate for cuts in state aid, or keep up with the average tuition rates across the state. The new law will allow college officials to raise tuition as much as they want beginning in July 2022. Schools will be allowed to charge different tuition rates for different degrees, a change aimed at letting colleges set higher tuition in fields with higher education costs. The wide-ranging legislation also will let college athletes profit off their fame and celebrity, although the NCAA preemptively scrapped its rules against that earlier this month. Missouri joins a growing list of states that have enacted laws allowing student-athletes to earn money for autographs, sponsorships, or other uses of their names, images, likenesses or athletic reputations.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Two Native American women are leading cultural hikes throughout the state, sharing Indigenous stories connected to the land and animals who live there. As Lailani Upham and Carrie Bear Chief hiked through Upper Two Medicine in Glacier National Park on July 8, Lailani and Carrie told the story of a young warrior. The man was injured, and his two comrades left him in the park, but the man was later helped by a bear, who communicated with him in the Blackfoot language. They also told the story of a non-Native man who lived among the Blackfeet people. A sharpshooter, this man shot a bighorn sheep in the very spot they stood in the park. Lailani and Carrie collect stories from elders, and they record oral histories and study books that chronicle Indigenous people in Montana. Lailani, a Blackfeet woman who loves the outdoors, in March launched Iron Shield Creative, a platform that aims to “bring Indigenous stories to the world.” The business also offers multimedia storytelling projects and workshops. “I wanted to see people within our tribal communities get to document their own stories,” she said. Lailani said storytelling is crucial because it “brings people together.” Carrie, who works as a storyteller guide for Iron Shield Creative, said storytelling keeps Indigenous culture and tradition alive.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Former state Rep. Ernie Chambers, known for seeking the censure of judges he believes have acted outside the bounds of fairness, is targeting a judge in the state’s northeastern corner who saw the Nebraska Supreme Court overturn his denial of an adoption petition to a same-sex couple. In a complaint filed last week with the Nebraska Judicial Qualifications Commission, Chambers accused Dixon County Judge Douglas Luebe of violating state law requiring judges perform their duties fairly and impartially and without bias, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Luebe described himself as “old-fashioned” in denying an adoption petition for a same-sex married couple last year. His denial was based not on state law but on a legal definition of “wife” that he pulled from a law dictionary. Luebe said the married women who sought to adopt had listed themselves in their petition as “wife and wife.” He balked, saying the dictionary defined “wife” as “ ‘a woman who has a lawful living husband.’ ” Nebraska’s highest court overturned that denial in March, ruling that the plain language of state adoption law does not preclude same-sex married couples from adopting. In his complaint, Chambers called Luebe a “scalawag in judicial robes.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A Republican pageant winner and business owner is running for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto. Sharelle Mendenhall filed as a candidate with the Federal Election Commission earlier this month and is scheduled to officially kick off her campaign Thursday evening with a rally in Las Vegas. Mendenhall was Mrs. Nevada United States in 2020 and Ms. California United States in 2019. She is also the owner of Elite Expo Talent Agency, which hires models and talent for conventions and other events. Her campaign describes her as “a strong Christian, lifelong conservative” and supporter of former President Donald Trump. She joins Reno businessman and Army veteran Sam Brown in the GOP primary. Brown is expected to hold a rally kicking off his campaign July 24. Republican Adam Laxalt, the former Nevada attorney general, has said he’s considering another run for public office and is expected to join the race as well. Cortez Masto, who is seeking reelection, is the first Latina elected to the U.S. Senate. She was elected in 2016, winning the seat held by longtime Sen. Harry Reid after he retired.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nChesterfield: Since the 1960s, visitors along a forest trail could see stone stairs and archways, remnants of a country house that was referred to as a “castle.” That’s now giving way to gravity. The top section of stairs collapsed over the weekend in Madame Sherri Forest in West Chesterfield, named after a Ziegfeld Follies costume designer who lived in the house and threw parties for New York’s theatrical elite in the 1930s, the Brattleboro Reformer reports. The house was lost in a fire in 1962. The land is owned by the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests. Jack Savage, society president, said with all the rain the area has seen recently, it wouldn’t surprise him to hear the ground under the steps was saturated, and something just gave way. The society recently hosted a work party at the castle, cleaning up graffiti and weeding. “I know it’s a very popular place,” Savage said. “People will likely want to go see what’s there no more, but we ask that they stay away from the rubble so they don’t get hurt.” Madame Sherri, who was born Antoinette Bramare in 1878 in Paris, built her castle in 1929. She eventually abandoned the home and died in 1965 in Brattleboro, Vermont, at age 87.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Nearly 88,000 low-level marijuana offenses have been dismissed over the past two weeks, the state Supreme Court said, as the Garden State transitions to legalizing and decriminalizing the drug. The dismissed cases announced late Monday afternoon are the first in a wave of about 360,000 that are eligible to be automatically vacated, dismissed and expunged under the decriminalization law Gov. Phil Murphy signed earlier this year. Although the first batch of cases have been dismissed, they still have to go through the expungement process, which is automatic under the law. Earlier this month, New Jersey Supreme Court Chief Justice Stuart Rabner directed that pending cases and warrants for fourth-degree and disorderly persons offenses related to marijuana or hashish – including possession and distribution of small amounts, being under the influence and operating a motor vehicle while in possession of the drugs – be dismissed. The court’s July 1 order also said that related violations of probation or pretrial monitoring will be vacated and that driver’s license suspensions or revocations for failure to appear will be rescinded. Cases of eligible defendants who are pending sentencing or have completed sentencing will also be vacated and dismissed, the court said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Some of the state’s top climate and water experts warned lawmakers Tuesday that the effects of the drought on water supplies have been worsened by climate change, specifically an ongoing, long-term warming trend. They told members of a legislative committee that the drought is a harbinger of still more arid conditions to come as temperatures continue to climb and as rainfall becomes more variable. Human-caused climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years. Increasing temperatures also can lead to the snowpack that feeds rivers and streams melting several weeks earlier and more rapidly, resulting in more evaporation. That means less runoff into the Rio Grande, Pecos and other rivers, and that’s not going to change, since the experts said there are no indications that the long-term temperature trend will go away. New Mexico uses all its water and is pretty well tapped out when it comes to new supplies, said retired professor David Gutzler. He said long-term climate change should lead policymakers to expect and plan for diminished surface water supplies in the decades going forward. Groundwater supplies also are being depleted as more people are forced to pump water to make up for dwindling flows.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: It will be weeks before the state issues any payments from its $2.4 billion COVID-19 rent relief fund, state officials said Tuesday, adding to delays in a program that has been beset by technical glitches with its online application portal. At least 1.1 million New York households that rent have at least one family member who was economically affected by the pandemic, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration. But New York is one of four states that did not distribute any of the tens of billions of dollars in rent relief that Congress has paid out to states this year, according to a U.S. Treasury report of spending through May. On June 1, New York launched an online application portal allowing tenants and landlords to apply for rent – nearly two months after lawmakers first created the $2.4 billion fund. The State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance has said it would take four to six weeks to process applications to release payments to landlords. Six weeks later, agency spokesperson Anthony Farmer said Tuesday that first payments are “expected to go out in the coming weeks.” Tenants and landlords alike say New York’s application portal is too difficult, time-consuming and glitch-prone to ensure eligible New Yorkers are getting the help they need applying.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republicans advanced legislation Wednesday that defines how teachers can discuss certain concepts about race and racism inside the classroom. GOP Senate leader Phil Berger said his chamber is taking action as conservatives across the country seek to counter their understanding of “critical race theory,” a framework legal scholars developed in the 1970s and 1980s that centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation’s institutions, maintaining the dominance of white people in society. The latest version of the North Carolina bill would prevent teachers from compelling students to personally adopt any ideas from a list of 13 beliefs, even though though they cannot identify a single case of this happening inside the state’s classrooms, which serve about 1.5 million K-12 public school students. “We don’t want to indoctrinate folks in what I think is the core of critical race theory, which is that race is determinative of whether or not someone is going to be successful, that race is determinative of all matter of things that happen in society and that past discrimination justifies current discrimination,” Berger said in an interview before unveiling the updated education measure.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: City commissioners have directed the police department to present them with hate crime findings. “I’m going to be reporting on the hate crimes in terms of whether or not the city ordinance was issued or reports where the city ordinance was applied or federal law was applied,” said Dave Zibolski, chief of the Fargo Police Department. “Our current hate crimes are reviewed if they meet the elements of the federal law by the U.S. attorney’s office.” Zibolski said the reports will help determine whether the city’s ordinance on hate crimes is effective. “With the new hate crimes ordinance, we’ll have some additional and potential ordinance violations. So we’ll track those as well in terms of how many of those come in, and we’ll add in the prosecution piece. So what was prosecuted so they have reported in terms of is the ordinance is effective in a sense or how often is it used,” Zibolski told KVRR-TV. Eleven cases were investigated as potential hate crimes this year, “but through the course of the investigation, none of those could be shown to be hate crime-related in terms of the ability to prosecute them,” he said. Zibolski said reports of hate crimes are posted on the department’s website monthly.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Vaccination trends have led to the development of “two Ohios” when it comes to combating COVID-19, increasing vulnerability to the coronavirus’ highly contagious delta variant, the state’s top medical official warned Wednesday. The delta variant is rapidly becoming the disease’s dominant strain and is a real threat to those who are unvaccinated, said Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, chief medical officer for the Ohio Department of Health. The delta variant was first identified in India and is now spreading in more than 90 other countries. Meanwhile, about 5.3 million people in Ohio, or 45% of the population, have completed the inoculation process. “The reality is, we now have two Ohios,” Vanderhoff said. “An Ohio that is vaccinated and protected on the one hand, and an Ohio that is unvaccinated and vulnerable to delta on the other.” About 9 of every 10 people hospitalized for COVID-19 in central Ohio since April have been vaccinated only partially or not at all, said Dr. Andrew Thomas, chief clinical officer at the Ohio State University medical center. The doctors’ remarks came a day after Gov. Mike DeWine said Ohio will soon announce a second vaccine incentive program following the Vax-a-Million initiative that offered five $1 million prizes and five full-ride college scholarships.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt was forced to end a forum early after he and a panel of district attorneys were berated as they sought to explain the position prosecutors are taking on the U.S. Supreme Court’s McGirt decision. Stitt ended the “McGirt v Oklahoma Community Forum” roughly an hour earlier than planned Tuesday amid jeering from the audience as he tried to explain how the high court’s decision had unintended consequences for victims of crime regardless of tribal citizenship. The McGirt decision determined that a large swath of eastern Oklahoma remains an American Indian reservation and that state prosecutors lack the authority to pursue criminal charges in cases in which the defendants or victims are tribal citizens. It has led to dozens of criminal convictions in Oklahoma being overturned, including some death row cases. Most of those cases are having to be retried in federal court. “Nobody on this panel created the McGirt situation,” Stitt said shortly before ending the program. “This is a complicated issue, and we have 400,000 Natives who live in the state of Oklahoma. We’ve got 3.6 million non-Natives living in the state of Oklahoma. We need to keep all Oklahomans safe.” But the main source of frustration for Native Americans who attended the forum was the lack of tribal representation on the panel, the Tulsa World reports.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Residents struggled to get rides to cooling centers during the recent heat wave that is believed to have killed hundreds across the Pacific Northwest, officials said Monday, and staffing shortages prevented callers from reaching operators at an information line. State authorities are examining their response to scorching temperatures that broke all-time records across the region late last month as the West struggles with a historic drought and as climate change makes extreme weather more common and intense. Oregon blamed 116 deaths on the heat. “One of the heartbreaking things about this heat wave is that there were resources that were available to communities, whether it was cooling centers or transportation, and folks couldn’t access those resources to protect themselves,” Andrew Phelps, director of the Oregon Office of Emergency Management, said at a news conference. In the week leading up to the late June heat wave, Oregon officials contacted providers, set up cooling centers and connected with vulnerable populations, including the thousands of homeless people who live on the streets of Portland and in low-income communities. One major complaint from community members was not knowing where to go to cool down and a struggle to find that information.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nCarlisle: The disinterred remains of nine Native American children who died more than a century ago while attending a government-run school in Pennsylvania were headed home to Rosebud Sioux tribal lands in South Dakota on Wednesday after a ceremony returning them to relatives. The handoff at a graveyard on the grounds of the U.S. Army’s Carlisle Barracks was part of the fourth set of transfers to take place since 2017. The remains of an Alaskan Aleut child were returned to her tribe earlier this summer. “We want our children home no matter how long it takes,” said U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, who in June announced a nationwide investigation into the boarding schools that attempted to assimilate Indigenous children into white society. Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary, said at the event that “forced assimilation practices” stripped away the children’s clothing, their language and their culture. She said the government aims to locate the schools and burial sites and identify the names and tribal affiliations of children from the boarding schools around the country. In Pennsylvania, the nine sets of remains inside small wooden coffins were carried past a phalanx of tribal members and well-wishers before being loaded into a trailer to be driven to Sioux City, Iowa. The children died between 1880 and 1910.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State environmental regulators have denied a permit for a medical waste-to-energy facility in West Warwick. In denying the application Tuesday for MedRecycler-RI Inc., the Department of Environmental Management cited several factors, including a recently passed law prohibiting new high-heat medical waste processing facilities in the state. The agency also cited environmental concerns; a lack of adequate details about testing protocols; the facility’s lack of emergency response plans; a lack of clarity about how much and where medical waste would be stored; the facility’s proximity to residential neighborhoods; and questions about the facility’s technology, which has not previously been used on medical waste. The company planned to use a process known as pyrolysis to break down used gloves, tubing and syringes to generate power. MedRecycler has said the facility will be safe, provide jobs and tax revenue. The site would not accept hazardous waste. The company said it was not subject to the new law because it does not apply retroactively. Nicholas Campanella, chairman and CEO of MedRecycler’s parent company, Sun Pacific Holding Corp., told The Boston Globe that the company is considering its legal options.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMount Pleasant: An abandoned liposuction machine was the suspicious package that closed one of the state’s busiest bridges for three hours over the weekend, according to authorities. Someone called police Saturday after finding a metal box near a pillar of the Ravenel Bridge in Mount Pleasant, just across the Cooper River from Charleston, investigators said. The caller showed officers pictures of a metal box with a lock, green and red buttons, and a fan. Officers then confirmed the box’s location, and a supervisor shut down the bridge and called the bomb squad, according to a Mount Pleasant Police report. The bridge was opened after about three hours, and officials confirmed Monday that the item was a liposuction machine. The Ravenel Bridge carries about 77,000 vehicles a day on U.S. Highway 17 between Charleston and Mount Pleasant, according to South Carolina Department of Transportation data.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem suspended her Cabinet secretary overseeing state prisons and the warden of the state penitentiary in Sioux Falls, following an anonymous complaint that alleged supervising corrections officers regularly sexually harassed their fellow employees, that employee morale is low and that promotions are plagued by nepotism. The governor said she was briefed about 7 p.m. Tuesday on an internal review from the Bureau of Human Resources that was prompted by the anonymous complaint. Less than three hours later, Noem said she was putting Secretary of Corrections Mike Leidholt and State Penitentiary Warden Darin Young on administrative leave and commissioning an investigation into the allegations. The complaints had been known to state officials for months, according to the organization that represents state employees. The two pages of the complaint released by Noem’s office do not name either Leidholt or Young but allege that supervising corrections officers at the prison were allowed to sexually harass employees and that attempts to report the harassment were ignored. The complaint says schedules at the prison were adjusted so the officers could “work in the same vicinities as their interest/victims.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The federal government will not alert the state when unaccompanied migrant children are brought to Tennessee to be placed with sponsors, officials with Gov. Bill Lee’s administration told lawmakers Tuesday. Brandon Gibson, Lee’s chief operating officer, said that the federal Department of Health and Human Services has largely directed her questions to information posted on government websites and policy statutes. Gibson said it’s her interpretation that the federal government could disclose information to local law enforcement about when immigrant children pass through the state, but federal officials have told her they won’t due to privacy concerns. “The response I got from HHS was that because of confidentiality they would not be notifying local law enforcement,” Gibson said. HHS officials did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Gibson gave her remarks Tuesday before a legislative panel made up of entirely of GOP members. The group is tasked with investigating refugee and immigration settlement in Tennessee after a local television station aired footage of children arriving at a Chattanooga airport and boarding buses in the middle of the night.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: State officials on Tuesday added 59 deaths to the toll wrought by the Feb. 14 cold wave and the ensuing collapse of the state’s electric power grid. The deaths newly tallied by the Texas Department of State Health Services boosted the toll from 151 to 210 deaths, most from exposure to the sometimes-subzero temperatures. Still, some were blamed on carbon monoxide poisoning as freezing Texans sought warmth from cars and outdoor grills. The count remained preliminary and may change as more deaths are confirmed, the department said. The county with the highest death toll was Harris, where Houston is located, with 43 deaths. Travis County, where Austin holds most of its population, had 28 deaths. Dallas County reported 20 deaths. The toll is a far cry from the initial March 15 report of 57 deaths. The toll was raised to 111 on March 25, 125 on April 6 and 151 on April 28. The collapse of the power grid managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas has made electric reliability in Texas an ongoing political question. In early June, Gov. Gregg Abbott declared that state lawmakers had fixed the problem. Since then, two conservation alerts issued by ERCOT during temperate spring weather prompted renewed questions.\n\nUtah\n\nDraper: The drought gripping the West is contributing to an increased number of mountain lion sightings in the state, police said. It appears cougars are being forced into more populated areas to get enough water to drink, Draper Police Lt. Pat Evans told Fox13 News. One recent encounter happened in Coyote Hollow, near the Salt Lake City suburb of Draper. Hiker Sherie Allen said she had just hit the trail with friend Shelli Roberts and Roberts’ small Shitsu Yorkie dog, Buster, when she heard something. “We hear this like, ‘rawrrrr’ – it wasn’t like a growl, it was like that screech,” she said. It was a cougar, about 6 feet away. “She, luckily, grabbed my arm and was like, ‘Whatever you do, do not run,’ and she stopped me in my tracks,” Roberts said of Allen. Roberts picked up Buster, and the big cat tracked them as they backed away slowly and got away safely. Other hikers should be aware of the danger and watch for big cats. In an encounter, people should try to make themselves look big, maintain eye contact and never run away from a cougar. Any small pets or kids should be kept close.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Some performance venues across the state are preparing to reopen with help from federal money after the coronavirus pandemic forced them to close. So far, 43 Vermont locales benefited from the $13 million from the Shuttered Venue Operator Grant program, part of federal pandemic relief assistance. “From Brattleboro to St. Albans, from Derby Line down to Bennington, there’s gonna be a real shot that your community theater, your community venue will be reopened very soon,” Vermont’s Democratic U.S. Rep. Peter Welch told MyNBC5. Two Burlington locations are preparing to reopen. The Vermont Comedy Club, which received more than $400,000, is set to reopen Labor Day weekend. The Flynn Center, which received more than $1.8 million, plans to open again in October. “The funding came through right at the perfect time for us to be able to hire our contractors and start booking talent,” said Natalie Miller, co-owner of Vermont Comedy Club. Miller said the club is getting ready for the reopening. “We’re gonna be able to space people out a little bit more because everyone is in there, they’re laughing, droplet city. So we’re gonna make it a lot safer,” she said.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: An effort is underway to make the larger Chesapeake Bay area part of the National Park Service. The Virginian-Pilot reports it would be called the Chesapeake National Recreation Area. Behind the effort is a group of conservation nonprofits, community leaders and lawmakers who are working to draft legislation in Congress. It’s unclear exactly what the recreation area would look like. Proponents don’t call for the entire bay to be included. But certain land-based sites would provide public access to it. “The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure, and the national park system represents America’s most treasured landscapes,” said Reed Perry, external affairs manager for the Chesapeake Conservancy, which is a part of the group. The idea has been around since the 1960s. And the park service has already established itself along parts of the nation’s largest estuary. For instance, there is the 3,000-mile Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail and the Fort Monroe National Monument in Hampton. A federal working group has been formed to explore the possibility of designating the Chesapeake recreation area.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: An extreme heat wave damaged cherries grown in the Yakima Valley and the Northwest in late June and early July. The high temperature reached 113 degrees Fahrenheit in Yakima on June 29, an all-time record. The heat caused various issues, such as sunburn and stunted growth that made the cherries unsuitable for the fresh cherry market, The Yakima Herald-Republic reports. Many cherries were left on trees, while others were picked but processed, which provides a lower return to growers. Northwest Cherry Growers is still assessing the damage, but President B.J. Thurlby estimated about 20% of the overall crop was lost. Much of the loss happened in the Yakima Valley, where cherries were about to be picked. The Northwest cherry growing region includes five states: Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Montana. In May, the Yakima-based organization estimated a crop of 23.8 million 20-pound boxes in the five-state growing region. Thurlby said the yield this season is now likely in the 18 million to 19 million box range, which would be similar to the 2020 crop. Last year’s crop was affected by frost and wind before harvest. A few cherry varieties received a disproportionate amount of damage: Bing and Skeena, two red-fleshed cherry varieties, and the popular Rainier.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The governor has launched a program to showcase chefs across the state. The West Virginia Chef Ambassador Program aims to promote culinary innovation and farm-to-table experiences with the goal of expanding the state’s agritourism industry, officials said. Gov. Jim Justice launched the program Monday in partnership with the West Virginia Department of Tourism. Nominations are open for this year’s inaugural class of chef ambassadors. “West Virginia’s culinary industry is one of our state’s best-kept secrets,” Justice said. “It’s time we take the flavors we all know and love – and the chefs behind our favorite local dishes – and shine a spotlight on the great things happening across the Mountain State.” The initiative will serve as a partnership between the Tourism Department and the top nine chefs to promote dining and Appalachian cuisine. Ambassadors will be selected to serve one-year terms. Each ambassador will be selected to represent a specific travel region.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The operators of a startup that allows private homeowners to rent their swimming pools by the hour said Wednesday that Wisconsin regulators are all wet and want them to back off demands that they say would kill their business. Wisconsin is the first state to push back against Swimply, which started in 2018 with just four pools in New Jersey but has taken off during the pandemic as more people looked for private spaces to swim and have fun. The business works like an Airbnb for swimming pools. Private homeowners list their pools on the website and app as available for rent. Most of the pools on Swimply are in warm-weather locations, but it recently dove into the Wisconsin market. It currently has only about a dozen pools available to rent statewide, starting at about $35 an hour, but it’s looking to expand. Wisconsin regulators told Swimply in April that pools offered for rent would have to be treated the same as large, public swimming pools. That means a pool’s owner would have to obtain a license and meet construction requirements that are more onerous. The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, which is representing Swimply, said it will file a lawsuit if the state doesn’t back off. Wisconsin is the only state that has challenged Swimply, institute spokeswoman Erin Collins said.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: The president of the University of Wyoming is proposing several academic changes and up to 75 layoffs as the university absorbs budget cuts due to a decline in state support over the past several years. President Ed Seidel will present the plan to the university’s Board of Trustees this week, and the panel is expected to take public comment before voting on it in November, the university said. The proposal would eliminate some programs with low enrollment and consolidate and reconfigure some of its colleges to better combine degree programs that have overlapping courses while reducing redundancies, officials said. The changes will lead to the layoff of at least 10 department heads. However, the university will look to rehire some of them for new departments that are created, university spokesperson Chad Baldwin said Tuesday. Seidel’s administration is proposing adding a School of Computing, a Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, and the Wyoming Outdoor Recreation, Tourism and Hospitality Initiative. Those programs are aimed at training students for future jobs in the state. The university has absorbed $42 million in cuts.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/business/agricultural/2022/07/05/drought-heat-ravage-kansas-farms-politicians-debate-climate-change/7700521001/", "title": "Drought, heat ravage Kansas farms as politicians debate climate ...", "text": "A gubernatorial drought declaration covers all of Kansas.\n\nFor the first time, the 2022 annual Kansas Water Authority report acknowledged the role of climate change while recommending mitigation and adaptation strategies.\n\nInternationally, climate scientists warn of a \"code red for humanity.\"\n\nAs farmers harvest a drought-ravaged wheat crop after a heat wave killed cattle, discussion of what governments can do to help remain divided over the role of climate change.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/27/politics/senate-race-rankings-march-elections/index.html", "title": "The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 | CNN Politics", "text": "(CNN) The war in Ukraine has shifted attention overseas, but even if President Joe Biden 's approval has ticked up nominally, the national environment heading into the 2022 midterms still looks treacherous for his fellow Democrats as they try to hold their Senate majority .\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has given Biden a convenient foil on whom to blame high gas prices. (\"Putin's price hike,\" he has called it.) But Republicans are hammering Democrats for rising inflation , which they argue predates the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats point to the pandemic and stuck supply chains for the current inflation woes, blaming corporations for pocketing profits while Americans pay the price at the pump. The most vulnerable Democratic Senate incumbents -- Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire -- have tried to get ahead of the inevitable GOP attacks by introducing legislation that would suspend the federal gas tax through the end of the year.\n\nIn a sign they're trying to distance themselves from the national party, most of them also sided with Republicans on a recent vote to overturn the requirement that passengers wear masks on public transportation. Establishing their own brands in their states, independent of Biden, will be a challenge for Democrats running in November if the President's approval rating remains in the low 40s . The party in the White House traditionally loses seats during the first midterm of a new president's term.\n\nDespite those obstacles, the Senate seat most likely to flip is still a pickup opportunity for Democrats. Pennsylvania has led this list since its incarnation -- a testament to it being an open seat in a state Biden carried in 2020. The ranking is based on CNN's reporting and fundraising and advertising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. Two seats have traded places on the latest list, however, which underscores the difficult environment for Democrats: New Hampshire slides above North Carolina as more likely to flip.\n\nRepublicans have their own challenges, though, mostly candidate-driven. May primaries in Ohio and Pennsylvania are heating up as GOP candidates jockey for former President Donald Trump 's blessing. At the same time, candidates who do have his backing are finding that it doesn't solve all their problems. (Trump just rescinded his endorsement for the open Senate seat in Alabama, where Rep. Mo Brooks' campaign was underwhelming.) He's backed candidates in two competitive states with May primaries -- Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nMuch to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's chagrin, the chair of the GOP committee charged with flipping the Senate recently released an 11-point plan that calls for all Americans to pay income tax. Expect Democrats to tie all Republicans, even those who have disavowed the tax proposal, to Florida Sen. Rick Scott's plan (released by his campaign, not the National Republican Senatorial Committee). It's a tactic that House Democrats successfully used against the GOP in 2018, when they tied even Republicans who had voted against repealing Obamacare to that effort, and that Republicans used against Democrats in 2020 in linking the entire party to the \"defund the police\" movement.\n\nThe paid media (i.e., television advertising) portion of the campaign is just taking off in many of these races, so we'll see how much that message sticks in the months to come.\n\nHere are the 10 Senate seats most likely to flip with less than eight months to go before Election Day:\n\n1. Pennsylvania\n\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\n\nPennsylvania once again tops the list of seats most likely to flip. Republican candidates and super PACs have spent nearly $40 million in the open-seat race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey ahead of the May 17 primary, with much of it coming from Mehmet Oz and David McCormick and their allies. Trump has yet to weigh in after his chosen candidate dropped out in November, which is fueling even more spending as Republicans try to prove their loyalty to the former President.\n\nAs the GOP field has grown, the Democratic one has thinned with Val Arkoosh -- a doctor and the only woman in the primary -- dropping out in February. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and US Rep. Conor Lamb , both from Western Pennsylvania, are on the air, mostly with positive bio spots that give the primary a noticeably different tone than the GOP contest. Fetterman is seen as the current front-runner because of his fundraising advantage and statewide name recognition. But Lamb has a record of winning tough House races, with his ads touting that he's previously beaten \"the Trump machine.\" Lamb has also picked up the endorsement of the Philadelphia Democratic Party. State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who hails from the vote-rich city, has some significant labor endorsements but is not on TV.\n\nThe bottom line here is that both parties think the other side's primary will take the eventual nominee too far to the extremes. But, given how much the GOP primary is pushing candidates toward Trump in a state Biden won (and all the millions of dollars putting that message in front of voters), this Democratic pickup opportunity is still the most likely to change party hands.\n\n2. Georgia\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\n\nDemocratic Sen. Raphael Warnock is running for a full six-year term after winning a special election runoff last year. He has impressed with strong fundraising and is on the air with positive spots leaning into his background as a pastor and touting the legislation he's co-sponsored that would temporarily suspend the federal gas tax.\n\nFormer NFL star Herschel Walker is the prohibitive Republican favorite in the May 24 primary, with both McConnell and Trump behind him. But attacks from his primary rivals and recent negative headlines over his business record could preview some of the scrutiny to come in the general election as Democrats gear up to face a first-time candidate whom much of the GOP establishment was bad mouthing this time last year.\n\nBut even with an untested likely opponent and a fundraising prowess that bests longer-serving Democratic incumbents on this list, Warnock is highly vulnerable because of the fundamentals of Georgia. He narrowly overperformed Biden in 2020, but both won by close margins in this purple state. And given Biden's sagging approval ratings, the senator will need to maintain -- and grow -- his margins over the President. Turnout will be a crucial question in a midterm year, but in that regard, Democrats are excited that Stacey Abrams' candidacy for governor may help energize nonwhite voters.\n\n3. Wisconsin\n\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\n\nAs the only Republican running for reelection in a state Biden won in 2020, Sen. Ron Johnson remains the most vulnerable GOP incumbent this year. A Marquette University Law School poll conducted at the end of February found that 45% of registered Wisconsin voters had an unfavorable view of him with only 33% seeing him favorably.\n\nDemocrats were ecstatic that Johnson decided to break a pledge to serve only two terms, and they see political hay in his penchant for controversial remarks. See, for example, his recent call for Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act if they win control of Congress. That's a debate Democrats are happy to have after running on defending Obamacare in the 2018 midterms, when the law was much more popular than when Johnson last faced voters, in 2016. (Johnson later issued a clarifying statement, saying he he did not mean to suggest that repealing and replacing Obamacare should be a top priority for his party.)\n\nStill, Republicans note that Johnson has been underestimated before and has come from behind to win. And while Biden narrowly carried the Badger State, his approval rating is at 43% (with 52% disapproving), according to the same Marquette poll.\n\nThe Democratic field remains largely unknown. Even Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, whom the Marquette poll found in the lead among Democratic primary voters with 23%, was unknown to 53% of them. Two of his challengers who have poured their own money into their campaigns -- Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry and state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski -- are on TV, so voters' familiarity with them could grow ahead of the August primary.\n\n4. Arizona\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\n\nThe biggest news in Arizona over the past month is that GOP Gov. Doug Ducey said (again) that he would not run for Senate , which was a major relief for Democrats as Sen. Mark Kelly runs for a full six-year term in the purple state.\n\nThe crowded field of GOP challengers, all jockeying for a Trump endorsement, is pulling the candidates to the right, potentially complicating the eventual nominee's ability to make a general election pivot after the August primary. (Former Sen. Martha McSally, whom Kelly defeated in a 2020 special election, struggled with this dynamic in her races for Senate.)\n\nState Attorney General Mark Brnovich is seen as the GOP front-runner, considering he's already won statewide, but he's struggled with fundraising. Venture capitalist Blake Masters picked up the backing of the anti-tax Club for Growth and already had the support of a super PAC funded by tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel, his onetime boss, so he's not suffering for lack of outside assistance. Solar energy entrepreneur Jim Lamon, who had loaned his campaign $8 million by the end 2021, is up with plenty of ads talking about immigration.\n\nWith the GOP primary still in flux, Kelly's using his massive fundraising advantage to run positive spots about infrastructure and his work to address supply chain issues , with Democrats also spending on Spanish-language ads . Like Warnock, Kelly overperformed Biden in 2020, but the national environment has gotten worse for Democrats since and they cannot count on presidential-level turnout this year.\n\n5. Nevada\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\n\nSen. Catherine Cortez Masto is running ads featuring hospitality and restaurant workers touting her pandemic recovery efforts -- another Democratic incumbent who's using her campaign coffers to go up with positive spots while she has the airwaves to herself. Her campaign and Democratic outside groups are also running Spanish-language ads -- an important early investment in the Silver State.\n\nFormer state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who has the backing of Trump and McConnell, is expected to win the June Republican primary, but he still faces a well-funded opponent. Laxalt is the grandson of a former governor and senator with the same last name, but he lost his most recent election, the 2018 governor's race. Voters may know him more recently for serving as Trump's state campaign co-chair and echoing his election fraud claims, which Democrats point to in calling Laxalt too extreme for the state.\n\nBut Biden didn't win Nevada by all that much (about 2 points), and in a challenging national environment -- with voters here especially worried about inflation and the economy -- Cortez Masto is likely in for a tough race. The former Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chair hasn't raised nearly as much money as two of her higher-profile colleagues up for reelection (Warnock and Kelly) and has less recent experience trying to distance herself from the national party when facing voters. She won with about 47% of the vote in 2016, underperforming Hillary Clinton, to become the first Latina elected to the US Senate\n\n6. New Hampshire\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\n\nDemocratic Sen. Maggie Hassan is in for a competitive race, even without a challenge from GOP Gov. Chris Sununu. Yes, the Granite State has gone blue in every federal election in the past six years. And yes, by the numbers, it's the most daunting for Republicans given that Biden carried it by 7 points. But given Biden's low approval rating and a sour national mood, even a Republican with a much lower profile than Sununu should be able to keep this one close.\n\nFifty-five percent of New Hampshire adults disapproved of Biden's job performance while 43% approved, according to a University of New Hampshire poll conducted in late February. Ratings of his handling of the economy were worse. Those may be difficult numbers for Hassan, a first-term senator, to overcome in an era when Senate races are increasingly nationalized.\n\nJust how competitive November's race is, however, may depend on what kind of campaigns Republicans Chuck Morse and Kevin Smith put together. There's still time for these relatively unknown candidates to introduce themselves, but a September primary also doesn't give them much time to position for the general election.\n\nDemocrats think New Hampshire is one state where the abortion issue may prove to be particularly salient if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade this year, because of the higher concentration of college-educated voters in the Granite State. Nearly two-thirds of New Hampshire adults in that UNH poll (which was taken before Biden nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court) said they wanted him to pick a justice who would vote to uphold Roe v. Wade.\n\n7. North Carolina\n\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\n\nTrump took sides in the GOP primary in June, but his chosen candidate, US Rep. Ted Budd, hasn't cleared the field. \"He's loved by, especially, the conservative wing of the party — highly respected guy,\" Trump told the Washington Examiner earlier this month. Budd has had plenty of help on the airwaves from the political arm of the Club for Growth, which has spent millions attacking former Gov. Pat McCrory ahead of the May 17 Republican primary.\n\nThe latest back-and-forth in this race is about Putin. McCrory's first statewide TV ad accused Budd of being \"friendly\" toward Russia, selectively splicing comments the congressman has made about the Russian President, including calling him a \"very intelligent actor.\" The club responded with an ad calling McCrory's attack a \"low-down, dirty hit job\" and surfacing footage of Budd calling Putin \"evil\" and expressing support for Ukraine.\n\nFormer Rep. Mark Walker and combat veteran Marjorie K. Eastman are still in the race but even if they peel some votes away from Budd or McCrory, it may not be enough to spoil an outright victory since the threshold needed to avoid a primary runoff is only 30%.\n\nThe Democratic field is essentially set, with Cheri Beasley seeing her most viable opponents drop out. The former state Supreme Court chief justice hasn't raised as much money as some Democrats in other races. And even though she doesn't have a voting record, her judicial record could provide fodder for Republicans to try to paint her as soft on crime, similar to the way they've gone after Jackson since her Supreme Court nomination. Democrats are hopeful that a Black woman who's previously been elected statewide will help mitigate the turnout problem they've often faced in North Carolina, especially in midterm years, but that may not be enough to overcome any anti-Democratic headwinds in a Trump state.\n\n8. Florida\n\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\n\nGOP Sen. Marco Rubio, who's likely to face Democratic Rep. Val Demings in the fall, starts this race ahead in a state that Trump carried twice. The war in Ukraine has brought plenty of earned media opportunities for the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. His campaign has attacked Biden and Democrats for not doing more to increase domestic oil production amid a surge in gas prices.\n\nDemings, who has impressed with her fundraising, has a compelling profile -- she's a former Orlando police chief with firsthand experience fighting crime, a detail that appears prominently in her campaign media. But Republicans are signaling they will continue to tie her to the national party, even on the issue of rising crime rates.\n\n9. Ohio\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\n\nThe Buckeye State is playing host to one of the nastiest Republican primaries of the election cycle. But regardless of how badly dinged the eventual nominee emerges from the primary, he or she will start with the advantage for this open seat in an increasingly red state that Trump twice won by 8 points. Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan faces a primary, too, but he's largely consolidated party support.\n\nIt's possible the May 3 primary will be delayed because of uncertainty over state legislative and congressional maps. That would only give Republicans more time for the kinds of attacks that have made this a topsy-turvy race, with poll leads fluctuating depending on who's on the receiving end of the most televised vitriol.\n\nBy far the biggest motif in GOP advertising isn't Russia, but something a little closer to home, although still some 1,500 miles away from Ohio -- the US southern border with Mexico.\n\n10. Missouri\n\nIncumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring)\n\nThe prospect of former Gov. Eric Greitens winning the GOP nomination was already causing headaches in a red state that has no other reason to go blue. Those pains got more intense when Greitens' ex-wife alleged he was physically abusive toward his children and her, according to court documents filed last week. (Greitens has denied this.) His primary opponents immediately called for him to drop out of the race, with some members of GOP leadership in Washington, DC, echoing that.\n\nLater in the week, Trump, who had previously left the door open to endorsing Greitens, gave US Rep. Billy Long reason to hope when he issued a positive statement about the former auctioneer. \"Have the great people of Missouri been considering the big, loud, and proud personality of Congressman Billy Long for the Senate?\" Trump said. \"This is not an Endorsement, but I'm just askin'?\"", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/09/big-tex-ac-problems-camping-changes-news-around-states/116918714/", "title": "Big Tex, AC problems: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: An infectious disease expert said Monday that he is concerned about lagging vaccination rates in the state, as well as the number of unvaccinated people who appear to have abandoned wearing masks. Alabama has the second-lowest percentage of people vaccinated, ranking only above Mississippi, according to numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 36% of Alabama’s population has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, and 29% are fully inoculated. “All of us want to get back to normal, every single one of us. The vaccine is our sure ticket to get there,” said Dr. Mike Saag, a professor with the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s Division of Infectious Diseases. The CDC has said fully vaccinated people are safe to go without masks, but Saag said that message appears to have gotten misconstrued. “What I saw over the Memorial Day weekend: Most everybody was walking around without a mask as if everyone was vaccinated. We know around 70% of the Alabama population has not been vaccinated,” he said. While new cases and hospitalizations are down significantly from their peak, the effects of the Memorial Day holiday will serve as a “stress test” of sorts, Saag said: “It’s not going to be like the surges we saw in January, but it will be a bump. The question is how big.”\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: As the current special legislative session slumped along Monday, Gov. Mike Dunleavy urged lawmakers to act on his proposal to place in the state constitution a new formula for the annual check residents receive from Alaska’s oil-wealth fund. Some legislators have raised questions about some of the administration’s modeling assumptions and concerns with tackling the dividend issue without other pieces of a possible fiscal plan. “It’s like whack-a-mole,” Dunleavy said in an interview. “Every time we come up with a thing to move this along, it’s not enough for some people, and you start to become somewhat cynical. You start to say, ‘Well, wait a second. You’re moving the goal posts constantly to try and fix this issue.’ ... We have not decreed that they shouldn’t come forth with ideas. Let’s see what their ideas are.” The Republican said if legislators want to discuss revenues, they can do so in August, when he has scheduled another special session. The agenda for that session references “an act or acts relating to measures to increase state revenues” and includes his proposed constitutional amendment that would put the establishment of new taxes to a public vote. He has unsuccessfully pushed a similar constitutional proposal the past two years.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: More than 6 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have now been administered in the state. Gov. Doug Ducey hailed it as a major milestone Monday and urged residents to keep the momentum going. More than 3.3 million people statewide have received at least a first dose – 47.3% of Arizona’s vaccine-eligible population. About 2.9 million are fully vaccinated. The state is shutting down operations at its mass vaccination sites by June 28, with public health officials citing the vast availability of doses at community health centers, doctor’s offices, pharmacies and pop-up clinics. Maricopa County health officials have started an education campaign with ads on television, radio, billboards and social media encouraging people to get vaccinated. Public health officials said in a news release that they’re trying to reach people who are on the fence about getting a vaccine, telling them it’s OK to have questions, and they should seek answers from trusted sources. Meanwhile, the state dashboard reported 374 new cases and no deaths Monday. That brings the total numbers of cases and deaths to 884,195 and 17,700, respectively. The number of patients hospitalized for the virus deviated little from the past few days at 560. According to the state, 141 of those patients were in intensive care units.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Factory shutdowns during the pandemic have caused a shortage of air conditioning equipment. “If we have a real hot summer, we could get desperate,” said Chuck Hooks, the service manager at Blaylock Heating & Air Conditioning, Plumbing and Drain Cleaning in Fort Smith. The factory shutdown has led to a dearth of air conditioning equipment in the state and across the nation, Hooks said. “There’s a big demand and a big shortage for pretty much everything to do with our field right now,” said Michael Lytle, the commercial project manager for Wilson’s Heating & Air Conditioning in Van Buren. Lytle said there is also a shortage of metals for ductwork and air conditioning equipment, which has caused prices to steadily increase. Michael Roberts, the owner of Roberts Heat and Air in Booneville, said he has had trouble getting parts for the past year. Equipment that was taking two to four weeks to come in is now taking six to 24 weeks to arrive, Hooks said. “It will get worse before it gets better is my understanding,” he said. Hooks has his equipment delivered from factories in the United States but said the situation is even worse for people who get equipment from overseas. Because of the coronavirus, the U.S. would not let ships dock and unload their supplies.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Mayor London Breed married four couples inside City Hall on Monday to mark the reopening of the storied building after it shut down in March 2020 as part of a regional lockdown. Madelyn Peterson and Indira Carmona were the first couple to wed on the grand staircase of the building’s rotunda. The building’s doors opened at 8 a.m. for those looking to get marriage license applications, business registrations, birth and death certificates, and other documents. Visitors are still required to wear a mask and socially distance. San Francisco has had some of the strictest pandemic-related restrictions in the country, and the compact city of nearly 900,000 has reported 36,766 COVID-19 cases and just 546 deaths. To compare, Long Beach has about 467,000 residents but more than 53,000 cases and 900 deaths. Vaccination rates in San Francisco are also high, with 80% of residents having received at least one dose. Moments before Breed officiated the weddings, she raised the Pride flag outside the building’s main entrance to officially kick off the annual LGBTQ Pride Month celebrations. “We’re going to celebrate; we’re going to have a good time; we’re going to keep smiles on our faces because we survived a pandemic, y’all,” Breed told a small, cheerful crowd gathered for the flag-raising ceremony.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The Fort Collins Rescue Mission wants to expand its downtown shelter and has filed a conceptual application to build a “semi-permanent” structure in its parking lot for men during winter months. The structure would essentially extend capacity by another 50 to 70 beds if the nonprofit is allowed to put bunk beds inside, said shelter Senior Director Seth Forwood. While the facility would not be permanent, it would have windows, doors, flooring, heating and ventilation – everything a permanent addition would have, he said. With financial support from the city of Fort Collins, the Rescue Mission operated a temporary overnight winter shelter from mid-October to April. While it squeezed in about 150 men experiencing homelessness, the downtown Rescue Mission can handle half that number. The city has been working for years on additional shelter resources. For now, federal coronavirus relief funding approved in spring 2020 to staff and run the Rescue Mission’s 24/7 shelter downtown runs out at the end of June. Forwood said he’s still hoping the federal government’s latest pandemic aid package will come through to provide funding beyond July 1. “Like with many things COVID-related, I have hopes that building these plans won’t be for naught,” Forwood said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state Senate early Tuesday narrowly approved a long-awaited bill that would legalize the recreational use of cannabis after years of failed efforts in both chambers to pass the legislation. The 19-17 vote in the Democratic-controlled Senate came just before 2 a.m. and hours after lawmakers announced they had reached a compromise on how to ensure the new industry will benefit those residents adversely affected by the nation’s war on drugs. Six Democrats voted against the proposal, while one Republican voted in favor. “We’ve seen what’s been wrought by having a war on drugs. Whole communities have been decimated,” said state Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, co-chairman of the legislature’s Judiciary Committee. The bill now heads to the House, where Democratic majority leaders said they hope to see it pass before Wednesday’s midnight adjournment of the regular legislative session. They did not rule out going into a special legislative session if time runs out. “I think it will get done. I think the marijuana vote will happen, I do,” Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Tuesday morning. Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said he would sign the legislation.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The General Assembly is allowing some members of the public to return to the building and listen to floor debates in person for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Legislative Hall in Dover will allow 25 people each in the House and Senate for the remaining 11 days of the legislative year that ends June 30. Masks will be required, and attendees will sit in the galleries, according to a news release from the General Assembly announcing the opening. Seats can be reserved on the General Assembly website legis.delaware.gov. The House and Senate will use separate online signup forms, which will be available at 5 p.m. the day before each session day. The General Assembly meets on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Sign-ups will close either once all seats have been reserved or at 10 a.m. the next morning, whichever comes first. Capitol Police will be given the names of those who have reserved a seat. Doors to Legislative Hall will open 30 minutes before each chamber convenes its session. “In order to accommodate as many Delawareans as possible, members of the public are encouraged to sign up to observe only one chamber each day,” the release said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has launched SmarTrip on Google Pay, expanding payment options for Android smartphone users on the Metro system. As the pandemic eases, and more riders return to Metrorail and Metrobus, officials said Android users will now have the ability to use their SmarTrip card, purchase a new one or add value to a card digitally, WUSA-TV reports. “It’s an investment in the future of Metro, as we modernize our system to incorporate many new technologies,” Metro General Manager and CEO Paul J. Wiedefeld said in a statement. Customers will also be able to download the SmarTrip app from the Google Play Store, with Metro waiving the $2 SmarTrip card fee for all Android users purchasing a virtual card during the first six months. Metro rolled out similar options for for Apple iPhone users in September 2020. Card readers will be available at 91 Metro stations, Metro parking garages and lots, Metrobus routes and even regional buses across the capital region. Data shows that 98% of Metro users have a smartphone, according to WMATA officials.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Miami-based Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings on Monday announced plans to set sail from two Florida ports requiring passengers to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 despite state legislation banning businesses from asking for proof. Norwegian announced sailings from New York, Los Angeles, Port Canaveral and Miami. Carnival Cruise Line, also based in Miami, announced sailings from the Port of Galveston, Texas, with vaccinated guests and was working with Florida officials for a ship to leave from PortMiami. The cruise lines’ plans appear to be at odds with the new state law. The sailings are contingent on obtaining a certificate from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and it remains unclear how the plans can be reconciled with Florida law. Norwegian said in a statement that it was in contact with Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office on the requirements. In April, DeSantis signed an order banning businesses from requiring customers to show proof of vaccination and prohibiting state agencies from issuing so-called vaccine passports that document COVID-19 inoculations and coronavirus test results. The governor argued the legislation was meant to preserve individual freedom and medical privacy.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Officials in Georgia’s oldest city say they plan to start collecting soon on some long overdue utility bills. More than $25 million in unpaid water bills remain outstanding in Savannah, according to city officials. Mayor Van Johnson said many of the overdue payments date back to 2019. The pile of outstanding bills grew larger over the past year as the coronavirus pandemic left many people jobless and unable to pay, WJCL-TV reports. That’s too much money owed to City Hall for Savannah to keep serving residents efficiently, the mayor said. “We are always willing to work out payment arrangements with those who need it,” Johnson said, “but for our city to operate, we must start collecting what’s due.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: The Pacific Tsunami Museum plans to reopen from a coronavirus pandemic-triggered shutdown by the end of the summer after finishing substantial renovations. The downtown Hilo museum is working on relocating and renovating its Japan exhibit, which focuses on the 2011 tsunami, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. The new displays will also cover Japanese tsunami history. Its Big Island tsunamis exhibit will be updated with new interviews from survivors and more photos from the most recent tsunami that hit the island in 1975. “I always felt the local tsunamis exhibit is one of our most important exhibits because it is informative for people living here,” said Marlene Murray, the museum’s director. The museum is adding a new natural hazards exhibit. The area will step away from tsunamis and highlight hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes and volcanic activity, which all can affect Hawaii Island. The museum got financial help during the pandemic from federal Paycheck Protection Program loans and stimulus funds. It’s also applied for a shuttered venue grant. “Luckily, we’ve had some wonderful people out there that have been renewing their memberships and sending donations specifically to keep supporting us,” Murray said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Many members of the state’s ascendant far right believe they’ve never been closer to achieving their goals in what is already one of the most conservative states in the country. Some half-dozen recently formed right-wing groups, including anti-government activist Ammon Bundy’s People’s Rights, have used coronavirus restrictions as recruiting tools, organizing angry mask-burning protests in a push to disrupt institutional norms ahead of statewide elections next year. Other Republicans, including a former Idaho attorney general, have established groups to oppose them. The atmosphere is so charged that lawmakers approved extra spending to bring more Idaho State Police troopers to the Statehouse, even when the Legislature isn’t in session. A doorway pane shattered last year when Bundy and others pushed their way into the House gallery that had limited seating due to the pandemic. The schism also played out dramatically late last month when far-right Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin issued an executive order during a short stint as acting governor while fellow Republican Gov. Brad Little was out of the state. She ordered a ban on mask mandates without consulting localities or Little. Bundy, best known for leading an armed standoff at a federal wildlife refuge five years ago, has also filed paperwork in a long-shot run for governor. He is expected to officially announce his campaign this month.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Health officials, community groups and churches are coming together to vaccinate people against COVID-19, with some offering incentives like gift cards for groceries and fuel. Douglas Avenue United Methodist Church – working alongside Wooden It Be Lovely, a nonprofit that supports single mothers; Springfield Ward 8 Alderwoman Erin Conley; and the Illinois Department of Public Health – plans a vaccination clinic the afternoon of June 17. IDPH also is coordinating clinics at United Methodist churches across the state. The Rev. Meredith Manning Brown, senior pastor at Douglas United Methodist, said the clinic would be a way for people in the community to get the vaccine in an environment that they know and trust. “Vaccination is a way for people to be healthy and safe and for our community to return to normal,” Brown said. “We want as many people to be as healthy and safe as possible, and that’s part of what it means to love and follow Jesus.” The clinic will also provide gift cards for fuel and groceries up to $50, which Conley said is yet another way it could push some community members still reluctant to get the vaccine. “This is just an extra thank-you,” Conley said. “At this point, we know that the vaccine is working.” Overall, 43.77% of Illinois’ population and 51% of its adults are fully vaccinated.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The city ended its mask mandate for people fully vaccinated against COVID-19 on Tuesday, hours after the City-County Council approved a measure easing numerous pandemic restrictions. The Democratic-majority council passed the new public health order Monday evening on a 19-5 party line vote, with Republicans opposed because the measure didn’t fully lift all pandemic restrictions. Despite lifting its mask order, Indianapolis businesses may choose to require masks on their property, and masks are still required in hospitals and on public transportation in Indiana’s capital. The change means residents who received their final vaccine shot at least two weeks ago are not required to wear masks in public areas. Indianapolis is aiming for a 50% vaccination rate in order to fully reopen, Virginia Caine, director of the Marion County Public Health Department, told the council. Last week, the county’s vaccination rate stood at about 36%. Indianapolis’ new order eases numerous pandemic restrictions, including allowing religious services and funerals, as well as community pools, to open to 100% capacity. The maximum number of people at social gatherings increased from 50 to 500, and bars, restaurants and nightclubs can operate at 75% capacity indoors.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: 515 Alive, one of the metro’s largest annual events, is off for another year, the festival’s organizers announced Monday in a Facebook post. “Organizing events of this size and nature takes months of proper planning,” the post said, “and with the uncertainty surrounding covid regulations we felt that it was simply too turbulent to bring to fruition.” In an addendum to a lengthy post, the organizers said they had been planning a “scaled down” version of the festival this year. “However, artist & date availabilities didn’t align as we had hoped,” they wrote. “We look forward to seeing everyone next year!” The electronic music and hip-hop festival also was canceled in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The posting thanked fans for their “patience and understanding.” The festival began as a gathering of DJs and electronic dance music artists in the early 2000s. In 2013 it was staged on a single day in an East Village parking lot, attracting 3,000 people. The event then moved to Western Gateway Park, grew to two days and ultimately ended up at Water Works Park, where festivalgoers could camp overnight. With more than 100 acts that mix local, regional and international electronic and hip-hop talent – including top draws like Waka Flocka Flame and Wiz Khalifa – it has attracted up to 25,000 people.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Officials with the dispatch center at the Shawnee County Sheriff’s Office were hoping higher-than-usual unemployment would mean an increase in applications for open positions, but no such influx of job inquiries ensued. Melanie Bergers, director of communications at the sheriff’s office, said the dispatch center has been understaffed throughout 2020 and 2021 and typically has paid about 600 hours of overtime every two weeks for the past year. Twenty-three dispatchers are employed at the center, leaving it at 60% staffing capacity. Those numbers don’t count American Medical Response employees who work out of the same building. Bergers said applicants must be at least 18 years old, have a high school diploma, and pass a background check and drug test, among other requirements, to be qualified to work. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in Kansas was as high as 12.6% in April 2020. The statewide rate had fallen back under 4% by April 2021, according to the Kansas Department of Labor.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The longtime state executive who inherited oversight of Kentucky’s beleaguered unemployment insurance system during the COVID-19 pandemic is stepping down as labor secretary. Larry Roberts’ retirement, effective at the end of June, was announced Monday by Gov. Andy Beshear. Roberts’ career in state government stretches back to 1973. The Democratic governor said he selected another veteran state official, Jamie Link, to succeed Roberts in leading the state Labor Cabinet, beginning July 1. In announcing the appointment, Beshear said Link is “committed to standing with our labor unions, protecting our workers and helping Kentucky families climb out of this pandemic.” Link promised to continue efforts to “resolve and remedy Kentucky’s unemployment insurance challenges” and to focus on “the needs and well-being of all Kentucky workers.” Beshear decided about a year ago to shift the unemployment office into the Labor Cabinet. The unemployment office had been housed in the Education and Workforce Development Cabinet. Like other states, Kentucky was overwhelmed by record-setting waves of unemployment claims as the pandemic temporarily shuttered or scaled back many businesses. Tens of thousands of Kentuckians have found themselves in limbo for months waiting for benefits.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Republican lawmakers have taken aim at vaccines, sending Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards two bills that would keep state and local government agencies from mandating COVID-19 immunization in order to receive certain services. Separate votes Monday gave final passage to the the anti-vaccine proposals from Republican Reps. Danny McCormick and Kathy Edmonston. Edwards – who has championed COVID-19 vaccines and is regularly urging residents to get the shots – hasn’t taken a position on the legislation, and no agency in his administration has publicly proposed requiring the immunization for services. “He will review the bills when they reach his desk and see how they conform with recommendations from doctors and public health experts as well with current Louisiana law relating to vaccines, which does allow for certain exemptions,” Edwards spokesperson Christina Stephens said in a statement. But she also defended the vaccines as safe and effective and said they “have already saved lives and are our way out of this pandemic.” McCormick’s proposal would ban agencies from refusing to give a permit, business license or professional license to someone based solely on a business’ decision that it won’t require vaccines for employees or customers, as well as broadly exempting such employers from related civil lawsuits.\n\nMaine\n\nSaco: The state’s camping industry is busy and campsites are in demand a year after reservations came to a halt at the height of the pandemic. Owners of the Silver Springs campground in Saco told WMTW-TV their business has quadrupled since last year, when the mask mandate and 14-day quarantine restrictions were in place. They said things are different this year: People aren’t just coming for the weekend but for the whole season. “It’s changed overall camping as a nation because now instead of just camping as recreation, it’s camping in spots because you now have the luxury of being able to work from wherever you’re located,” said Bryce Ingraham of Silver Springs Campground. Businesses that rely on campers and outdoors recreation are optimistic about the coming season.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Students at nearly three dozen public schools without air conditioning were learning virtually for a second day Tuesday amid sweltering temperatures. News outlets report about 30 city schools listed on the district’s website sent students home about 10:30 a.m. Monday to transition to virtual learning, while staff also transitioned to teaching from home. Officials said several Baltimore City schools had air conditioning systems that were not working properly. In Baltimore County, six public schools also closed three hours early Monday due to a lack of air conditioning, and afternoon and evening activities also were canceled. County school buildings have air conditioning systems but experienced a variety of mechanical problems that prevented them from operating as they should. Two of the schools also closed because of power outages, spokesman Charles Herndon said in an email. Two schools remained virtual Tuesday. Sweltering classrooms are a perennial problem in Baltimore, which has some of the state’s oldest school buildings. Some educators used social media to document the high temperatures in the classrooms as students focus on final exams.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The New Bedford Whaling Museum is offering free admission passes to anyone who gets a COVID-19 vaccine at a clinic at the museum Wednesday. The first 25 people who get a shot will also get a gift bag from the museum’s gift shop. The clinic will be administering the Pfizer vaccine, which has received federal authorization for use in anyone 12 or older. Preregistration is encouraged, but walk-ins are also welcome to get a free shot, according to the museum. A follow-up clinic for the second dose will take place June 30. Vaccine check-in and in-person registration will be located at the rear entrance, and doses will be administered inside the building. More than 8.1 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Massachusetts as of Monday. That includes more than 4.2 million first doses and nearly 3.6 million second doses of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. There have been nearly 258,000 doses of the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine administered. More than 3.8 million residents have been fully immunized, according to state health officials. Gov. Charlie Baker has set a goal of at least 4.1 million people in the state fully vaccinated. He said Massachusetts has adopted a more targeted approach, particularly in communities hit hardest by the pandemic.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said Tuesday that her office is adding 350,000 appointments over nearly four months to address a pandemic-related backlog as Michigan residents try to renew driver’s licenses, transfer vehicle titles and conduct other business in person. Branch offices will be able to serve 25% more customers than planned, she said, citing efficiencies – namely shortening 20-minute appointment slots to 10-minute slots. She also eased a requirement that all visitors book an appointment in advance, saying those who need a disability placard can show up without one and be served. Greeters will be stationed at the doors of some of the department’s busiest offices. They will tell people if any immediate appointments are available or help schedule them to come back later. Benson, a Democrat, is confronting a logjam caused by the end of a 13-month grace period for driver’s license and ID renewals, which has been exacerbated by branch closures due to COVID-19 exposures. Republican lawmakers are pressuring her to restore motorists’ ability to walk in without an appointment, pointing to months­long waits. But she has said she wants to stay the course and noted more transactions can be done online than in the past.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Fifteen schools that aren’t fully air-conditioned are switching from in-person to online instruction to avoid a heat wave this week. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reports the schools planned to shift into online learning Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Highs in Minneapolis are expected to top out in the mid- to upper-90s those days. The schools plan to reopen Friday, the last day of class for the year, so students can bring items home, and teachers can close their classrooms.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A new clinic in the city aims to address health disparities among at-risk mothers using preventive, holistic and patient-first maternal care. Getty Israel, founder and executive director of Sisters in Birth, is fighting against a system in which pregnant women largely lack advocates during the birthing process. Mississippi ranks last in women and children’s health care in the United States. It ranks 50th in infant mortality. Black mothers die nearly three times more often than white mothers of pregnancy-related causes. The state’s high obesity, hypertension and tobacco-user rates are mostly to blame, Israel said. “You always hear about the worst health outcomes,” she said. “Well, what are we doing about it? This is what we’re doing about it. It’s not the solution; it’s a solution.” Israel said childbirth in Mississippi is all about convenience. The state has the highest cesarean delivery rate in the country. The World Health Organization makes it clear that C-sections should only be performed when medically necessary, with only about 10% to 15% of births by cesarean delivery. Mississippi’s rate is nearly 40%. C-sections, intended to be used in emergencies, can pose risks of heavy bleeding, infection, organ injury and maternal death, according to the American Pregnancy Association.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations continue to spike in southwestern Missouri, and residents there are being urged to get vaccinated before gathering for Fourth of July activities. Springfield-Greene County Acting Health Director Katie Towns said 142 new cases of the coronavirus were reported Tuesday, and the seven-day average has reached 62, the highest level since Feb. 10. Meanwhile, 76 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in Greene County. Towns, speaking at a news conference, said Memorial Day gatherings were a source of some of the recent spread, in part because new, faster-spreading variants are in the region. She said there was concern about the pending Independence Day get-togethers. “Gatherings are continuing to be a place where COVID is spread, just as it has throughout this pandemic,” Towns said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 42.1% of Americans are fully vaccinated. Missouri lags with 35.6% of all residents fully inoculated, and rates in the southwestern part of the state are far lower than that. State health department data shows just 31% of Greene County residents have completed their shots, and several southwestern Missouri counties have full vaccination rates below 30% – with a few even below 20%.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The Montana Democratic Party has become the first state party in the U.S. to establish a formal role for Native Americans, based on their proportion of the population. Representatives from the seven reservations in the state and the Little Shell Tribe will have two delegates each at the Montana Democratic Party platform, rules, officers and special nominating conventions, according to a news release. Rep. Donavon Hawk, D-Butte, who advocated for the rule change, said the move symbolizes progress in Indigenous representation locally and nationally. “This isn’t just about having a seat at the table, it’s about delivering results that improve health care, infrastructure and the economy for American Indian Montanans across the state,” he said in a statement. Some of the Democratic tribal committees have formed. Maria Vega was selected as chair of the Fort Peck tribal committee, and Lance Four Star was selected as vice-chair. Davin Sorrell, a member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, was selected last week to chair the Flathead tribal committee, and Patrick Yawakie-Peltier, community organizer and co-founder of Red Medicine, was selected as vice-chair. Yawakie-Peltier said he hopes increased Indigenous participation in politics will encourage others to be engaged.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A lawsuit that sought to block the state from imposing a two-tiered Medicaid expansion system with more benefits for people working, volunteering or meeting other requirements is on hold after officials said they would give all participants the same benefits. Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong granted a motion Friday to pause legal proceedings until Oct. 4, the first business day after everyone enrolled in Medicaid expansion will get the extra services available under the state’s premium plan, the Omaha World-Herald reports. The motion was filed after an agreement between the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, which administers the state Medicaid program, and Nebraska Appleseed, a Lincoln-based advocacy group that filed the lawsuit. State officials announced recently that they would abandon plans for a limited tier of coverage for most Medicaid expansion patients. According to the motion, the department must give monthly reports to Nebraska Appleseed and the court about its progress in meeting its Oct. 1 goal for launching the additional services. If the services are implemented on time, the lawsuit may be dismissed.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: In Sin City, one thing that will soon become unforgivable is useless grass. A new state law will outlaw about 31% of the grass in the Las Vegas area in an effort to conserve water amid a drought that’s drying up the region’s primary water source: the Colorado River. Other cities and states around the U.S. have enacted temporary bans on lawns that must be watered, but legislation signed Friday by Gov. Steve Sisolak makes Nevada the first in the nation to enact a permanent ban on certain categories of grass. Sisolak said last week that anyone flying into Las Vegas viewing the “bathtub rings” that delineate how high Lake Mead’s water levels used to be can see that conservation is needed. “It’s incumbent upon us for the next generation to be more conscious of conservation and our natural resources – water being particularly important,” he said. The ban targets what the Southern Nevada Water Authority calls “non-functional turf.” It applies to grass that virtually no one uses at office parks, in street medians and at entrances to housing developments. It excludes single-family homes, parks and golf courses. Nevada Assemblyman Howard Watts III, the bill’s sponsor, said he hopes other Western states consider similar action leading up to 2026, when they renegotiate the Colorado River’s Drought Contingency Plan.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: The city has repealed its mask ordinance. The City Council voted Monday to repeal the mandate, effective immediately. It had been set to expire June 30. The council voted against a motion to amend the repeal so that the mask mandate would stay in place indoors only through June 30. City businesses have reported they are starting to see fewer customers because the mask mandate remained in effect, while other communities revoked their mandates, Assistant Mayor Jim Splaine said. “We are losing business. That’s the message that we’re hearing,” Splaine said. “We’re beginning to look kind of foolish by continuing it.” Durham also rescinded its mask mandate Monday. Exeter and Newmarket ended theirs, and others did not have one. Separately, the city put out a notice that indoor seating in Portsmouth restaurants may return to normal capacity, still complying with all applicable codes. Meanwhile, the public school district in New Hampshire’s largest city is requiring masks for students and staff only for moving around in a building. Masks are now optional inside Manchester classrooms, WMUR-TV reports. School district officials said they made the change because of a decrease in community transmission of COVID-19 and in the district.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Schools will have the discretion to let students go without masks during the extreme heat that has descended on the state this week, Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday. Summer camps will also have similar discretion on masks outdoors, regardless of the weather, he said. The announcement comes as temperatures in many parts of the state have hovered at or risen above 90 degrees since Saturday and are expected to continue that way at least through Wednesday. Some parents have been clamoring for Murphy to ease mask-wearing inside and outside school buildings, culminating in a protest outside the Statehouse last week. The exception for going without a mask outdoors on school grounds in extreme heat has been in effect since schools reopened last September. But on Monday, Murphy suggested school districts can also waive the mask requirement indoors if it can potentially affect students’ health. “School officials are empowered to relax masking among students and staff in their buildings given extreme weather conditions,” Murphy said at a briefing. Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said it will be up to school districts to determine what constitutes excessive heat. “We need to trust that they’ll do the right thing,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state Supreme Court ruled Monday that there is no constitutional or statutory requirement to compensate businesses for financial losses due to emergency public health orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ruling in favor of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham scuttles about 20 lawsuits against her administration. The original plaintiffs argued that aggressive health restrictions from the administration constituted a regulatory taking much like the taking of land for public works projects. The governor urged the high court to block the lawsuits. In a unanimous opinion from Justice Shannon Bacon, the court said current public health orders “are a reasonable exercise of the police power to protect the public health.” “Occupancy limits and closure of certain categories of businesses, while certainly harsh in their economic effects, are directly tied to the reasonable purpose of limiting the public’s exposure to the potentially life-threatening and communicable disease,” the decision said. The high court noted that the Public Health Emergency Response Act does provide for compensation for the emergency appropriation from businesses of health care supplies, a health facility or any other property.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Hundreds of nursing homes across the state that are struggling to vaccinate workers remain at heightened risk of COVID-19 outbreaks, despite recent declines in coronavirus infections. About 250 nursing homes are lagging the state’s COVID-19 vaccination rate for long-term care workers, according to a USA TODAY Network analysis of state data. Overall, 62% of nursing home staff statewide have been at least partially vaccinated. While 85% of New York’s nursing home residents have been partially or fully vaccinated, the likelihood of future outbreaks is higher in facilities where fewer workers choose to get shots. It also increases the odds of breakthrough infections among vaccinated people, which are exceedingly rare. The problem is acute in some nursing homes across the Finger Lakes, Mid-Hudson, Southern Tier and Mohawk Valley regions, where about 50 facilities had partially vaccinated less than half of their respective workers as of last week. The data shed light on a stagnated vaccination push inside nursing homes, which were granted early access to shots in December but today still trail New York hospitals and assisted living facilities, which have partially vaccinated 72% and 69% of workers, respectively.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRocky Mount: Get ready for long lines at DMV offices this summer, state officials warn, as pandemic delays and economic forces are bringing record demand for licenses. Division of Motor Vehicles Commissioner Torre Jessup urged motorists to conduct business online if they can. Summer is usually the busiest time at DMV regardless, but many people have waited to get vaccinated before completing transactions, the division said in a news release. The COVID-19 pandemic also delayed thousands of teenagers in completing in-person driving tests to obtain their provisional licenses. And the agency’s job vacancy rate remains high because of the state’s strong job market, according to DMV. The department is encouraging people who must complete in-person business to schedule appointments or to wait to come in until after Labor Day. Meanwhile, the agency is opening new offices, expanding hours and hiring new license examiners.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State tax revenue exceeded projections in April, according to new data released by state budget officials. The Bismarck Tribune reports the data shows April’s general fund revenues outpaced 2019 legislative projections by 1.2%, or more than $2.7 million. Revenues have exceeded projections by 2.2%, or $96.6 million, since mid-2019. May’s revenue numbers aren’t available yet, but State Office of Management and Budget Director Joe Morrisette said Monday they looked to be what he called “fairly positive.” Some tax sources are still underperforming 2019 projections, however, reflecting the disruptive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall sales taxes, the largest source of general fund revenue, for example, were still 2.5% lower than the 2019 forecast, though. Overall oil taxes were 26% under forecasts.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state crossed two COVID-19 milestones Tuesday, counting more than 20,000 total deaths from the disease and reporting the fewest number of people currently hospitalized statewide. Since the pandemic began, 20,021 people have died due to COVID-19, according to the Ohio Department of Health. December remains the deadliest month for the coronavirus in Ohio, with 5,520 deaths, according to state data. But deaths fell sharply in January and February, after older Ohioans and people living in nursing homes were able to get COVID-19 vaccines. In April, 518 Ohioans died due to COVID-19, and 269 died in May. Those numbers could increase as deaths are reported. Deaths are often reported in the state’s coronavirus stats weeks or even months after someone dies. That’s because medical professionals have up to six months to complete a death certificate, under Ohio law, and they are reviewed by the National Center on Health Statistics before appearing in Ohio’s tally. Meanwhile, only 503 coronavirus-positive patients were being treated in hospitals across the state Tuesday, the lowest number seen since the Ohio Hospital Association began collecting data in March 2020. That’s down from a high of 5,308 on Dec. 15, 2020 and 1,058 just one month ago.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s economy is recovering from the coronavirus pandemic downturn, with revenue collections in May 34% higher than May 2020, Treasurer Randy McDaniel said Tuesday. The state collected $1.24 billion in May 2021, $314.7 million more than the same month a year prior, according to McDaniel. “At this time last year, unemployment was high, numerous businesses had significantly reduced operations, and many people were quarantined in their homes,” McDaniel said. “Today, pent-up demand has been unleashed, and the economy is performing quite well.” He said the strongest indicator of increased economic activity is sales and use tax collections of $534.2 million – a 26% increase, or $110.1 million more than a year ago. Gross production taxes on oil and gas generated $87.3 million, nearly 128% more than May 2020, after oil prices plummeted to below $20 per barrel. The unemployment rate in Oklahoma was 4.3% in April, the most recent month available, down from 13% in April 2020.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Lane County, home to Eugene, has vaccinated enough people to move into the state’s lowest level of COVID-19 restrictions. And other counties will have restrictions changed based on measurements of community spread, Gov. Kate Brown announced Tuesday. Coos and Wasco counties will move down from moderate risk to lower risk. Josephine and Yamhill counties will move down from high risk to moderate risk. Harney County will move up from lower risk to moderate risk. Brown’s county risk level system governs capacity limits in restaurants, bars, gyms, retail stores and more, as well as the size of social gatherings. Since November, counties have changed risk designations based on metrics such as cases per 100,000 residents and coronavirus test positivity. On May 11, Brown announced that counties where 65% of adults have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and where officials have submitted a plan for vaccine equity can move into the lowest level of restrictions. Lane is the seventh Oregon county to do so. The new designations take effect Friday. In all, there will be 11 counties, including Marion, in the high-risk category; four counties, including Polk, in the moderate-risk category; and 21 counties in the lower-risk level.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s long-awaited overhaul of its unemployment claims filing system went live Tuesday, with some users immediately complaining about glitches and the state agency that runs the program reporting a phone outage that temporarily prevented it from making or receiving calls. More than a year after the coronavirus pandemic swamped the state’s old claims system, officials promised the replacement would be easy to use; simplify and speed up the process of filing a claim; and incorporate features to reduce the opportunity for fraud. But people trying to migrate to the new website quickly ran into trouble – and weren’t shy about expressing their displeasure online. The agency acknowledged some users got “invalid password” messages, while others had trouble connecting to the server. It said fixes were in progress. Many claimants expressed alarm when the system told them they’d receive benefits by debit card and not direct deposit. But the Department of Labor & Industry said it was “just a display issue and not a problem with payment type.” Pennsylvania had been relying on a 40-year-old computer system to process unemployment benefits. The replacement system that went live Tuesday had been under development since 2006 and was plagued by delays and cost overruns.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: With the coronavirus apparently on the run in Rhode Island, the state is sending help to other areas of the world still in the heat of the battle against COVID-19, officials said Monday. Care New England’s COVID-19 Crisis Relief Effort and the Rhode Island Department of Health recently sent 200,000 coronavirus tests to India, along with protective equipment, ventilators, medications and other medical supplies to be distributed to hospitals around Delhi. “India’s hospitals and laboratories have been stretched to their limit as case counts in the nation reach an all-time high,” Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott, director of the state Department of Health, said in a statement. The BinaxNOW rapid antigen tests can help health care professionals quickly identify coronavirus cases and put people into isolation, she said. The tests do not need to be sent to a lab and provide results in 15 minutes. The tests were part of Rhode Island’s allotment from the federal government, and the state has enough remaining to sustain current testing volume.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Continuing efforts to boost the state’s economy following pandemic-related hardships, Gov. Henry McMaster on Tuesday announced a cash infusion for technical colleges, aimed at training the jobless in new skills as they reenter the workforce. During a news conference in Anderson, the Republican said he’s allocating $8 million in federal coronavirus relief aid to a partnership between the state’s 16 tech schools and the Department of Employment and Workforce. Starting this week, the agency will contact the 87,000 South Carolinians already eligible for jobless benefits to advise them of tuition-free, short-term training classes designed to quickly prepare them for jobs like welding and truck driving, according to Tim Hardee, president of the state’s technical college system. The funds come from a total of more than $48 million provided under federal legislation passed in spring 2020, to be used at the governor’s discretion. In other allocations, McMaster has directed funds to the Department of Social Services, the Department of Education and the Department of Commerce. “All they have to do is apply,” McMaster said of the training for in-demand technical jobs. “If this works as well as we are confident it will, we are hopeful this will be a permanent part of our career process in South Carolina.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The union at a Smithfield Foods pork processing plant engaged in contract negotiations Tuesday armed with the authorization to call a strike. A strike authorization at the Sioux Falls chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union was overwhelmingly approved late Monday with 98% of the vote total, the union said. However, leaders said they hoped to avoid a work stoppage as they met with company representatives Tuesday. Meatpacking workers have become emboldened after a coronavirus outbreak at the plant last year killed four workers and infected nearly 1,300. The union is demanding that Smithfield boost its wage offerings in a four-year contract to match those at a JBS pork plant in the region, as well as to make several other concessions on break times and employee health insurance costs. “We’re not going to change our stand,” said B.J. Motley, the president of the local union. Smithfield Foods, based in Virginia, has said its initial offer, which was rejected by the union last week, is in “full alignment” with agreements that UFCW has already accepted at other plants. A strike at the plant, which produces roughly 5% of the nation’s pork supply every day, could create ripple effects from hog farmers to supermarket shelves.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s annual free fishing day is Saturday. Each year, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency offers one day when anglers can fish without a paid license in the state’s public waters, agency-owned and -operated lakes, and state park facilities. The TWRA said it annually stocks several thousand pounds of fish for various events. However, some privately owned lakes and ponds continue to charge during free fishing day, the agency said. Interested anglers will need to consult with those operators if there are any questions about a facility. Many events are returning this year following cancellations in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A list of events being held on free fishing day can be found on the TWRA’s website.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The State Fair of Texas is coming back this fall, two years after the last time folks were able to gather at Fair Park to devour funnel cakes, admire flashy cars and gaze up at the iconic 55-foot tall Big Tex. The annual fair, which dates back to 1886, will take place from Sept. 24 through Oct. 17. This year’s theme is “Howdy, Folks!” State Fair of Texas president Mitchell Glieber said in a statement that the theme “encompasses the foundation of what the fair is all about – being together.” “We’re excited to make up for lost time and help families and friends from all walks of life reconnect again, while making new memories to last a lifetime,” Glieber said. Last year, the in-person fair was canceled due to the pandemic. Instead of eating fried food at Fair Park, would-be attendees had the option to stream corn dog and funnel cake cooking tutorials from their living rooms. Big Tex still loomed over Fair Park, but for the first time in his 68-year history, he wore a mask. This fall, according to the Dallas Morning News, his mask is coming off. Fairgoers can look forward to bull riding, vegetable carving and Dia de los Muertos activities. Food offerings will include Cajun crab bombs, deep fried waffles, and jalapeno and champagne jello shots, and attendees will hear loads of live music.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: More than 20,000 people marched through downtown Salt Lake City over the weekend to close out Pride week in the state. Utah Pride Center Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Foulk said it was “beautiful” to see everyone gathered at the “Rainbow March & Rally” again after events were canceled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, KSTU-TV reports. “We really wanted to get back to how Pride started,” Foulk said. “Pride started as a protest and a rally and a march, and that’s what we brought back for this year specifically because we couldn’t have food vendors and floats and have a super large gathering.” Planning has already started for next year, with hopes that more people can attend, Foulk said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Republican Gov. Phil Scott signed into law Monday a bill that will make it easier for residents to vote in general elections. The new law will send general election ballots to all active voters ahead of the election, making permanent a policy used last year during the pandemic. Under the system that was used last November, when COVID-19 was surging, voters will be able to cast ballots by mail, take them to polling places to vote early or cast their ballots in person on Election Day. The law also provides a mechanism for correcting defective ballots and makes other changes to the state’s voting laws. Scott said he didn’t think the law went far enough, and he urged lawmakers when they return in January to extend the provisions of the law to primary elections, local elections and school budget votes. “I’m signing this bill because I believe making sure voting is easy and accessible, and increasing voter participation, is important,” Scott said in a statement. At a time when legislatures around much of the nation are more likely to pass laws that limit opportunities to cast ballots, “here in the Green Mountain State we chose a different path,” Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos said in a statement.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: The mansion where Robert E. Lee once lived that now overlooks Arlington National Cemetery is open to the public again, after a $12 million rehabilitation and reinterpretation that includes an increased emphasis on those who were enslaved there. The National Park Service opened Arlington House to the public Tuesday for the first time since 2018. The mansion and surrounding grounds had been expected to reopen in 2019, but delays and the coronavirus pandemic extended the closure. The rehabilitation was funded by philanthropist David Rubenstein, who has also donated millions for the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial and other historical sites around the D.C. region. The mansion, which commands an unrivaled view of the nation’s capital and the Potomac River, is best known as the home of the Confederate general leading up to the Civil War. But its history goes well beyond Lee. George Washington Parke Custis, the adopted son of George Washington, built the mansion as a memorial of sorts to the country’s first president. Robert E. Lee came to Arlington House after he married Custis’ daughter, Mary Anna Randolph Custis. New exhibits and materials at Arlington House include the stories of the enslaved Syphax and Norris families.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: The elite submarine USS Connecticut, now finally free from an infestation of bedbugs, has set sail for deployment to the Pacific Ocean. The Navy announced the submarine, one of three of the Seawolf-class boats, left Sinclair Inlet on May 27. The boat had been battling an infestation of bedbugs on board, but Navy officials said the submarine is free of the insects following eradication efforts. Some of the crew of more than 100 had complained of bed bugs in late 2020. Navy entomologists found them in the perforated bulkheads between bunks Feb. 19, the Navy said. Berthing areas were thoroughly cleaned and treated for the insects, and linens, privacy curtains and clothes on board were washed and dried. Some crew members slept in vehicles until a temporary structure was opened in the boat’s mooring area. The Connecticut is home-ported at Naval Base Kitsap-Bremerton with sister boat USS Seawolf, itself having returned from a globetrotting deployment in February. Only three of the Seawolf-class subs, which each cost more than $3 billion to build, were actually completed. Many more had been planned in the days of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, as a way to gain an upper hand.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Lawmakers poured federal funds and extra state cash into road repairs, health care, and education programs such as school lunches Monday as they began the GOP-led Legislature’s first special session of the year, called by the governor to handle spending about $902 million received through the latest round of federal pandemic aid. One Republican senator took the opportunity after the break to snipe at Gov. Jim Justice’s new sweepstakes for getting more residents vaccinated against COVID-19 and his reluctance to lift a statewide mask mandate sooner. Fully vaccinated people are exempt from the indoor mask requirement. Sen. Randy Smith, R-Tucker, said he is “fed up” with the governor’s decisions and “wasteful spending.” Justice announced a vaccine lottery that will include prizes ranging from hunting rifles to $1 million. “I don’t believe we should be using money to bribe people to get something that should be their own personal choice,” Smith said. The governor and his health experts have pushed residents to get the shots in weekly news conferences, where Justice has trotted out his bulldog named Babydog to entice viewers. West Virginia’s vaccine lottery is now called “Do It for Babydog.” The efforts haven’t yet boosted a sluggish vaccination drive.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A former pharmacist who purposefully ruined more than 500 doses of COVID-19 vaccine was sentenced to three years in prison Tuesday. Steven Brandenburg, 46, of Grafton, pleaded guilty in February to two felony counts of attempting to tamper with a consumer product. He had admitted to intentionally removing the doses manufactured by Moderna from a refrigerator for hours at Aurora Medical Center in Grafton, located just north of Milwaukee. In a statement before receiving his sentence, Brandenburg said he felt “great shame” and accepted responsibility for his actions. He apologized to his co-workers, family and the community. Aurora destroyed most of the tampered doses, but not before 57 people received inoculations from the supply. Those doses are believed to have still been effective, but weeks of uncertainty created a storm of anger, anxiety and anguish among the recipients, according to court documents. Prosecutors asked for a sentence of three years and five months. Brandenburg faced a maximum penalty of 10 years of imprisonment at $250,000 in fines for each felony count. Brandenburg is an admitted conspiracy theorist who believes he is a prophet, and vaccines are a product of the devil. He also professed a belief that the Earth is flat and that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were faked.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: The Cody School District’s practice of broadcasting its special school board meetings to the public has come to an end after over a year. The pandemic-era practice related to limited capacity in the board room, but those restrictions have since been dropped, the Cody Enterprise reports. The district will continue to broadcast its regular meetings via the paid service Boxcast, which officials say is more accessible than free options like Facebook Live and YouTube, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/09"}]}

Prev Next\n\nCorgis have become synonymous with the monarch, who throughout her long life was regularly photographed with a Welsh corgi at her feet.\n\nThe Queen was often credited with creating the dorgi breed when her corgi mated with a dachshund owned by her sister, Princess Margaret.\n\nThe Queen’s passion for corgis dated back to her childhood, when she fell in love with her father King George VI’s dog, Dookie. In 1944, on her 18th birthday, she was given a Pembroke Welsh corgi puppy named Susan. Such was her attachment to Susan, she reportedly took her on her honeymoon in 1947. Susan died in January 1959.\n\nThe monarch went on to own dozens of corgis in her lifetime. One, Willow, famously appeared alongside her in the James Bond sketch that she recorded for the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nWhen Willow was put to sleep at the age of 14, the Queen lost the last descendant of her original corgi, Susan. According to Reader’s Digest, the Queen had a fondness for corgis because of their “energy and untamed spirit.”\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of York, Andrew and Sarah, will take care of the dogs. Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images\n\nPrince Andrew stepped back from public duties in 2019 following a firestorm of criticism over an interview about his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEarlier this year, he paid a settlement to sexual abuse accuser Virginia Giuffre, according to her attorney, and a US district judge agreed to dismiss her lawsuit against the Duke of York.\n\nThe prince has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Still, the allegations against Andrew, 62, have dramatically tarnished his public standing.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Max Foster Niamh Kennedy Toyin Owoseje", "Max Foster", "Niamh Kennedy", "Toyin Owoseje"], "publish_date": "2022/09/11"}]}

Can Los Angeles be trusted? Probably not. For all their star power, they've now survived two straight playoff wins by the skin of their teeth, and you might say that about the Bengals, too, except the Rams were literally built to win it all. They are the win-now team, assembled with one big-name veteran after another. Cincy feels like the right call, with all their fun-loving, expectation-shattering youth. But Aaron Donald and the Rams' defensive front is a different animal, and we saw in Tennessee what can happen when Joe Burrow's blocking is up against real pressure. If Sean McVay can actually put a game plan together, L.A. should be able to do quite a bit more than it did against the 49ers, and that spells a big-play win at home.\"\n\nMore:Los Angeles Rams vs. Cincinnati Bengals pick, prediction: Who wins Super Bowl 56?\n\nSporting News: Rams 27, Bengals 24\n\nBill Bender writes: \"The recipe for success on both sides is a familiar one, but the result will still come down to the No. 1 picks. It took Stafford 13 years to get to this stage. Burrow is there in his second season. Which quarterback will be more composed on that stage? It is a true toss-up. Burrow has shown the same cool that made him a national champion at LSU. He will make big plays despite the Rams' furious pass rush. Cincinnati will lead at halftime, but Los Angeles will rally behind Stafford, with Kupp and Beckham catching second-half touchdowns. A late TD by the Bengals will cut the lead to three, but Los Angeles will hold on for its first Super Bowl victory in 22 seasons.\"\n\nSporting News: Bengals 30, Rams 27\n\nVinnie Iyer writes: \"Although it would a nice story for Stafford to win a Super Bowl right after his 34th birthday in his first season with the Rams after all those fruitless years with the Lions, the NFL is a league tilting toward the AFC's young guns with the sun setting for the GOAT now in the NFC, Tom Brady. Mahomes has a ring. Josh Allen and Justin Herbert might get into the mix very soon. Burrow, only two years removed from his Heisman and national title turn at LSU, has the old-school cool swagger tied to Super Bowl Joes of the past (Namath, Montana). At 25, he looks like he's been in the league for a long time. The Rams have a solid defense, but they have enough holes to exploit for Burrow to outduel Stafford, setting up McPherson for the game-winner late (again).\"\n\nMore:Super Bowl odds: Los Angeles Rams vs. Cincinnati Bengals point spread, money lines, total\n\nFox Sports: Rams will beat Bengals to win Super Bowl\n\nGeoff Schwartz writes: \"The Bengals have been able to force turnovers this postseason, and we know Stafford has issues with giving the ball away. This is the formula for the Bengals once again: They need to force turnovers, stay patient on defense and make Stafford beat them. I’m taking the Rams to win the Super Bowl on their home field. Maybe it’s a mistake after picking against the Bengals for weeks now, but my mind will not allow me to pick a team with an offensive line I do not trust in a Super Bowl. The Rams will win this game in the trenches, and Stafford will do just enough to help L.A. claim the Lombardi Trophy.\"\n\nBleacher Report: Rams 20, Bengals 17\n\nMichelle Burton writes: \"Cincinnati's offensive line, meanwhile, was one of the league's worst when it comes to protecting the quarterback. The Bengals gave up 55 sacks in the 2021 season, third-most in the NFL, and Burrow was sacked 51 times. This game has the potential to be a shootout, and Burrow has proved capable of compensating for the deficiencies of his line. But the Rams front seven may prove just too stout for Cincinnati to overcome.\"\n\nMore:Super Bowl TV information: How to watch Los Angeles Rams vs. Cincinnati Bengals game\n\nFansided: Take the Bengals money line vs. Rams\n\nPeter Dewey writes: \"Cincinnati has gone 6-1 ATS the spread as a road underdog this season, and it has upset the Tennessee Titans and Kansas City Chiefs on this playoff run. Joe Burrow and the Bengals have plenty of weapons to compete with Matthew Stafford, Cooper Kupp and Odell Beckham Jr., and they came into the AFC title game with the fifth fewest rushing yards allowed this season.

Kay Ivey and Republican legislative leaders said would save state taxpayers’ money, but that critics argue is not for what the funds are supposed to be used. Lawmakers on Monday begin a special session focused on a $1.3 billion prison construction plan to build at least three new prisons and renovate others. The projects would be done in phases and funded with a $785 million bond issue, $150 million in general fund dollars and $400 million from the state’s $2.2 billion share of American Rescue Plan funds. Ivey and Republican legislative leaders have defended the use of the virus funds, saying it will enable the state to essentially “pay cash” for part of the construction and avoid using state dollars as well as paying interest on a loan.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state reported more than 1,700 resident COVID-19 cases Friday, which state health officials said included reports from earlier this month as they work to clear a backlog that has built up during the latest case surge. Health officials encouraged looking at cases by their symptom onset date versus the date they were submitted to the state health department. Dr. Anne Zink, the state’s chief medical officer, also recommended looking at weekly trends. Zink said the high daily report includes a mix of current and older cases, “but it does not diminish the fact we continue to see tremendous COVID spread in our communities.” Dr. Joe McLaughlin, the state epidemiologist, told reporters there is no indication yet that Alaska has hit a peak.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: More than a dozen B-1 bombers decommissioned by the Air Force have been flown to a boneyard in Tucson. The last of the 13 bombers destined for storage or disposal at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson arrived Thursday after being flown from a base in California, an Air Force statement said. The Air Force decommissioned a total of 17 B-1s, with the other four going to various locations for testing and other purposes. With the retirements of 17 of the B-1 bombers, 45 others remain in the Air Force’s active inventory. In addition, four of the B-1s sent to Davis-Monthan will be stored in a manner that would allow them to be put back into use if needed. The Air Force said retiring some of its B-1s will allow it to give more attention to remaining B-1s to increase their readiness while the service transitions to a bomber fleet consisting of only two types of aircraft – rebuilt B-52s and a new model, the B-21.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of COVID-19 patients in Arkansas’ hospitals hit its lowest point in two months on Friday as the state reported more than 1,300 new coronavirus cases. The state Department of Health reported COVID-19 hospitalizations dropped by 62 to 894. It’s the lowest number of COVID-19 patients the state has reported since 875 were hospitalized on July 24. The state reported 1,365 new coronavirus cases, bringing its total since the pandemic began to 491,221. Arkansas ranks 23rd in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: California will strike the word “alien” from its state laws, getting rid of what Gov. Gavin Newsom called “an offensive term for a human being” that has “fueled a divisive and hurtful narrative.” Newsom on Friday signed a law that removes the word from various sections of the California state code. California passed laws in 2015 and 2016 that removed the word from the state’s labor and education code. But the law Newsom signed on Friday finishes the job by removing the word from all state laws. The word will be replaced with terms such as “noncitizen” or “immigrant.” “By changing this term, we are ensuring California’s laws reflect our state’s values,” Newsom said. The federal government has used the term “alien” to describe people in the U.S. who are not citizens since at least 1798 with the passage of the “Aliens and Sedition Acts.” But Assemblywoman Luz Rivas, a Democrat from Arleta, said the word “has become weaponized and has been used in place of explicitly racial slurs to dehumanize immigrants.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Whistleblower allegations that the state health department’s air pollution division interfered with staff efforts to properly enforce federal air quality standards are unsubstantiated, according to an independent report released Friday by the Colorado attorney general’s office. The Colorado Department of Law, which is led by Attorney General Phil Weiser, hired the independent investigator after a complaint was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of inspector general in March. Three whistleblowers alleged that dozens of air pollution permits were issued unlawfully by the health department’s Air Pollution Control Division to companies, and that at least one whistleblower was asked to falsify data to get pollution estimates under permitted limits. They also alleged that health department division leaders ignored EPA regulations on modeling and permitting short-term pollutants from important Colorado industries – including mines, asphalt plants and oil and gas gathering sites. They said the permits were part of a larger problem of state officials allegedly catering to industry. The Denver Post reported the findings released Friday didn’t substantiate the claims of fraud and suppression.\n\nConnecticut\n\nDurham: A retired Connecticut physician and surgeon’s license was suspended Friday by a state medical board for allegedly providing people she had not treated with blank vaccine, mask-wearing and other exemption forms, so long as they sent her a self-addressed stamped envelope in the mail requesting the paperwork. The state Department of Public Health said it received an anonymous tip in July about Dr. Sue Mcintosh of Durham sending people fraudulent exemption forms. After an investigation, DPH called on the Connecticut Medical Examining Board to hold Friday’s emergency hearing and summarily suspend the doctor, saying she poses a “clear and immediate danger to public health and safety.” The panel voted unanimously in favor of the suspension. A full hearing on the merits of the case is scheduled for Oct. 5.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A judge has refused to order a hospital to administer the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin to a man who is seriously ill with COVID-19. Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn said in a ruling issued Friday that patients, even if they are gravely ill, do not have a right to a particular medical treatment. She also said a health care provider’s duty to treat is bound by that provider’s standard of care. “While ivermectin has been approved as safe and effective to treat human parasitic infections, and so is distinct from a wholly unapproved new drug, DeMarco still has no right to compel its use to treat COVID-19 outside the standard of care,” Zurn wrote. The ruling came a day after a hearing in a lawsuit filed last week by Mary Ellen DeMarco on behalf of her husband, David, against Christiana Care Health Services. Despite refusing to issue an injunction sought by Mary Ellen DeMarco, Zurn indicated she was prepared to quickly consider an application for an interlocutory appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Two women, a pastor and a college student, who live in the D.C. area, will headline CBS's “Survivor 41” that premieres at 8 p.m. Wednesday, WUSA-TV reported. Shantel Smith, 34, who is from Toronto, is a pastor at Emmanuel Brinklow Church,.and Liana Wallace, 20, who is from Evanston, Illinois, is a junior at Georgetown University. The Emmy Award-winning series returns this fall on CBS as 18 new castaways will compete for $1 million and the title of Sole Survivor.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A ferret has tested positive for the coronavirus in Florida, the first ferret to test positive for the virus in the United States, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture news release. A ferret in the European nation of Slovenia previously tested positive for the virus. USDA officials said samples from the Florida ferret were tested after the animal showed symptoms that included sneezing and coughing. Officials believed the ferret acquired the virus from an infected human. The small mustelids are commonly kept as pets. Officials didn’t say where in Florida the infected ferret was found. COVID-19 has been reported in several animal species around the world, usually animals that come in close contact with infected humans, officials said. The USDA said the the risk of animals spreading the virus to people is low and doesn’t recommend routine testing for animals.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The largest city in coastal Georgia is in talks about a new way to recycle glass that it’s burying in a landfill, even though it still accepts glass in recycling bins. WTOC-TV reported Savannah officials are in talks with Glass WRX SC, a South Carolina company that seeks to recycle glass into air and water filtration systems, road surfaces and prefabricated interior walls. The city stopped recycling glass more than five years ago after running out of users willing to accept the bulky material. It’s a common problem nationwide. Savannah still finds new users for paper, plastic and metals that it collects from all-in-one recycling bins. In 2020, about 25% of what the city collected from recycling bins, including about 1,000 tons of glass, were buried in the city landfill. Some of that was because materials were too contaminated for further use. City officials recently toured Glass WRX SC’s facility in Beaufort, South Carolina. One use is turning glass into rock-like water filters.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaiian Airlines said a passenger assaulted one of its flight attendants in an unprovoked attack during a flight. The airline said the incident occurred shortly after flight HA152 left Honolulu for Hilo at 7:30 a.m. Thursday. The flight attendant was walking down the aisle at the time. The pilot returned the plane to Honolulu. Deputy sheriffs assigned to the airport arrested a 32-year-old male passenger for third-degree assault based on information they received from the airline, said Toni Schwartz, a spokesperson for the state Department of Public Safety. The FBI was investigating the matter, said agency spokesperson Joy Van Der Voort. Hawaiian Airlines spokesperson Alex Da Silva said the flight attendant was evaluated for injuries and released from work to rest. The flight took off again for Hilo at 9:09 a.m.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S. Department of Defense is taking input on its plan to build an advanced mobile nuclear microreactor prototype at the Idaho National Laboratory in eastern Idaho. The department began a 45-day comment period on Friday with the release of a draft environmental impact study evaluating alternatives for building and operating the microreactor that could produce 1 to 5 megawatts of power. The department’s energy needs are expected to increase, it said. The draft environmental impact statement cited President Joe Biden’s Jan. 27 executive order prioritizing climate change considerations in national security as another reason for pursuing microreactors. The draft document said alternative energy sources such as wind and solar were problematic because they are limited by location, weather and available land area, and would require redundant power supplies.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford:The northern Illinois city that figured prominently in the movie “A League of Their Own” might be getting a museum of its own. The Rockford Zoning Board of Appeals voted unanimously last week to grant a special-use permit to build a $10 million International Women’s Baseball Museum at Beyer Park on the city’s southeast side, the Rockford Register Star reported. The city and the league gained international fame in 1992 when the movie starring Tom Hanks, Geena Davis and Madonna was released. At the park, Beyer Stadium was the actual home of the real Rockford Peaches of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in the 1940s and 1950s. To put the museum on the site, the Rockford Park District, which owns Beyer Park, plans to sell an acre of land at the north end of the park to the International Women’s Baseball Center. The vote came after a group called Friends of Beyer Stadium urged the zoning board to find a different site for the museum – an effort the group said will continue as the issue moves to a Rockford City Council committee on Monday and the full council on Oct. 4.\n\nIndiana\n\nMuncie:A beverage can company has started work on a factory in eastern Indiana where it expects to produce about 3.6 billion cans a year. A groundbreaking ceremony was held last week for the new aluminum can factory in Muncie that will be operated by Canpack, a subsidiary of the Polish company Giorgi Global. The factory is expected to ultimately employ about 340 people, according to the company. The new factory will help meet the demand for more beverage cans in the U.S., company executive Tom Johnson told The Star Press. Johnson said the company plans to start recruiting employees early next year and have the factory in operation by late 2022. Delaware County approved 15 years of property tax breaks for the new factory, while the state agreed to provide up to $6 million in tax credits and worker training grants.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: At least 16 people in eastern Iowa were charged with gun crimes after a two-day sweep by federal authorities this week. Grand juries met Wednesday through Friday in the U.S. District Court for Northern Iowa and issued the indictments, the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported. Many of those indicted have already been charged in state courts for weapons offenses. Most of the indictments were for felons in possession of a firearm or for having a firearm and using drugs.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly said the state will adopt the recommendation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concerning Pfizer booster shots as part of the effort to fight COVID-19. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky ruled Thursday that people 65 and older, nursing home residents and those ages 50 and older who have chronic health problems such as diabetes should be offered a booster once they’re six months past their last Pfizer dose. Kelly, a Democrat, said in a news release that she has authorized all COVID-19 vaccine providers to begin administering Pfizer booster shots to eligible Kansans as of Friday. Kelly said the CDC’s announcement “will provide additional protection to the most vulnerable Kansans and our frontline healthcare workers.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear called on the state’s residents Friday to honor a 15-year-old Fayette County student who died from COVID-19 by lighting porches with green lights. In a statement posted to social media, he also urged Kentuckians to “encourage vaccinations among friends and family and to mask up indoors.” Sophomore Christopher “C.J.” Gordon Jr. died from virus, Fayette County Superintendent Demetrus Liggins confirmed Thursday in a news release. Gordon’s mother, Renita Wright Gordon, told the Lexington Herald-Leader that Gordon always put other people first and you rarely saw him “not smiling.” Earlier this month, a 15-year-old Shelby County student who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 before the school year began also died from the virus.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAlexandria: Next month, people can order firewood from the Rapides Parish Sheriff’s Office and in the process help out the community and inmates. Sheriff Mark Wood has started a firewood project that can help recycle the many trees felled by recent hurricanes and winter storms. Priority for the wood will go to elderly and disabled residents of the parish, but anyone can buy up to two ricks beginning Oct. 1. Each rick costs $60, and sales are handled with money orders only. Wood told The Town Talk the object isn’t to make a lot of money through the venture. Some of the proceeds will go toward the upkeep of chainsaws and log splitters, and some will go into the sheriff’s office Inmate Welfare Fund. Money from the fund is “used to purchase basketballs and other sports equipment and work clothes or work boots for those inmates who have an economic need,” according to a news release. Some inmates don’t have family to help them with things like shoes, he said. He said the fund can help provide that so inmates “can continue paying back their debts to society.” Residents interested in buying wood through the program can call (318) 709-8489 to check availability. The sheriff’s office also asks local tree surgeons or cutters to call them if they have hardwood trees needing disposal.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine’s wild blueberry growers had a bounce-back year this summer after struggling with low prices and small crops sizes in recent seasons. The only commercial-scale wild blueberry growers in the U.S. harvest the fruit in Maine, mostly in the rural Down East region. The 2020 crop was less than 48 million pounds, and that was the lowest number since 2004. But the 2021 season, which ended recently, appeared to be much better, said David Yarborough, emeritus professor of horticulture with the University of Maine. He said the crop was likely about 90 million pounds, which would be the most blueberries since 2016. Growers had a better year in part because of a cool, wet July, Yarborough said. Hot summers and droughts have hurt the crop in recent years. It was also a good season for pollinators, Yarborough said. Prices were also up to about 70 cents per pound to farmers, which would be an improvement of 10 cents from last year and more than twice the number from 2017, when prices cratered, he said. Wild blueberries are smaller than cultivated blueberries, and they serve a slightly different niche in the market. Although many cultivated blueberries are sold fresh, the vast majority of the wild blueberry crop is frozen. The berries are also used extensively in processed food products.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: City officials said two sewer discharges have released an unknown amount of sewage in residential neighborhoods. The City Department of Public Works issued a notice of the overflows Saturday. One occurred in the Reiserstown area northwest of downtown and affected the stream known as Gwynns Falls. The other happened in the Poplar Hill neighborhood north of downtown and impacted the stream known as Jones Falls. Officials urged people to avoid swimming or other contact with the impacted streams.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: City Councilor and mayoral candidate Michelle Wu has won the endorsement of her former political rival and current office holder, Acting Mayor Kim Janey. Janey made the endorsement Saturday, the Boston Globe reported. In a statement, Janey said Wu has the record and values to protect and build upon the city’s progress in becoming more “equitable, just and resilient.” “Important policies like our housing agenda, equitable vaccine distribution, and how we handle mental health crises are on the line in this election,” said Janey. “Moreover, Black and brown residents who are most impacted by systemic inequities need a leader in City Hall who will center equity and inclusion in all her policies, and ensure they have a seat at the table when real decisions are made.” Wu was the top vote-getter in Sept. 14′s preliminary election. City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George came in second and also advanced to the Nov. 2 general election, and three major contenders – City Councilor Andrea Campbell, Janey, and John Barros – were eliminated.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office said she will declare unenforceable a Republican-written budget provision that seeks to ban indoor mask requirements for children. The Democrat had been expected to block the language as unconstitutional since $55 billion in spending was unveiled and quickly passed by Michigan’s Legislature earlier this week. Spokesman Bobby Leddy confirmed this week’s move in a statement, calling the proposed restriction “dangerous.” The provision, which is not tied to spending, would prevent the state health director and local health officers from issuing or enforcing orders that require children under age 18 to wear a face covering. More than a dozen counties, including most of the state’s most populated ones, mandate masking in schools to curb COVID-19. Various K-12 districts in other counties also require face coverings. The governor and GOP legislators did negotiate other language related to coronavirus vaccine exemptions and reporting requirements for epidemic orders.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State regulators launched a court-ordered process for assessing the risks to clean water from waste from the proposed PolyMet copper-nickel mine in northeastern Minnesota. The Department of Natural Resources announced plans for a trial-like proceeding known as a contested case hearing, which was ordered by the Minnesota Supreme Court in April. The hearing will be confined to the narrow question of whether the bentonite clay lining planned for the mine’s waste basin would be sufficient to keep pollution contained. A prehearing conference has been set for Nov. 1. An administrative law judge will later schedule the hearing itself, which will be a potentially lengthy proceeding in which all sides can present evidence and call witnesses before the neutral judge, who will report his findings back to the agency. The open pit mine and processing plant near Babbitt and Hoyt Lakes would be Minnesota’s first copper-nickel mine. Environmentalists have fought it because of the potential for acid mine drainage.PolyMet said the mine will be safe and that the project has undergone more than a decade of thorough, public environmental reviews.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state will soon start rebuilding a section of highway that collapsed during torrential rainfall brought by Hurricane Ida, the head of the state Department of Transportation said. Two people were killed and nine injured Aug. 30 as seven vehicles plunged into a deep pit that opened up on the dark, rural stretch of Mississippi Highway 26 near Lucedale. One of the injured people died in a hospital on Sept. 11. Department of Transportation Director Brad White told legislative budget writers Friday that the department has completed a geotechnical review and will choose a company early next month to repair the damage for about $1.2 million. He said the highway could reopen in about 45 days. White said the area had received more than double its average annual rainfall before the hurricane, and then Ida dumped more than 12 inches of rain in less than a day. The stretch of highway is on a hillside, and White said the deluge blew out a pipe that ran under the roadbed.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State lawmakers who want to halt all public funds to Planned Parenthood are recommending the Legislature give Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s administration authority to cancel abortion providers’ Medicaid contracts based on behavior in other states deemed illegal or unethical. The Senate Interim Committee on Medicaid Accountability and Taxpayer Protection approved a report with that recommendation on Thursday. Planned Parenthood is Missouri’s only abortion provider. Abortion providers are prohibited from using Medicaid funds for abortion except when the mother’s life is in danger or in the cases of rape or incest. Some lawmakers want to pull all public funds, including those for birth control, sexually transmitted disease treatments, cancer screenings and other health care for low-income women. Democrats warned that the move would trigger a confrontation with the federal government that could threaten the overall Medicaid program.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A therapeutic boarding school in northwestern Montana, which state inspectors learned had once made boys sleep outside in winter conditions without proper clothing as punishment, closed Friday. Staffers confirmed to the Montana State News Bureau on Tuesday that the 16-bed Wood Creek Academy near Thompson Falls was shutting down. A message had also been posted on the program’s website, which had been pulled down by Friday. Wood Creek Academy, a residential boarding school for boys ages 13 to 18, had been the subject of two complaints filed with the state within the past year and inspections uncovered other infractions. The state health department sent inspectors to the boarding school in January in response to a complaint. The inspection found two boys ran away from the school one morning in January and Wood Creek Academy staff waited for more than an hour before calling law enforcement. As punishment for running away, staff prohibited the boys from having any interaction with their peers for three days. Such punishment is prohibited under state regulations. The inspector reported the boys also were sent to sleep in shorts and T-shirts in tents as nighttime temperatures dipped as low as 28 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nNebraska\n\nKearney: Authorities in south-central Nebraska said a teenage girl survived after a car she was driving collided with a train. The collision was so violent that her car’s engine was ejected. The crash happened Wednesday at a rural railroad crossing west of Kearney, the Kearney Hub reported. Buffalo County Sheriff’s officials said Sydney Conner, 17, was traveling north on a county road about 7:45 a.m. when her car collided with a westbound Union Pacific train. Sheriff’s Sgt. Ramey Ristine said investigators believe Connor was blinded by the rising sun as she approached the crossing and didn’t see the train. There are no crossing arms at that railroad intersection, but it is marked with stop signs.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: A hospital in rural northeastern Nevada is pleading with residents to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and to take other precautions to help slow the spread of the coronavirus to “keep our health care system from being overrun.” The Northeastern Nevada Regional Hospital in Elko said Friday the virus was “running rampant”” in the region and that the hospital’s intensive care and medical-surgical units were near capacity and that it had postponed elective surgeries and added beds. “As a hospital staff, we are pleading with you to practice the precautions we know are effective in stopping COVID-19,” the hospital said in a statement posted on social media. “Avoid large gatherings, wear a mask when around people from outside your household, observe physical distancing, and practice good hand hygiene. Most importantly, please get vaccinated against COVID-19.” The hospital said wait times were longer than normal but that it was still able to safely provide medical care. “Please help us slow the spread of COVID-19 and keep our healthcare system from being overrun,” the hospital said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A former high school teacher accused of soliciting sexually explicit videos from a student for money and making and possessing child pornography has pleaded guilty to human trafficking and manufacturing child sex abuse images. Joshua Harwood, 38, of Manchester entered his pleas to the two felony counts on Wednesday, the Concord Monitor reported. Harwood had taught business at the high school, where he was hired in July 2020. Police were notified of the allegations involving a minor in December and Harwood was placed on administrative leave. He was later arrested and has been in jail since February. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for Oct. 19. On the trafficking charge, attorneys are recommending a sentence of 31/ 2 to seven years in jail, which may be suspended if Harwood completes a sex offender program. They’re recommending a consecutive sentence of 71/2 to 15 years, a portion of which may be suspended, for the manufacturing charge.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nCherry Hill:The New Jersey craft beer scene took home a few big honors at this year's Great American Beer Festival in Denver. Among the 265 breweries awarded 290 medals from the Brewers Association were Mechanical Brewery of Cherry Hill, which took home the gold in the English mild or bitter category for its Momentum. Departed Soles Brewing Co. of Jersey City and Spellbound Brewing of Mount Holly each took home silver medals. The Jersey City brewery was honored in a gluten-free beer category for None Shall PATH, and the Mount Holly brewery won for its wood- and barrel-aged beer for Porter Aged on Palo Santo. The Great American Beer Festival honored beers in 97 categories spanning 175 styles in the 35th edition of its competition, with judging held across 17 days and 34 sessions, according to a news release.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham visited southern New Mexico on Friday to talk with fellow elected Democratic leaders and business groups about economic development and to tour a military base near the U.S.-Mexico border where Afghan refugees are being housed. The Democrat’s visit was not made public until late in the afternoon. Her office said she walked through the processing area at Fort Bliss Army base, spoke with volunteers about the need for winter coats and other items for those at the facility and saw how the refugees were screened for COVID-19. “Whenever the federal government tells us they need our help, New Mexico is ready to help these families on their way,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement after the tour. There was no indication that Lujan Grisham visited the U.S.-Mexico border while in the area. She has faced criticism in recent months for not doing more to address the concerns of residents along the border amid the latest influx of immigrants.\n\nNew York\n\nHolbrook: Mourners began arriving at a Long Island funeral home viewing Sunday for Gabby Petito, whose death on a cross-country trip has sparked a manhunt for her boyfriend. A line had formed outside the funeral home in Holbrook, about 35 miles east of New York City, by noon, and groups of firefighters were seen filing past. A fire truck sat on each side of the building, each with its ladder raised. Across the street from the funeral home, a chain link fence was adorned with posters featuring Petito’s image and messages such as, “She touched the world.” Petito was reported missing Sept. 11 by her parents after she didn’t respond to calls and texts for several days while she and Brian Laundrie visited parks in the West. Her body was discovered Sept. 19 in a remote area in northwestern Wyoming. Laundrie and Petito grew up on Long Island but in recent years moved to Florida. Petito’s death has been classified as homicide, meaning she was killed by another person, but medical examiners in Wyoming haven’t disclosed how she died pending further autopsy results. The couple posted online about their trip in a white Ford Transit van converted into a camper. They got into a physical altercation Aug. 12 in Moab, Utah, that led to a police stop for a possible domestic violence case. Ultimately, police there decided to separate the quarreling couple for the night. But no charges were filed, and no serious injuries were reported. Investigators have been searching for Laundrie in Florida, and searched his parents’ home in North Port, about 35 miles south of Sarasota.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Authorities said a bank robber was caught after they determined he had taken his getaway vehicle for a test drive from a car dealer. The Raleigh-based U.S. Attorney’s Office said in a news release that 68-year-old Glenn Alin Martinoff was sentenced to more than four years in prison on Thursday after previously pleading guilty to bank robbery. The news release said Martinoff entered a Wilmington bank in January wearing a mask and gloves and brandishing a large screwdriver. He robbed the location of more than $6,000, authorities said. Investigators using surveillance video determined his getaway car was for sale at a nearby dealership. The news release said that authorities found out he had taken the car for a test drive to use as his getaway car. The news release said investigators found the cash and clothing worn during the robbery during a search of his apartment.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMakoti: The first car jumping attempt in five years by North Dakota’s version of Evil Knievel ended in disaster when the car driven by the man known as the Flying Farmer corkscrewed off the ramp and rolled. Authorities said John Smith, 57, was alert after the crash Saturday at a rural gravel pit and that he even tried to pull himself out of the car while talking to rescuers. He was eventually cut out and taken by a medical helicopter to a hospital, according to firefighters. The extent of his injuries wasn’t known. The crowd of about 300 spectators went silent when Smith crashed. Family members, including his daughters and wife of 34 years, Melinda, reacted emotionally, running to the mangled car, The Bismarck Tribune reported. Smith’s previous jump was in 2016, when he rose over towering flames to clear a burning trailer. Smith, who farms near Makoti, in western North Dakota, said he was inspired by the motorcycle daredevil Knievel while growing up. He has gained notoriety for his jumps at fairs and other attractions across the state. He has performed more than 100 jumps, even jumping on a frozen lake.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine’s top lobbyist, a man linked to an ongoing federal bribery investigation but never charged, resigned Friday after three years on the job. Legislative Director Dan McCarthy cited “the pace and grind” of the job and referred to predecessors who warned him against serving more than two years. “I know I’ve run quite a bit over my two year commitment but I think now is the right time to resign as your Legislative Director,” McCarthy wrote in his letter to DeWine. Federal prosecutors charged five individuals last year, including the then-House speaker, with orchestrating a $60 million bribery scheme to assure the 2019 passage of a bill bailing out two nuclear power plants. Prosecutors said the scheme also involved killing efforts to put a petition on the ballot to overturn the bailout. The power plants were operated at the time by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp. McCarthy is a former FirstEnergy lobbyist who was president of one of the dark money groups, Partners for Progress, which has been implicated in the alleged bribery scheme. McCarthy has said his actions were legal and DeWine’s office has said it has no indication McCarthy is a target of the investigation, which continues.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOkmulgee: Muscogee Nation voters have approved press protections for their tribe’s news enterprise. Citizens voted 1,914-596 last week to amend the tribe’s constitution to include press protections and mandate funding for Mvskoke Media, Indian Country Today reported. Although freedom of the press is guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution, many tribal nations lack such language in their constitutions. The Muscogee amendment allows the tribe’s news enterprise – which includes print, broadcast and digital operations – to operate “free from political interest or undue influence, harassment, censorship, control or restrictions from any department” of the tribe’s government. The effort traces to 2015, when the tribe passed the Free Press Act establishing independent media. Its governing body later repealed the law during an emergency meeting. Last year, tribal leaders unanimously restored the press freedoms by passing the Independent Muscogee (Creek) Press Act, which was viewed as a positive step.\n\nOregon\n\nNewberg: A school board has banned educators from displaying Black Lives Matter and gay pride symbols, prompting a torrent of recriminations and threats to boycott the town and its businesses. Newberg, a town of 25,000 residents situated 25 miles southwest of Portland in gorgeous wine country, has become an unlikely focal point of a fight between the left and right across the nation over schooling. The City Council has condemned the action by the Newberg School Board. So did members of color of the Oregon Legislature and House and Senate Democrats. The American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon is threatening to sue. The Oregon State Board of Education called on the school board to reverse course, saying student identities should be welcomed and affirmed. But the four conservative members of the seven-member board are digging in their heels. Member Brian Shannon, who proposed the ban, said lawmakers from Portland should keep out of the school district’s business and instead focus on Portland, where homelessness is an issue.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has joined a federal investigation of Pennsylvania’s largest pension fund and is seeking among other things records to determine whether improper “compensation and gifts” might have been offered staff, a newspaper reported. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the commission is also seeking records earlier sought by the U.S. attorney’s office about what officials of the $64 billion Public School Employees’ Retirement System have called a mistake in calculating the fund’s long-term investment performance. The newspaper reported that the subpoena given to the school pension plan Friday was the first indication that investigators are looking into possible presents or money from investment advisers and consultants. State employees are forbidden from accepting such gifts under a ban imposed by Gov. Tom Wolf. The Securities and Exchange Commission pursues civil rather than criminal complaints and has broad power to impose fines, discipline financial players and order changes. Pension fund system spokesperson Steve Esack said Saturday that the fund had no comment on the SEC action, the newspaper said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The man authorities sid leads the Rhode Island chapter of the Hells Angels motorcycle club has turned down a plea deal that would have sent him to prison for five years, and will now take his chances at trial. Joseph Lancia, 30, of Smithfield told a judge Thursday that he would rather go to trial, WPRI-TV reported. He faces multiple criminal counts stemming from two incidents. In one case, he is charged with shooting at a truck in June 2019 being driven by a former Hells Angels prospect with whom he had a dispute. He is charged with felony assault and battery in that case. He is also charged with knocking someone unconscious with a punch outside a Providence strip club in March 2020. Prosecutors initially offered a deal that came with eight years in prison, but after speaking with the judge, the sentence was lowered to five. Assistant Attorney General Joseph McBurney said if Lancia is found guilty at trial on all counts, he faces 61 years behind bars. Lancia, who is out on bail, refused to comment outside of court.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSt. George: State transportation officials want to hear from the public about a project to widen part of Interstate 26 and improve one of the state’s key interchanges. The state is spending $19 million on preliminary engineering work to widen 22 miles of I-26 in Orangeburg, Berkeley and Dorchester counties. The project also will modernize I-26’s interchange with Interstate 95. The tight, curving off ramps often cause backups. The Department of Transportation is accepting comments about the project until Oct. 10 on its website. The project from Exit 165 to Exit 187 on I-26 will also improve interchanges and take other steps to make the highway safer. It is also part of a larger plan to have three lanes in each direction on I-26 from Charleston to Columbia by the end of the decade.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A Missouri-based battery manufacturer has selected Rapid City for a factory complex that it said could employ up to 1,500 people. AEsir Technologies plans to construct four buildings. The first building will be a 150,000-square-foot manufacturing and distribution center capable of producing 1.2 million batteries annually. The company initially plans to hire 400 employees and expand to 1,200 to 1,500 employees. The first phase will cost about $90 million, with a total price tag of $300 million when all four phases of the development are finished, according to CEO Randy Moore. The company looked for an available labor force, an economic development incentive package and community support when searching for the ideal location for the new facility, Moore said. Twenty other communities were considered for the facility. Moore said easy access to rail, a state highway and Rapid City Regional Airport were also factors in the company’s decision to choose Rapid City. AEsir Technologies manufactures nickel zinc batteries that Moore said are two to three times more powerful than lithium ion batteries and last just as long. He said they use potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte, an active ingredient in soaps and shampoos, which makes the batteries environmentally friendly.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:Tennessee Supreme Court Justice Cornelia Clark has died at the age of 71, the court announced Friday. She had been diagnosed with cancer. According to a news release, Clark died overnight after 16 years in her role, serving the longest tenure of her counterparts on the court while she was on the bench for more than 1,100 Supreme Court cases. Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who will select Clark’s replacement, called her a “trailblazer for women in the legal profession.” Clark was appointed to her seat in 2005 by former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen and served as chief justice from 2010 to 2012. Chief Justice Roger Page said Clark, better known as Connie, “loved the Tennessee judicial system and has made it better in immeasurable ways.” All but one of the remaining justices – Sharon Lee, whom Bredesen also appointed – were appointees of former Gov. Bill Haslam, signaling a likely shift further rightward for the court with an appointment by Lee. The Governor’s Council for Judicial Appointments will recommend three candidates to the governor, who will make his pick. The Legislature must confirm the selection.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso:A group of 14 Mexican soldiers was detained Saturday after inadvertently crossing the border at the Bridge of the Americas in El Paso, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman said. The soldiers were returned to Mexico after being detained by CBP for about 5 hours. One of the soldiers was issued a civil fine for being in possession of a personal-use amount of marijuana, CBP said. The incident occurred shortly after midnight Saturday when CBP officers saw two Mexican military vehicles cross the international border line on the middle of the bridge, CBP said. The bridge is also known as Puente Internacional Córdova de las Américas and as the Puente Libre, or free bridge, because there is no bridge toll charge. CBP officers approached the military trucks and temporarily detained the soldiers and secured their weapons and equipment. Photos shared on social media showed soldiers sitting on the asphalt and a military pickup stopped near the CBP checkpoints at the foot of the bridge on the El Paso side. The soldiers told CBP that they did not realize they had entered U.S. territory. CBP contacted Mexican military leadership who soon arrived at the international bridge. Shortly before 5 a.m., all the soldiers, equipment and vehicles were returned to Mexico, CBP said. Similar border incidents have occurred over the years, often involving Mexican soldiers or federal police from other parts of Mexico who cross the borderline into the U.S. at the middle of the international bridges in El Paso.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The home arena of the NBA’s Utah Jazz announced Friday that it will require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative coronavirus test for all fans over the age of 12. Vivint Smart Home Arena, located in Salt Lake City, will require fans to present proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test taken within 72 hours of the event to enter the venue. Employees who work at the arena are required to be fully vaccinated. “As a community gathering place, we have a responsibility to protect our guests by putting health and safety standards in place,” Jim Olson, president of Vivint Arena and the Utah Jazz, said in a statement. “We believe this is the path forward to shut down this pandemic.” Guests under the age of 12 will be allowed inside the arena if they wear a mask at all times. Other guests are strongly encouraged to wear a face mask, but it is not mandatory.\n\nVermont\n\nWilliston: Three people were sent to a hospital with nonlife-threatening complaints Friday after being exposed to bear spray at a local hotel, the Williston Fire Department said. Emergency crews were sent to a local inn about 10:30 a.m. Friday after receiving a report that four employees were having difficulty breathing. The investigation determined a can of bear attack deterrent was left in one of the second floor rooms where it was accidentally discharged by housekeeping staff. Bear spray is stronger than police pepper spray. Officials said 30 people in the hotel were evacuated. Three people were taken to a hospital and a fourth was treated at the hotel and released. The firefighters ventilated the building. Occupants and staff of the hotel were able to reoccupy the building shortly after noon.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The University of Virginia has announced plans for a new performing arts center funded by a $50 million donation. University President Jim Ryan said the gift is being made by Tessa Ader. The news release said the new center for dance, concerts, theater and other performances will be in the area known as the Emmet-Ivy corridor. “My late husband, Richard, and I long felt that a state-of-the-art performing arts center was needed by the University of Virginia,” Ader said in a statement to The Daily Progress. “I believe this new facility will be a wonderful asset to our community and am hopeful my gift will encourage others to come forward as well to make it a reality.” Although designs haven’t been completed, the university said the center will include a concert hall with more than 1,000 seats, a 150-seat recital hall and rehearsal studios. The center will also hold national touring artists. “The performing arts center will be a place that celebrates the arts as fundamental to the human condition, a university education and a democratic society,” Ryan said in the news release.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An administrative law judge has recommended that a Native American tribe in Washington state once again be allowed to hunt gray whales – a major step in its decadeslong effort to resume the ancient practice. “This is a testament to what we’ve been saying all these years: that we’re doing everything we can to show we’re moving forward responsibly,” Patrick DePoe, vice chairman of the Makah Tribe on the remote northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula, said Friday. “We’re not doing this for commercial reasons. We’re doing it for spiritual and cultural reasons.” DePoe was in high school in the late 1990s when the Makah were last allowed to hunt whales – occasions that drew angry protests from animal rights activists, who sometimes threw smoke bombs at the whalers and sprayed fire extinguishers into their faces. Since then, the tribe’s attempts have been tied up in legal challenges and scientific review. A federal appeals court ruled in 2002 that the Makah needed a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act; the tribe applied for one in 2005 but still hasn’t received one. On Thursday, nearly two years after he presided over a hearing on NOAA Fisheries’ proposal to approve the waiver, administrative law Judge George Jordan issued his 156-page recommendation to the U.S. Department of Commerce, finding that the tribal hunts would have no effect on the healthy overall population of the whales. The recommendation, along with a public comment period and further environmental analysis, will inform the department’s final decision, though no timeline for that has been set. As proposed, the waiver would allow the tribe to land up to 20 Eastern North Pacific gray whales over 10 years, with hunts timed to minimize the low chances of the hunters accidentally harpooning an endangered Western North Pacific gray whale.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice is urging residents who got the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to get their booster shot, citing the rising number of hospitalizations involving vaccinated people. There were 16,223 active COVID-19 cases reported statewide on Friday, with 1,008 people being treated in a hospital, according to the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources. The number of fully vaccinated people who have been hospitalized has increased 20%, Justice said. “That tells us there’s a growing need, more and more and more, for people that are fully vaccinated to get their booster shot,” he said. He said booster shots are available, for the most part, for people age 18 and over who had their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Booster shots are not yet available for other vaccines. Justice also pleaded again for the unvaccinated to get the vaccine. He said 3,700 doses have been given since the last update, but that’s not enough. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, West Virginia ranks last among the states in doses administered per 100,000 population.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:North America’s oldest polar bear living in human care at the Milwaukee County Zoo has died, zoo officials said Saturday. The Journal Sentinel reported 36-year-old Snow Lilly was euthanized Friday because of her declining health and subsequent quality of life concerns. According to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the median life expectancy for polar bears in human care is about 23 years. A recent wellness exam found Snow Lilly had heart disease and was undergoing other age-related changes, the release said. Snow Lilly came to the Milwaukee County Zoo in 2005 from the Bronx Zoo. “Snow Lilly was a visitor favorite at the Zoo and considered one of the iconic animals in the population,” said Zoo Director Amos Morris in a statement. “She will be sorely missed by both staff and visitors.” In recent years, the zoo called on Snow Lilly to stand in for a groundhog and usher in spring at a Groundhog’s Day celebration in 2018. She also shared a birthday with Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich. A necropsy will be performed, as important information can continue to be collected from it and help other polar bears living in human care. Final necropsy results will be forthcoming in the upcoming months.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Kristi Gabriel, 42, who survived a brush with death with COVID-19 but also lost her father and aunt to the disease, is pleading for the public to get vaccinated. “Even though I’ve gone through what I’ve gone through, some of my family still doesn’t agree with the vaccine,” she said. “And it’s shocking. It’s difficult to try to explain things to them. … I know there is a lot of misleading information out there and I know sources are trying to cut down on that, but you can’t eliminate them all. It’s unbelievable some of the fictitious stuff that’s out there and people are buying into.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/01/31/crocker-mansion-nj-real-estate/9286626002/", "title": "Crocker Mansion in Mahwah NJ sold for $26 million", "text": "The most expensive address in New Jersey is a Mahwah mansion steeped in Gilded Age grandeur.\n\nThe Crocker-McMillin mansion, a 58-room, four-story brick palace that has drawn comparisons to the royal estate in Versailles, was sold for $26 million in late December, earning the title of the priciest home sold in the Garden State last year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/31"}]}

Officials say the Alabama State Parks Foundation will raise money through donations to help improve park facilities and programs. The group’s website promotes contributions to help build cabins and trails, plus provide scholarships for youth campers. Most of the $40 million budget for the 22-park system comes from visitor fees, and donations will supplement funding for improvements. Voters three years ago approved a constitutional amendment to protect funding for the park system after money was shifted to other state agencies. Some parks had closed, and maintenance projects were delayed. Dan Hendricks of Florence is serving as president of the foundation.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Residents of the Aleutian Islands are planning to bring home indigenous remains removed from burial sites nearly a century ago. The Anchorage Daily News reports officials on the remote chain of islands stretching out from southwest Alaska are working on a three-year plan to recover the remains, held by the Smithsonian Institution, of more than 175 people from 11 islands. Researchers say some of the remains are up to 3,000 years old. Mark Snigaroff, president of the tribe on Atka, says officials plan to bury the first group of remains on Shemya this summer. They plan to bury the rest in 2020 and 2021. University of Kansas researchers also will collect genetic material from the bones before the remains are returned.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport set a new passenger-traffic record in March. The month is always extremely busy at Sky Harbor, as warm weather and spring training lure visitors to the Valley of the Sun. But more than 4.5 million passengers arrived at and departed from Sky Harbor this March, breaking the record set just a year ago. That figure represented growth of 3.3% over last year’s number of travelers. The airport reports it typically sees about 120,000 passengers daily. That number grew to 146,000 daily in March 2019. The increase also means that passenger traffic is up 3% year over year in the first three months of 2019. In a statement, Mayor Kate Gallego said the figures show the strong demand for travel to and from Phoenix.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Nearly three decades after the state became one of the first to cap how long someone can serve in the Legislature, lawmakers may find out next year just how far voters are willing to go to limit their time in office. Arkansas legislators are sending voters a proposal that would rework the term limits on House and Senate members for the second time in the past several years. It’s a pre-emptive strike against another proposal a group is trying to put on the 2020 ballot that would impose the strictest term limits in the U.S. Arkansas currently caps lawmakers’ time in office at 16 years under an amendment that voters approved in 2014 loosening limits that were imposed in the 1990s. It’s one of 15 states with legislative term limits.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Former first lady Michelle Obama and a host of celebrities will join thousands of students to celebrate college signing day at UCLA this year. Obama, Conan O’Brien, Kelly Rowland, Bebe Rexha, Jesse Williams, Usher, Pentatonix, La La Anthony, Don Cheadle, and other entertainers and athletes are slated to gather on the UCLA campus Wednesday to commemorate the day that high school students choose to pursue higher education. This will mark Obama’s sixth college signing day that she has celebrated with Reach Higher. As first lady, Obama used the Reach Higher initiative to inspire high school students to continue their education by attending college or a training program or by joining the military.\n\nColorado\n\nGranada: A University of Denver team is using drone images to create a 3D reconstruction of a World War II-era Japanese internment camp in southern Colorado. Researchers last week used the drone from the Switzerland-based company senseFly as part of a mapping project to help future restoration work at Camp Amache in Granada. From 1942 to 1945, more than 7,000 Japanese-Americans and Japanese immigrants were forcibly relocated to Camp Amache. They were among the 110,000 Japanese-Americans ordered to camps throughout the U.S. The Amache effort is part of a growing movement to identify and preserve U.S. historical sites connected to people of color.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The entity overseeing distribution of state funds to help homeowners with crumbling foundations has ceased authorizing new foundation construction work until it receives a payment from the state Department of Housing. Michael Maglaras, superintendent of the Connecticut Foundation Solutions Indemnity Company Inc., announced the suspension Monday. Maglaras said the captive insurance company determined it “cannot in good faith approve any new Participation Agreements” without the funds, given its commitments. There are 80 homes in the construction pipeline. The State Bond Commission, chaired by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont, released $20 million to the housing agency April 2.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: When Aubrey Plaza served lunch to those in need at Emmanuel Dining Room on Monday afternoon, none of the hungry men, women or children recognized the actress from her starring television and film roles. However, they clearly recognized her efforts, along with a team of 10 youth from Delaware 4-H, who served plates of baked ziti, string beans and cookies to 169 people seeking a hot meal. The “Parks and Rec” star, who was in town visiting her family over the weekend, is the national Service Ambassador for youth organization 4-H. As a young girl, she volunteered at the Ministry of Caring’s nearby child care center and the Mary Campbell Center, a home for adults and children with disabilities. “I really wanted to come back to the places where I used to go,” Plaza said, recalling dressing up as the Easter Bunny some years and taking photos with children.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The American Civil Liberties Union is suing the district and a police officer over the search of a yard belonging to a woman who made negative comments about police. The Washington Post reports the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit Monday against the District of Columbia and Officer Joseph Gupton. The lawsuit accuses officers of unlawfully searching Denise Price’s yard last May as retaliation for her critical comments about police. Price’s son was killed in a crash with a police car earlier that month. Police have said the officers were chasing a man and thought he threw a gun into Price’s yard, which they then searched without a warrant. Video shows them finding nothing. Police say the officers didn’t know Price owned the yard.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: A bill that expands state anti-hazing law has been sent to Gov. Ron DeSantis by the Legislature on a unanimous vote. The House voted 114-0 on Tuesday for the measure making people who organize hazing culpable if someone is seriously injured or dies, even if the organizer didn’t participate in the event. It also prohibits hazing of former members of fraternities or other organizations. Current law addresses pledges and active members. The vote came after the parents of Andrew Coffey made a tearful plea in support of the bill. The 20-year-old Florida State University student died of alcohol poisoning in November 2017 at an off-campus fraternity party. The bill provides immunity for the first person who calls 911 to get help for a hazing victim or provides immediate aid.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A new historic marker honors a woman who helped maintain peace and fair trade between the Creek Indian nation and what was then the new colony of Georgia. The Savannah Morning News reports that the marker describes Mary Musgrove, interpreter for Gen. James Oglethorpe from 1733 to 1743. Musgrove’s mother was Creek and her father English. She established a trading post after marrying John Musgrove in 1717. The marker in Lafayette Square was dedicated Friday. Joy Daniel Schwartz of the Colonial Dames of America says Musgrove was a colony founder but until now didn’t have a marker in Savannah’s historic district. One erected in 1961 on Savannah Sugar Refining Co. grounds is about a mile from Musgrove’s trading post and notes that her Indian name was “Cousaponakeesa.”\n\nHawaii\n\nKahului: Hybrid electric planes will be put to the test by a Hawaii airline hoping to use them for short-haul commercial flights. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports Mokulele Airlines and Los Angeles-based aircraft design firm Ampaire plan to test a model hybrid on Mokulele’s Maui route in September or October. The companies say a hybrid plane would provide lower operational costs as well as additional routes and more frequent flights. Hawaii is a good fit for the service because communities rely on short-haul flights to travel between islands. The collaboration will include the loan of Mokulele’s pilots and hangar space at Kahului Airport on Maui to Ampaire. Officials say Mokulele was acquired in February by Southern Airways, but the partnership with Ampaire will continue.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state is seeking to intervene on the side of the federal government after four conservation groups asked a judge to immediately halt drilling, mining and other activities to protect sage grouse habitat in seven Western states. Idaho and Utah filed documents in U.S. District Court late last week seeking to defend a plan put forward by President Donald Trump earlier this year. The conservation groups in a lawsuit filed in March say the plan weakens an earlier version put forward by the Barack Obama administration in 2015. The conservation groups early last week asked a judge to block the Trump administration plan altogether in Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, California and Oregon. Idaho Gov. Brad Little says preserving sage grouse is best accomplished with a collaborative process.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The nation’s capital may be famous for its cherry blossom season, but the Windy City will have one of its own this year too. The Chicago Tribune reports about 160 young flowering cherry trees planted near the Museum of Science and Industry are mature enough to put on a show this spring. The trees were planted in 2013 in honor of the 120th anniversary of the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. The blooms are expected to be at their peak during the first or second week of May. The Chicago Park District plans to offer status updates on its website. Chicago Park District Operations Support Manager Karen Szyjka says the cherry trees in Jackson Park are the largest collection in the Chicago area and were planted for the Japanese practice of cherry blossom viewing.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s court system has reached a new milestone with the creation of Indiana’s 100th problem-solving court. The recent certification of a veterans’ treatment court in Pulaski County means the state now has 100 courts that specialize in handling issues that include drug treatment, veterans, mental health and domestic violence. Pulaski County Judge Crystal Kocher says she’s proud that the new veterans’ court has been certified for her rural county. She says its creation “highlights the need and possibilities for rural communities around the state to provide comprehensive services.” Fifty Indiana counties are now served by a problem-solving court, and several more such courts are in the planning stages.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Half a dozen people dressed as penguins to ask Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang about climate change Sunday at a Franklin Junior High town hall event. The costumed questioners were there on behalf of Bold Iowa, a Democratic group founded by former state lawmaker Ed Fallon that organizes around climate change and environmental protection. The penguin outfits were a response to a Yang quote from another campaign event where he said that “people with financial struggles have the attitude that the penguins can wait in line.” Activists asked Yang to make climate change his top priority. Yang responded that climate change is important but that helping people with financial needs, through his plan to give all citizens a basic income, is the way to start fixing it.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Lawmakers have tightened the financial requirements for a license to operate nursing homes. The move comes after state regulators were forced to take over 22 struggling nursing homes last year. Officials with the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services told The Kansas City Star they had no choice to step in because nursing home managers had fallen behind on bills for basics like food and utilities, putting the health and safety of residents at risk. The Legislature passed a bill requested by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration requiring much more financial information from people applying for nursing home licenses. Under the new law, applicants must show they have enough working capital for the first 12 months of operations.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: All eyes are on the racehorses during Kentucky Derby Week. But in barns on the backside of Churchill Downs, you might find a behind-the-scenes animal napping in a horse’s stall – goats. There’s Lily, who gets in trouble for eating flowers and is known for head-butting people who stop scratching her. And there’s her pal Roxanne, whose horns get painted pink for the Kentucky Oaks and who has a sixth sense for knowing which horses are running. You might see Trevor, the ornery, one-horned goat, who some say likes to eat Doritos. And, if you’re lucky, you’ll spot Oliver and Max, the baby goat duo, sprinting around – maybe even with a stuffed jockey on one of their backs. Goats, their owners say, can serve as companions for a nervous thoroughbred, making for a soothing presence in the stall.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The Army Corps of Engineers says the rising Mississippi River could result in the unprecedented reopening of a historic flood control structure. Spokesman Rickey Boyett tells WVUE-TV there’s a real chance the Corps might have to reopen the Bonnet Carre Spillway, which was closed April 11. Boyett says it’s never been opened twice in one year. The National Weather Service says the river is expected to reach 16.9 feet May 11 at a New Orleans gauge where 17 feet generally corresponds with a spillway opening. The spillway is opened to relieve stress on New Orleans levees when the Mississippi flows at 1.25 million cubic feet per second, fast enough to fill the Superdome in less than two minutes.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Fishing managers on the East Coast are beginning the daunting process of implementing new restrictions on lobster fishing that are designed to protect a vanishing species of whale. A team organization by the federal government recommended last week that the number of vertical trap lines in the water be reduced by about half. The lines can entrap and drown the North Atlantic right whale, which number a little more than 400 and have declined by dozens this decade. The interstate Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission met on Monday to discuss the implementation of the new rules, which are designed to reduce serious injuries and deaths for whales by 60%. Colleen Coogan, who coordinates the federal government team designed to protect the whales, says cooperating with Canadian authorities will be key.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The first black woman to serve as American University’s student government president is seeking more than $1.5million in court-ordered damages against a neo-Nazi website operator who orchestrated an online harassment campaign against her. In a court filing Monday, Salisbury native Taylor Dumpson’s attorneys asked a federal judge in Washington for a default judgment against The Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin and a follower who racially harassed Dumpson on Twitter. Dumpson sued Anglin and the internet troll last April, but neither responded. Dumpson graduated from Wicomico High School. She seeks a total of more than $1.8 million in damages, including $1.5 million in punitive damages against Anglin and his company.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nCambridge: Student pranksters at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have struck again, drawing inspiration from America’s hottest movie. MIT students over the weekend draped the university’s signature Great Dome with a giant cloth version of Captain America’s red, white and blue shield. Their efforts drew a Twitter “Very cool!” from actor Chris Evans, the Massachusetts native who plays Captain America in Marvel films including current smash hit “Avengers: Endgame.” The shield went up Saturday night and was taken down Monday morning. MIT students have for generations centered similar pranks, which they call “hacks,” on the dome. A realistic police cruiser was placed on the dome in 1994. In 1999, it was decked out to look like R2D2, the robot from “Star Wars.”\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: Moose are thriving at Isle Royale National Park, but the trees on which they feast are paying a heavy price, scientists say. An estimated 2,060 of the lumbering beasts roam the island wilderness, according to a report by Michigan Technological University researchers who spend weeks there each winter observing the relationship between moose and the wolves that prey on them. The moose number is believed to be the highest since 1995, when the total exceeded 2,400, only to plummet to about 500 within two years because of harsh winters, a shortage of food and a drop-off of wolves that previously had culled the herd. Conditions are similar now, although it’s uncertain how the moose population will respond, scientists said. Its growth is likely to slow at least somewhat in the coming year, says Sarah Hoy, an assistant research professor.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A proposal to rename a state park on the St. Croix River after former Vice President Walter Mondale has been dropped after strong opposition from local residents. House Majority Leader Ryan Winkler proposed renaming Interstate Park after Mondale, who helped preserve the St. Croix and other waterways as a U.S. senator in the 1960s by sponsoring the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. When residents in the area pushed back, Winkler turned to St. Croix Park. But more than 1,800 people signed a petition opposing the name change. Rep. Nathan Nelson says many of his constituents admire and respect Mondale but don’t want to change the St. Croix name that was given in the 1930s. The Star Tribune says Winkler will instead focus on naming a trail, scenic overlook or visitor center in the parks after Mondale.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: If you’re over 50 and looking for love in the Magnolia State, you’re probably in the worst place possible. A recent study by TheSeniorList has ranked Mississippi dead last on “The Best States for Finding Love After 50” list using the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau on marital status and income. Baby boomers only have about a 44.5% chance of finding love here, according to the study. The ranking was determined based on three factors: How many 50+ singles exist in each state, including those divorced, widowed or never married? How many of those singles have a median income of at least $50,000, giving them financial means to date? And which way is the senior single scene trending – up or down? Mississippi only has 13.7% singles over 50; 43% have income over $50,000; and the change in singlehood has only increased 2% since 2012.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Hoax alert: The Missouri Department of Conservation says it is not planning to ban mushroom hunting on public lands and is not considering implementing a license for the activity. The department is responding to a social media post that includes the agency’s logo. It shows a fake statement attributed to the agency that claims the state is banning mushroom hunting on public hunting grounds, including those around lakes. And it says it’s legal to hunt for mushrooms on private land without a permit. It also says the state is considering implementing a $50 license for mushroom hunting, beginning Jan. 1. None of that is true. The wildlife department says the post is a hoax. In a post on Facebook, the agency asks the public to help dispel the rumor.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: This year’s state paddlefish season kicks off Wednesday with the opening of the Upper Missouri River section from Fort Benton downstream to Fort Peck Dam. Substantial flooding occurred around the Fred Robinson Bridge and in James Kipp Recreation Area this spring, so camping will be considered “primitive” for most of the paddlefish season as crews clean up and fix damaged infrastructure. The access road and public boat ramp at the James Kipp Recreation Area is fully operational. Access and camping areas on the north side of the river, including Slippery Ann, Jones Island and Rock Creek campground, are reportedly in good shape. The Rock Creek boat ramp is also fully functional. Anglers who did not participate in the paddlefish harvest tag drawing can still purchase an Upper Missouri River Paddlefish Snag and Release License online, at an FWP office or at any license provider.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Native American education advocates say the state’s proposed social studies standards fall short of teaching a comprehensive history of Native Americans. The Omaha World-Herald reports the newly formed Nebraska Indian Education Association is raising concerns about the statewide standards unveiled last month. The Nebraska Department of Education is seeking public input on the drafted education guidelines. The group wants the standards to better disprove misconceptions and emphasize local tribes. They say schools should teach about tribal sovereignty and Indian science and horticulture. They also want the state to teach about the centuries before European settlement when their civilization thrived. State Board of Education President John Witzel acknowledges the proposed approach to Native American topics is “pretty general” and says there’s time to make changes.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Some Clark County commissioners have voiced general support for considering firearm restrictions on the Las Vegas Strip if state lawmakers give them the power to create stricter gun laws. The county would be given such power under an omnibus gun bill moving through the Democrat-controlled Legislature despite widespread opposition from Republicans and gun rights groups. Some commissioners say state law prevented the body from enacting gun regulations following the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The gunman attacked a 2017 Las Vegas music festival and used bump stocks to mimic the firing rate of an automatic firearm. Nevada is one of the few states in which the Legislature meets every other year, so the move under consideration could extend the window for conversation about firearm issues.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHopkinton: The 130-year-old Contoocook Covered Railroad Bridge, believed to be the oldest surviving bridge of its type, is getting a face-lift. The New Hampshire Division of Historical Resources said the bridge was to be stained and receive minor repairs starting Tuesday. The bridge spans the Contoocook River at the junction of Routes 103 and 127. The project is expected to last several weeks but not affect vehicle traffic. It was built for the Concord and Claremont railroad and served rail traffic until 1960. It was listed to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The project is funded through the Conservation and Heritage License Plate Program.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMillburn: The Millburn High School robotics team didn’t start off strong, but after four days of competing, with a robot that shot balls at targets, the 11-member team took the top prize in the VEX Robotics World Championship. Bryan Levine, the senior captain of the Essex County school team, said his group lost the first two of the 11 rounds of competition but rallied to win eight of the next nine for the top spot. It’s the first New Jersey team to win the international competition. The 7405P Millburn Phreak Show team paired with a team from a school in Shanghai, China, to win two of three matches over a joint team composed of Shanghai and Beijing competitors. More than 30,000 competitors in 1,650 teams converged in Louisville, Kentucky, for the contest.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard has halted further oil and natural gas development on New Mexico trust lands near the Chaco Cultural National Historic Park that are considered sacred by many Native Americans. Confirmed Monday, the executive order places a drilling moratorium within a buffer zone surrounding Chaco Canyon and its ancient dwelling. The moratorium does not directly affect federal and private holdings. Garcia Richard visited the Navajo Nation to sign the moratorium. She calls it a huge step forward in safeguarding archaeological and cultural resources. Oil industry representatives say robust protections already are in place within the national park at Chaco Canyon and surrounding areas where archaeological surveys are required.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced a ban of alcohol advertising on city property. The ban, which takes effect immediately, applies to bus shelters, newsstands, Wi-Fi kiosks and recycling kiosks. Venues currently permitted to sell alcohol, such as restaurants, stadiums and concerts halls, are exempt. Existing ads will also be allowed to remain until their contracts end. The city’s health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, says there are “far too many deaths related to alcohol.” The deputy mayor for health and human services, Dr. Herminia Palacio, says ads can influence how much people drink and how young they are when they start. A Metropolitan Transportation Authority ban on advertising alcohol beverages on all New York City buses and subway cars and in stations took effect in January 2018.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A bill heading to Gov. Roy Cooper’s desk makes clear charities aren’t breaking the law by holding occasional casino “game nights” as fundraisers as long as they follow new restrictions. The House agreed 95-17 on Monday to changes the Senate made on legislation making legal what some nonprofits already have been doing. Bill supporters say enforcement of the current ban on these events has been uneven, and it would be better to allow nonprofits and some employers and trade associations to hold them, with alcoholic drinks permitted and prizes awarded by raffle. The bill still only applies east of Interstate 26 to comply with Cherokee casino agreements. Cooper vetoed a casino night measure in 2017, worried it could attract video poker. Lawmakers say those concerns have been addressed.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum has signed a complex energy bill dealing with empty pockets in underground rock formations, though property rights advocates are likely to keep fighting. The cavities or voids are known as “pore space.” They belong to the surface owner, not the mineral owner. The Bismarck Tribune reports that certain landowners will no longer get compensated for the injection of oil-field wastewater into their pore spaces. Landowners also are barred from making claims that oil-field wastewater injected into a disposal well on adjacent land is migrating into their pore space. Burgum says the bill clarifies legal issues related to underground injection, which should boost the state’s energy industry. Opponents say it’s an unconstitutional taking of private property rights and will lead to lawsuits or a referral to voters.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s Department of Natural Resources says land that it’s purchasing to expand a nature preserve near Lake Erie will help protect more than 700,000 plants of the endangered Lakeside daisy species. The department says the purchase of 118 acres for $1,075,860 will increase Lakeside Daisy State Nature Preserve on the Marblehead Peninsula in Ottawa County to 137 acres. State officials say the preserve is home to the only natural population of the plant left in the state. The Lakeside daisy was listed as endangered in Ohio in 1980. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed it as federally threatened in 1988. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service grant will cover 75% of the cost, with the remainder coming from Ohioans’ donations from their state income tax refunds to state nature preserves.\n\nOklahoma\n\nEagletown: State alcohol regulators used modern technology in a recent investigation of an old-school illicit job: moonshining. The Oklahoman reports agents with Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Laws Enforcement Commission and the McCurtain County sheriff’s deputies busted a moonshine operation in Eagleton. Authorities say a man turned himself in last week on a felony charge of operating a whiskey still without a distiller’s license. ABLE Special Agent-in-charge Joe Daniels says the investigation started with a tip that an Eagleton-area convenience store was selling moonshine. Daniels said agents flew a drone over some nearby wooded property, where they spotted the illegal operation. Daniels says the Discovery Channel TV show “Moonshiners” has sparked a resurgence of the illegal enterprise.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs clinic in the city is plagued with long wait times for new patients. The average delay to see a primary care doctor is 67 days, according to agency data. It’s the second-worst in Oregon and much longer than most Portland-area VA clinics, where wait times average less than a month. For veterans who move to the Salem area after starting VA treatment elsewhere, the wait is far worse. It’s not uncommon for them to wait years for an appointment. More than 1,100 veterans are caught in this limbo – living in or near Salem and still waiting to see a Salem VA physician because they were assigned doctors elsewhere in the Northwest. VA officials acknowledge the long waits are embarrassing and attribute it to difficulty in recruiting doctors to the Salem clinic.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state is getting an unexpected windfall, as internet sales tax revenues are coming in nearly four times above what had been projected for the current fiscal year. Revenue Department officials say the state estimated to collect $50 million from the tax on online transactions, but it’s looking like about $200 million will be remitted. The state two years ago imposed sales taxes on people who use online marketplaces to sell their wares. Pennsylvania is requiring businesses that don’t have a physical presence in the state to pay online sales taxes, under a divided U.S. Supreme Court decision issued last June. That ruling was considered a win for large retailers that maintain a presence in many states, as they generally had been collecting sales taxes on online purchases before the decision.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A report by the general treasurer finds that the state’s 35 locally run pension plans have close to $2.5 billion in unfunded obligations. The Providence Journal reports General Treasurer Seth Magaziner’s report found that almost two-thirds of the plans that provide retirement benefits to police, firefighters and other municipal employees are in “critical status,” meaning they have less than 60% of what they need to cover their liabilities. Providence leads the way with a $1 billion gap between its assets and its accumulated liabilities. The report also expresses concern about how much of some communities’ tax revenue is going to payments to pension plans, leading to the potential underfunding of other important budget priorities.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: More than 4,000 educators and their supporters are planning to rally at the Statehouse on Wednesday under the banner of education reform. The event, organized by the network of teacher activists known as SC for Ed, is expected to be one of the largest teacher protests in South Carolina history. Teachers involved say the rally is necessary because their demands for a 10% salary increase, smaller class sizes and uninterrupted planning time have fallen on deaf ears. SC for Ed organized the protest after a 2019 education overhaul bill that would have provided better working conditions for teachers stalled last week in the state Senate. At least four school districts have canceled classes because so many teachers have requested to take the day off.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Students at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology have won two awards totaling $10,000 in prize money for an invention they say may improve vehicle fuel efficiency by up to 10%. The Rapid City Journal reports that sophomores Mark Rotert and John Parker Chandler IV won a combined $5,000 Friday after pitching their vortex generator, TwisTech, in the governor’s Giant Vision competition. They also won another $5,000 prize from the college last month for the invention to reduce drag on vehicles. The students used a 3D printer to manufacture prototypes of the pocket-sized device. They say they’ve tested it on their personal cars and used simulation software to test a digital model. They say the invention yielded a 10% improvement in fuel consumption on sedan-style cars and a 7% improvement on semi-trucks.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Kid Rock is quite literally raising a middle finger in Music City. Rock, who lives in the White’s Creek neighborhood, commissioned an artist to install a giant middle finger sculpture on his property, Taste of Country reports. The outlet points to Ted Pelkey of Westford, Vermont, who installed a wooden sculpture shaped like a hand flipping the bird on his property. The finger caught the attention of Rock, who reportedly contacted Pelkey to see if he could help Rock get a similar statue. In turn, Pelkey reached out to the artist who made his, and the artist agreed to make a second. Rock also recently made headlines when the sign for his new Lower Broadway steakhouse and bar was approved in January. The soaring 20-foot-tall neon sign is a giant guitar, the base of which is intentionally shaped like a woman’s buttocks.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: State prison officials say the last written words of condemned inmates will no longer be shared publicly, marking another fresh change to execution day procedures in the nation’s busiest death chamber. The new policy Tuesday follows outrage by a state lawmaker who in 2011 also put a halt to Texas death row inmates choosing their final meals. State Sen. John Whitmire had chastised prison officials for reading an avowed racist’s final written statement after he was executed last week for the 1998 dragging death of James Byrd Jr., a black man. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice now says the agency will only publicly relay verbal statements made in the execution chamber. Texas prison officials last month also stopped allowing clergy in the death chamber.\n\nUtah\n\nDuchesne: A state park in east-central Utah has been renamed in honor of a former director of the Division of Parks and Recreation. A ribbon-cutting ceremony will be held May 7 at Fred Hayes State Park at Starvation, formerly Starvation State Park. After beginning his career with Parks and Recreation in 1982 as a seasonal ranger, Hayes rose through the ranks and served as division director from 2012 until 2018, the year he died. The park in Duchesne is named after 3,495-acre Starvation Reservoir. According to the park’s website, the origin of the previous name has been attributed to various legends, two involving a food cache stolen either by mountain men or by American Indians and another about livestock that perished due to hunger.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: It appears unlikely that testing of water at the state’s schools and day care centers for lead will happen this academic year. Vermont Public Radio reports lawmakers are having a difficult time deciding what lead level triggers remediation and how much state money should go toward the work. The Vermont Department of Health tested water in 16 schools last year and found all had traces of lead, with five schools showing levels high enough to require immediate action. A bill was introduced early in the session in the House to set up a water testing protocol for all schools and day care centers. The Senate later passed legislation that requires any school with lead levels above three parts per billion to switch out pipes or fixtures to remove the lead.\n\nVirginia\n\nCroaker: Howard Hankins was disappointed when he realized one of the presidential busts was missing from the collection on his farm, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. The crumbling, oversized busts of 42 presidents – and a much smaller bust of Barack Obama – are all that remains of Presidents Park, the defunct open-air museum near Williamsburg where visitors once walked among the presidential heads. The park closed in 2010, and Hankins, who helped build it, offered to take the 18- to 20-foot heads and move them to his farm about 12 miles away. After a recent tour, he discovered the 2-foot-tall bust of Obama was missing. After a public appeal for its return, a mysterious caller arranged to return Obama. “He didn’t know what it meant to everybody,” Hankins says. “There is hope for people in this country. ... Here we go. Let’s unite. Maybe the whole world can do this.” Reservations for tours can be made via Facebook, by visiting the “Presidents Heads Walking Tour” page.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state budget approved this week includes $750,000 to study the impacts of the possible breaching of four Snake River dams to help salmon recovery. The Seattle Times reports the legislation calls for a neutral third party to develop a process for local, state, tribal, federal and other stakeholders to weigh in on issues that would surround a decision to breach the four federal dams. Chinook salmon are prime food for the endangered orcas that frequent Puget Sound, and a statewide dialogue had been proposed last year by a task force that Gov. Jay Inslee established. The two Republican members of Congress from eastern Washington, where the dams are located, oppose the state-financed effort as wasteful, saying the decision to remove the dams is up to the federal government.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: An annual fundraiser involving Marshall University ceramics students has raised a record $18,000 to help feed needy families. Marshall says in a news release that bowls made by students and other volunteers brought in more than $15,000 at the Empty Bowls event last month, while nearly $2,500 was raised at a silent auction. The fundraiser benefited the Facing Hunger Foodbank. The purchase of each bowl covered the cost of more than 100 meals. The Facing Hunger Foodbank serves more than 115,000 people annually in 17 counties in West Virginia, eastern Kentucky and southern Ohio.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: This Is It! is the longest-running gay bar in the state, and it’s paying homage to the important role it has played by becoming home to the Wisconsin LGBTQ History Project’s first permanent public display since the project began 25 years ago. In doing so, This Is It! will also be able to open its doors to an 18-and-older crowd on select nights. “My late business partner, my current business partner and myself are dedicated to our history,” says This Is It! co-owner George Schneider. “It’s a win-win. We’re able not only to showcase this fantastic exhibit of LGBT history, and we can open the doors on select nights to our 18- to 21-year-old LGBT community.” The venue can admit people under 21 with a permanent visual art display that has cultural or historical significance, according to city law.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A U.S. Department of Justice report shows the state’s prison population grew the third fastest in the country in 2017. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the government figures released last week show the population in state prisons increased by 4.2% by the end of 2017. Wyoming’s prison growth was outpaced by Utah at 4.3% and Idaho at 5.1%. In Wyoming, 429 people per 100,000 were incarcerated that year. The national rate of state prison incarceration was 390 per 100,000 people. According to the report, Wyoming had about seven times more men than women in prisons. State prisons across the country had about 12 times more men than women. Prison populations in 29 states decreased by the end of 2017.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/01"}]}

The New York Times, which first reported the contribution on Monday, also identified Seid as the donor.\n\nThe massive donation instantly makes the Utah-based group one of the most well-funded organizations bankrolling conservative causes in the US -- a staggering distinction for a group with zero public profile or even a website. In comparison, the single contribution is more than double the total amount raised by Trump's presidential campaign committee during the entire 2020 election cycle.\n\nRobert Maguire, the research director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, called the donation \"stupefying,\" and \"by far\" the largest known contribution to a dark money political group.\n\n\"I've never seen a group of this magnitude before,\" Maguire said. \"This is the kind of money that can help these political operatives and their allies start to move the needle on issues like reshaping the federal judiciary, making it more difficult to vote, a state-by-state campaign to remake election laws and lay the groundwork for undermining future elections.\"\n\nLeo said in a statement that \"it's high time for the conservative movement to be among the ranks of George Soros, Hansjörg Wyss, Arabella Advisors and other left-wing philanthropists, going toe-to-toe in the fight to defend our Constitution and its ideals\" -- referring to two liberal-leaning billionaires and a consulting firm that manages several smaller dark money groups on the left.\n\nSeid did not respond to requests for comment left on phone numbers listed for him and his longtime assistant.\n\nHuge anonymous donation has ties to Chicago executive\n\n\"Dark money\" generally refers to nonprofits that get involved in politics but do not disclose their donors, a practice that significantly ramped up after the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010. Many dark money groups , like Marble Freedom, are 501(c)4 organizations -- nonprofits that are allowed to participate in politics as long as it is not their primary activity.\n\nGroups on both sides of the political spectrum have increasingly turned to dark money in recent years to sway voters or push agendas without revealing their ultra-wealthy benefactors -- but the Marble Freedom donation dramatically eclipses even the largest of the previously known groups.\n\nMarble Freedom's tax return covers its initial year of existence between May 2020 and April 2021. The gift of just over $1.6 billion came in the form of 100% of the stock of a privately held company, which Marble Freedom then sold to another company, according to the tax form.\n\nThe arrangement likely saved Seid a large amount of money in taxes, according to Marcus Owens, an attorney and former director of the IRS division on tax-exempt organizations, who reviewed the form for CNN. If Seid had personally sold the stock in the company, he would likely have had to pay capital gains tax on the proceeds of the sale. By donating the stock to Marble Freedom, he avoided having to pay that tax, and the nonprofit would be exempt from paying it.\n\nMarble Freedom wrote that it was withholding information about which company was donated and who it sold to because \"disclosing it would effectively disclose the identity of its donors.\"\n\nBut details about the donation connect it to the sale of the Chicago-based electrical device firm Tripp Lite, whose longtime chairman was Seid.\n\nAfter receiving the donated stock, Marble Freedom sold the company on March 17, 2021, according to the tax form. The same day, according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents , the American-Irish power company Eaton acquired Tripp Lite for $1.65 billion.\n\nDuring the sale, \"the sole shareholder of Tripp Lite\" was represented by New York law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, Law360 reported at the time. Less than two weeks later, Marble Freedom paid Sullivan & Cromwell $940,000 in legal fees, the tax form shows. A spokesperson for Eaton said the company would not provide more details about the acquisition, and several lawyers involved in the transaction did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSeid served as chairman and CEO and listed himself as the \"owner\" of Tripp Lite in federal campaign donation records from 2008. He worked at the company, which produces power strips, surge protectors and other devices, for more than 50 years, according to a Facebook post from Tripp Lite. He grew up in Chicago, the son of immigrants from Russia, according to Census records, and graduated from the University of Chicago.\n\nSeid has previously had a history of donating anonymously to conservative political groups and causes. An internal 2015 document from the Bradley Foundation, a right-wing nonprofit, stated that the conservative think tank Foundation for Government Accountability had received support from \"Barre Seid (anonymously).\" The document was part of a trove of records from Bradley that was hacked and released, and was later included as an exhibit in Senate testimony.\n\nIn addition, Salon reported in 2010 that \"Barry Seid\" was listed in tax documents as the identity of an anonymous donor who gave nearly $17 million to a group that produced an anti-Islam documentary and sent DVDs of the movie to millions of households during the 2008 election. An assistant for Seid told Salon that he did not contribute to the organization, although she didn't address whether he made the donation by routing it through another group.\n\nAnd publicly released emails suggest that Seid may also be the anonymous donor who pledged $20 million over five years to George Mason University's law school in order to rename it for former Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia in 2016. The emails were obtained through a public records request and published by George Mason Law alum Allison Pienta in 2019. The school has refused to identify the donor but has said that Leo coordinated the gift.\n\nSeid and his wife make public donations through another nonprofit, the Barbara and Barre Seid Foundation, which mostly funds Chicago-based cultural organizations and universities but has given to conservative and libertarian groups such as the Cato Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Heartland Institute. Seid also donated to various political campaigns in Illinois and elsewhere in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nBig spending and opaque groups\n\nEven in its infancy, Marble Freedom Trust has already funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to other dark money groups.\n\nLeo, Marble Freedom's chairman and trustee, is one of the most influential figures in the world of conservative dark money. A longtime executive at the Federalist Society, a national network of right-leaning lawyers, Leo has led or served on the board of more than a dozen different nonprofits. Several of his groups have been associated with political campaigns promoting conservative Supreme Court nominees, operating in complex networks of spending.\n\nThe new $1.6 billion donation \"solidifies Leo as just an absolute gravitational force within the conservative political and legal world,\" Maguire said. \"He was already the man behind the scenes raising money for reshaping the American judiciary, and this amount of money just takes it to a stratospheric level.\"\n\nOn the Marble Freedom tax form, Leo is listed as being paid a $350,000 annual salary for 25 hours a week of work for the group.\n\nThe form states that the group's mission is to \"maintain and expand human freedom consistent with the values and ideals set forth in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.\" While politics can't be its primary focus, it can use at least some of its huge resources to influence this year's midterms or future elections.\n\n\"This is such a significant amount that it would be a game-changer if they do decide to devote even a portion of that to election-related spending,\" said Anna Massoglia, the Editorial and Investigations Manager at OpenSecrets, a group that researches campaign finance.\n\nMarble Freedom reported making four donations to other nonprofits -- transactions that appear to have taken place between the sale of the stock in mid-March 2021 and the end of April 2021.\n\nThe largest contribution was a $153 million gift to the Rule of Law Trust, a dark money nonprofit led by Leo that has funded other conservative organizations. The group's tax returns show it received just under $80 million in donations in 2018 and no contributions in 2019 or 2020 , so the gift from Marble Freedom represents a massive funding boost for the organization.\n\nMarble Freedom contributed $41.1 million to Donors Trust, a nonprofit that distributes money to conservative and libertarian groups in addition to nonpolitical organizations. The group is a donor-advised fund, which means its contributors can recommend where their donations to the fund are sent.\n\nIn the past, Donors Trust has funneled millions of dollars to groups that have amplified false claims about election fraud and advocated for more restrictive voting rules. The group has previously said that its donations are intended to \"serve the public good.\"\n\nMarble Freedom also donated $16.5 million to The Concord Fund, a nonprofit that has advocated for conservative nominees to the Supreme Court and other judgeships and is associated with a group that has pushed restrictive voting laws. Concord, which was previously known as the Judicial Crisis Network, raised $20.4 million from July 2019 to June 2020, according to its most recent tax return\n\nIn addition to the three groups with political connections, Marble Freedom gave $18 million to Schwab Charitable Fund, another donor-advised fund.\n\nMarble Freedom lists two other board members in addition to Leo, both of whom are unpaid. One is Tyler Green , the former solicitor general of Utah, who has represented the Republican National Committee and other GOP groups in multiple voting-related lawsuits in recent years. Green, who is listed as Marble Freedom's administrative trustee, is also a former law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. The trust's address is listed as a home in North Salt Lake, Utah, that Green owns.\n\nThe board's third member is Jonathan Bunch, a former Federalist Society vice president who has been involved with various groups led by Leo. Bunch is listed as Marble Freedom's successor trustee. Green and Bunch did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt the end of April 2021, Marble Freedom had more than $1.4 billion in assets -- positioning it to play a major role in conservative causes potentially for years to come.\n\n\"This group is emblematic of the corrosion and the breakdown of our campaign finance system,\" Maguire said -- and how it gives \"wealthy donors, whether they be corporations or individuals, access and influence over the system far greater than any regular American can ever imagine.\"", "authors": ["Casey Tolan", "Curt Devine", "Drew Griffin"], "publish_date": "2022/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/politics/tax-credits-energy-savings-climate-bill/index.html", "title": "How the climate bill could save you money on electricity, cars and ...", "text": "(CNN) Democrats' new party-line tax and clean energy bill is a big deal for climate and energy savings. With nearly $370 billion for energy programs and tax incentives, it represents the largest climate investment in US history.\n\nIn addition to the US emissions reductions these will bring, there's a lot in the bill that could change both how Americans power their homes and what kinds of vehicles they drive.\n\nThe bill contains a bevy of tax incentives aimed at pushing consumers, developers, small businesses and others towards clean energy and more efficient energy usage -- helping bring down the cost of buying electric vehicles, heat pumps, water heaters, rooftop solar panels and more.\n\nThese measures would be more comprehensive than existing weatherization programs, and several would be available to all households, not just low-income ones,\" said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.\n\nClean electricity nonprofit Rewiring America recently estimated a US household would save $1,800 per year if they installed electric heat pumps to heat their water and heat and cool their air, replaced a gas car with an EV, and installed solar.\n\nThe tax credits work in another way to bring down costs: incentivizing cheaper clean electricity powered by renewables.\n\n\"There are people who are really on the front lines of the inflation crisis and how expensive fossil fuels are because of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, and this bill will be delivering big energy savings for those people,\" Leah Stokes, a senior policy advisor at Evergreen and associate professor of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, told reporters recently.\n\nHere are the main pieces of the bill that help consumers save money.\n\nSavings on buying an electric vehicle: The bill extends the current $7,500 tax credit for a new vehicle, as well as a $4,000 tax credit off a used EV. It also gets rid of the current cap that cuts automakers off tax credits after they've sold 200,000 EVs, and it is written so buyers can get an immediate discount at the dealership, instead of waiting weeks or months for their tax credit to come through.\n\nStill, there's a significant caveat: Automakers and consumers likely won't be able to take advantage of this tax credit over the next few years. At the insistence of Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, the tax credit was written in a way so that automakers are forced to move their EV supply chains away from China and to the US and countries where the US has free trade agreements. Vehicles must be built in North America, and EV batteries must also not come from countries like China.\n\nAs a result, US automakers likely won't be able to offer the credit in the next few years as they try to build up their domestic supply chains, Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan said.\n\nThe tax credit is also limited to trucks, vans and SUVs under $80,000, and other vehicles under $55,000, and has an income threshold for consumers.\n\nNew tax credits will cover 30% of the cost of highly efficient air conditioners, water heaters, furnaces and other home heating cooling appliances.\n\nHelp installing more efficient air conditioning and heating equipment: The bill would provide Americans with tax credits to cover 30% of the costs of installing highly efficient ACs, water heaters, furnaces and other cooling and heating equipment.\n\nHouseholds would be able to receive up to $600 for each piece of equipment, up to $1,200 total per year. There would also be a special credit of up to $2,000 for electric heat pumps. And credits could be used to upgrade breaker boxes, if needed, to handle additional electric load.\n\nThis measure replaces a similar tax credit that expired at the end of last year and came with a lifetime cap of $500.\n\nAid for low- and moderate-income Americans to purchase electric appliances: The legislation calls for providing low- and moderate-income households with rebates of up to $14,000 to buy electric appliances.\n\nThe rebates could cover between half and all the typical $14,000 cost of installing an electric heat pump, as well as much of the cost of electric water heaters, stoves and ovens and clothes dryers, as well as upgrading the home's breaker boxes and electric wiring. The legislation sets aside $4.5 billion over 10 years for this provision.\n\nTo alleviate concerns that low-income households would have to pay for the items up front, rebates could be provided at the point of sale or contractors could claim them, for example. It would depend on how state energy offices, which would administer the rebates, would set up their programs.\n\nRebates for retrofitting homes: Households could receive rebates of up to $4,000 to install energy-saving measures throughout their homes, under the bill. Low- and moderate-income Americans could receive up to $8,000. The rebate amount would depend on the estimated savings that would be achieved. The legislation would provide a total of $4.3 billion in funding over 10 years.\n\nTax credits to reduce energy leakage: Americans could receive tax credits to cover 30% of the costs of home improvements that reduce energy leakage, such as updated windows, doors, insulation and other weatherization measures, under the bill. They could get a credit of up to $600 per improvement and a total of $1,200 per year. Plus, they could receive a $150 credit to have a home energy audit conducted. The credit would be expanded so families could use it multiple times to make upgrades over time.\n\nBoosting efficiency in HUD housing: The bill would provide $1 billion in grants and loans to affordable housing units administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to increase energy or water efficiency, improve indoor air quality, make clean energy or electrification upgrades or address climate resilience needs. The improvements could include insulation, HVAC upgrades, flood-proofing, storm resistance, water-saving changes and the installation of solar or other renewable energy systems\n\nCredits in the bill will also cover 30% of the cost of a rooftop solar system and battery storage.\n\nTax credits for developers to build energy efficient homes: Builders could receive tax credits of $2,500 for single-family or manufactured homes and $500 for units in multi-family buildings for constructing Energy Star-certified housing. Developers could get $2,500 for each multifamily unit if prevailing wage requirements are met.\n\nThe credits would double if the homes or units are also certified under the Department of Energy's zero-energy ready home program.\n\nA credit of up to $2,000 for building energy efficient homes expired at the end of last year.\n\nInstalling solar panels on homes: Tax credits in the bill will cover 30% of the cost of buying a rooftop solar system and home battery storage. The average cost of a rooftop solar system is around $20,000, Tax credits in the bill will cover 30% of the cost of buying a rooftop solar system and home battery storage. The average cost of a rooftop solar system is around $20,000, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. But that upfront cost will result in energy bill savings every year and add value to a home.\n\nFor those who live in apartments or can't install solar on their roofs, there are other ways to get solar energy and lower energy bills, including leasing a rooftop solar system or joining a community solar farm to get power delivered. Tax credits in the bill increase for solar projects in low-income communities as well.\n\nSmall business incentives: Small businesses can get tax deductions of up to $1 per square foot of their business to make the space more energy efficient. They can get tax credits that cover up to 30% of the cost to replace fleets of cars and trucks with clean vehicles, as well as incentives to power their businesses with solar.", "authors": ["Tami Luhand Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/08/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2022/05/07/arizona-will-have-to-dig-deep-for-money-as-water-shortage-worsens/9682189002/", "title": "Arizona will have to dig deep for money as water shortage worsens", "text": "Arizona needs to rapidly invest in both water conservation and new supplies to offset losses from a shrinking Colorado River, the state’s top water officials warned Friday.\n\nFrom the millions of dollars the state is paying users to leave water in the river’s largest reservoir to the $1 billion lawmakers could spend to fund a new Arizona Water Authority, the future of water security for the fast-growing state will be costly. Water managers at a shortage briefing urged Arizonans to consider the river that supplies a third of their state’s water as permanently challenged.\n\n“We need significant action,” state Water Resources Director Tom Buschatzke said, “really significant action.”\n\nAlready, because of a federally declared shortage on the river, the Central Arizona Project is pumping only about two-thirds of what it once did through its canal to the Phoenix and Tucson areas. Forecasts for continuing declines in river storage at Lake Mead and Lake Powell suggest even deeper cuts over the next two years.\n\n“This may be the new normal,” CAP General Manager Ted Cooke said, referring to a river diminished by 22 years of drought and a warming climate. “This may be what we have to live with, ostensibly forever.”\n\nThe state is paying $40 million to water providers who agree to leave their water in Lake Mead this year and next, and CAP is adding $20 million each year. But Cooke said that sort of compensation is not guaranteed in future years, and continued losses would be painful to those relying on canal water. Rates also must rise when less water flows through the canal, so CAP can repay its construction debt.\n\nArizona’s river-dependent cities, who have previously banked excess water in the ground, have sufficient supplies to keep tap water coming despite the cutbacks, and municipal water officials say they're not ready to restrict outdoor watering. But Buschatzke said they and all water users must help in the fight to save the Southwest’s biggest single supply.\n\nBoth water managers support Gov. Doug Ducey’s plan for an Arizona Water Authority stocked with a $1 billion budget to find new sources of water over the next three years. The governor proposed that in his State of the State address in January, and suggested it could help the state partner on a plant that desalinates seawater. If a plant is built in Mexico, states who invest in it could take part of Mexico’s share of the river in return.\n\nA state water authority's envisioned compensation for a declining supply would take a lot of time and money, Cooke said, but it is an important step beyond conservation.\n\n“We can’t really count on Mother Nature,” he said.\n\nImport water from the Mississippi?\n\nThe legislation to create and fund such an authority initially stalled, but House Speaker Rusty Bowers on Friday said it is gaining bipartisan support and he hopes to pass it, either this session or in a special session.\n\n“We’re moving forward,” he said.\n\nThe state can help farmers who use 72% of Arizona's water get more efficient, he said, but it also must protect vegetables and other products grown on what he called some of the world's most productive farmlands.\n\n\"We don't want to throw that away, but there are smarter ways to do it,\" he said.\n\nAsked about potential targets for new supplies, Bowers told The Arizona Republic that one option is to pump floodwaters from the Mississippi River basin, either to Colorado’s Front Range or to New Mexico’s Rio Grande. From the Rio Grande, it could be pumped to the Gila River's headwaters and flow to Phoenix.\n\nKansas lawmakers who want to import water to western Kansas are interested in participating, Bowers said, though he acknowledged any such plan would likely be too expensive for a few states to handle on their own.\n\n“It would be a federal investment,” he said. Bowers believes that would make more sense than the government paying to help rebuild New Orleans or other areas damaged by floods.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the Colorado River dams, pondered but did not propose a similar scheme when it studied the river basin’s future 10 years ago. That study imagined piping water from the Missouri River, a major Mississippi tributary, to the Denver area, where it could replace water diverted from the Colorado.\n\nThe agency determined then that building a pipeline to move 600,000 acre-feet (coincidentally, about the same amount that Arizona expects to give up from the Colorado next year) would cost $8.6 billion. Pumping the water 700 miles would raise the total price to $1,700 an acre-foot. An acre-foot equals about 326,000 gallons and could support a few households for a year.\n\nBy contrast, Arizona cities currently pay less than $200 for an acre-foot of Colorado River water.\n\nThe costs for a pipeline likely have risen with inflation in the decade since the basin study. The Bureau of Reclamation has not conducted or begun any updated cost studies for such imports, said Dan Bunk, who leads the agency’s Boulder Canyon Operations Office near Hoover Dam.\n\nFix the 'leaky bucket' first\n\nArizona House Minority Leader Reginald Bolding agreed there’s bipartisan support for a water authority to assist with such projects as water recycling, but said the search for new water from outside the state shouldn’t overshadow the need for better policy within.\n\nFor instance, he said, lawmakers need to address the unregulated depletion of rural groundwater by industrial farms, another proposal that has so far not advanced in this year's legislative session. Paying big for new water sources while maintaining a “leaky bucket” makes no sense, he said.\n\n“We can’t fix the water crisis without looking at water holistically,” said Bolding, D-Laveen.\n\nWhatever legislators ultimately decide about new supplies, a more immediate remedy may already exist underfoot. The Gila River Indian Community, a major holder of Colorado River rights in lieu of water that others drained from the Gila, has banked more of it in its underground aquifer than what flowed through the CAP in a normal year before the shortage. It also stands to lose river water — 40,000 acre-feet — if Reclamation declares a deeper shortage next year.\n\nTo slow Lake Mead’s decline and possibly delay more losses, the Gila River Community is talking with neighboring cities and other water providers about selling them credits for later use of the groundwater, tribal Gov. Stephen Roe Lewis said. That would allow those governments to leave some of their own river water in Lake Mead for everyone’s future.\n\n“Now is the time to lead,” Lewis said.\n\n'Culture change' sought: Why Arizona cities won't impose water restrictions yet\n\nThere’s little time to stave off the next level of shortage, one that would take another 80,000 acre-feet out of Arizona, including the Gila River Community’s share. The federal government will decide on next year's shortage level when it makes its August forecast of reservoir levels. If hydrologists then predict that Lake Mead’s surface will start 2023 less than 1,050 feet above sea level, it will lock in the losses that Lewis seeks to avoid.\n\nThe weather could still change by August, but right now, the Bureau of Reclamation predicts the lake will drop a few inches below the threshold that mandates new cuts.\n\nBrandon Loomis covers environmental and climate issues for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

Here's what you need to ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe United States is on the brink of a retirement crisis. The primary savings tool for Americans – your 401(k) – isn’t helping.\n\nBy the end of the decade, about 21% of the country’s population will be 65 or older, up from 15% in 2016, according to forecasts by the Census Bureau. Most non-retired adults have some type of retirement savings, but only 36% think their savings are on track.\n\nNow, Congress is looking to help Americans save by bolstering 401(k) programs – the tax-deferred, company-sponsored retirement accounts to which employees can contribute income, and employers can match their contributions.\n\nA new bill, expected to reach President Joe Biden’s desk by the end of the year, could require most employer-sponsored retirement plans to enroll their workers automatically, making it easier for student-loan borrowers to save, and for older workers to make catch-up contributions. It will also lower costs for smaller businesses.\n\nRetirement savings in the United States were long thought of as a three-legged stool. Americans had pension plans, Social Security benefits, and defined contribution plans like the 401(k). Not any more.\n\nPension plans are nearly extinct. About half of private sector workers were covered by those so-called defined-benefit plans in the mid-1980s, but by 2021 only 15% of private sector workers had them.\n\nSocial Security payments still provide about 90% of income for a quarter of older adults, according to Social Security Agency surveys. But the Social Security trust fund is facing a 75-year deficit, and without intervention it will be depleted by the mid-2030s. Lawmakers have faced a decades long political stalemate on how to fix it.\n\nWhat’s left is the 401(k), which 68% of private industry workers have access to, but only 50% use.\n\n“I don’t think it was ever anticipated that this would be the primary leg of the stool,” said Jonathan Barber, head of compensation and benefits policy research at Ayco Personal Financial Management, a unit of Goldman Sachs that provides investment services to hundreds of US companies and more than a million corporate employees.\n\nIndeed, the 401(k) was never designed to be the primary retirement tool for Americans when it was introduced into the US tax code in 1978. “When it works, it works really well,” said Sri Reddy, senior vice president of retirement and income solutions for Principal Financial Group.\n\nThe 401(k) naturally appeals as a savings vehicle to Americans who bring in more money, say critics. Under the current plan, an employee in the highest tax bracket saves 37%. But an employee in the lowest tax bracket would gain a pre-tax advantage of saving only 10% on deferred income.\n\nThe tax breaks for these retirement savings are expected to cost the government nearly $200 billion this year, with most of those benefits going to the top 20% of earners, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nLess than 40% of lower-paid workers have retirement accounts, compared with 80% of middle- and upper-income families, according to Vanguard. Making a 401(k) plan more accessible doesn’t help Americans who don’t have money to save in the first place.\n\nStill, Congress thinks there’s a solution.\n\nIn late 2019, one of the most significant pieces of retirement legislation in the past 15 years, was signed into law by President Donald Trump: the bipartisan Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement, or SECURE Act. The bill removed maximum age limits on retirement contributions, provided tax credits for small businesses to offer their employees 401(k) plans, and extended retirement benefits to some long-term but part-time employees.\n\nLast week Congress almost unanimously passed another bill, SECURE 2.0, that has even broader changes. The Senate is expected to pass its version in the coming weeks.\n\nHere’s a look at how the primary retirement savings plan in the US may soon change.\n\nAutomatic enrollment\n\nIn what would be the largest change to the 401(k) program, SECURE 2.0 would require employers to automatically enroll all eligible workers into their 401(k) plans at a savings rate of 3% of salary. (Many employees currently have to opt in and then choose their contribution level.) The new rule also applies to the 403(b), a similar program for employees of certain public and tax-exempt organizations.\n\nEnrolled workers’ contribution rates would be automatically increased each year by 1% until their contribution reaches 10% annually.\n\nWhile workers have the option to opt out of the plan or change their contribution level after they enroll, automatically enrolling workers into these plans would make a huge change in younger and low-waged employees’ participation in the program.\n\nA 2012 study cited in the SECURE 2.0 bill found that, “[t]he most dramatic increases in enrollment rates are among younger, low-paid employees, and the racial gap in participation rates is nearly eliminated among employees subject to auto-enrollment.”\n\nAbout one in six of employers already offer automatic enrollment, and about 90% of new hires who use them participate in retirement plans, compared with just 28% under voluntary enrollment, according to a recent study by Vanguard, the largest provider of mutual funds in the United States.\n\nPre-retirees save more\n\nOlder workers who are between the ages of 62 and 64 can increase their catch-up contributions to $10,000 a year, up from $6,500 now. Beginning in 2023, these catch-up contributions would be taxed as Roth contributions, meaning they’d be taxed before being invested for retirement, though earnings would be indexed to inflation.\n\nPeople generally earn more as they age, said Reddy, and people in their 60s are typically earning more than they spend. Giving them the ability to increase their contributions makes a huge difference in retirement savings. “If you have people who are motivated and have incremental means, it’s a wonderful way of helping them get caught up for retirement,” he said.\n\nBarber, who heads up benefits research at Goldman Sachs’ Ayco Personal Financial Management, worries that this change may be overly complex.\n\nCurrently, most 401(k) contributions come from employees’ paychecks pre-tax, so investors don’t really feel the bite until they’re ready to withdraw their savings. Under the new plan, the catch-up contribution will be raised, but employees must pay taxes before they contribute.\n\nFor investors, “that might be a shock to some people who don’t understand the financial impact of that, especially if they’ve never had a Roth account,” said Barber.\n\nAbout 43.4 million borrowers in the United States have federal student loan debt, totaling a whopping $1.7 trillion, and many employees tend to forgo saving for retirement until they pay their loans in full.\n\nPay off student loan debt while saving\n\nLosing out on those early years of potential savings puts them at a significant disadvantage. The plan has a solution to that.\n\nEmployers could treat student loan repayments as elective retirement account deferrals, and provide a matching contribution to their 401(k). So if you pay off $1,000 in student loan debt, it would be the same as putting $1,000 into a retirement plan, as far as matching goes. If a company matches by 6%, that’s an extra $60 in savings.\n\n“The earlier you do [invest], the more those investment gains can multiply,” said T. Lake Moore V, an employee benefits attorney at McAfee & Taft.\n\nDelay mandatory withdrawals and limit tax penalties\n\nAmericans are retiring later and living longer. Secure 2.0 lifts the minimum age at which enrollees must begin withdrawing money from their accounts each year to 75 from 72. That allows for three additional years of tax-free growth on their retirement investments.\n\n(The penalty for those who fail to withdraw the required minimum from their account after 75 would be halved, to 25% from 50%.\n\nPart-time workers can contribute\n\nUnder the proposed act, companies that offer a 401(k) plan would be required to allow part-time employees who work at least 500 hours a year for two years, (the equivalent of just under 10 hours a week) to contribute to a retirement account. That would include part-time workers, gig employees, freelancers, caregivers and independent contractors.\n\nAdditional provisions\n\nThe plan would also extend tax credits to small businesses for providing greater access to retirement plans for their workers, and create an online database for Americans to locate lost retirement funds.", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind"], "publish_date": "2022/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/tech/twitter-whistleblower-peiter-zatko-security/index.html", "title": "Twitter whistleblower Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko raises concerns over ...", "text": "Twitter has major security problems that pose a threat to its own users' personal information, to company shareholders, to national security, and to democracy, according to an explosive whistleblower disclosure obtained exclusively by CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nThe disclosure, sent last month to Congress and federal agencies, paints a picture of a chaotic and reckless environment at a mismanaged company that allows too many of its staff access to the platform's central controls and most sensitive information without adequate oversight. It also alleges that some of the company's senior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter's serious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees may be working for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, who was previously the company's head of security, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges that Twitter's leadership has misled its own board and government regulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that could allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation, hacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also alleges Twitter does not reliably delete users' data after they cancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost track of the information, and that it has misled regulators about whether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The whistleblower also says Twitter executives don't have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become central to Elon Musk's attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk's claims).\n\nZatko was fired byin January for what the company claims was poor performance. According to Zatko, his public whistleblowing comes after he attempted to flag the security lapses to Twitter's board and to help Twitter fix years of technical shortcomings and alleged non-compliance with an earlier privacy agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. Zatko is being represented by Whistleblower Aid, the same group that represented Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.\n\nJohn Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid and Zatko's lawyer, told CNN that Zatko has not been in contact with Musk, and said Zatko began the whistleblower process before there was any indication of Musk's involvement with Twitter.\n\nAfter this article was initially published, Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, told CNN, \"We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding.\"\n\nCNN sought comment from Twitter on more than 50 specific questions regarding the disclosure.\n\nIn a statement, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN that security and privacy are both longtime priorities for the company. Twitter also said the company provides clear tools for users to control privacy, ad targeting and data sharing, and added that it has created internal workflows to ensure users know that when they cancel their accounts, Twitter will deactivate the accounts and start a deletion process. Twitter declined to say whether it typically completes the process.\n\n\"Mr. Zatko was fired from his senior executive role at Twitter in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance,\" the Twitter spokesperson said. \"What we've seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context. Mr. Zatko's allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be.\"\n\nPeiter \"Mudge\" Zatko was the head of security at Twitter. A well-known \"ethical hacker,\" Zatko also previously held senior roles at Google, Stripe and the US Department of Defense.\n\nSome of Zatko's most damning claims spring from his apparently tense relationship with Parag Agrawal, the company's former chief technology officer who was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. According to the disclosure, Agrawal and his lieutenants repeatedly discouraged Zatko from providing a full accounting of Twitter's security problems to the company's board of directors. The company's executive team allegedly instructed Zatko to provide an oral report of his initial findings on the company's security condition to the board rather than a detailed written account, ordered Zatko to knowingly present cherry-picked and misrepresented data to create the false perception of progress on urgent cybersecurity issues, and went behind Zatko's back to have a third-party consulting firm's report scrubbed to hide the true extent of the company's problems.\n\nThe disclosure is generally much kinder to Dorsey, who hired Zatko and whom Zatko believes wanted to see the problems within the company fixed. But it does depict him as extremely disengaged in his final months leading Twitter -- so much so that some senior staff even considered the possibility he was sick.\n\nCNN has reached out to Dorsey for comment. A person familiar with Zatko's tenure at Twitter told CNN the company investigated several claims he brought forward around the time he was fired, and ultimately found them unpersuasive; the person added that Zatko at times lacked understanding of Twitter's FTC obligations.\n\nZatko believes his firing was in retaliation for his sounding the alarm about the company's security problems.\n\nThe scathing disclosure, which totals around 200 pages, including supporting exhibits -- was sent last month to a number of US government agencies and congressional committees, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The existence and details of the disclosure have not previously been reported. CNN obtained a copy of the disclosure from a senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill. The SEC, DOJ and FTC declined to comment; the Senate Intelligence Committee, which received a copy of the report, is taking the disclosure seriously and is setting a meeting to discuss the allegations, according to Rachel Cohen, a committee spokesperson.\n\nThe claims I've received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and also received the report, vowed to investigate \"and take further steps as needed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations.\"\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, the same panel's top Republican and an avid Twitter user, also expressed deep concerns about the allegations in a statement to CNN.\n\n\"Take a tech platform that collects massive amounts of user data, combine it with what appears to be an incredibly weak security infrastructure and infuse it with foreign state actors with an agenda, and you've got a recipe for disaster,\" Grassley said. \"The claims I've received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns as well as privacy issues, and they must be investigated further.\"\n\nThe FTC should investigate the claims, and impose fines and individual liability on specific Twitter executives if a probe finds they were responsible for security lapses, Sen. Richard Blumenthal wrote to the agency in a letter on Tuesday obtained by CNN.\n\nThe letter by Blumenthal — who chairs the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection — highlights the pressure Twitter now faces from Washington as a result of the disclosure.\n\n\"If the Commission does not vigorously oversee and enforce its orders, they will not be taken seriously and these dangerous breaches will continue,\" Blumenthal wrote.\n\nZatko may be eligible for a monetary award from the US government as a result of his whistleblower activities. \"Original, timely and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action\" by the SEC can earn whistleblowers up to a 30% cut of agency fines related to the action if the penalties amount to more than $1 million, the SEC has said. The SEC has awarded more than $1 billion to nearly 300 whistleblowers since 2012.\n\nTye told CNN that Zatko filed his disclosure to the SEC \"to help the agency enforce the laws,\" and to gain federal whistleblower protections. \"The prospect of a reward was not a factor in Mudge's decision, and in fact he didn't even know about the reward program when he decided to become a lawful whistleblower.\"\n\nThe Whistleblower\n\nZatko first came to national attention in 1998 when he took part in the first congressional hearings on cybersecurity.\n\n\"All my life, I've been about finding places where I can go and make a difference. I've done that through the security field. That's my main lever,\" he told CNN in an interview earlier this month.\n\nJUST WATCHED Twitter whistleblower was on CNN 22 years ago. Here's what he had to say Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Twitter whistleblower was on CNN 22 years ago. Here's what he had to say 03:22\n\nThe events leading to his decision to become a whistleblower began before he worked at Twitter, with a devastating hack in 2020 in which the Twitter accounts of some of the world's most famous people, including then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, Kim Kardashian and Musk, were compromised. Twitter told CNN that in response to the incident, the company began compartmentalizing access to customer support tools.\n\nAfter the attack, Dorsey recruited Zatko, a well-known \"ethical hacker\" turned cybersecurity insider and executive who previously held senior roles at Google, Stripe and the US Department of Defense, and who told CNN that he'd been offered a senior, day-one cyber position in the Biden administration.\n\nZatko, center, was among a group of hackers who testified before Congress on cybersecurity in 1998.\n\nWhat Zatko says he found was a company with extraordinarily poor security practices, including giving thousands of the company's employees — amounting to roughly half the company's workforce — access to some of the platform's critical controls. His disclosure describes his overall findings as \"egregious deficiencies, negligence, willful ignorance, and threats to national security and democracy.\"\n\nAfter the January 6 insurrection , Zatko was concerned about the possibility someone within Twitter who sympathized with the insurrectionists could try to manipulate the company's platform, according to his disclosure. He sought to clamp down on internal access that allows Twitter engineers to make changes to the platform, known as the \"production environment.\"\n\nBut, the disclosure says, Zatko soon learned \"it was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did.... Nobody knew where data lived or whether it was critical, and all engineers had some form of critical access to the production environment.\" Twitter also lacked the ability to hold workers accountable for information security lapses because it has little control or visibility into employees' individual work computers, Zatko claims, citing internal cybersecurity reports estimating that 4 in 10 devices do not meet basic security standards.\n\n[I]t was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did. From Zatko's disclosure\n\nTwitter's flimsy server infrastructure is a separate yet equally serious vulnerability, the disclosure claims. About half of the company's 500,000 servers run on outdated software that does not support basic security features such as encryption for stored data or regular security updates by vendors, according to the letter to regulators and a February email Zatko wrote to Patrick Pichette, a Twitter board member, that is included in the disclosure.\n\nThe company also lacks sufficient redundancies and procedures to restart or recover from data center crashes, Zatko's disclosure says, meaning that even minor outages of several data centers at the same time could knock the entire Twitter service offline, perhaps for good.\n\nTwitter did not respond to questions about the risk of data center outages, but told CNN that people on Twitter's engineering and product teams are authorized to access the production environment if they have a specific business justification for doing so. Twitter's employees use devices overseen by other IT and security teams with the power to prevent a device from connecting to sensitive internal systems if it is running outdated software, Twitter added.\n\nThe company also said it uses automated checks to ensure laptops running outdated software cannot access the production environment, and that employees may only make changes to Twitter's live product after the code meets certain record-keeping and review requirements.\n\nTwitter has internal security tools that are tested by the company regularly, and every two years by external auditors, according to the person familiar with Zatko's tenure at the company. The person added that some of Zatko's statistics surrounding device security lacked credibility and were derived by a small team that did not properly account for Twitter's existing security procedures.\n\nBut Twitter's security concerns had come to light prior to 2020. In 2010, the FTC filed a complaint against Twitter for its mishandling of users' private information and the issue of too many employees having access to Twitter's central controls. The complaint resulted in an FTC consent order finalized the following year in which Twitter vowed to clean up its act, including by creating and maintaining \"a comprehensive information security program.\"\n\nZatko alleges that despite the company's claims to the contrary, it had \"never been in compliance\" with what the FTC demanded more than 10 years ago. As a result of its alleged failures to address vulnerabilities raised by the FTC as well as other deficiencies, he says, Twitter suffers an \"anomalously high rate of security incidents,\" approximately one per week serious enough to require disclosure to government agencies. \"Based on my professional experience, peer companies do not have this magnitude or volume of incidents,\" Zatko wrote in a February letter to Twitter's board after he was fired by Twitter in January.\n\nThe stakes of Zatko's disclosure are enormous. It could lead to billions of dollars in new fines for Twitter if it's found to have violated its legal obligations, according to Jon Leibowitz, who was chair of the FTC at the time of Twitter's original 2011 consent order.\n\n[I]f there's a violation here — and that's a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order. Jon Leibowitz, former chair of the FTC\n\nThe agency now has another opportunity to show the tech industry it is serious about holding platforms accountable, Leibowitz added, after officials opted not to name top Facebook execs including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg in the FTC's $5 billion privacy settlement with that company in 2019.\n\n\"One of the big disappointments in the Facebook order violation case was that the FTC let executives off the hook; they should've been named,\" Leibowitz told CNN in an interview. \"And if there's a violation here — and that's a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order.\"\n\nTwitter told CNN its FTC compliance record speaks for itself, citing third-party audits filed to the agency under the 2011 consent order in which it said Zatko did not participate. Twitter also said it is in compliance with relevant privacy rules and that it has been transparent with regulators about its efforts to fix any shortcomings in its systems.\n\nZatko's allegations are based in part on a failure to grasp how Twitter's existing programs and processes work to fulfill Twitter's FTC obligations, the person familiar with his tenure told CNN, saying that misunderstanding has prompted him to make inaccurate claims about the company's level of compliance.\n\nForeign threats\n\nTwitter is exceptionally vulnerable to foreign government exploitation in ways that undermine US national security, and the company may even have foreign spies currently on its payroll, the disclosure alleges.\n\nThe whistleblower report says the US government provided specific evidence to Twitter shortly before Zatko's firing that at least one of its employees, perhaps more, were working for another government's intelligence service. The report does not say whether Twitter was already aware or if it subsequently acted on the tip.\n\nParag Agrawal, Twitter's former chief technology officer, was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November.\n\nLast year, prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Agrawal — then Twitter's chief technology officer — proposed to Zatko that Twitter comply with Russian demands that could result in broad-based censorship or surveillance of the platform, Zatko alleges.\n\nThe disclosure does not provide details of Agrawal's suggestion. Last summer, however, Russia passed a law pressuring tech platforms to open local offices in the country or face potential advertising bans, a move western security experts said was intended to give Russia greater leverage over US tech companies.\n\nWhile Agrawal's suggestion was ultimately discarded, it was still an alarming sign of how far Twitter was willing to go in pursuit of growth, according to Zatko.\n\nThe fact that Twitter's current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter's effects on US national security, From Zatko's disclosure\n\n\"The fact that Twitter's current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter's effects on U.S. national security,\" Zatko's disclosure says.\n\nZatko's report is becoming public just two weeks after a former Twitter manager was convicted of spying for Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi case underscores the gravity of the allegations Zatko now levels at Twitter. His report could further inflame bipartisan concerns in Washington about foreign adversaries and the cybersecurity threats they pose to Americans, ranging from the theft of US citizens' data to manipulating US voters or stealing technology and trade secrets.\n\nTwitter did not respond to specific questions about its alleged foreign intelligence vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Musk element\n\nZatko's disclosure comes at a particularly fortuitous moment for Musk, who is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Musk has accused Twitter of lying about the number of spam bots on its platform , an issue that he claims should let him terminate the deal.\n\nWhile the binding acquisition agreement that Musk signed with Twitter in April did not include any bot-related exemptions, the billionaire claims that the number of bots on the platform affect the user experience and that having more bots than previously known could therefore impact the company's long-term value. After Musk moved to terminate the purchase, Twitter responded with a lawsuit alleging that he is using bots as a pretext to get out of a deal over which he now has buyers' remorse following the recent market downturn, and asking a court to force him to close the deal. The case is set to go to trial in Delaware Chancery Court in October.\n\nTwitter employees walk by the company's headquarters in San Francisco.\n\nUser numbers are vital information for any social media business, as advertising revenue depends on how many people could potentially see an ad. But figures about how many users a service has, or how many people actually view a given ad on a site, are notoriously unreliable throughout the tech and media industries due to manipulation and error.\n\nAlone among social media companies, Twitter reports its user numbers to investors and advertisers using a measurement it calls monetizable daily active users, or mDAUs. Its rivals simply count and report all active users; until 2019, Twitter had worked that way as well. But that meant Twitter's figures were subject to significant swings in certain situations, including takedowns of major bot networks. So Twitter switched to mDAUs, which it says counts all users that could be shown an advertisement on Twitter -- leaving all accounts that for some reason can't, for instance because they're known to be bots, in a separate bucket, according to Zatko's disclosure.\n\nThe company has repeatedly reported that less than 5% of its mDAUs are fake or spam accounts, and a person familiar with the matter both affirmed that assessment to CNN this week and pointed to other investor disclosures saying the figure relies on significant judgement that may not accurately reflect reality. But Zatko's disclosure argues that by reporting bots only as a percentage of mDAU, rather than as a percentage of the total number of accounts on the platform, Twitter obscures the true scale of fake and spam accounts on the service, a move Zatko alleges is deliberately misleading.\n\nZatko says he began asking about the prevalence of bot accounts on Twitter in early 2021, and was told by Twitter's head of site integrity that the company didn't know how many total bots are on its platform. He alleges that he came away from conversations with the integrity team with the understanding that the company \"had no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bots,\" in part because if the true number became public, it could harm the company's value and image.\n\nJack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I'm still performing that mission. Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, former Twitter head of security\n\nExperts on inauthentic behavior online say it can be difficult to quantify \"bots\" because there isn't a widely agreed upon definition of the term, and because bad actors constantly change their tactics. There are also many harmless bots on Twitter (and across the internet), such as automated news accounts, and Twitter offers an opt-in feature to allow such accounts to transparently label themselves as automated. Twitter told CNN that the claim it doesn't know how many bots are on its platform lacks context, reiterating that not all bots are bad and adding that to focus on the total number of bots on Twitter would include those the company may have already identified and taken action against. The company also does not believe it can catch every spam account on the platform, Twitter said, which is why it reports its less-than-5% figure, which reflects a manual estimate, in its financial filings.\n\nBut Zatko told CNN he thinks there would still be value in attempting to measure the total number of spam, false or otherwise potentially harmful automated accounts on the platform. \"The executive team, the board, the shareholders and the users all deserve an honest answer as to what it is that they are consuming as far as data and information and content [on the platform ... At least from my point of view, I want to invest in a company where I know what's actually going on because I want to invest strategically in the long-term value of an organization,\" he said.\n\nTwitter says that it allows bots on its platform, but its rules prohibit those that engage in spam or platform manipulation. But, as with all social media platforms' rules, the challenge often lies in enforcing its policies.\n\nElon Musk is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company.\n\nThe company says it regularly challenges, suspends and removes accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation, including typically removing more than one million spam accounts each day. Twitter said the total number of bots on the platform is not a useful number. The company declined to answer questions about the total number of accounts on the platform or the average number of new accounts added on the platform daily as context around its daily bot deletion figure.\n\nBut in casting doubt on Twitter's ability to estimate the true number of fake and spam accounts, Zatko's allegations could provide ammunition to Musk's central claim that the figure is much higher than Twitter has publicly reported.\n\nBy going public, Zatko says, he believes he is doing the job he was hired to do for a platform he says is critical to democracy. \"Jack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter.

The upmarket grocery chain now has the exclusive right to sell products under the Duchy name, and shoppers can find salmon, sausages, milk, carrots and blueberries bearing the \"Waitrose Duchy Organic\" name at its stores.\n\n\"It's turned into a very successful business,\" said Andrew Bloch, a London-based public relations expert. \"You can sense with this brand, it has heart and soul behind it.\"\n\nThe future is uncertain, though. Control of the Duchy Originals brand is up in the air during a period of national mourning culminating in the Queen's state funeral on Monday.\n\n\"We will liaise with the Royal Household on future arrangements when the time is right to do so,\" a spokesperson for Waitrose said.\n\nPackets of Prince Charles' brand of products line shelves at a Waitrose supermarket in central London.\n\nOwnership of Duchy Originals will most likely pass to Charles' eldest son Prince William, who also inherits the separate Duchy of Cornwall estate — worth about £1 billion ($1.2 billion). And while the prince has studied organic farming, he's likely to be less hands-on than his father.\n\n\"He'll be interested, but he'll entrust others to run it,\" said Sally Bedell Smith, a biographer and author of the book \"Charles: The Misunderstood Prince.\"\n\nA passion project\n\nCharles spent decades preaching the benefits of organic farming and protecting the environment, even before such issues became mainstream causes.\n\nIn 1985, he converted Home Farm, near his Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire, into a fully organic system. The Duchy Originals venture emerged five years later.\n\n\"Since the beginning of the 1980s, when I first had responsibility for managing some land in my own right at Highgrove, I have wanted to focus on an approach to food production that avoids the impact of the predominant, conventional system of industrialized agriculture, which, it is increasingly clear to see, is having a disastrous effect on soil fertility, biodiversity and animal and human health,\" Charles told Country Life magazine in 2021.\n\nThe first Duchy Originals product was an oaten biscuit sold in 1992. Initially, items bearing the brand were only found in high-end shops such as Harrods and Fortnum & Mason, though they later expanded into outlets like Waitrose, which caters to wealthier shoppers but has many more locations.\n\nThe business was on rocky ground in its early days, Smith wrote in her book. It took on too much debt, and Duchy Originals had to look for new producers and manufacturers once it became too big to rely solely on Highgrove.\n\nIts fortunes later improved, according to Smith. She reported that when Charles visited the British embassy in Spain in 2004, he burst in with gift-wrapped products, announcing, \"I'm a self-made millionaire, you know!\"\n\nWaitrose steps in\n\nAn ill-fated attempt to expand into the United States, however, combined with the onset of the global financial crisis, pushed the business to the brink of collapse.\n\nFacing millions of pounds in losses in 2009, Charles turned to Waitrose, which threw him a lifeline by agreeing to serve as exclusive distributor.\n\nIt marked the end of the prince's ambitions for a large presence in the US market, but the start of a robust turnaround in the outlook of the business.\n\n\"The Waitrose rescue during the financial crisis in September 2009 was absolutely vital,\" Smith said.\n\nBy 2017, 25 years after the oat biscuit's debut, the line had expanded to 300 products , including fruits, vegetables, meat and beer, and annual sales reached £200 million ($231 million). More than 30 countries around the world, including the United States, Germany, Japan and Australia, have received exports of select products.\n\nPrince Charles and his wife Camilla visit a Waitrose supermarket in central London in 2009.\n\nCharles has access to vast personal wealth through his portfolio of land and property, but he has never directly profited from the Duchy Originals business. All royalties collected from Waitrose have been donated to charitable causes. In its annual report for 2019, the firm said it had raised more than £30 million ($35 million) since striking the licensing deal with Waitrose.\n\n\"It has provided a very substantial income stream into his foundation and has helped to fund his charitable work as well as to promote organic products,\" Smith said.\n\nmedicine as based on \"outright quackery.\" A regulatory agency later said online advertisements for two of the line's herbal medicines Still, the venture hasn't been without controversy. A range of herbal remedies, including the \"Herbals Detox Tincture\" blend of artichoke and dandelion, was accused by an expert on alternativemedicine as based on \"outright quackery.\" A regulatory agency later said online advertisements for two of the line's herbal medicines were misleading and instructed Duchy Originals to change the wording.\n\nWilliam's new venture?\n\nin recent years as Charles prepared to take the throne. In 2020, his team Changes have been underwayin recent years as Charles prepared to take the throne. In 2020, his team said he wouldn't renew the lease on the sprawling Home Farm, but would continue to farm organically at the late Queen's Sandringham Estate in Norfolk that he had started managing in 2017.\n\nObservers now believe William will take the reins of Duchy Originals and its partnership with Waitrose, part of his new responsibilities as the Duke of Cornwall.\n\n\"I think there will be a tension between his new role as King Charles III and what he can and can't do,\" said Bloch, who also has worked on a voluntary basis with Charles' Prince's Trust charity. \"It's likely that Prince William will take over.\"\n\nPrince Charles looks at produce during a reception in 2013 to celebrate the anniversary of Duchy Originals.\n\nIn his first address to the nation as king, Charles acknowledged that his responsibilities will change.\n\n\"It will no longer be possible for me to give so much of my time and energies to the charities and issues for which I care so deeply,\" he said. \"But I know this important work will go on in the trusted hands of others.\"\n\nWilliam spent lots of time on the Highgrove estate growing up and enrolled in an agricultural management course at the University of Cambridge in 2014.

Elon Musk ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nFour years ago, Twitter cofounder and then-CEO Jack Dorsey laid out four key focus areas that would propel the company’s growth. Among them: promoting “healthy conversation” on the platform.\n\nAfter years of criticism for Twitter’s apparent failures to prevent its platform from turning toxic, Dorsey acknowledged the scourge of “abuse, harassment, troll armies,” as well as bots, misinformation campaigns and “increasingly divisive echo chambers” on the social network, and he called on researchers to help improve the situation.\n\n“We think it is a growth vector over the long term, and it’s the right thing to do for the people on Twitter, and also for the world,” Dorsey said on the company’s earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2018 of the focus on the “health” of the platform.\n\nIn the years since, Twitter (TWTR) has made significant progress toward that goal, including banning many accounts promoting abuse and spam, adding labels for false or misleading information, banning the misgendering of transgender people and launching a team dedicated to studying and increasing transparency around the technology that determines what content is promoted on the site. Just last week, Twitter (TWTR) said it would embrace third-party tools for users to help prevent harassment.\n\nBut some who’ve been following the work Twitter has done in recent years worry it could be unraveled now that billionaire Elon Musk has succeeded in his bid to acquire Twitter in a deal worth about $44 billion.\n\nMusk, a controversial Twitter user with a history of erratic behavior on and off the platform, has called for freer speech on the social network and policies that would favor leaving up most tweets and accounts.\n\n“If in doubt, let the speech exist,” Musk said in an on-stage interview at the TED conference earlier this month. “If it’s a gray area, I would say, let the tweet exist. But obviously in the case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, you would not necessarily want to promote that tweet.”\n\nUnder his ownership, Twitter could unwind steps taken in recent years to make the platform more palatable for its most vulnerable users, typically women, the LGBTQ community and people of color, according to safety experts.\n\nBeyond potentially alienating employees who have worked on or support efforts to improve content moderation on the platform, undoing Twitter’s progress on “healthy conversations” also risks losing users at a time when the company has been fighting to reverse sluggish growth. It could also turn off advertisers wary of having their ads run next to harmful content. While Musk has said his bid for Twitter is “not a way to make money,” it is still a business and advertising remains its central revenue driver.\n\nThough smaller than some rival platforms, Twitter also has an outsized influence in the online (and offline) world because it is popular among influential figures in media, politics and entertainment, and because it has often acted as a model for other platforms on how to address thorny harmful content issues. Thus, changes to Twitter’s policies could have broader ripple effects on politics and society.\n\nTwitter has certainly not been perfect on content moderation issues, but as Kirsten Martin, professor of technology ethics at Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business, put it: “Twitter has consistently strived to be a responsible social media company through not only their content moderation but also their hires in the area of machine learning ethics.”\n\n“I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter’s values,” Martin added.\n\nTwitter and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA billionaire with a history of trolling\n\nMusk has a mixed reputation in the tech industry. He is undoubtedly one of the most ambitious and successful innovators and entrepreneurs of this era, but he is also someone who has courted controversy, often from his own Twitter profile, where he has 83 million followers.\n\nOver the years, Musk has used Twitter to make misleading claims about the Covid-19 pandemic, to make a baseless accusation that a man who helped rescue children from a cave in Thailand is a sexual predator, to mock people who display their gender pronouns on the platform and to make countless jokes involving the numbers 420 and 69. He has also tweeted a (since deleted) photo comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler and he has compared Twitter’s new CEO Parag Agrawal to Joseph Stalin.\n\nElon Musk is one of the highest profile but most controversial users on Twitter, where he has more than 83 million followers. Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nMusk and others have pointed out that most of Twitter’s board has little experience actually using the platform. The same cannot be said of Musk, an avid Twitter user with a rabid following who well understands the dynamics of the platform. Still, Musk’s experience of using Twitter as an ultra-rich, White man, is inherently different than that of most users, and especially those who are women or from other marginalized communities Twitter has tried to protect and who now may be at risk if its moderation policies are rolled back.\n\n“Any time somebody says free speech, it always means free speech for the powerful. It does not mean free speech for the less powerful,” said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter engineering manager who started its product safety and security team and left the company in 2015. “[Musk] says he wants to make it a free speech platform. What he wants is a platform to say what he wants — and wants other people like him to say what they want — without any accountability.”\n\nFor his part, Musk said on Twitter Monday: “I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.”\n\nProminent users like game developer Brianna Wu have for years spoken out about how online Twitter mobs can spiral from online hate speech to real-world harm. She now worries the progress she and other users have pushed for on Twitter will be reversed.\n\n“There have been so many hard fought battles over these [safety] policies behind the scenes,” Wu, who now serves as executive director of a PAC for progressives, told CNN Business. “I am extremely concerned Musk is going to roll back all the hard work that’s been done to combat hate speech on the platform.”\n\nMusk’s plan for Twitter\n\nAt the TED conference earlier this month, Musk presented his broad strokes vision for Twitter, including making its algorithm public to increase transparency around its decisions about content enforcement and promotion — a move that experts say it is far from a silver bullet. Moreover, Musk said Twitter would be more “reluctant to delete things” and “very cautious with permanent bans.”\n\n“My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,” Musk said.\n\nMany followers of the company have speculated that if his takeover bid succeeds, Musk could restore the Twitter account of former President Donald Trump, who was banned early last year following the insurrection at the US Capitol. Such a move could have huge implications for the upcoming 2024 presidential election as Twitter was a key tool for Trump to rally his base, promote political allies and deride critics and spread false and misleading claims.\n\n“If Musk buys Twitter, then he will surely return Trump to the platform, opening the door for a viable 2024 run,” Joan Donovan, research director at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, said on Twitter Monday before the deal was announced.\n\nTrump, for his part, told Fox News Monday that he is not planning to rejoin Twitter, if invited, and will instead start using his own app Truth Social (Trump has only posted on the site once, back in February). “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on TRUTH,” Trump told Fox.\n\nDonovan also noted that under Musk’s leadership, Twitter could “further become a terrain of culture wars. With a mandate for ‘free speech,’ the kind of harassment that content moderation tampers will go into overdrive targeting lgbtq groups, women, BIPOC, and anyone else fighting for civil rights.”\n\nMusk said in a statement Monday that he also wants “to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”\n\nA platform with more work to do\n\nEach of the major social media platforms have faced pressure from lawmakers, researchers and the public to do more to crack down on abuse, harassment and misinformation, and have taken different approaches with varying degrees of success. Twitter has in many cases been seen as a leader in the industry in terms of how it handles problematic content, and in being transparent about its approach and the success of its efforts. Most notably, Twitter was the first of the major platforms to ban Trump for violating its policy on inciting violence, pushing other platforms to follow suit.\n\n“It’s not great today, but it’s better,” Wu said. “I think people don’t understand how much we have to lose.”\n\nTwitter's board is said to be nearing an agreement to sell the social media company to Elon Musk. Adobe Stock\n\nAnti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said he’s hopeful that Twitter remains a place where people can speak freely while also feeling safe. “When I say safe and secure, I mean from bigotry, and the kind of terrible trolling that makes it too toxic for so many of us,” he added.\n\nOthers, however, are less optimistic. Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said that Musk has a “fairly unsophisticated view” of the factors a platform must consider when it “provides access for bad actors to normal people.”\n\nHarmful content can have real-world consequences — the Myanmar Genocide and the Capitol Riot are two of the most egregious examples, but a deluge of harassment and veiled threats of offline harm can severely impact users on an individual basis, as well — and social media platforms face a difficult balancing act in considering how to allow users to speak as freely as possible while also protecting them from such harms.\n\nWhile Musk has said he wants to allow “all legal speech on Twitter,” the lines for what is legal can be blurry and vary from country to country — and may also be soon to change, as regulators home in on the harms social media platforms can have on users, especially young people, and civic processes.\n\n“[Twitter has] started to talk about the morality of what they do, in a way that implies that they get it,” Ahmed said. But with Musk, “it feels like … we have to go and re-educate another kind of billionaire, libertarian, man-child that [Twitter] is the real world … I would hope he can see the difference between you know, being a douche and being dangerous.”\n\nSome experts also question whether a less-moderated platform would be a sustainable business. Several new platforms launched in recent years have promised to take a less restrictive approach to content moderation, often in hopes of attracting right-leaning users frustrated with the Big Tech giants, but have largely failed to gain significant adoption. The most recent example: Trump’s Truth Social. Online advertisers are also hesitant to have their ads run alongside dangerous or controversial content.\n\n“The general public doesn’t want to see more conspiracy theories and more harassment and more hate speech,” said Karen Kornbluh, a senior fellow and director of the Digital Innovation and Democracy Initiative at the German Marshall Fund. “There’s this [disconnect] between what he’s saying he wants to do [to loosen content restrictions], which sounds like a culture war initiative, versus saying that he wants to increase their profits. It doesn’t seem to add up.”", "authors": ["Sara Ashley O'Brien Clare Duffy", "Sara Ashley O'Brien", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/investing/inflation-companies-prices/index.html", "title": "Big companies aren't shy about raising prices - CNN", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nConsumers are feeling the pinch from inflation, and that will likely continue for the foreseeable future. That’s because major companies have been raising prices to protect their profit margins — and they are showing no signs of changing course anytime soon.\n\nCompanies in a variety of industries have been talking about their need to raise prices, not necessarily in response to higher demand, but in order to push profits — which surged in 2021 — even higher this year.\n\nThe cost of oil and many other raw materials are undeniably higher, so some price increases are necessary for businesses to keep reporting strong enough earnings to please Wall Street.\n\nThe implication: Corporate America doesn’t seem terribly concerned that consumers are going to suddenly stop spending. So they are going to find out just how high they can lift prices before shoppers cry uncle.\n\nEarnings calls with analysts during the past few months have been filled with statements from executives about how rising prices have helped boost bottom lines.\n\nIncreased commodities costs — for oil, copper, iron, wheat, corn and many other essential supplies — have led big businesses to boost prices to lift profits.\n\nRaising prices across the board\n\nCompanies realize they can get away with continued price hikes, in part because the job market is so strong and wages are rising.\n\nTJX (TJX) CEO Ernie Herrman told investors during a February earnings call that there have been “price increases across the board.” So far, executives at Marshalls, T.J. Maxx and HomeGoods have said, “the pricing strategy is working.”\n\nSome companies in service-related businesses are raising prices, too. Concert promoter and ticket seller Live Nation (LYV), a firm that is often criticized by consumers for high prices, said that fans of live events should expect ticket costs to climb even further.\n\nLive Nation CEO Michael Rapino said in a recent presentation to analysts that the company is asked about inflation and ticket prices, “all the time.”\n\nBut Rapino argued that “this is a business that is underpriced.” He cited the fact that ticket resellers in the secondary market are often able to command “a high premium for those tickets and experiences” — even after Live Nation has raised its own prices.\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) CEO Frank Del Rio said expenses are up, and his company is passing the costs onto customers.\n\n“We didn’t drop prices. And that’s by design because that’s just not what we do,” Del Rio said during the company’s latest earnings call last month.\n\n“Similar to all other industries, we are experiencing upward pressure on costs in certain areas such as food, perishables and other supplies that are impacted by the global supply chain constraints,” Del Rio said, adding that last summer, “I remember calling my brand presidents into a meeting and asking them to raise prices.”\n\nSome companies pushed back against the notion that they are raising prices simply because they can.\n\nPeanut butter and jelly giant Smucker (SJM), which also owns Folgers and sells Dunkin’ branded coffee in stores, defended its price hikes for coffee during its earnings conference call Tuesday.\n\n“We have seen higher costs,” said CEO Mark Smucker in response to questions about strong profits for the coffee division. “We have been very diligent and prudent in adjusting our prices throughout the year for inflation. And we have been very prudent in how we have taken those and are really just following inflation and making sure that our price increases are truly justified from a cost standpoint.”\n\nSPAM owner Hormel Foods (HRL) is also trying to navigate the higher inflationary environment. That means higher prices for its products.\n\n“As we’re sitting here today, you’ve got, obviously, breast meat prices at significantly higher prices. You’ve got corn and soy at very high prices. So there’s just a lot of moving parts and a lot of volatility,” said CEO James Snee during Hormel’s earnings call with analysts Tuesday.\n\nHigher commodity costs are one reason why prices keep going up\n\nEnergy drink maker Monster Beverage (MNST) has also lifted prices. Monster chairman and co-CEO Rodney Sacks read a long list on the company’s earnings call of all the things that are costing the company more — costs that it is passing on to consumers.\n\n“The company experienced increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing as well as the cost of importing aluminum cans,” Sacks said.\n\nHe added that Monster also “experienced increased ingredient and other input costs,” including higher shipping, labor, trucking and fuel expenses.\n\nThe price of just about everything is going up, including resin, a substance used in plastic. That’s a main reason why Newell Brands (NWL), the owner of Rubbermaid, has been lifting prices as well.\n\n“We expect this to be another year of high inflation,” said Newell Brands chief financial officer Christopher Peterson on the company’s earnings call last month.\n\nPeterson said that all of its business units are “implementing further pricing increases into 2022” after raising prices last year. He added that higher costs for ocean freight and wages will be “major sources of inflation this year.”\n\nBucking the trend\n\nStill, not all companies are looking to pounce and raise prices.\n\nTop retailer Walmart (WMT), which has a reputation for discounts and price rollbacks, said in its last earnings report that it is committed to keeping prices low for its consumers.\n\nThat’s not just corporate altruism, it’s a main selling point to get shoppers in the door.\n\n“We use rollbacks to communicate not only the reality that prices are coming down at some places but the emotion or perception we want customers to have about us being there for them and earning their trust during a period of time like this,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on a conference call.", "authors": ["Paul R.

As we know, he has funded Chelsea to the tune of billions of pounds and has a £1.5 billion ($1.98 billion) loan that Chelsea currently owes to Abramovich,\" he said.\n\n\"We don't currently know where the money to pay players is coming from -- whether it just be coming from kind of day-to-day trading the business i.e. broadcast revenue, commercial revenue. Obviously, matchday revenue contributes to that, and we know that no new tickets can be sold, no new merchandise can be sold that benefits either the club or Abramovich -- it can only benefit the retailers.\"\n\nThis could have significant implications for the club, which is already seeing sponsors considering their contracts with Chelsea.\n\nChelsea's shirt sponsor Three, the mobile phone and telecommunications company, said in a statement that they have asked the club to temporarily suspend its sponsorship of the club. The company had told CNN earlier on Thursday that it was reviewing its position with Chelsea after the UK government sanctioned owner Roman Abramovich.\n\n\"In light of the government's recently announced sanctions, we have requested Chelsea Football Club temporarily suspend our sponsorship of the club, including the removal of our brand from shirts and around the stadium until further notice,\" Three said in a statement.\n\n\"We recognise that this decision will impact the many Chelsea fans who follow their team passionately. However, we feel that given the circumstances, and the Government sanction that is in place, it is the right thing to do.\"\n\nMeanwhile, automotive giant Hyundai, Chelsea's official partner since 2018, said it is \"assessing the situation\" following the news.\n\n\"Hyundai has become one of the strongest partners in football over the years and the company supports the sport to be a force for good. We are currently assessing the situation with Chelsea FC,\" a Hyundai spokesperson told CNN.\n\nHyundai's logo appears on the shirt sleeves for the men's and women's teams through to the Academy teams, and the current four-deal is due to come to an end this year.\n\n\"If Mr. Abramovich can't finance the club, and you've also got other sources of commercial revenue coming into the club that are now going to start to basically dry out given the sanctions imposed, the long term implications are very significant if a sale isn't made,\" Peppi said.\n\nThough Chelsea could negotiate with potential buyers, the club can't be sold until a special license is granted, he added.\n\n\"If they're not generating any commercial matchday revenue, and they're not going to be able to draw on shareholder loans, where's the money going to come from to prop up the club?\n\n\"I anticipate a new owner will be found. But it's going to be a far different kind of sale process than it looked like it was going to be, even last week.\"\n\nThe sanctions will also have implications for Chelsea's players, Peppi said.\n\n\"The immediate short term players whose contracts are running down means that those players are entitled to essentially leave on a free transfer at the end at the end of the season because they're out of contract.\"\n\nFor players with contracts beyond the end of the season, nothing will change until May 31, Peppi said.\n\nThe sanctions will have a significant impact on Chelsea FC.\n\nIn the long term, he said, \"it goes to this wider, wider theme around the kind of cultural political, social impact of football as being way more powerful than it ever has been.\n\n\"And are players going to want to sign for Chelsea -- for a club like Chelsea, a club like Newcastle -- where they know the volatility of the situation with regards to the ownership structure of the football club?\"\n\nChelsea manager Thomas Tuchel says he isn't worried about the recent sanctions imposed on Abramovich by the UK government but acknowledged the \"noise\" that surrounds the team.\n\n\"I'm not sure I am concerned but I am aware of it. It changes almost every day. ... I'm still happy to be here and still happy to be manager of a strong football team.\"\n\nBritish Member of Parliament Chris Bryant has previously called for Abramovich to be stripped of his ownership of Chelsea. Speaking in the House of Commons in February, Bryant quoted a leaked 2019 UK government document that identified Abramovich's alleged \"links to the Russian state and his public association with corrupt activity and practices.\" Abramovich has always denied being linked to Putin and rejected claims that any of his activities merited government sanctions.\n\nAbramovich is worth is an estimated £9.4 billion ($12.36 billion), according to the UK government.\n\nThe UK is \"absolutely determined\" to sanction Russian oligarchs, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said this month, adding that the UK was working through \"a further list\" of oligarchs to sanction.\n\n\"There is nowhere for any of Putin's cronies to hide,\" Truss continued.\n\nSeparately, Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial museum in Jerusalem, announced on Thursday it had suspended its \"strategic partnership\" with Abramovich, after announcing last month that the billionaire had pledged funding to its \"endeavors in the areas of Holocaust research and remembrance.\"\n\n\"In light of recent developments, Yad Vashem has decided to suspend the strategic partnership with Mr. Roman Abramovich,\" the museum tweeted\n\nThe donation would have helped support Yad Vashem's International Institute for Holocaust Research for five years and build it a new building.

Tennis has treated me more generously than I ever would have dreamt, and now I must recognize when it is time to end my competitive career.\"\n\nSTAY UP-TO-DATE: Subscribe to our Sports newsletter now!\n\nAfter two knee surgeries in 2020, Federer attempted to come back last year and reached the fourth round of the French Open before withdrawing and then the quarterfinals at Wimbledon where he was easily defeated by Hubert Hurkacz 6-3, 7-6, 6-0.\n\nShortly after that, Federer revealed he had another setback with the knee and required a third surgery which would keep him out of training for months. Though there had been hopeful signals that Federer would play some competitive matches this fall as he prepared for 2023, word began to circulate at the recent U.S. Open that he was still having problems getting up to full speed.\n\nThe Laver Cup, a team event featuring Europe vs. the rest of the world, will be a fitting way to end Federer’s competitive career. Federer and his management team were crucial in launching the event in 2017, which has featured some memorable matchups like Federer playing doubles alongside his rival and friend Rafael Nadal.\n\nThough Federer will not finish his career as the player with the most Grand Slam titles – Nadal has 22 and Novak Djokovic passed him with his 21st at Wimbledon this year – his popularity and impact on the sport goes beyond just numbers. Federer's mere presence packed stadiums around the globe and was ranked as the highest-paid athlete in the world as recently as 2020 by Forbes Magazine despite playing very few matches.\n\nBut Federer’s tennis career will stand the test of time as well. In addition to his 103 ATP titles, his dominance of the sport between 2003 and 2009 is almost unmatched in history. During that span, he won 15 of the 26 Grand Slams played including five straight Wimbledons and five consecutive U.S. Opens. From 2004-07, he won 315 of 339 matches. His streak of 23 consecutive Grand Slam semifinals from 2004 Wimbledon to the 2010 Australian Open is likely to never be overtaken.\n\nThough Federer’s success rate in the Grand Slams dipped for a period in the early 2010s, he returned to No. 1 in 2017 after beating Nadal in five sets in the Australian Open final and adding his record eighth Wimbledon title later that year. Federer’s 2018 Australian Open victory over Marin Cilic was his 20th major title and, as it turns out, his last.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/15/tennis/roger-federer-retirement-announcement-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Roger Federer announces his retirement from the ATP Tour and ...", "text": "(CNN) Roger Federer has announced that he will retire from the ATP Tour and grand slams following the Laver Cup next week in London.\n\n\"I am 41 years old. I have played more than 1500 matches over 24 years. Tennis has treated me more generously than I ever would have dreamt, and now I must recognize when it is time to end my competitive career,\" the 20-time grand slam winner said in an Instagram post.\n\nThe last few years of Federer's career have been marred by a series of injuries, as he underwent two knee surgeries in 2020 and another after he was defeated by Hubert Hurkacz in the 2021 Wimbledon quarterfinal -- his last competitive match to date.\n\n\"As many of you know, the past three years have presented me with challenges in the form of injuries and surgeries,\" he said. \"I've worked hard to return to full competitive form. But I also know my body's capacities and limits, and its message to me lately has been clear.\"\n\nFederer's long career coincided with those of 22-time grand slam winner Rafael Nadal and 21-time grand slam winner Novak Djokovic, with whom he dominated men's tennis for the last two decades.\n\n\"I would also like to thank my competitors on the court,\" Federer said.\n\n\"I was lucky enough to play so many epic matches that I will never forget. We battled fairly, with passion and intensity, and I always tried my best to respect the history of the game. I feel extremely grateful.\"\n\nNadal took to Twitter to commemorate his great rival and friend: \"Dear Roger,my friend and rival. I wish this day would have never come. It's a sad day for me personally and for sports around the world. It's been a pleasure but also an honor and privilege to share all these years with you, living so many amazing moments on and off the court.\n\n\"We will have many more moments to share together in the future, there are still lots of things to do together, we know that ... I'll see you in London.\"\n\nDespite playing alongside two of the greatest players of all time, Federer has still broken multiple records, including becoming the oldest ever world No. 1 at age 36 and remaining at the top of the rankings for a record 237 consecutive weeks.\n\nAmong his many accolades, Federer won a career grand slam: the Australian Open six times, the French Open once, the US Open five times, and Wimbledon -- the tournament with which he was synonymous -- a record eight times.\n\nHe also won 103 ATP titles -- the second most in the Open era behind only Jimmy Connors -- a record six ATP finals, the Davis Cup and a gold medal at the 2008 Olympics in the men's doubles alongside Stan Wawrinka.\n\n\"This is a bittersweet decision, because I will miss everything the tour has given me,\" he said.\n\n\"But at the same time, there is so much to celebrate. I consider myself one of the most fortunate people on Earth. I was given a special talent to play tennis, and I did it a level that I never imagined, for much longer than I ever thought possible.\"\n\nFederer won Wimbledon eight times.\n\n\"The last 24 years on tour have been an incredible adventure. While it sometimes feels like it went by in 24 hours, it has also been so deep and magical that it seems as if I've already lived a full lifetime.\n\n\"I have had the immense fortune to play in front of you in over 40 different countries. I have laughed and cried, felt joy and pain, and most of all I have felt incredibly alive.\"\n\nAs well as thanking his fans, Federer thanked his team, sponsors, parents, sister, wife and children, and recalled his time growing up in Basel, Switzerland.\n\n\"When my love of tennis started, I was a ball kid in my hometown of Basel. I used to watch the players with a sense of wonder. They were like giants to me and I began to dream. My dreams led me to work harder and I started to believe in myself,\" he said.\n\n\"Some success brought me confidence and I was on my way to the most amazing journey that has led to this day. So, I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart, to everyone around the world who has helped make the dreams of a young Swiss ball kid come true.\"\n\nAlmost as soon as Federer announced his retirement, tributes began rolling in from the tennis world.\n\nNewly crowned US Open champion and men's world No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz, who was two months old when Federer won his first grand slam, tweeted a broken heart emoji, as did two-time grand slam winner Garbiñe Muguruza.\n\nRoger... 💔 — Carlos Alcaraz (@carlosalcaraz) September 15, 2022\n\n\"It's been a privilege to witness your journey and see you become a champion in every sense of the word. We will so miss the sight of you gracing our courts, but all we can say for now is thank you, for the memories and joy you have given to so many.\"\n\nOn his own terms\n\nFederer's retirement announcement arrived a month after Serena Williams also declared her intention \"to evolve away\" from the sport, signaling an almost simultaneous end to eras in which they have shaped men's and women's tennis.\n\nWilliams' likely swansong unfolded at the US Open -- in her home country and at the site of her first grand slam triumph -- but Federer told CNN's Christina Macfarlane in 2019 that he had no such specific plans.\n\n\"I think it will all come down to is it the body, is it the family, is it the mind, is it a morning when I wake up, how will it happen?\" he said.\n\n\"The day that it happens, maybe that is the end or maybe I say I've got a few more tournaments left in me, I don't know. And then maybe that one tournament that I think it could be is way too far away and then you just can't make it there ... Wimbledon stands out as a place but there are actually many others.\"\n\nFederer won his 20th and final grand slam at the 2018 Australian Open.\n\nDue to injuries, Federer was absent from this year's main draw at Wimbledon for the first time since 1998, and he will finish his career at the Laver Cup -- a tournament which he was a driving force behind in which six players from Europe play six players from the rest of the world.\n\n\"I would like to go out on my terms,\" he added in 2019. \"I don't have the fairytale ending in my head saying it has to be another title somewhere and then I have to announce it big and say, 'By the way, that was it, guys.' I don't have to have it that way.\n\n\"The expectations from the media is that it all has to end so perfectly and I've given up a long time ago. I just think as long as I'm healthy and I'm enjoying myself at the very end, I know it's going to be emotional anyway.\"", "authors": ["Issy Ronald"], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/columnist/dan-wolken/2022/09/15/roger-federer-retires-grand-slam/10389546002/", "title": "Roger Federer retired after making tennis look perfect in his career", "text": "By the 2009 French Open, Roger Federer was already considered by many observers to be the greatest tennis player of all time. With 13 Grand Slam titles already and plenty of good years ahead, it seemed like a formality that he would win two more and pass his idol, Pete Sampras.\n\nWhether Federer could win in Paris, though, was very much in question.\n\nWhen Federer woke up on June 1 of that year, however, things had changed significantly. Rafael Nadal, the rival he couldn’t beat at Roland Garros, had suffered a stunning fourth-round defeat to Robin Soderling. Federer was suddenly staring at the biggest chance he would ever have to complete the career Grand Slam.\n\nFEDERER RETIRES: 20-time Grand Slam champion makes it official\n\nNEWSLETTER: Get the latest sports news straight to your inbox\n\nBut exactly two hours into his fourth-round match against Tommy Haas, it looked like an opportunity lost. Down two sets and serving at 3-4, 30-40, Federer was a point away from being broken and likely finished in the next few minutes.\n\nAs Federer’s second serve kicked out wide, he immediately moved to the backhand corner, anticipating that Haas’ return would come back cross-court. But instead of playing to a safe target or drawing Haas into a rally, a backpedaling Federer launched himself off the red dirt and whipped an inside-out forehand — the most dangerous shot he could have chosen at that moment — toward the opposite sideline where Haas had left just a sliver of an opening. It caught the line by the smallest of margins. He went on to win the game, the match and the tournament -- a scene of joy and relief that only Federer could have authored.\n\nIt is impossible to know how much hinged on that shot, how many demons Federer might have battled if he had not made it. But its mere existence and the daring spirit from which it was born explains what it was like to watch Federer on a tennis court for two decades.\n\nWhether or not you consider Federer the greatest of all time, there has never been a player who conjured a sense of history with every swing of his racquet, whose game was so beautiful it could have been painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and whose mentality was so audacious that the difference between brilliance and crushing defeat was often no more than an inch.\n\nFederer announced Thursday that he is retiring from professional tennis after next week’s Laver Cup, a glorified exhibition that will likely put him on a court with Nadal one last time. It will also allow fans to give Federer the proper send-off he didn’t get a year ago at Wimbledon when he lost his final competitive set to Hubert Hurkacz, 6-0, and then submitted to a third knee surgery in the span of 18 months.\n\nSince then, there has been no expectation that Federer would be able to return at age 41 and play at a level representative of his greatness. Even if everything had gone perfect in his recovery, playing in 2023 was going to be little more than a goodbye tour. Still it feels wrong that Federer, perhaps the most universally beloved athlete of the modern era, will not even get that much.\n\nBut tennis doesn’t lend itself to fairytale endings, save for a declining Sampras making magic one last time at the 2002 U.S. Open and never stepping foot on the court again.\n\nMore often, the all-time greats have to accept some level of indignity in their final act. Bjorn Borg lost two consecutive Grand Slam finals to John McEnroe in 1981 and decided he had lost his passion. Andre Agassi poured everything out at age 36 to upset Marcos Baghdatis in his final U.S. Open and had nothing left in the tank for the next round against the unknown Benjamin Becker. Steffi Graf could not finish a match against Amy Frazier in San Diego due to an injured hamstring and announced her retirement a week later.\n\nAnd as we just saw the U.S. Open, Serena Williams turned back the clock enough to make the third round but ultimately walked off the court feeling as if she had let victory slip away against Ajla Tomljanovic.\n\nIt feels like a jolt to everything we have come to expect from tennis that Williams and Federer are walking away together. Though Williams had already won six Grand Slam titles by the time Federer won his first in 2003, they towered over their respective tours concurrently for two decades, even during periods when they didn’t win everything in sight. It is not often that you get to see all-time great athletes make the full journey from teenage emergence to dominance to parenthood to inevitable athletic mortality, but they made the aging process look far more aspirational than anyone who had come before them.\n\nThere were surely be a lot of hand-wringing in the coming weeks about what it means for tennis that these global superstars who drew millions to stadiums all over the world are leaving the scene. The reality is that Federer and Williams, along with Nadal and Novak Djokovic, have been at this longer than anyone could have reasonably expected. There may be a period of transition, and it may be generations before someone can match their achievements, but the sport does not stop.\n\nAs we saw at the U.S. Open with 19-year old Carlos Alcaraz winning the title after epic battles with Jannik Sinner and Frances Tiafoe along with Iga Swiatek asserting her dominance on the women’s side, there are plenty of exciting young stars ready to take the baton.\n\nWhether it’s them or somebody else coming in the future, we will see players who push the boundaries of the game exactly like Federer and Williams did. That's how tennis works, a constant evolution of technology, athleticism and power that demands more and more of players who want to win at the highest level.\n\nWhat will be more difficult for the next generate to recreate is the feeling that Williams and Federer generated when they were on the court. They didn’t play matches as much as they were main characters in a human drama where their vulnerabilities were as much a part of the story as their one-of-a-kind talent.\n\nThere is an alternate world in which Federer completes the career Grand Slam in 2009, surpasses Sampras at Wimbledon for the all-time Slam record and then retires shortly thereafter. It would have been arguably the most dominant run in the history of men’s tennis, winning 90 percent of his matches over a six-year period while accomplishing practically everything he possibly could have in the game.\n\nBut Federer was not afraid of failing or seeing his dominance wane. It only challenged him to keep evolving and getting better, even though the next seven years of his career were marked by some painful losses to his rivals, matches he failed to finish and missed opportunities to add more majors.\n\nAt the time, Federer’s 2012 Wimbledon title seemed like a last hurrah. In 2015, he lost close matches to Djokovic in the Wimbledon and U.S. Open finals and seemed unlikely to ever hold another major trophy. Then in 2016, he shut it down after Wimbledon to take care of a back injury.\n\nThe odds seemed long that he could come back and be a factor at age 36. Instead, not only did he come back, he won three more Grand Slams, returned to No. 1 in 2018 and beat Nadal in five of their final six matches. And he did it because, even after all the winning and success, Federer kept refining his game, kept making adjustments to his backhand and kept working for solutions against players that gave him fits.\n\nEvery part of that journey made Federer magnetic; not just the ease with which he won but the devastation of so many losses — perhaps none more than the 2019 Wimbledon final against Djokovic when he held two match points in the fifth set, missed an ace by millimeters and then failed to close out the title.\n\nThose moments may very well cost him the moniker of greatest ever. But even someone who knows nothing about tennis could watch Federer and see the artistry and genius at play.\n\nWhen Federer came along, the men's game was struggling. It was all about big serves and quick points, a paint-by-numbers game that had lost too much creativity and skill.\n\nFederer flipped that on its head. He didn’t have the fastest serve, but he had the most lethal. He shanked more balls than any other top player, squandered countless break points and often put himself in situations where he had to dig out of trouble. What he had was a variety of shotmaking like nobody else, a backhand slice that he turned into a weapon and a willingness to come forward for volleys that was uncommon for his era. And when Federer got a forehand to hit, he really hit it -- a signature shot with his eyes locked onto the contact point that everyone who picked up a racquet in the last 20 years has tried to recreate.\n\nFederer did not always play perfect tennis, but it always looked like perfection. And in the moments that required him to be great — like that 2009 French Open — he so often found the right balance between brutality and grace.\n\nFederer will be missed, not just by tennis but everyone who remembers what he was like at his best. Whether or not the numbers say he was the greatest player ever is irrelevant. For nearly 20 years, nobody authored more moments that made his fans feel something they never felt before.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2021/07/13/roger-federer-withdraws-tokyo-olympics-knee/7952112002/", "title": "Roger Federer withdraws from Tokyo Olympics after setback with ...", "text": "Former No. 1 Roger Federer has pulled out of the Tokyo Olympics tennis event, citing a setback during his recent Wimbledon quarterfinal run with a knee that was surgically repaired last year.\n\nIn an announcement posted to Twitter, Federer said he had begun rehab with hopes of rejoining the ATP Tour “later this summer,” which would presumably include trying to play the U.S. Open.\n\n“During the grasscourt season, I unfortunately experienced a setback with my knee, and have accepted that I must withdraw from the Tokyo Olympic Games,” Federer wrote. “I am greatly disappointed, as it has been an honor and highlight of my career each time I have represented Switzerland.\"\n\nAn Olympic gold medal in singles is the only major prize in tennis that Federer, who will turn 40 in August, never won.\n\nHe was runner-up to Andy Murray in the 2012 Games played at Wimbledon and lost a shocker to American James Blake in the quarterfinals of the 2008 Games, though he did win gold for Switzerland in doubles with Stan Wawrinka that year.\n\nFederer was the heavy favorite to win Gold in Athens in 2004 but was upset by Tomas Berdych in the second round.\n\nThere had been some hope that Federer would play in the Tokyo Games, particularly after leaving Nike to sign an apparel deal with Japanese company Uniqlo in 2018.

That is a team event run by his management company.\n\nFederer is married and he and his wife, Mirka — a tennis player, too; they met as athletes at an Olympics — have two sets of twins.\n\nHe leaves with a total of 103 tour-level titles on his substantial resume and 1,251 wins in singles matches, both second only to Jimmy Connors in the Open era, which began in 1968. Federer's records include being the oldest No. 1 in ATP rankings history — he returned to the top spot at 36 in 2018 — and most consecutive weeks there (his total weeks mark was eclipsed by Djokovic).\n\nWhen Federer won his first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon in 2003, the men's record for most was held by Pete Sampras, who had won his 14th at the U.S. Open the year before in what turned out to be the last match of the American's career.\n\nFederer would go on to blow way past that, ending up with 20 by winning eight championships at Wimbledon, six at the Australian Open, five at the U.S. Open and one at the French Open. His 2009 trophy at Roland Garros allowed Federer to complete a career Grand Slam.\n\nHis serving, forehand, footwork and attacking style will all be remembered. Also unforgettable were his matches against younger rivals Nadal, 36, and Djokovic, 35, who both equalled, then surpassed, Federer's Slam total and are still winning titles at the sport's four biggest tournaments.\n\nNadal now leads the count with 22, one ahead of Djokovic.\n\n“I was lucky enough to play so many epic matches that I will never forget,” Federer said in Thursday's announcement.\n\nAddressing his “competitors on the court” — although not by name — he wrote: “We pushed each other, and together we took tennis to new levels.”\n\nFederer's last match anywhere came on July 7, 2021, when he lost at Centre Court in the Wimbledon quarterfinals to Hubert Hurkacz 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-0.\n\nSoon after, Federer had surgery to repair damage to his meniscus and cartilage in his right knee — his third operation on that knee in a span of 1 1/2 years.\n\n“Tennis has treated me more generously than I ever would have dreamt,” Federer said Thursday, “and now I must recognize when it is time to end my competitive career.”\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2022/09/15/as-roger-federer-retires-an-appreciation-of-his-career/50741269/", "title": "As Roger Federer retires, an appreciation of his career", "text": "AP\n\nRoger Federer never let ’em see him sweat.\n\nHe played tennis with a style that only rarely betrayed the effort behind the masterful serving, the rare-in-its-day attacking and the flawless footwork.

It also helped him manage to avoid serious injuries for so long and achieve the consistent excellence over decades he prized.\n\n“Every time people write me off, or try to write me off, I’m able to bounce back,” Federer once said in an interview with The Associated Press. On Thursday, at a little more than a month past his 41st birthday and after a series of knee operations, he announced that there would be no more comebacks.\n\nIt is a loss for tennis, to be sure, and a loss for the sports world.

But tennis will not be the same.\n\nNot without Williams, who was feted at the just-concluded U.S. Open. And not without Federer, whose last tournament came last year at Wimbledon, and whose final appearance on court will be next week in London at the Laver Cup, a team event his management group founded.\n\nTennis will miss Federer, the player. And Federer, the statesman and ambassador who spoke several languages. And Federer, the instantly recognizable global pitchman who brought his sport to places all over the world that didn't even have tournaments through exhibitions to raise money for his charitable foundation.\n\nOnce a tantrum-throwing kid — on the court and off, where he would overturn a chess table when losing to his father — who grew up admiring basketball stars such as Michael Jordan and soccer players more than tennis players, Federer became a symbol of his sport and someone known as much for the way he carried himself as the hardware he accumulated.\n\n“He was the epitome of a champion; class, grace, humility, beloved by everyone,” Hall of Famer Chris Evert wrote on Twitter.\n\nHe became friends with Vogue editor Anna Wintour and showed up at the Met Gala. He had a special jacket with a gold “15” on it to don right there on Centre Court after winning Wimbledon in 2009 to break Pete Sampras' men's mark of 14 career major trophies. He kept playing, and winning, well past an age that is customary for that sort of thing in tennis, to the point that his two sets of twins — now ages 13 and 8 — eventually were able to be present in courtside guest boxes. He returned after left knee surgery in 2016, the first significant absence of his career, and used a larger racket head and a rebuilt backhand to collect his last three Slams.\n\n“There won't be anybody like him,\" said Tony Godsick, Federer's agent since 2005. \"There will be people who will win more tournaments or will have more Grand Slams. There will always be a new No. 1. There will always be someone holding a trophy up. But no one has had such a big impact and will continue to have such a big impact.”\n\nWhen it came to defining success, Federer cared about longevity as much as anything. He was proud of facing — and defeating — stars from an earlier generation (Sampras and Andre Agassi), from his own generation (Andy Roddick, Lleyton Hewitt, Marat Safin), from the next generation (Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, Stan Wawrinka) and from the current crop (Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas).\n\nHe chased the first group, dominated the second, dueled with the third — Nadal, with 22, and Djokovic with 21, eventually surpassed Federer's Grand Slam total — and set an example for the fourth.\n\nAside from those major trophies won from 2003 to 2018, Federer put together unprecedented stretches of elite play, appearing in 10 consecutive Grand Slam finals (and 18 of 19), along with 23 semifinals and 36 quarterfinals in a row.\n\nHis contests against Nadal, now 36, and Djokovic, 35, were happenings, tantalizing matchups against a backdrop of differing ways of play and contrasting personalities.\n\n“I was lucky enough to play so many epic matches that I will never forget,” Federer wrote in the section of his goodbye post addressed to his competitors. “We battled fairly, with passion and intensity, and I always tried my best to respect the history of the game. I feel extremely grateful. We pushed each other, and together we took tennis to new levels.”\n\nPredicted to be a star from the time he won the Wimbledon junior title as a teenager — a sentiment that only built when he stunned Sampras in the fourth round there in 2001 — it took Federer a little time to get pointed in the right direction: He did not win a quarterfinal match in his first 16 Grand Slam appearances.\n\nThere were six first-round exits in that span, including at the 2003 French Open. So then came this concern: Might Federer not quite be as good as he, and others, thought?\n\nIt all came together at Wimbledon that year, where Federer claimed his first Grand Slam title at the tournament that always meant the most to him. And off he went.\n\n“There was pressure from all sides; also from myself. I wanted to do better in Slams,” Federer said that day. “I’ve always believed, but then in the end, when it happens, you don’t think that it is possible. It’s an absolute dream for me. I was always joking around when I was a boy: ’I’m going to win this.'”\n\nHe would end up with those men's-record eight at Wimbledon, plus six at the Australian Open, five at the U.S. Open and one at the French Open. He is one of eight men with a career Grand Slam, holds the records for most consecutive weeks at No. 1 in the ATP computerized rankings and for oldest to get there, and set a mark for most total weeks that Djokovic eclipsed.\n\nIf anyone worried that Federer is gone for good, one of those athletes who wants to disappear after the playing days are done, he concluded his farewell note with these words: “To the game of tennis: I love you and will never leave you.”\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2022/07/27/saudi-funded-liv-golf-announces-14-event-schedule-for-2023/50533117/", "title": "Saudi-funded LIV Golf announces 14-event schedule for 2023", "text": "AP\n\nBEDMINSTER, N.J. (AP) — The Saudi-funded LIV Golf series announced a 14-tournament schedule for next year with 12 established team franchises and a chance for players to either be promoted or relegated through its series of Asian Tour events.\n\nGreg Norman, the CEO and commissioner of LIV Golf, said Wednesday in a news release that the full schedule would be released later and would include stops across the world.\n\nThe rival league of the PGA and European tours plays its third event this week at Trump National Bedminster in New Jersey, the course owned by former President Donald Trump. The four additions to the 48-man roster of players are Henrik Stenson, Paul Casey, Charles Howell III and Jason Kokrak. The European tour stripped Stenson of his Ryder Cup captaincy for signing up with LIV Golf, after pledging full support to the tour when he was selected as captain in March.\n\nAlong with the 48-man field, no-cut events worth $25 million in prize money, LIV Golf Investments has pumped $300 million into the Asian Tour for “International Series” events. While details on promotion and relegation were not announced, players could earn their way into the LIV Golf League through their performance in these Asian Tour events, while those who finish toward the bottom of LIV Golf events would be replaced.\n\nThe news release said LIV Golf League players are expected to compete in “numerous” International Series events, which would mean playing more than the 14 tournaments on the 2023 LIV Golf schedule. One appeal for players who have signed up, such as Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson, was to play less.\n\nLIV Golf said it would have 25 tournaments worldwide next year, which indicates a total of 11 events on the Asian Tour. There are four “International Series” events on the Asian Tour schedule this year. The news release said new Asian Tour stops would include the Americas and Europe. This year, the Asian Tour held an event in England a week before the LIV Golf Invitational debut outside London.\n\nNorman said LIV Golf and the “International Series” would play for $405 million in prize money. With $25 million set aside for LIV Golf events, that would suggest International Series events would each have a $5 million purse.\n\nThe 12 four-man teams would stay the same throughout the year. Captains will be able to build their franchises to attract a fan following and sponsor interest. Howell and Casey are now on a team led by Bryson DeChambeau, and they said he reached out to them a few months ago about joining LIV Golf.\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2022/09/15/quote-box-reaction-to-federers-retirement-from-tennis/50739435/", "title": "Quote Box: Reaction to Federer's retirement from tennis", "text": "AP\n\nLONDON (AP) — Reaction to Roger Federer's announcement that he will retire from tennis after the Laver Cup in London next week.\n\n___\n\n\"I wish this day would have never come… it’s a sad day for me personally and for sports people around the world. I said it to you when we spoke and now it’s here.

Not many tennis players at his level push into their 40s. But he was always interested in challenging himself. And at the end of the day, after 1,500-plus matches, the tires finally wore out. And he’s got things to do in his next stage.” — Tony Godsick, Federer’s agent since 2005.\n\n___\n\n“There was that incredible speed. There was the unreal work close to the net. And there was the way he made it all look devastatingly easy. But there was also, just as importantly, a kindness and a grace — one might even say a dignity — in the way he carried himself on the court and off.” — Anna Wintour, Federer's friend and Vogue editor-in-chief.\n\n___\n\n“Cheers Roger. Thanks for the shared memories my friend. It was an honor to share time/experiences on the most hallowed grounds in our sport.

You crushed me on the court, but were so nice and genuine that I couldn’t hate you for it. You made the game better on and off the court and you will be missed.
