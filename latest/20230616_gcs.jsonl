Haith created the flag in 1997 with the help of collaborators, and Boston-based illustrator Lisa Jeanne Graf brought their vision to life.\n\nThe flag was revised in 2000 into the version we know today, according to the National Juneteenth Observation Foundation. Seven years later, the date “June 19, 1865” was added, commemorating the day that Union Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas, and told enslaved African Americans of their emancipation.\n\nFor two decades now, communities around the country have held flag-raising ceremonies on Juneteenth in celebration of their freedom.\n\n“This country has so many aspects to it that are spiritual, and I believe this flag is of that nature,” Haith said. “It (the idea for the design) just came through me.”\n\nDesigning the flag and its symbols was a deliberate process, Haith said. Here’s what each element of the flag represents.\n\nThe star\n\nThe white star in the center of the flag has a dual meaning, Haith said.\n\nFor one, it represents Texas, the Lone Star State. It was in Galveston in 1865 where Union soldiers informed the country’s last remaining enslaved people that, under the Emancipation Proclamation issued two years earlier, they were free.\n\nBut the star also goes beyond Texas, representing the freedom of African Americans in all 50 states.\n\nThe burst\n\nThe bursting outline around the star is inspired by a nova, a term that astronomers use to mean a new star.\n\nOn the Juneteenth flag, this represents a new beginning for the African Americans of Galveston and throughout the land.\n\nThe arc\n\nThe curve that extends across the width of the flag represents a new horizon: the opportunities and promise that lay ahead for Black Americans.\n\nThe colors\n\nThe red, white and blue represents the American flag, a reminder that slaves and their descendants were and are Americans.\n\nJune 19, 1865, represents the day that enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas, became Americans under the law.\n\nAnd while African Americans today are still fighting for equality and justice, Haith said those colors symbolize the continuous commitment of people in the United States to do better – and to live up to the American ideal of liberty and justice for all.", "authors": ["Harmeet Kaur"], "publish_date": "2022/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/06/19/union-general-who-made-juneteenth-announcement-buried-kentucky/3222927001/", "title": "Union general who made Juneteenth announcement in 1865 is ...", "text": "On June 19, 1865, a Union General read an official military decree to the people of Texas which would become the catalyst for the modern-day Juneteeth holiday and celebrations.\n\nThat same general is now buried in Section P, Lot 66 of the Lexington Cemetery in Kentucky.\n\nToday, 155 years ago, Major Gen. Gordon Granger marched into Galveston, Texas with nearly 2,000 Union solider to announce the Civil War had ended and all enslaved people were free. Gordon arrived with the news in the Lone Star State Texas nearly two and half years after President Abraham Lincoln enacted the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed black people enslaved in Confederate states in rebellion against the Union, on Jan. 1, 1863.\n\nInformation in the mid-1800s was not shared as instantaneously as it is today. The news that the Civil War had ended and slavery had been abolished traveled slowly to the western edge of the former Confederate states.\n\nYou may like:Freedom is not free: Louisvillians celebrates Juneteenth amid an ongoing fight for justice\n\nYou may like:'I want to celebrate freedom in its totality': What Juneteenth means to Black Louisvillians\n\nWhen the Union army finally arrived in 1865, Granger's official announcement was met with great jubilation throughout the Black community — at the time around 250,000 people were slaves in Texas — and that celebration has been passed down through generations for more than a century.\n\nGranger, whose wife was from Lexington, died in 1876 from a stroke at age 54. The general would have no knowledge that June 19 would become the most popular date to commemorate the end of slavery in the United States. Juneteenth has been adopted in many states, including Kentucky, as National Freedom Day.\n\nMaj. General Granger is buried next to his wife, Maria, at Lexington Cemetery, 833 W.

The measure to pass a Juneteenth National Independence Day passed the House by a large margin Wednesday. On Thursday afternoon, President Joe Biden signed it into law.\n\n\"Today we consecrate Juneteenth for what it ought to be, for what it must be, a national holiday,\" Biden said before picking up a pen and signing into law America's newest national holiday at 4:04 p.m. EDT.\n\nBoth New Jersey, which made Juneteenth a state observance on Sept. 10, and New York, which made Juneteenth a state holiday on Oct. 14, were ahead of the curve in recognizing the holiday. So was Bergen County — which leaves Randy Glover, producer of the county's Juneteenth Celebration in Overpeck Park on Saturday from noon to 6 p.m., feeling good about himself and his colleagues.\n\n\"They decided to do this without knowing it would be a national holiday,\" Glover said. \"This puts the county on a good footing.\"\n\nThis Saturday's event, done in cooperation with the Bergen County NAACP and other county entities, is liable to be bigger and more important than anyone had imagined.\n\n\"I'm excited because a lot of people will get an opportunity to experience what we're offering,\" Glover said.\n\nThe joy is mixed with other feelings.\n\nJuneteenth, celebrated since 1866 as a day of African American freedom, has become a flashpoint in the Black Lives Matter era.\n\n\"This is a day, in my view, of profound weight and profound power,\" Biden said Thursday. \"A day in which we remember the moral stain and the terrible toll that slavery took and continues to take … At the same time, I also remember the extraordinary capacity to heal and hope and emerge from those painful moments and a bitter, bitter version of ourselves, to make a better version of ourselves.\"\n\nThe movement to get Juneteenth declared a national holiday has been building for years.\n\nBut now that it has arrived — passed by a Congress that has been unable to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, and at a time when some states are trying to restrict how history is taught, and the extent to which racial injustice can be acknowledged — some have expressed cynicism about the timing. Crumbs, they say. A sop to silence the critics. Biden acknowledged this in his signing speech, when he talked about the movement to restrict voter access. Glover can sympathize with such skepticism.\n\n\"We have another holiday to celebrate who we are and what we are,\" he said. \"But equality always seems to be left out of the equation. So we don't have voting rights, but we have another day to go shopping.\"\n\nEven so, the federal government recognizing Juneteenth is no small thing.\n\nIt's the first new federal holiday added to the calendar since Martin Luther King Day in 1983. \"They have not amended the calendar for 30 or 40 years,\" said Deborah Evans, vice chair of the board of directors for the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation. That's what their organization had been pushing for since 1994. Their petition bears 1.5 million signatures\n\nAnd rightly so, said Wayne Bass, grand marshal of this year's Juneteenth celebration in White Plains, New York (held virtually, because of COVID, on the 12th).\n\n\"I think there should be recognition by the United States government that we have made significant contributions to the nation as a whole,\" Bass said.\n\nThe \"teenth\" of Juneteenth — as many in the U.S. have only started to learn — is June 19, 1865. That was the day Union Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, to inform the residents kept as slaves that they were free. Had been, since Jan. 1, 1863.\n\nCelebration:17 North Jersey events celebrating Juneteenth this weekend\n\nJuneteenth, in other words, celebrates people who were free but didn't know it. Which might make it the most American holiday of all.\n\n\"We have it, within ourselves, to be the democracy we should have always been,\" Glover said. \"By taking this opportunity to be clear about what the past was, we can start celebrating the future.\"\n\nJuneteenth was a big thing last year — the year of George Floyd and Black Lives Matter. It's a bigger thing now.\n\nBy the time Congress got around to its historic vote this week, all but one state in the union — South Dakota — had recognized Juneteenth in some way (Hawaii signed its bill just this week). Some states, like New Jersey, simply marked the day with proclamations, educational programs and so on.\n\nSeven states — Texas, Massachusetts, Virginia, Washington, Oregon, New York and Pennsylvania — recognized Juneteenth as a state holiday. State employees were to have the day off, schools were to be closed. Five of those seven states enacted the legislation within the last year.\n\nAmong the private companies that had been giving their employees paid Juneteenth leave: Nike, Mastercard, Uber, Best Buy, Target, J.C. Penney, the NFL, The New York Times, The Washington Post and Gannett.\n\nSome have likened Juneteenth to an African American Fourth of July. But it's more than that, Evans said. Juneteenth, rightly considered, is a continuation of Independence Day — the sequel to Liberty and Justice for All.\n\n\"We say Juneteenth completed the cycle of freedom,\" Evans said. \"Fourth of July freed the country from the British. Juneteenth freed all the people. This is a completion.\"\n\nNot that there's anything wrong with the Fourth of July. Fireworks, hot dogs, Sousa — all very nice.\n\nBut some Americans have always felt July 4 didn't quite tell the whole story. And not just this year. That feeling is actually a very old one.\n\n\"What, to the American slave, is your Fourth of July?\" Frederick Douglass thundered, famously, to a crowd in Rochester, New York, in 1852.\n\n\"I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim,\" Douglass said. \"To him, your celebration is a sham, your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity … [They] are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy — a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.\"\n\nThat feeling has not gone away.\n\n\"Juneteenth is becoming more well known because of Black Lives Matter,\" said Mofalc O. Meinga of Jersey City, president of the Frederick Douglass Juneteenth Celebration Inc., which staged its first Juneteenth event in 2000.\n\n\"There are events popping up all over,\" said Meinga. His group, a Jersey branch of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, has been doing ceremonies around the state this month: two flag-raisings in Jersey City so far (on the first and the fifteenth), another in Trenton at 4:30 p.m. Friday (co-sponsored by the African American Cultural Collaborative of Mercer County) and a motor caravan through Linden on the 19th, at 11:30 a.m.\n\n\"Our mission is to bring all Americans together to celebrate our common bond of freedom,\" Meinga said.\n\nGetting popular:Juneteenth is more popular than ever. This year's celebrations come amid a culture war.\n\nEverything old is new\n\nJuneteenth is both one of the oldest and one of the newest holidays on the calendar. Old in terms of its origins. New in terms of its national profile.\n\nIt was first celebrated in Texas on June 19, 1866 — one year after the event it commemorates. That, by the way, was more a symbolic than an actual milestone: there were people held as slaves in Delaware and Kentucky even after June 19, 1865.\n\nUnder various names — Jubilee Day, Freedom Day, Emancipation Day — Juneteenth was celebrated in the Southwest and the South over the next century. In 1938 it was recognized by proclamation in Texas: \"Whereas, June 19, 1938, this year falls on Sunday…[I] do urge all members of the Negro race in Texas to observe the day in a manner appropriate to its importance to them,\" proclaimed Gov. James V. Allred.\n\nBut Juneteenth never gained much traction in the North. And by the 1960s civil rights era, some came to see it as old-fashioned. So depending on where you grew up, Juneteenth might be a blowout celebration. Or it might get you a blank look.\n\n\"I went to private school, so that was not on my radar,\" Glover said. \"The nuns were not so into Juneteenth.\"\n\nBy the late 1960s, interest began to revive: June 19 became the \"solidarity day\" of the 1968 Poor People's Campaign of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. In 1979, Texas made it a state holiday — the first state to do so. And as populations in the U.S. became more mobile, they brought Juneteenth with them.\n\n\"Juneteenth is not something that has been adequately appreciated in the Northeast,\" said Pastor Eddie Spencer IV of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Englewood. He grew up in Burlington; he heard about Juneteenth from his roommate at Virginia Union University in Richmond — a Texan.\n\nThese days there is much more regional mixing. So word is getting out.\n\n\"it depends on who you interact with,\" Spencer said. \"In certain areas, for instance Essex County, you find a lot of people from Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and possibly Alabama. When you get into areas like Jersey City you come into contact with people from Mississippi. There are not a whole lot of Texans here, historically. But now with the boom of businesses going global, you can run into people from Texas.\"\n\nBy 1994 there was a National Juneteenth Observance Foundation. By 1997, it had a flag — the national (copyrighted) Juneteenth Flag, designed by Ben Haith of Massachusetts. Red, white and blue, with a great star erupting out of the middle.\n\n\"It's the bursting star of freedom,\" said Steve Williams, president of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation. \"The new horizon is the blue. The red is the ground soaked with the blood we shed for this country, from the middle passage to the current day.\"\n\nThe stories of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other victims of the past year have made Juneteenth seem newly important. People wanted to learn about it.\n\n\"Each year, you go through a period where you have to explain what Juneteenth is,\" Bass said. \"This is one of the first years where people understand it. It seems there was some more clarity of the last year, and understanding, and interest in it.\"\n\nBut no one changed the game like former President Donald Trump, when he scheduled a rally for June 19, 2020, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, site of the worst race massacre in U.S. history (marking its own 100th anniversary this year). In the resulting uproar — eventually the date was changed — Juneteenth was suddenly on everybody's radar. \"I made Juneteenth very famous,\" Trump boasted.\n\n\"The fact that he had planned it in Tulsa lets you know he had no clue,\" Meinga said. \"Until someone told him it was not a good idea.\"\n\nThe Tulsa Race Massacre:100 years later, TV goes where textbooks won't\n\nMany ways to celebrate\n\nEveryone knows how you celebrate July Fourth. Bottle rockets, barbecues, bunting. But how do you celebrate Juneteenth? In the Northeast, it varies from community to community.\n\nThere might be a raising of the Juneteenth flag. There might be a reading of the Emancipation Proclamation, or of General Order No. 3, the original announcement Major General Granger read to the enslaved populations of Galveston and their former masters on June 19, 1865:\n\n\"The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves.\"\n\nOther towns are doing more elaborate things.\n\nSaturday's event at Overpeck Park, produced by Glover's Tri-Arc Community Development Corporation, will include food and entertainment. An invocation by traditional African drummer Pernell Bess will be followed by a jazz trio featuring veteran players Abel Mireles (tenor sax), Radam Schwartz (organ) and Bernard \"Pocket\" Davis (drums) and the funk band The Total Eclipse. The amphitheater in the Ridgefield Park section is where it all happens.\n\n\"This is a big public event. It's big for Bergen County,\" Glover said.\n\nThe Bergen County NAACP (which will be presenting lifetime achievement awards), the county executive's office, the county Parks Department and Bergen Community College are all co-presenting. Several other local organizations will have a presence, including Hackensack Meridian Hackensack University Medical Center, Holy Name Medical Center and New Bridge Medical Center. Vaccinations will be offered on-site.\n\n\"The mere fact that all these Bergen County entities are joining in is a game changer,\" Glover said.\n\nIt means that Juneteenth has, in this area at least, arrived.\n\n\"It's probably more relevant now than in previous years, because of the tumultuous times we are in politically,\" Glover said. \"When you look at voting rights being restricted in the South, and the other things that are happening, you're talking about disenfranchisement on a national level. Now it's going to be a misdemeanor to give somebody some water? Black people are fighting for the same things as Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and the Panthers, all these groups that fought to bring us forward.\"\n\nIn Yonkers, New York, the urgency of the times demanded a three-day celebration.\n\nOn Friday, the Pan-African Flag will be raised at City Hall, and a Juneteenth King and Queen will be proclaimed. On Saturday, in Trevor Park & Playground on Ravine Avenue, there will be educational symposiums, a musical tribute to rapper DMX (a native of neighboring Mount Vernon), youth talent and award shows. On Sunday in the park, an outdoor unity worship service will be followed by a summer stage full of live performers and live bands. There will be vendors and food.\n\n\"We try to balance the story so it's not all jubilee, but it's still a celebration of our freedom from chattel slavery,\" said Robert Winstead, president of the Yonkers African American Heritage Committee, which has produced the event since 2015. It grew out of an African American heritage festival the group has been doing since 1975.\n\n\"We just thought it would make a lot of sense to join that to the national Juneteenth celebration,\" Winstead said. \"It gives us more context.\"\n\nJuneteenth, however it's celebrated, is a joyful, welcoming event. It originated with, and is specifically pertinent to, African Americans — but it can be celebrated by people of all backgrounds.\n\nOnly it does ask something of us: a willingness to fully acknowledge American history. The bad, as well as the good. That's the only way all of us — the whole country — can move forward. Together.\n\n\"There's been this sweeping-under-the-rug mentality,\" Spencer said. \"And after all these years, no one wants to admit we've run out of rug.\"\n\nCelebrate: Juneteenth events in New Jersey\n\nCelebrate: Juneteenth events in Westchester\n\nJim Beckerman is an entertainment and culture reporter for NorthJersey.com.

My rally is a celebration. In the history of politics, I think I can say there's never been any group or any person that's had rallies like I do,\" Trump said. \"I go and I just say, give me the biggest stadium and we fill it up every time. We've never had a vacancy.\"\n\nThe president sparked outrage after he revealed he would return to the campaign trail for his first rally in more than three months in Tulsa and on June 19th.\n\nIn 1921, a white mob in Tulsa attacked a predominantly black neighborhood killing hundreds of people, most of them African-American, one of the most notorious acts of racial violence in U.S. history. . June 19, or Juneteenth, is also known as Emancipation Day and commemorates the date in 1865 when Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger traveled to Galveston, Texas, to inform residents that President Abraham Lincoln had freed the slaves and that slave owners had to comply with the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nDespite Trump denying the significance of Tulsa, he's never held a rally there and Oklahoma is a firmly red state he won by 36 percentage points in the 2016 election.\n\nThe trip comes after weeks of protests over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who was pinned to the ground for nearly nine minutes under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer. The rally announcement prompted backlash, with some suggesting he was being insensitive about holding an event on such a highly symbolic day amid nationwide demonstrations over racial inequality, but the campaign appeared to standby its timing.\n\nMore: Trump stirs anger with plans for Juneteenth rally in Tulsa, site of huge massacre of African Americans\n\nWhen asked about why the campaign decided to hold the rally in Tulsa and on Juneteenth, senior Trump campaign adviser Katrina Pierson said in a statement Thursday, “as the party of Lincoln, Republicans are proud of the history of Juneteenth.\"\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany later told reporters Juneteenth was very \"meaningful\" for Trump.\n\n\"The African American community is very near and dear to his heart,\" McEnany said. \"At these rallies he often shares the great work he has done for minority communities.\"\n\nThe rally will be Trump's first in more than three months after coronavirus restrictions halted large-scale public events.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden criticized Trump’s scheduled rally in Tulsa during a teleconference call with thousands of AFSCME union members Friday. But a day after mistakenly saying the rally was in Texas, Biden said it was Arizona.\n\n“Now, did you hear what this guy just did? He’s having a rally on Juneteenth in Arizona and guess what? All of the people coming to his rally have to sign a piece of paper saying if they get COVID in this, they will not sue the campaign. I mean come on, man,” Biden said. “Can’t sue the campaign, yet he won’t fund? I’m sorry, I’m getting a little frustrated. Quite frankly, I’m getting angry about it.”\n\nDuring the Fox interview, Trump also called a much-criticized photo of him posing with a bible in front of a historic church \"a beautiful picture.\" The president came under fire for using police and National Guard forces to remove peaceful protesters from the area just before the photo was taken.\n\n\"I think it was a beautiful picture. I'll tell you, I think Christians think it was a beautiful picture,\" he told Fox's Faulkner.\n\nHis comments came a day after Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley said it was a \"mistake\" to accompany the president and other top administration officials on the walk across Lafayette Square to historic St. John's Church, adding that his \"presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.\"\n\nUSA TODAY Poll:Forceful clearing of Lafayette Square was defining moment for president and protests\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper also distanced himself from the president's walk to St. John's, saying he had nothing to do with the decision to clear the protesters. He told NBC News he didn't know they were going to the church, then clarified the next day that he knew where they were going but not about the president's planned \"photo op\" with the Bible.\n\n\"I mean, if that's the way they feel, I think that's fine. I have good relationships with the military,\" Trump told Faulkner.\n\nThe photograph of Milley, in his camouflage combat uniform, and Defense Secretary Mark Esper walking along a path in Lafayette Square with Trump and other administration officials was condemned by a chorus of former military officials. Former Defense Secretary James Mattis slammed his former boss for ordering use of force for a photo op. Attorney General William Barr has since said his decision to clear the square was over safety concerns and unrelated to the president's walk.\n\nGraphic:How police pushed aside protesters before Trump's controversial church photo\n\nContributing: William Cummings, Tom Vanden Brook", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/12"}]}

News outlets cite Guinness World Records as announcing last week that Poncho Via’s horns measured just over 10 feet, 7 inches as of last month, beating all previous records. The 7-year-old steer belongs to a family in Goodwater, just southeast of Birmingham. Poncho’s owner Jeral Pope says he brought Poncho into the family when the steer was 6 months old. The organization says the Pope family first noticed the potential of Poncho’s horns when he was about 4 years old and his horns were growing straight out instead of curving upward. Pope says Poncho is a gentle giant with a soft spot for apples, carrots and marshmallows.\n\nAlaska\n\nQuinhagak: Accelerating erosion is forcing villages in western Alaska to begin making plans to move. Alaska’s Energy Desk reports erosion caused by climate change threatens village infrastructure and could force the relocation of communities such as Quinhagak. A 2012 state report listed Quinhagak’s sewer lagoon and multipurpose building as top priorities for replacement or repair because of erosion and thawing permafrost. Officials say erosion now threatens Quinhagak’s airstrip, water treatment plant, and water and sewer system. An official says he does not know how they would close up the lagoon if erosion causes waste to leak into the Kuskokwim Bay, an important food source. Quinhagak has applied for a Bureau of Indian Affairs grant to help with moving and rebuilding the lagoon, which could cost $6 million.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s housing shortage has drawn more attention than ever before in recent months, prompting a stack of dream-big legislation, newly energized activism and a mayoral race that emphasized each candidate’s plan to keep Phoenix affordable. Yet the state continues to slide deeper into unaffordable territory. An Arizona renter with a minimum-wage job must now work 71 hours to afford a modest two-bedroom home, according to a report released Tuesday by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. In the Phoenix metro area, that figure rises to 75 hours of labor. Under a widely accepted standard for affordability, a household should spend no more than 30% of its income on housing costs. The NLIHC report assumes a median two-bedroom rent of $898 across Arizona, rising to just under $1,000 in the Phoenix metro area. The state’s minimum wage is $11 an hour.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal judge has blocked a state law that prevents candidates for state office from accepting campaign contributions more than two years before an election. U.S. District Judge James Moody Jr. on Monday granted a preliminary injunction that prevents the state from enforcing the blackout period for accepting campaign contributions. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge has appealed the order and on Tuesday asked Moody to stay his ruling during the appeal. Attorneys for Peggy Jones, the Pulaski County woman who sued over the restriction, have said the blackout period prevents her from exercising her First Amendment right to contribute money to candidates she wishes to support in the 2022 election.\n\nCalifornia\n\nHuntington Park: A Southern California police force is welcoming a robot to the department. Huntington Park police says “HP RoboCop” will provide 360-degree high-definition video footage. It became an official member of the force at a Tuesday evening ceremony. The department says the blue-and-white rolling robot serves as an extra set of eyes for areas such as parks and buildings that police might not have time to patrol. HP RoboCop has been helping to patrol a park in the Los Angeles suburb for several weeks since it was previewed at a 5K run last month. HP RoboCop even has its own Twitter page.\n\nColorado\n\nGlenwood Springs: A 10-year-old Colorado girl has scaled Yosemite National Park’s El Capitan, taking five days to reach the top of the iconic rock formation. Selah Schneiter of Glenwood Springs completed the challenging 3,000-foot climb last week with the help of her father and a family friend. Selah and her dad, Mike Schneiter, say it took them five days last week with family friend Mark Regier to reach the top of the California icon. Selah told KFSN-TV that the group’s method was to do the climb little by little, calling it taking “small bites.” Mike Schneiter told the television station in Fresno, California, that the entire family climbs and that he fell in love with his wife, Joy, 15 years ago while scaling El Capitan.\n\nConnecticut\n\nTorrington: The man who promised to turn himself in if his wanted poster received 15,000 likes on Facebook has made good on his pledge. It just took longer than expected. Torrington police say 29-year-old Jose Simms called Enfield police Wednesday and asked them to pick him up because he was wanted. Enfield police turned him over to Torrington police, who held him on $30,500 bond. Torrington police posted Simms’ poster on Facebook on May 22. He contacted police through the site and agreed to surrender if the post received 15,000 likes. It quickly surpassed that number. Simms was being sought as a fugitive after failing to appear in court on several charges. It couldn’t be determined if he has a lawyer.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: For more than 150 years, members of the city’s Episcopal community were baptized, married and eulogized at the imposing Cathedral Church of St. John in Brandywine Village. This year, after sitting vacant since 2012 due to declining membership and rising maintenance costs, the church will be reborn with a new purpose: housing the elderly. The Ministry of Caring has converted the historic Gothic Revival structure and a priest’s residence on its grounds into 17 apartment units for low- and moderate-income seniors. A new building adjoining the church adds 36 units to the new Village of St. John. The apartments will be offered to residents over the age of 62, with a maximum of four residents per unit and income restrictions determined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A Georgetown University graduate who launched a project to trace the family histories of hundreds of black slaves sold by the Jesuit college in 1838 and a Boston-based genealogical organization have teamed up to digitize the information and make it available to people researching family histories. The public announcement Wednesday of what’s known as the GU272 Memory Project coincided not only with Juneteenth – the annual observance of the 1865 announcement of the abolition of slavery in America – but also with the anniversary of the 1838 sale of 272 of the more than 300 slaves the Washington, D.C., college sold over a five-year period. In addition to documents, photographs and the indexed genealogies of thousands of descendants, the project includes recorded interviews with dozens of living descendants.\n\nFlorida\n\nTitusville: Boeing says it’s moving the headquarters of its space and launch division to the Sunshine State. The company said Wednesday that it was moving the space division headquarters from Arlington, Virginia, to Titusville on Florida’s Space Coast. Boeing official Leanne Caret says it makes sense to move Boeing’s space headquarters to Florida, where so much space history has taken place. The company also is working on several future launches. Florida is home to the Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Patrick Air Force Base. Company officials say the move won’t affect space operations in other states, such as Alabama, California, Colorado, Louisiana and Texas. Boeing spokesman Daniel Beck says the company isn’t saying how many jobs will move to Florida, but the number will be small.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Atlanta’s mayor says she hopes to improve the city’s reputation through media coverage and her administration’s initiatives. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms spoke Tuesday at the Atlanta Press Club about her concern that the city is viewed locally and nationwide as corrupt. She asked journalists to be mindful of how their reporting affects the city’s reputation, and she encouraged news leaders to balance coverage of positive and negative stories. Bottoms mentioned launching My Brother’s Keeper in Atlanta – a program created under former President Barack Obama’s administration that pairs boys with mentors. And she spoke about opening a homeless resource center with money remaining after hosting the Super Bowl. She said these efforts and highlighting positive news will make strides in the right direction.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: Vacation rental registrations have been coming in to Hawaii County faster than workers can process them. West Hawaii Today reports the county Planning Department processed 226 registrations as of early last week. Paper application forms were stacked in several boxes awaiting processing. The applications are the result of a new law requiring all vacation rental owners in existence as of April 1 to register their property by Sept. 28. Registrants must pay a $500 fee and show that their transient accommodations taxes, general excise taxes and property taxes are paid in full. Vacation rentals are defined as dwellings that are rented for a period of 30 consecutive days or less and where the owner or operator does not live on the building site.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A citizens group is launching an initiative drive to raise the state’s $7.25-an-hour minimum wage. The Idaho Press reports that while lawmakers haven’t raised the minimum wage in a decade, 26 other states have increased theirs in the past five years alone. That includes 17 that raised minimum wages by legislation and nine other states by voter initiative. Idaho is a low-wage state overall, with the average weekly wage in 2018 lower than all but two other states. The group, Idahoans for a Fair Wage, is organizing a signature drive to get an initiative on the ballot. It would raise Idaho’s minimum wage to $8.75 initially, raising it another dollar a year for the next two years. After four years, the wage would be set at $12 an hour, after which increases would be tied to the consumer price index.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A wet spring and dangerous flooding have created a nasty byproduct – more mosquitoes. The Illinois Department of Public Health says the flooding has made conditions ripe for floodwater mosquitoes. They’re also known as nuisance mosquitoes and don’t carry disease like other types. Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of public health, says it’s always important to be protected from mosquito bites. She says mosquitoes that carry West Nile Virus prefer hot, dry conditions. But nuisance mosquitoes that flourish in wet weather can still pose a threat. A bite from one of them can become infected if it is scratched and becomes a wound. Precautions include avoiding outdoors between dusk and dawn, wearing light clothing over all exposed skin and using approved repellant.\n\nIndiana\n\nWolf Lake: The owner of a small northern Indiana town’s former hospital that’s become a medical museum is looking for someone to take it over. The Luckey Hospital Museum building in the Noble County community of Wolf Lake dates to 1931, when it was opened as a hospital by Dr. James Luckey. After closing in the 1950s, the building was used as a nursing home and apartments before two great-nieces bought it in 2000 and started displaying their collection of medical memorabilia. Shirley Hile, 83, tells The (Kendallville) News Sun that she can’t keep up the museum anymore since her sister died a year ago. Hile hopes a buyer will keep the museum intact. A museum anniversary celebration is planned for July 13.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds says a new social media and advertising campaign is designed to draw attention to the state’s quality of life in hopes of attracting new workers. At the announcement of a newly branded “This is Iowa” campaign, Reynolds unveiled a state-produced video that shows New York City residents being shown photos of properties they assumed were nearby, only to learn they are in Iowa. The video records their shock at hearing the prices for such large, luxurious apartments and houses. Iowa has a chronic worker shortage, and attracting more people is one of Reynolds’ priorities. She held her announcement at a downtown restaurant owned by Alexander Hall, who sold several New York restaurants four years ago and moved to his wife’s native Iowa. He’s now planning his fourth dining location. Reynolds says Hall’s experience demonstrates that when people spend a year or two in Iowa, they stay.\n\nKansas\n\nGarden City: Officials in this western Kansas city are sweating over a nearly century-old swimming pool that leaks about 200,000 gallons of water every day. The Kansas News Service reports that Garden City water resource manager Fred Jones says the water loss at the Big Pool is excessive, even for a pool that holds about 2 million gallons. Assistant city manager Jennifer Cunningham says refilling the Big Pool costs $1,000 a day, and the city spends up to $800,000 on repairs, staff and water for the pool every summer. She says recoating the deep end of the pool with concrete would cost $750,000, but it wouldn’t be cost-effective. Concrete expands in heat and contracts in the cold, so it breaks down as the seasons change. She supports replacing the pool with a sturdier option.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A project that would bring high-speed internet across the state will be delayed because company representatives say an “abundance” of squirrels have chewed through wiring. Lawmakers in the Capitol questioned reports of ravenous squirrels Tuesday, blocking officials in charge of the KentuckyWired project from borrowing an additional $110 million. KentuckyWired was started in 2015 under former Gov. Steve Beshear to boost Kentucky’s internet infrastructure. Officials are now saying squirrels damaged cable that was supposed to be up and running in April. This isn’t the first time the project has been denied extra funds. In February, lawmakers blocked a request for an additional $20 million for “unanticipated borrowing costs.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Weekend memorial services have been scheduled for singer and musician Malcom “Mac” Rebennack Jr., better known by his Voodoo-inspired stage name, Dr. John. Rebennack, a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, died June 6 at age 77. The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival says memorial services are set for Saturday at the historic Orpheum Theater in downtown New Orleans. Public visitation starts at 7 a.m. and runs until 10:30 a.m. A service running from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. at the Orpheum will be invitation only but will be broadcast on WWOZ FM. There was no immediate word on any music and entertainment stars who might attend. That will be followed by a public “second line parade” that will begin at the theater.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The National Audubon Society is getting involved in a lawsuit over the future of a national monument in the ocean off New England because of the area’s importance to seabirds, especially colorfully beaked puffins. Fishing groups sued in federal court against creation of Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, which former President Barack Obama designated in 2016. The case is on appeal. Court documents show Audubon has moved to file a friend-of-the-court brief in favor of keeping the monument. Lawyers for the fishing groups have said the monument was illegally created by Obama using the Antiquities Act. But the nearly 5,000-square-mile area is especially important to Maine’s vulnerable Atlantic puffins, says Karen Hyun, vice president of coasts for Audubon. The health of the puffin population is a tourism boost for Maine, she says.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: A carnivorous plant recently discovered by botanists is the first of its kind in the state. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources announced Tuesday the discovery of a dwarf sundew near Nassawango Creek in Worcester County. It was reported growing in open areas with wet, peaty sand, according to a Facebook post. “Dwarf sundew is an insectivorous plant with a unique way of catching its prey. The paddle-shaped leaves of the sundew form a rosette at the base and are densely covered with hairs that exude a clear, sticky liquid, which attracts and traps various kinds of insects,” the post says. The plant is the smallest native species of sundew in the U.S., according to the post. There are other species of sundew in Maryland, according to DNR. Dwarf sundew is not in the same family as the Venus flytrap, but both are considered carnivorous.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State officials are expanding an early college initiative that allows thousands of students to study and earn college credits before they even graduate from high school. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker and state Education Secretary James Peyser announced $900,000 in grants being awarded for programs involving 13 high schools and eight public colleges, starting in the fall. State officials say the early college programs combine traditional high school classes with courses offered by a local college or university, allowing students to focus on an area of study while earning up to 12 college credits at no cost. High schools in Boston, Framingham, Fitchburg, Haverhill, Lynn, Leominster and Marlborough are among those receiving grants and bring to 35 the number of high schools with early college programs.\n\nMichigan\n\nEast Lansing: Michigan State University was named the most secretive public agency in the United States by the nation’s largest organization of investigative journalists, recognizing what award committee chair Robert Cribb called MSU’s “unrelenting commitment to ensuring transparency was avoided.” Investigative Reporters and Editors named MSU the winner of the Golden Padlock Award at its annual conference in Houston on Saturday. “MSU was nominated for keeping sweeping sexual assault scandals under tight wraps, including serial abuse by disgraced team doctor Larry Nassar and hundreds of student complaints against faculty, staff and students,” IRE Executive Director Doug Haddix wrote in a May 28 letter to acting Michigan State President Satish Udpa. Udpa did not respond to the letter or Haddix’s invitation to attend IRE’s annual awards luncheon.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A leaked email has raised new questions about how state and federal regulators handled a major permit for the planned PolyMet copper-nickel mine in northeastern Minnesota. The email asks Environmental Protection Agency officials not to file written comments on the water quality permit during Minnesota’s public comment period, which had the effect of keeping the federal regulators’ multiple criticisms out of the public record. The Star Tribune reports the email appears to support accusations by PolyMet’s critics that the two agencies suppressed regulators’ concerns about pollution risks of the mine. The state approved the permit in December. The email from a top Minnesota Pollution Control Agency official was released Tuesday by the union representing employees of the EPA’s regional office in Chicago, which oversees Minnesota’s enforcement of federal pollution laws.\n\nMississippi\n\nNatchez: Academy Award winner Allison Janney will take the stage at a local theater in a fundraiser for the venue’s restoration project. The Natchez Democrat reports stars from the upcoming film “Breaking News in Yuba County” have volunteered to be in a production at the Natchez Little Theatre on Saturday night. The feature was filmed in Natchez and stars Janney, Mila Kunis, Awkwafina and Regina Hall. The event will feature Janney and a few “surprise” guests. Representatives from the theater’s board of directors say the proceeds would be used for funding youth programs and multiple restoration projects, including a remodel of the theater’s Mayweather Hall. Representatives say they hope to raise $350,000 and have already received donations from “all over the world.”\n\nMissouri\n\nEureka: An endangered wolf pup born at a preservation center near St. Louis has been named in honor of the St. Louis Blues’ Stanley Cup victory. Officials at the Endangered Wolf Center in Eureka said the nearly 8-week-old American red wolf is rare and worthy of celebration, like the hockey win. The pup was named Gloria after the 1982 Laura Branigan hit that became the Blues’ unofficial victory song. Gloria is one of a littler of seven pups born April 23 at the Endangered Wolf Center. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that center director of animal care and conservation Regina Mossotti says there are fewer than 30 American red wolves left in the wild and about 200 in breeding programs. Forty-five of those have been born at the Eureka facility.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A conservation group is opposing planned races on state trails, saying the events would put runners and grizzly bears at risk. The Missoulian reports the U.S. Forest Service has granted a special use permit for a 31-mile ultramarathon in October from Whitefish to the top of Whitefish Mountain and back. The agency is considering a permit for the Foy’s to Blacktail Marathon in September. The trail course sends runner from the Blacktail Mountain ski area to Herron Park. The Swan View Coalition has asked the agency to rescind the permit for the ultramarathon and deny one for the marathon. Coalition chair Keith Hammer says granting the permits would promote risky behavior in bear habitat. Montana Trail Crew co-founder Jimmy Grant says the risks are “very minimal.”\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The Nebraska Education Department intends to provide school districts with guidance on students’ sunscreen use during the school year. Officials say various districts have wrestled with the issue and sought state direction. Rules vary from district to district. Some require the sunscreen be sent from home and require parents to sign permission notes guiding administrators on application. Some require notes from doctors, and some don’t. Some districts have no policies at all. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the state guidance says children should be allowed to possess and use over-the-counter sunscreen approved by the Food and Drug Administration without doctors’ notes, and the sunscreen need not be stored in the nurses’ office. A department spokesman says the guidance would not be binding on districts.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Silver State residents who live in areas most prone to wildfires could see their electricity intentionally cut. NV Energy already turns off customers’ power during fires when lines are damaged or aren’t working properly. But the utility announced last week that it would turn off power when there’s a high risk of wildfires, too. Chris Hofmann, the utility’s director of grid reliability, says planned outages would lower the odds that an electrical malfunction would spark a wildfire. Up to 15,000 customers in the Lake Tahoe Basin and the Spring Mountains could be subject to the outages. New equipment to monitor weather, fuel moisture and soil conditions has been installed in those areas.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Visitors are expected to flock to the state this summer. The New Hampshire Department of Business and Economic Affairs says it is expecting to see a 2.7% increase in summer visitations and spending over 2018. As a result, the state is expecting to see about 3.6 billion overnight visitors and for spending to reach $1.9 billion for the summer travel season. As part of an event Tuesday to kick off the summer travel season, BEA Commissioner Taylor Caswell and local tourism partners gathered in downtown Littleton. Along with announcing the summer forecast, the Portsmouth Herald reports they also unveiled their summer marketing campaign, which aims to build on the “Live Free” brand. The department will focus its campaign on the New England market, as well as Canada.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: New Jerseyans are living healthier lives than their peers in other states thanks to lower rates of suicide and alcohol deaths, but opioid fatalities have skyrocketed, according to a report by a research group. The report by the Commonwealth Fund showed New Jersey could make bigger gains if its residents had more access to mental health services. “Their physical concerns are being addressed, but the mental health aspect is not,” says Linda Dayan, 23, of Allenhurst, and a medical student at the Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University. The Garden State scored highly in the healthy lives category. For example, it had the third-lowest suicide death rate. It had the fourth-lowest alcohol death rate and the fifth-lowest adult-smoking rate. But drug-poisoning deaths have increased by 219% since 2005. They increased just 115% nationwide during that time, according to the report.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A CIA intelligence officer will be working at the University of New Mexico’s campus and will carry a teaching or research load comparable to faculty colleagues, according to a new agreement. The CIA officer is scheduled to arrive at the university in August as part of an ongoing relationship with the agency and the school despites protests from students in previous years, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Under a new contract between the university and the agency, the officer will participate in the academic life of the university just like other professors. Since UNM became a signature school, very few others have publicly identified themselves. Other than the University of New Mexico, the CIA has only publicized signature schools partnerships at the University of Illinois at Chicago and Baruch College in New York City, according to CIA news releases.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Horror and alarm over the discovery of what appeared to be a dead baby at a city park turned to relief and probably some embarrassment Tuesday when the blue-skinned corpse was revealed to be a realistic-looking doll. Police and paramedics rushed to Crocheron Park in the Bayside neighborhood of Queens after a woman out for a morning jog found the “baby” lying face-down in the grass. Detectives descended in droves to look for evidence. A crime scene tent was set up. Yellow tape blocked off the area. Police initially reported the child was 3 months old and had been pronounced dead at the scene. At some point, a closer inspection showed it was a doll or some sort of theatrical prop, its skin apparently colored to resemble decomposing skin. One giveaway was the baby’s T-shirt, which read, “the crawling dead.” The red lettering wasn’t initially visible because the doll was on its stomach.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSouthern Pines: Some rising high school seniors do not have their ACT test scores because their answer sheets were never submitted. News outlets report more than 400 students at Pinecrest High School were notified Tuesday that they were affected. School leaders say the missing scores are due to “human error,” and appropriate personnel action has been taken. The school says it plans to administer the test again in the fall at no cost to the students. All juniors took the ACT on Feb. 20 and March 13. Pinecrest High School spokesperson Catherine Murphy says the school learned the tests weren’t submitted when ACT officials said they hadn’t received the answer sheets. Moore County Schools says it’s looking into security, processes and protocols for giving tests like the ACT.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Officials have confirmed the presence of zebra mussels in Lake Ashtabula. The state’s Game and Fish Department says an angler discovered a suspected zebra mussel last week and turned it in. Subsequent inspections found populations of zebra mussels of various ages throughout the lake. Lake Ashtabula is an impoundment on the Sheyenne River in Barnes and Griggs counties. It’s operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and open for boating, swimming, fishing, camping and skiing. The Game and Fish Department has now classified Lake Ashtabula and the Sheyenne River downstream all the way to the Red River as Class I aquatic nuisance species infested waters. Emergency rules go into effect immediately to prohibit moving water away from the lake and river, including water for transferring bait.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will help wrap up nearly a week’s celebration of the 50th anniversary of the famous 1969 Cuyahoga River fire in Ohio. Kennedy’s scheduled remarks Sunday come as part of Cleveland’s celebration of environmental science and sustainability half a century after the June 22, 1969, fire. The blaze became the iconic event of the U.S. environmental movement. Kennedy, son of the late Robert F. Kennedy, is president of Waterkeeper Alliance. The nonprofit environmental group fights to defend the fire-inspired Clean Water Act. Sunday’s celebration includes free afternoon admission to the Great Lakes Science Center, where shows will explore the properties of water and combustion. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is hosting live music. A ticket is required to tour the Rock Hall.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Mayor David Holt has declared the city’s first official Pride Week to celebrate LBGTQ accomplishments. Holt helped kick off a week’s worth of events Monday with a mayoral proclamation to “reaffirm our city’s commitment that all people are welcome in Oklahoma City.” Others who joined the kickoff included Councilman James Cooper, who became Oklahoma City’s first openly gay councilman when he took office in April. Festivities include a parade Saturday that will roll by businesses catering to LGBTQ clientele along a stretch of road that was part of historic Route 66. Pride celebrations are happening throughout the U.S. in June, which also marks 50 years since a clash with police at the Stonewall Inn in New York became a catalyst for expanding LGBT activism nationwide and abroad.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The loss of public funding at one of the city’s homeless shelters will leave about 80 women needing a new place to stay in late July. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the Salvation Army gave incomplete answers on a new application for taxpayer money, leading to the loss of funding. The Salvation Army Female Emergency Shelter started getting money in 2008 from the city, but the Joint Office of Homeless Services, created as the city and Multnomah County consolidated homeless services, devised a more robust application process. Salvation Army’s Oregon and Southern Idaho operations CEO Nancy Dihle says officials were unprepared for the rigor of the process and hope to be more competitive next time. The closure won’t reduce the total number of homeless shelter beds as new shelters open this summer and temporary shelters are extended.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state is permanently recognizing Juneteenth, the cultural holiday commemorating the emancipation of enslaved black people in the United States. Gov. Tom Wolf on Wednesday signed legislation designating June 19 as Juneteenth National Freedom Day. Most states recognize it, and Pennsylvania lawmakers typically recognize the day by passing nonbinding resolutions. The celebration started with the freed slaves of Galveston, Texas. Although the Emancipation Proclamation declared slaves in the South free in 1863, it couldn’t be enforced in many places until after the Civil War ended in 1865. It was June 19, 1865, when Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger and his Union troops arrived at Galveston with news that the war had ended and that the enslaved were now free. Under the law, employers aren’t required to treat June 19 as a legal or official holiday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWest Warwick: The Catholic Diocese of Providence is merging two of its parishes. WJAR-TV reports that St. Mary Parish and SS John and James Parish of West Warwick will merge July 1. The diocese said in a press release Monday that a decline in attendance and key retirements played a role in the decision. The diocese says St. Mary Parish is serving 150 people, a smaller number than a viable parish should have. St. Mary has also seen a decline in sacramental practices like weddings, baptisms and First Holy Communions, and the current pastor is retiring soon. St. Mary Parish was built in 1850 and is the oldest Catholic church building in use in the diocese. It will remain open for daily Mass and other liturgical celebrations.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Jennifer Pinckney was hiding under a desk holding the mouth of her then-6-year-old daughter when Dylann Roof fired more than 70 rounds in Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, killing nine black worshippers. The new documentary, “Emanuel,” explores life after the June 17, 2015, shooting, as family members, friends and the community try to heal through faith and forgiveness. The Rev. Clementa Pinckney was killed by Roof. Jennifer Pinckney and her daughter were in her husband’s office when they heard gunshots in another room. Pinckney says watching the film is “emotional. I can’t help but to relive what happened.” “Emanuel,” which opened in theaters nationwide for a limited run Monday and Wednesday, is executive produced by Viola Davis and Steph Curry.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A year after an independent safety review of Falls Park recommended more viewing platforms, walkways and railings, construction on those amenities is nearing completion. In June 2018, three months after a 5-year-old Iowa girl drowned at the park after falling into the Big Sioux River, an outside consultant hired to study safety protocols furnished a report to city officials outlining ways to reduce drowning risks at Falls Park. That led Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken and the City Council in July to set aside $300,000 in leftover cash from the previous year’s budget for the design and construction of a “lower falls viewing area” with two platforms and railings that are tied into the park’s walkways with sidewalks. Mike Patten, a park development specialist for the city, says work on the project is expected to wrap up within the next couple weeks if weather cooperates.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Memphis Brooks Museum of Art this week opens an exhibition devoted to a man once cherished and later scorned as “the most popular painter in the United States.” The paintings range from confectionary scenes of huggable cherubs “with cute little rosy cheeks and pudgy little legs” to a violent tableau in which “women are about to be taken away by centaurs to be raped,” in the words of new Brooks associate curator Rosamund Garrett. Titled “Bouguereau & America,” the exhibition contains 39 paintings by William Adolphe-Bouguereau (1825-1905), the French academic artist who became a millionaire in the era of the robber barons when his detailed, idealized, sentimental and teasingly sensuous canvases became prized by wealthy American collectors. Organized by the Brooks and the Milwaukee Art Museum, the exhibition is the first major Bouguereau show in North America since 1984.\n\nTexas\n\nGalveston: A program meant to help restore storm-battered Galveston Bay oyster beds has gained support from a statewide conservation initiative founded by former first lady Laura Bush. The Galveston County Daily News reports Texan by Nature has picked Galveston Bay Foundation’s oyster shell recycling program as one of six programs across the state worthy of its support over the next year with the hope of expanding the program’s reach. Along with programs aimed at conserving wetlands, cleaning up rivers and preserving other natural systems, the oyster shell program has been named a Conservation Wrangler by Texan by Nature, which Bush founded in 2011. The nonprofit group’s mission is to bring together business and conservation leaders in Texas who believe the state’s prosperity depends upon conservation of natural resources.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A Utah judge says the time has come to let a community board have final decision-making authority about who is entitled to buy homes and properties in a trust that once belonged to Warren Jeffs’ polygamous sect, ending court oversight that began 14 years ago. Judge Richard McKelvie made his ruling Tuesday despite hearing from attorneys for past and current members of the polygamous group who argued that court oversight is still necessary because the board picks favorites and isn’t transparent enough. Utah seized control of the trust in 2005 due to allegations of mismanagement by Jeffs and other sect leaders. A board of trustees formed in 2013 has overseen the resale of more than 200 homes and buildings to people with ties to the community on the Utah-Arizona border.\n\nVermont\n\nNorthfield: Gov. Phil Scott has signed a bill aimed at getting Vermont veterans who have served overseas to sign up on a national registry that tracks symptoms of those who have suffered from burn bit exposure. The bill requires the state health commissioner and adjutant general to work together to develop and make available information about the possible health effects of being exposed to chemicals from burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan. Officials will contact all known veterans and ensure they have access to the registry and other resources. Scott signed the bill Monday at the Woody William Gold Star Families Memorial Monument in Northfield. He gave particular thanks to June Heston, whose husband, Gen. Mike Heston, died of cancer last year.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: Experts say southeastern Virginia could suffer $40 billion in losses if it’s struck by a major hurricane. Professors from Old Dominion University said in a recent report that the damages could seriously puncture the regional economy. The June 12 report said losses could equate to 40% of Hampton Roads’ gross domestic product. GDP is a measure of an economy’s health and accounts for the total output of goods and services. The report predicted a loss of 175,000 jobs and a decline in economic activity if the region’s infrastructure and military installations suffer major damage. The report was put together by the Commonwealth Center for Recurrent Flooding Resiliency. The center was established by Old Dominion University, the College of William & Mary and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: The state’s apple industry expects exports to India to slow down even more after the country tacked on a 20% retaliatory tariff, bringing the total duty to 70%. The Yakima Herald-Republic reports India added the tariff to apples and 27 other American products Sunday after the U.S. ended a preferential trade program with the country earlier this year. India had imported 7.8 million 40-pound boxes of the state’s 2017 apple crop by June 2018. It imported a record 8 million boxes by the end of season. It has imported 2.6 million boxes of the 2018 crop since last week. Northwest Horticultural Council President Mark Powers says the apples could depress prices for all growers if the industry cannot find alternative export markets.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Mountain State residents eat more hot dogs per capita – and fewer hamburgers – than any other state, according to a study by 24/7 Wall Street. West Virginia was served the dubious distinction with an estimated 481 hot dogs eaten per person annually, trailed by No. 2 Illinois with 317 hot dogs and Pennsylvania with 289. Meanwhile, the study found that West Virginians eat about 171 hamburgers per capita each year, the fewest among all states. The study used data from Google Trends, the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to estimate the number of hot dogs and hamburgers eaten annually in each state based on restaurant sales and 2017 populations.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Assembly has passed a bill that would limit the regulation of 5G, or “small cell,” technology. The bill approved Tuesday now heads to Gov. Tony Evers for his consideration. The Senate passed the bill 25-5 earlier this month. The proposal creates a statewide regulatory framework for the 5G technology, including provisions about where the small wireless facilities can be placed, height and size restrictions, and other requirements. In general, the bill prohibits local governments from regulating certain communications services or charging fees on infrastructure to support it. Bill sponsor Rep. Mike Kuglitsch said Wisconsin has been at a competitive disadvantage because neighboring states have already enacted similar laws. Supporters are calling for quick action to get the technology in place, especially before Milwaukee hosts the Democratic National Convention next year.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Nearly 100 people expressed opposition to any thought of demolishing the historic Cooper House on the University of Wyoming campus to make way for new student dormitories. The Laramie Boomerang reports that residents from across Wyoming had been mobilized in recent weeks after hearing that aask force working on a new student housing plan had discussed the possibility of tearing down the building. The task force heard more than an hour of public comment Monday, all from people who were opposed to Cooper House being demolished. Task force chairman Steve Harshman says he doesn’t think the Cooper House is in danger of being demolished.

This year’s midterm elections are offering voters an opportunity to shape public policy directly in the form of state ballot initiatives on major national issues.\n\nThe country witnessed the power of those referendums when voters in Kansas, typically considered a safe red state, rejected an anti-abortion measure by a decisive 61%-39% margin in the nation’s first test vote onthe volatile issue last August.\n\nWith the midterms at hand, voters are being asked to weigh in on reproductive rights, legalizing marijuana and even slavery.\n\nStay in the know:Get updates on these top ballot measures in your inbox\n\nEarly voting 2022 schedule: When early and in-person absentee voting starts in each state\n\nVoters will determine in at least five states whether to officially abolish involuntary servitude as a form of punishment, a question that could lead to a national rethinking on U.S. prison policy. Other ballot initiatives focus on the right to abortion and increasing minimum wage.\n\nMany of those topics have stalled in Washington, where gridlock has devoured reform efforts.\n\nBut whether through direct ballot initiative grown by grassroots organizations via petition or indirect referendums first raised by a state legislature, these measures could have major ramifications going forward.\n\nHere are the issues on the ballot to watch:\n\nAbortion access\n\nKansas voters overwhelmingly chose to uphold the right to an abortion in August, which has emboldened progressives hoping the momentum can mobilize their base through similar ballot initiatives elsewhere.\n\nNow at least four other states – California, Michigan, Kentucky and Vermont – will have similar questions for voters to consider.\n\nThe Michigan Supreme Court ruled that a proposed constitutional amendment on abortion rights must appear on the November ballot. Under the measure, Michigan voters will be able to explicitly enshrine a woman's reproductive rights in the state constitution.\n\nMontana is asking voters to decide rules around infants \"born-alive.\" The referendum deals with whether infants born alive at any stage of development will be considered \"legal persons.\"\n\nIf so, the proposal says, they must be provided medical care. Violators face a $50,000 fine and up to 20 years in prison.\n\nPoll: Most Americans want chance to support abortion rights on state ballot\n\nRoe v. Wade: Abortion to remain divisive issue in states, courts\n\nThe proposed amendments in California and Vermont, which already have liberal state laws ensuring abortion rights, encompass reproductive freedom as a whole including other protections such as guaranteeing access to contraceptives.\n\nVoters in Kentucky, a more conservative-leaning state, are being asked this November to restrict abortion rights by declaring that the state Constitution doesn’t recognize such access or require taxpayer funding of abortion.\n\nOutlawing slavery\n\nVoters in Alabama, Louisiana, Oregon, Tennessee and Vermont will decide whether to abolish slavery as a part of a larger criminal justice reform movement aimed at prison labor.\n\nThe 13th Amendment to the Constitution ended slavery and involuntary servitude when it was ratified in 1865. But a loophole allows it as punishment for someone convicted of a crime. Roughly 20 states have a similar exception.\n\nMost of the referendums ask voters to declare no form of slavery or involuntary servitude be permitted as a punishment for a crime.\n\nOthers go further, such as Alabama's question which seeks to remove \"all racist language\" from the state constitution. In Oregon, the amendment would add provisions allowing the state courts or parole agency to order alternatives to incarceration for a convicted individual.\n\nMore: As George Floyd Act's chances dim, Biden stays mum on police reform\n\nCriminal justice reform advocates say the referendums are more than symbolic and could spark larger changes for people who are incarcerated, such as paying them higher wages for prison work or ending forced labor altogether.\n\nIn 2018, voters in Colorado, Nebraska and Utah overwhelmingly struck down slavery and involuntary servitude through ballot initiatives.\n\nLegislation has been introduced in California, Florida, New Jersey, Ohio and Texas to put similar ballot questions before voters in future elections.\n\nDecriminalizing weed, psychedelics\n\nMultiple states will give voters a direct say over drug policies with ballot questions on decriminalizing marijuana and certain psychedelics.\n\nArkansas, North Dakota, South Dakota and Maryland are looking to legalize marijuana for residents age 21 or older.\n\nBut the provisions in some places go further.\n\nIn Missouri, the proposed amendment would decriminalize marijuana use and allow people convicted of non-violent cannabis offenses a chance to seek an early release from prison and have their criminal records expunged. It also seeks to impose a six percent tax on the sale of marijuana.\n\nNews: Marijuana is being legalized in parts of the U.S. That's not helping everyone with convictions\n\nPoll: Marijuana use is outpacing cigarette use for first time ever in U.S.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Oklahoma rejected a request that a measure on legalizing recreational cannabis gets voted on this November. But Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt set a statewide special election next March for voters to have a say.\n\nColorado has a ballot initiative asking voters whether the state should define certain psychedelic plants and fungi as natural medicine, including dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and mescaline.\n\nUnder the amendment, personal use, possession, transportation and growth would be legal for those age 21 or older. The changes would also create a regulatory agency that would oversee licensed healing centers to administer natural medicine services.\n\nMinimum wage, right to work rules\n\nNevada voters will be given a chance to give workers a pay raise this fall when they're asked to increase the minimum wage to $12 an hour for all employees. The state's floor for how much a person is paid currently sits between $9.50 to $10.50 per hour, depending on whether they have health insurance.\n\nIn 2019, the Nevada legislature passed a measure raising the minimum wage by increments without addressing the health insurance discrepancy. The ballot question will establish a flat rate for all regardless of their insurance status.\n\nMore: Nevada's minimum wage increases but is less of a living wage than a year ago\n\nNebraska secretary of state certified a ballot measure in September that would increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026 if approved.\n\nIn the District of Columbia, voters will decide whether to increase the minimum wage for tipped employees, such as restaurant servers, to match that of non-tipped employees.\n\nBeyond minimum wage, Illinois voters are being asked to establish a constitutional right to collective bargaining which would guarantee workers the right to organize a union.\n\nOn the opposite end of the political spectrum, Tennessee voters will weigh approving a right-to-work amendment to the state constitution which would prohibit workplaces from requiring labor union membership as a condition for employment.\n\nExpanded Medicaid, health care\n\nOne of the major debates about the Affordable Care Act from a decade ago was whether states would accept or reject federal incentives to expand Medicaid eligibility.\n\nAs of this year, 38 states and the District of Columbia have done just that with many doing so through ballot initiatives. Voters in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah, for example, did so in 2018.\n\nReport: 5 million to 14 million Americans could lose Medicaid coverage when COVID-19 pandemic ends\n\nMore: Uninsured rate hit record low of 8%, HHS analysis shows\n\nSouth Dakota, one of 12 states that has not expanded Medicaid, will have an opportunity thanks to a coalition of health care groups who joined forces this year to push the idea to the ballot box.\n\nUnder the amendment, adults 18 to 65 earning incomes below 133% of the federal poverty level would receive Medicaid. That is roughly $18,000 per person or $37,000 for a family of four.\n\nOther health care related questions are sprinkled around the country.\n\nIn Oregon, a ballot initiative would ensure every resident \"has access to cost-effective, clinically appropriate and affordable health care as a fundamental right.\"\n\nCalifornia voters will consider banning the sale of flavored tobacco products as well as legalizing mobile sports betting to use a portion of revenue generated for a homelessness prevention fund.\n\nStay in the know:Get updates on these top ballot measures in your inbox\n\nClimate change and emission tax\n\nIn 2020, multiple cities and states had ballot questions dealing with establishing policies around the environment.\n\nHeading into the fall elections this year, New York and California both have proposals that voters will be asked to consider.\n\nNew Yorkers are being asked to support the issuance of $4.2 billion in bonds for multiple projects related to the environment, such as flood-risk reduction, coastal shoreline restoration and land conservation.\n\nFor California, which has been beset by drought, wildfires and other climate change woes, the question is whether to levy a new tax for zero-emission vehicles and wildfire prevention programs.\n\nWhat's on your ballot? A complete guide to California propositions for the 2022 election\n\nUnder the proposed question, a 1.75% hike would be put on those making more than $2 million annually. That's projected to rake in $3.5-$5 billion, according to state analysts.\n\nAbout 45% of that money would go toward rebates for zero-emission vehicle buyers, especially for those in low-income areas. Another 35% of the new revenue is earmarked for building more charging stations.\n\nThe remaining 20% would be for the wildfire prevention and response actions.\n\nVoter IDs, early voting and election laws\n\nVoters will consider proposals in multiple states on voter identification, early voting and rules surrounding passing ballot initiatives.\n\nIn Connecticut, voters will decide if there is a constitutional amendment that permits in-person early voting.\n\nUnder a proposed question in Michigan, voters will decide on creating a nine-day window for early voting as well as making other changes to voting policies – such as requiring a photo ID or a signed affidavit to vote and requiring the state to provide secure drop boxes for all municipalities.\n\nA ballot proposal in Nebraska will determine whether a valid photo ID is required to vote for any election.\n\nArizonans will determine whether voters are required to provide a date of birth and a voter identification number for early ballot affidavits rather than just a signature. Voters will also weigh in on proposals related to passing ballot initiatives including whether the legislature can amend or repeal ballot measures approved by voters if deemed unconstitutional by the state or U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nVoting rights: New election laws could create barriers for voters with disabilities\n\nOne measure in Arizona would require a supermajority (three-fifths) vote to pass ballot initiatives that create a tax. A similar proposal in Arkansas would require a supermajority vote instead of a simple majority to adopt ballot initiatives.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2018/09/01/missouri-executive-order-44-mormon-war/1147461002/", "title": "Could you legally kill a Mormon in Missouri until 1976?", "text": "I recently met Walter J. Zabek at a luncheon at Cox South Hospital honoring Meals on Wheels volunteers.\n\nAs our paths briefly crossed — I was hustling out to get back to work — he asked me if I knew that it was once legal to kill a Mormon in Missouri.\n\nAlthough it was a question, it was not an Answer Man question. He stated the information as fact.\n\nIt did not sound like fact to me. I was skeptical.\n\nHistory begins with 1838 Mormon War\n\nBut I've discovered it is surprisingly close to the truth. In other words, it's nuanced and, in my view, the nuance is fascinating.\n\nThe truth of whether it was once legal to kill a Mormon in Missouri involves a history of which I previously knew nothing.\n\nIt includes the 1838 Mormon War in Missouri. I imagine if you are a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, you already knew this. I did not.\n\nI also knew nothing about the \"Extermination Order\" issued by the sixth governor of Missouri and directed at members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; the subsequent exodus of 15,000 church members in the winter of 1838-39; and the fact that Prophet Joseph Smith, who founded the faith, believed the Garden of Eden was in northwest Missouri and that when Christ returns at the Second Coming, it will be in northwest Missouri.\n\nMost of those forced from Missouri ended up founding a church settlement called Nauvoo, Illinois, on the Mississippi River, 58 miles north of Quincy.\n\nThey were subsequently forced out of Illinois and migrated to Utah. Smith was murdered in Carthage, Illinois.\n\nMore Pokin Around: 2nd Amendment grandma upset her granddaughter's new bike stolen off porch\n\n'Must be exterminated or driven from the state'\n\nMIssouri Executive Order 44, also known as the \"Extermination Order,\" was issued on Oct. 27, 1838, by Gov. Lilburn Boggs. Believe it or not, it states in part:\n\n\"The Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the state if necessary for the public peace — their outrages are beyond all description.\"\n\nThe order was part of the 1838 Mormon War in Missouri.\n\nAs a result,15,000 church members — about 90 percent of them living in northwest Missouri — left the state, leaving behind homes, livestock and crops.\n\nAmong them were Smith and a young man named Brigham Young, later known by some as the \"Mormon Moses.\" Young would later help found Salt Lake City.\n\nIt amazes me that the Extermination Order stood for 138 years. It was not until June 25, 1976, that Missouri Gov. Christopher \"Kit\" Bond rescinded it.\n\nThirty-four years later, Bond was recognized by the church. I found a 2010 news story in the Deseret News, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, in which Bond said:\n\n\"The treatment of the Mormon people in Missouri in the 1830s and beyond was barbaric. Women were raped and tortured. Men were killed by mobs or driven out of state. Their property was stolen. The lucky ones were those who were left alive with nothing and were forced to make their way into a more hospitable state.\"\n\n\"We cannot change history, but we certainly ought to be able to learn from it and where possible acknowledge past mistakes,\" he said. \"That was what motivated me to rescind the extermination order.\"\n\nWhen I first read the order this week, it seemed clear that Boggs knowingly issued a license to kill members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was astounded: it seemed similar to the Department of Conservation establishing a hunting season, but only for people.\n\nI called Jonathan Rimington, spokesman for the church. He seemed to read it the same way I did.\n\n\"You could have shot me on the streets with no repercussions,\" he says.\n\nBut it's not so clear that was Boggs's intent.\n\nOn Rimington's recommendation, I talked to John Lawson, who works for the church as director of the Springfield Institute of Religion.\n\nLawson says that while many members of the faith believe it was legal for 138 years to kill a Mormon in MIssouri, it's not true.\n\n\"There was no law that you could go out and kill people,\" he says. \"But you could force them to leave.\"\n\nIn 1838 parlance, Lawson says, the word \"exterminate\" primarily meant to \"force to leave an area.\"\n\nMormons were, in fact, killed in Missouri, he says, but those deaths were not necessarily linked to the \"Extermination Order.\"\n\n\"There were mini-skirmishes that took place up there between Mormons and old settlers,\" he says.\n\nMore Pokin Around:Assessor website a no go without the 'Mo'\n\nOne point of friction: Founder Smith opposed slavery\n\nThe friction had several causes — in addition to differences in religious views.\n\nWhile members of the church consider themselves Christians, in that they follow Jesus Christ, most other denominations do not consider members of the Church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints to be Christians, Lawson says.\n\n\"They say we follow Jesus Christ, but a different Jesus Christ.\"\n\nPerhaps more importantly than religious differences, there was friction because Joseph Smith opposed slavery, and Missouri was a slave state.\n\nIn addition, in the 1830s northwest Missouri was at the nation's frontier, Lawson says, and most residents were recent settlers who disliked government and people from the East Coast.\n\nMost church members settling into Missouri were from New England, Lawson says.\n\nWhile Lawson favors the interpretation of the word \"extermination\" as forced removal, not a license to kill, some disagree.\n\nI found a scholarly paper published in 2001 by William G. Hartley, a former associate professor of history and a research historian at the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Latter-day Saint History, at Brigham Young. He wrote:\n\n\"Extermination, a powerful word, means to eradicate but also implies killing. Governor Boggs's extermination order called for a nineteenth-century version of what in recent discussions of Serbian treatment to Kosovars is termed 'ethnic cleansing.'\"\n\nHartley likened the Extermination Order of 1838 to the 1830 Indian Removal Law, signed by President Andrew Jackson. It forcibly relocated Native Americans to lands west of the Mississippi, including 16,000 Cherokees in what is called the \"Trail of Tears.\"\n\nHarley also contends the Extermination Order lost all force of law once members of the church left Missouri.\n\nI asked Lawson the question that I believe gets to the heart of the matter: Was there any church member killed with impunity in Missouri after the Extermination Order was issued?\n\nAgain, the answer is nuanced.\n\nThe Extermination Order was issued on Oct. 27, and three days later, 17 church members — 15 men and two boys — were killed by 240 militiamen/vigilantes at Haun's Mill in Caldwell County. The church members were holed up in a blacksmith's shop. Some church members, including the boys, reportedly were slain after surrendering.\n\nAccording to Lawson, there is no record anyone was ever tried for murder in the incident.\n\nBut here's the nuance. Historians disagree whether the leaders of the militia even knew of the Extermination Order.\n\nAlexander L. Baugh is an associate professor of church history and doctrine at Brigham Young. He wrote:\n\n\"An examination of the sources indicates that there was no connection whatsoever with the governor's directive. There is evidence that the attack by the county regulators upon the LDS community was actually a response or a retaliatory strike directed against the Mormons because of the raid they conducted against local vigilante leaders and settlers living in Daviess County during the latter half of October.\n\n\"In short, their objective was to make the Mormons 'pay' for their most recent activities in Daviess — which payment would be in the price of human blood.\"\n\nMore Pokin Around: Having a 'Trumptastic' inauguration day\n\nThese are the views of News-Leader columnist Steve Pokin, who has been at the paper 6½ years, and over his career has covered everything from courts and cops to features and fitness.

The previous year, Maine was admitted as a \"free state,\" and Congress banned slavery in parts of the Louisiana Purchase territory north and west of Missouri.\n\nThe moves didn't prevent the Civil War. Two years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, delegates to Missouri's postwar constitutional convention finally outlawed slavery in the Show-Me State with an ordinance passed Jan. 11, 1865. Missouri's law passed 11 months before the 13th Amendment was ratified, definitively ending the practice of enslaving people on the federal level.\n\n\"It’s hard to envision what it was like 200 years ago, what it was like 150 years ago,\" said John Sellars, History Museum executive director, on Wednesday. \"You just have no concept of people’s frame of reference and why they would have made the decisions they made, knowing the horrendous outcome of it all. It’s hard for me as just Joe Public out here to make any kind of a judgment about it.\"\n\nAlmost two centuries after Missouri statehood, lawmakers in the 97th General Assembly tasked the State Historical Society of Missouri to mark the state's 200th birthday, and next year is expected to feature a variety of events around the state intended \"to promote a better understanding of Missouri and its regions, communities, and people, both past and present.\"\n\nIn a statement on the official bicentennial website, Missouri2021.org, Lt.

That sense of greatness is what makes being a Missourian so satisfying and rewarding.\"\n\nWorking with the Missouri Star Quilt Company and the Missouri State Quilters Guild, the state historical society set up a competition among amateur and professional quilters to represent Missouri diversity in quilt form.\n\nEach of Missouri's 114 counties, along with St. Louis city, is represented by a six-inch-by-six-inch block, said Mary Long, president of the Calico Clippers Quilting Guild of Stockton, in an interview with the News-Leader on Wednesday. The 20-year-old group counts 50 to 75 women among its membership, scattered from Cedar County \"almost down to Arkansas,\" in Long's words.\n\nMany are members of multiple guilds, Long said, and if the pandemic has had any benefit, it's allowed people to productively pursue their quilting. Many quilters create quilts in support of causes such as military veterans or families in need due to natural disaster or a cancer diagnosis, Long said. Sometimes they make lap quilts for folks using wheelchairs, face masks for police officers or even small individual quilts for kids to use at preschool naptime.\n\nMORE:Try the flea market route to make Christmas shopping fun\n\nLong, a retired second-grade teacher in Stockton, said she spent six weeks collaborating with fellow guild members Georgia Highley and Kay Patrick to prepare \"Cedar County Pleasures,\" 36 square inches of textile art celebrating Cedar County that state officials selected for inclusion in the traveling bicentennial quilt show. Competition was tough, Long said: There was at least one rival quilt block in Cedar County alone.\n\nPainstakingly, the Calico Clippers team hand-stitched bald eagles in the skies above Stockton Lake, along with sailboats on its waters. They performed \"thread painting,\" a free-motion way of using a sewing machine, to create an image of a leafy black walnut tree flanked by a basket of nuts, and they made sure the county's signature cedar trees were included in the background. A special quilt pattern known as a \"Missouri star block\" was added to represent the sun. Long said her trio was very attentive to the techniques used in making their block, favoring appliqué because \"embellishments\" like ribbons or buttons weren't allowed.\n\nMORE:Five scenic fall drives in the Ozarks\n\n\"I don’t think there’s a native Missourian among the three of us, so we researched Cedar County before we got started,\" Long, an Iowa native, said. \"We really had to make our block say Cedar County.\"\n\nThe quilt is arranged in geographical order, said Sellars, the museum director: \"Taney County is on the southern border; the northern counties are on the north border,\" he said. While many of the counties are portrayed with figurative images like the Calico Clippers' entry, some are more abstract. Greene County is a geometrical pattern, Sellars said, and other parts of the quilt include the state flag, the Route 66 logo and other regalia. All of the entries that were submitted and selected for the bicentennial quilt are available to view on Missouri2021.org.\n\nThe exhibit's Springfield run opened Wednesday and continues through Nov. 29, the History Museum announced late Tuesday. Sellars said that it's the first of several bicentennial events that the History Museum plans for 2021. Watch for \"The Struggle for Statehood\" in June, for example, Sellars said. In the meantime, he said the quilt show is a \"great\" tie-in with a forthcoming exhibit on local holiday decorations expected to open Nov. 21 as the Park Central Square Christmas tree is lit.\n\nFrom her home in Stockton, Long said that the Calico Clippers want to exhibit the Missouri bicentennial quilt at their annual show, tentatively scheduled for March 12-13 at Stockton's Ray H. Zumwalt Expo Center, if conditions permit.\n\n\"We can social distance a whole lot better\" than quilting guilds in larger communities, Long said.\n\nMORE:Dozens celebrate wins for Fogle, Biden, Harris in downtown Springfield\n\nAs a retired teacher, Long praised the traveling quilt's way of celebrating all of the places that make up Missouri and its complex history. She said if she were working in the classroom, she'd \"certainly\" include the state bicentennial for students.\n\n\"We want to learn the lessons of history,\" Long said, \"the bad as well as the good, so that we don’t we don’t repeat those mistakes again, so that we can hopefully solve, hopefully heal and move on.\"\n\n“Quilting is an American practice that started as a way to meet very practical needs by using all available scraps to keep a family warm and has evolved into a high art form,” said Joan Hampton-Porter, History Museum curator, in a Tuesday announcement. “This exhibit is an amazing opportunity for area residents to see construction techniques and historical content in each quilt block.”\n\nThe History Museum on the Square is open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday and 1-5 p.m. Sunday.

How their shapes were determined provides insight into how the United States became a nation like no other.\n\n24/7 Tempo has taken a look at how each state got its shape. We reviewed materials such as Mark Stein’s book “How the States Got Their Shapes” to find out how each state’s contours fit into the grand puzzle that is the United States of America.\n\nAccording to Stein, the most important influences that determined the shapes of the states were the American Revolution, the construction of railroads, the proposal for the Erie Canal, and the issue of slavery.\n\nThe American Revolution helped to define the shapes of the original 13 colonies. The outlines of the earliest states were often shaped by geographic boundaries, such as rivers. These are the oldest historic towns in every state.\n\nMy pandemic obsession:Why some of us have turned to compulsive shopping (and how to stop)\n\nStimulus checks sent to 156M Americans, including Social Security beneficiaries and 'plus up' COVID payments\n\nThe original 13 colonies vary in shape and size. This did not please Thomas Jefferson, who suggested that Congress create future states equal in size based upon latitude and longitude coordinates.\n\nThe construction of cross-country railroads and the Erie Canal helped dictate the contours of states where those modes of transport traversed.\n\nThe issue of slavery also helped shape states in the territory that was included in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. The Missouri Compromise of 1818 solidified the practice of determining state boundaries in the region based on where slavery was legal.\n\nThe two largest contiguous states, California and Texas, determined their own borders because of the political power they wielded and the concern that they might secede from the U.S. if a territorial dispute arose. As it turned out, Texas did end up seceding from the Union. Here’s how your state was founded.\n\n1. Alabama\n\n► Population: 4,887,871\n\n► Size (square miles): 50,645\n\n► Capital: Montgomery\n\n► Founded: Dec. 14, 1819 (22nd state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Edmund Pettus Bridge\n\nAlabama's boundaries were created in colonial times. In March 1663, King Charles II of England created the Carolina colony out of the larger colony of Virginia and placed the southern limit of the new colony at the 31st parallel, now Alabama's southern boundary with Florida. Georgia was created out of the Carolina colony, and Alabama would emerge from Georgia. Alabama got access to the Gulf of Mexico in 1804, the year after the Louisiana Purchase. That was when the U.S. announced that the area between the Mississippi River and the Perdido River in what was part of what had been called West Florida -- and was owned by Spain -- was claimed by the United States. That area that bordered the Gulf of Mexico would become part of southern Alabama.\n\n2. Alaska\n\n► Population: 737,438\n\n► Size (square miles): 570,641\n\n► Capital: Juneau\n\n► Founded: Jan. 3, 1959 (49th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Denali (formerly Mount McKinley)\n\nAlaska and Hawaii are the only two states that do not share a border with any other part of the U.S. Alaska is surrounded by the Arctic and Pacific oceans on its North, South, and West sides. Alaska's 1,538-mile eastern border runs along Canada's Yukon territory and British Columbia province. Russia sold Alaska to the U.S. in 1867. Russia and the British were engaged in a proto-Cold War at the time, and Russia decided to sell the territory that became Alaska to the U.S., which supported the Russian cause, instead of Canada, which was under British control at that time. The border between Alaska and Canada runs along the 141st Meridian.\n\n3. Arizona\n\n► Population: 7,171,646\n\n► Size (square miles): 113,594\n\n► Capital: Phoenix\n\n► Founded: Feb. 14, 1912 (48th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Grand Canyon\n\nArizona's current shape came to be in 1863, nearly 50 years before the area became a state. Arizona and New Mexico were split into separate territories when President Abraham Lincoln signed the Arizona Organic Act during the Civil War as a way to outlaw slavery in the new western areas the U.S. controlled. Its western border is marked by the Colorado River and its southern border was determined a decade earlier by the 1853 Gadsden Purchase in which the U.S. purchased a vast swath of land from Mexico.\n\n4. Arkansas\n\n► Population: 3,013,825\n\n► Size (square miles): 52,035\n\n► Capital: Little Rock\n\n► Founded: June 15, 1836 (25th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Hot Springs National Park\n\nArkansas borders Missouri to the north, Tennessee and Mississippi to the east, Louisiana to the south, and Texas and Oklahoma to the west. An act of Congress in 1819 created the state's northern boundary along the 36 parallel from the Mississippi River to the St. Francis River, then up the river to create the Missouri bootheel.\n\nArkansas' boundary between Tennessee and Mississippi was established after independence from England in 1795. Arkansas' boundary with Louisiana was also established when the Louisiana Purchase was divided in 1804 between the District of Orleans and the District of Louisiana. The 1819 treaty with Spain established Arkansas' western boundary after the Louisiana Purchase, and the border between Arkansas and Texas was set as running north from the Sabine River in Louisiana to the south bank of the Red River.\n\n5. California\n\n► Population: 39,557,045\n\n► Size (square miles): 155,779\n\n► Capital: Sacramento\n\n► Founded: Sept. 9, 1850 (31st state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Hollywood sign\n\nAside from its western border, which is the Pacific Ocean, California set its northern border along the 42nd parallel and the southern border was settled by the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo with Mexico. There was some sentiment among Californians to set the eastern boundary east of Salt Lake City, but others believed the federal government would not allow a state of that size. The northeast corner of the state was determined as where the 42nd parallel meets the 120th meridian, which includes the Sierra Mountains. California also could not extend eastward because Mormon settlers were already looking to establish their own territory.\n\n6. Colorado\n\n► Population: 5,695,564\n\n► Size (square miles): 103,641\n\n► Capital: Denver\n\n► Founded: Aug. 1, 1876 (38th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Pikes Peak\n\nColorado began as a rectangular state when Congress created its territorial boundaries in 1861. The borders were established between 37th and 41st parallels, and the 25th and 32nd longitudes. The area was taken from what would become Kansas, Utah, Nebraska, and New Mexico. The state became less of a rectangle later because of errors by surveyors.\n\n7. Connecticut\n\n► Population: 3,572,665\n\n► Size (square miles): 4,842\n\n► Capital: Hartford\n\n► Founded: Jan. 9, 1788 (5th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Mark Twain House\n\nThe original charter creating Connecticut's border issued by King Charles II in 1662 would have allowed Connecticut to claim most of Rhode Island, eastern Long Island, and all territory west to the Pacific Ocean. That was until New York was established by a patent to the Duke of York in 1664 and Connecticut lost claim to Long Island as a result. The western of the state border was settled in 1682, and Connecticut and Massachusetts resolved their border in 1826.\n\n8. Delaware\n\n► Population: 967,171\n\n► Size (square miles): 1,948\n\n► Capital: Dover\n\n► Founded: Dec. 7, 1787 (1st state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Mason Dixon Marker\n\nThe borders of Delaware, the nation's first state, were created as a result of the resolution of disputes between the state and with Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New Jersey. Delaware was deeded to William Penn from the Duke of York in 1682. Penn was granted all the lands west of the Delaware River within a 12-mile circle beginning in New Castle. The southern border was created by Maryland and Pennsylvania surveyors in 1751. The western border was determined by surveys by Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon of Mason-Dixon boundary fame in 1765. The Delaware River, Delaware Bay, and the Atlantic Ocean form the eastern border.\n\n9. Florida\n\n► Population: 21,299,325\n\n► Size (square miles): 53,624\n\n► Capital: Tallahassee\n\n► Founded: March 3, 1845 (27th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Castillo de San Marcos\n\nSpanish explorers first came to Florida in the 16th century, and the Florida Panhandle once stretched to the Mississippi River. Spain claimed to own the territories around New Orleans, but the U.S. also claimed ownership because of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. By 1819, most of this disputed land with Spain was in American possession via the Adams-Onis Treaty, making Florida part of the U.S. Over time, the border of the panhandle shifted eastward. Florida's northern boundary with Georgia is marked by a large mound of dirt called Ellicott's Mound, near the headwaters of the St. Mary's River. In 1859, Georgia and Florida appointed surveyors Gustavus J. Orr and B. F. Whitner to complete a survey of the border, and the Orr-Whitner line was accepted by Florida in 1861 and Georgia in 1866 as the boundary.\n\n10. Georgia\n\n► Population: 10,519,475\n\n► Size (square miles): 57,513\n\n► Capital: Atlanta\n\n► Founded: Jan. 2, 1788 (4th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Ebenezer Baptist Church\n\nGeorgia, founded by James Oglethorpe in 1732, defined its northeastern boundary as the beginning of the headwaters of the Savannah River. Georgia's southern boundary with Florida is marked by a large mound of dirt called Ellicott's Mound, near the headwaters of the St. Mary's River. In 1859, Georgia and Florida appointed Gustavus J. Orr and B. F. Whitner to complete a survey of the border. The Orr-Whitner line was accepted by Florida in 1861 and Georgia in 1866 as the boundary. Georgia's western boundary was established following an agreement over a land fraud dispute in the early 19th century.\n\n11. Hawaii\n\n► Population: 1,420,491\n\n► Size (square miles): 6,423\n\n► Capital: Honolulu\n\n► Founded: Aug. 21, 1959 (50th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Diamond Head\n\nHawaii was shaped by nature, in this case volcanic activity. The Hawaiian Islands were formed by a hot spot -- where Earth's tectonic plates come together and sometimes create a volcano -- in the middle of the Pacific Plate. British explorer James Cook arrived in Hawaii in 1778, and just over 100 years later, the U.S. made Hawaii a territory in 1898. The islands became the 50th state to join the Union.\n\n12. Idaho\n\n► Population: 1,754,208\n\n► Size (square miles): 82,643\n\n► Capital: Boise\n\n► Founded: July 3, 1890 (43rd state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Silver City\n\nIdaho's borders changed many times throughout the mid-1800s before finally giving the state its distinctive shape we know today. The land that makes up present-day Idaho was part of the Oregon Territory that was established in 1848 (the territory also included present-day Oregon, Washington, and parts of Montana and Wyoming). Five years later, Idaho's panhandle became part of the newly-designated Washington Territory. When Oregon became a state in 1859, it had the same borders as it does today, giving Idaho much of its western border.\n\nAfter gold was discovered in Idaho in 1860, miners began moving east to the area. Concerned about the growing mining country, Washington Territory managed to create the Idaho Territory in 1863, and its western border was established along the 117th Meridian. Idaho eventually obtained its current shape after losing some of its land when the Montana Territory was established in 1864, and it used the Bitterroot Mountains as a boundary, and the Wyoming Territory was formed in 1868.\n\n13. Illinois\n\n► Population: 12,741,080\n\n► Size (square miles): 55,518\n\n► Capital: Springfield\n\n► Founded: Dec. 3, 1818 (21st state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Wrigley Field\n\nIllinois' shape was determined by the issue of slavery. When it was a territory, the northern border of Illinois went east-west from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River. Nathaniel Pope, the Illinois Territory congressional delegate, introduced an amendment to the act of statehood that would eventually move the boundary farther north, adding 8,500 square miles. Pope wanted to keep Chicago in Illinois to strengthen links with eastern states and said a planned canal connecting the Illinois River to Lake Michigan could bring commercial opportunities to Illinois. In 1825, the Erie Canal opened, linking Lake Erie and all the Great Lakes to the Hudson River and New York. Congress accepted Pope's amendment, changing Illinois' destiny forever. Moving the borders farther north would also diminish the state's connection with slave states.\n\n14. Indiana\n\n► Population: 6,691,878\n\n► Size (square miles): 35,826\n\n► Capital: Indianapolis\n\n► Founded: Dec. 11, 1816 (19th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Madame C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company\n\nIndiana's northern boundary was created by the Enabling Act of 1816 that moved the state's border 10 miles north of the southernmost tip of Lake Michigan. This provided access to the Great Lake. Indiana would continue to have boundary disputes with Ohio and Michigan until the latter became a state in 1837. The Ohio River forms the boundary between Indiana and Kentucky, though the exact border was up for dispute until the Supreme Court settled the matter in 1980. The Wabash River forms the western border of Indiana.\n\n15. Iowa\n\n► Population: 3,156,145\n\n► Size (square miles): 55,857\n\n► Capital: Des Moines\n\n► Founded: Dec. 28, 1846 (29th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Terrace Hill\n\nIowa was originally supposed to be much larger than it ended up being. As Missouri was already a state, Iowa's southern border was fixed. Its original border proposal would have extended the state up to what is now the Twin Cities of Minnesota and set its eastern edge along the Mississippi River and its western edge along the Missouri River.\n\nThe territory, like many others in the mid-1800s, was forever changed by the fight over slavery. Northerners wanted Iowa and other states in the area to be small and numerous to increase the number of anti-slavery senators from new states, while Southerners wanted the opposite. Eventually, the two sides compromised, moving Iowa's northern border farther south and allowing the rivers to serve as the longitudinal boundaries.\n\n16. Kansas\n\n► Population: 2,911,505\n\n► Size (square miles): 81,758\n\n► Capital: Topeka\n\n► Founded: Jan. 29, 1861 (34th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Monument Rocks National Natural Landmark\n\nKansas might have been much bigger than its current size had the proposed larger territory gotten congressional approval. Its western boundary would have extended to the Rocky Mountains in the middle of what is now Colorado, and the northern boundary would be set at the Platte River. The battle between \"Big Kansas\" and \"Little Kansas\" supporters was eventually decided in \"Little Kansas\" favor as a result of the Wyandotte Constitution, which created the state of Kansas.\n\n17. Kentucky\n\n► Population: 4,468,402\n\n► Size (square miles): 39,486\n\n► Capital: Frankfort\n\n► Founded: June 1, 1792 (15th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Churchill Downs\n\nKentucky broke away from Virginia in 1792 and became the 15th state in the Union. The original border between Virginia and North Carolina was set by the British in the colonial era at 36'30\" north latitude and extended to the Mississippi River. However, subsequent surveying teams placed the boundary north by as many as 12 miles. This led to disputes between the two states that were resolved in 1820.\n\nA funky part of Kentucky's geography is The \"Kentucky Bend.\" Also called \"New Madrid Bend,\" it is part of Kentucky encircled on the north, east, and west by the Mississippi River, with the southern part bordering Tennessee. These 30 square miles of Kentucky were cut off from the rest of the state because of surveyor errors and earthquakes that shifted the river.\n\n18. Louisiana\n\n► Population: 4,659,978\n\n► Size (square miles): 43,203\n\n► Capital: Baton Rouge\n\n► Founded: April 30, 1812 (18th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Bourbon Street\n\nLouisiana became part of the U.S. as the result of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. At the time, its territory spanned from the Gulf of Mexico to part of present-day Canada and from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains. The River Sabine was set as the western boundary between Louisiana and Texas as outlined in the Louisiana Constitution of 1812. The Mississippi River forms Louisiana's eastern border with Mississippi. The northern border with Arkansas starts at 33 degrees north latitude and the south borders the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n19. Maine\n\n► Population: 1,338,404\n\n► Size (square miles): 30,842\n\n► Capital: Augusta\n\n► Founded: March 15, 1820 (23rd state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Portland Head Lighthouse\n\nMaine was split off from Massachusetts and admitted as a state in 1820 to offset the admission of slaveholding Missouri. Its border with Canada was heavily disputed for decades. The border was not well-defined in the treaty that ended the Revolutionary War, so the U.S. and the British compromised on the state's current boundary in 1842.\n\nWith most of its border running along Canada or the Atlantic Ocean, Maine's only American neighbor is New Hampshire. Though a 1740 decree from King George II supposedly set the border between them in the middle of the Piscataqua River, New Hampshire claimed that all of Portsmouth Harbor belonged to it and not Maine, forcing the Supreme Court to settle the dispute in 2001 in Maine's favor.\n\n20. Maryland\n\n► Population: 6,042,718\n\n► Size (square miles): 9,707\n\n► Capital: Annapolis\n\n► Founded: April 28, 1788 (7th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Fort McHenry National Monument\n\nMaryland has one of the most unusual shapes of any state. Though the state is small, it stretches 352 miles from Ocean City on the Atlantic Ocean to the Appalachian Mountains. A unique feature is the state's panhandle, which in some parts is 1 mile wide, separating Pennsylvania from West Virginia. The Mason-Dixon line, drawn by English surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, created the 233-mile boundary between Maryland and Pennsylvania. The Potomac River splits Virginia and Maryland. The borders of the two were determined in colonial times by various charters, agreements, and several Supreme Court rulings.\n\n21. Massachusetts\n\n► Population: 6,902,149\n\n► Size (square miles): 7,800\n\n► Capital: Boston\n\n► Founded: Feb. 6, 1788 (6th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Faneuil Hall\n\nThe boundary between Massachusetts and Rhode Island is a part of the original delineation of the territory granted to Sir Henry Roswell during the reign of King Charles I in the late 17th century. It has been a source of dispute for more than 200 years and has gone to the Supreme Court twice. Massachusetts' current northern boundary with New Hampshire was surveyed in 1741. The state's border with Connecticut was set by a joint commission authorized by acts passed by both states in 1905. The state's present boundary with New York was approved by Massachusetts in 1901 and New York nine years later.\n\n22. Michigan\n\n► Population: 9,995,915\n\n► Size (square miles): 56,538\n\n► Capital: Lansing\n\n► Founded: Jan. 26, 1837 (26th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Michigan Stadium\n\nMichigan joined the United States as part of the larger territory America gained from Great Britain after the American Revolution. Eventually Congress created the Indiana Territory, of which Michigan became a part, and then it became its own territory in 1805. Before it became a state, Michigan's legal boundary was established in an 1836 Act.\n\nSince then, Michigan has been involved in boundary disputes with Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Ohio but gained territory from Canada. Among the most notable disputes was a clash with Ohio in the 1830s over the Toledo Strip. Michigan hoped to gain Toledo and get access to Lake Erie. The federal government ruled in favor of Ohio. As part of the settlement, Michigan received the western portion of the Upper Peninsula, which had been part of Wisconsin Territory.\n\n23. Minnesota\n\n► Population: 5,611,179\n\n► Size (square miles): 79,626\n\n► Capital: St. Paul\n\n► Founded: May 11, 1858 (32nd state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Mall of America\n\nMinnesota's first boundary was formed before it was even a territory, when the 1783 Treaty of Paris established the border between the U.S. and Canada. The state's southern border was determined by the northern border of Iowa, which was decided in 1846, over a decade before Minnesota's statehood.\n\nThe state's eastern border runs along the Mississippi River, while the northern section of the western partition runs along the Red River. Where the river splits to form the Minnesota River, the boundary begins to run due south to the border with Iowa.\n\n24. Mississippi\n\n► Population: 2,986,530\n\n► Size (square miles): 46,923\n\n► Capital: Jackson\n\n► Founded: Dec. 10, 1817 (20th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Vicksburg National Military Park\n\nIn 1798, Congress created the Mississippi Territory. Its original boundaries consisted of the area between the Mississippi River in the west and Chattahoochee River in the east; the 31st parallel in the south; and the region where the Yazoo River empties into the Mississippi River in the north. In 1804, the northern boundary was extended to the Tennessee state line. Eight years later, the U.S. annexed more land along the Gulf of Mexico Coast. Mississippi shares a long eastern border with Alabama. When Mississippi joined the Union in 1817, Congress used the northwest corner of Washington County in Alabama as the main reference point for setting Mississippi's eastern boundary.\n\n25. Missouri\n\n► Population: 6,126,452\n\n► Size (square miles): 68,741\n\n► Capital: Jefferson City\n\n► Founded: Aug. 10, 1821 (24th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Gateway Arch\n\nMissouri became part of the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. The state borders eight states, and its current shape is the result of treaties, wars, and a Supreme Court ruling. The Mississippi River is Missouri's eastern border. The state's southern border is noted for the bootheel in the southeast, the result of lobbying by businessman John Hardeman Walker who wanted a small section of the border shifted farther south for commercial reasons and stay in the new state of Missouri and not in Arkansas Territory. Missouri's western border was put at Fort Osage on the Missouri River as part of a treaty with Native Americans. The northern boundary was a subject of dispute with the Iowa Territory and was not resolved until 1849 by the Supreme Court.\n\n26. Montana\n\n► Population: 1,062,305\n\n► Size (square miles): 145,545\n\n► Capital: Helena\n\n► Founded: Nov. 8, 1889 (41st state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Glacier National Park\n\nMontana owes its contours to Sidney Edgerton, the state's first territorial governor. Montana was split from the massive Idaho Territory that included what is now Idaho, Montana, and part of Wyoming. Lincoln chose Edgerton as chief justice of the Idaho Territory Supreme Court, and Edgerton was picked to make Montana's case to become its own territory. Edgerton proposed making Montana's western boundary along the Bitterroot Mountains, and as a result Montana, gained the riches of the Bitterroot Valley as well as the eventual wealth of Butte.\n\n27. Nebraska\n\n► Population: 1,929,268\n\n► Size (square miles): 76,824\n\n► Capital: Lincoln\n\n► Founded: March 1, 1867 (37th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Scotts Bluff National Monument\n\nThe current area that comprises the state of Nebraska is just a fraction of what the Nebraska Territory used to be. After being organized in 1854, the Nebraska Territory stretched from the Canadian border to present-day Kansas' northern boundary, in between the Rocky Mountains and the Missouri River. This area contained parts of modern Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska. The territory was gradually whittled down as the federal government introduced the Dakota, Idaho, and Colorado Territories. Nebraska actually grew after becoming a state in 1867, acquiring land from the Sioux Tribe in 1889.\n\n28. Nevada\n\n► Population: 3,034,392,\n\n► Size (square miles): 109,781\n\n► Capital: Carson City\n\n► Founded: Oct. 31, 1864 (36th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Hoover Dam\n\nNevada's borders have expanded since it joined the Union in 1864. The northern border where Nevada meets Idaho and Oregon is the oldest boundary in the West. The first southern boundary of the Nevada Territory was the 37th parallel, about 60 miles north of where Las Vegas is today. Nevada reached this southern point in 1867, when it took a section of the Arizona Territory. The northern section of the western border of Utah Territory, from which Nevada would be created, had been first established shortly after California's entry into the Union in 1850 at the 120th degree of longitude. The diagonal line with California is described by California's constitution as a straight line from the intersection of longitude 120 degrees with latitude 39 degrees down to the Colorado River at latitude 35 degrees.\n\n29. New Hampshire\n\n► Population: 1,356,458\n\n► Size (square miles): 8,952\n\n► Capital: Concord\n\n► Founded: June 21, 1788 (9th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Mount Washington\n\nNew Hampshire's shape traces its history back to the 1620s, when it was made a colonial settlement through a series of grants from the British Monarchy. It was initially smaller, running between the Piscataqua and Merrimack Rivers.\n\nNew Hampshire and Massachusetts engaged in a series of disputes about the size and control of the region throughout the 1600s and early 1700s that were finally settled in the 18th century by a royal decree from King George II. The state's eastern border with Maine was decreed to run through the middle of the Piscataqua River in 1740, but it was in dispute until a 2001 Supreme Court ruling settled it. New Hampshire's border to the west with Vermont was decided in 1790, when the state agreed to allow Vermont to have all lands to the west of the Connecticut River as Vermont was considering whether to join the United States, remain independent, or become a British colony.\n\n30. New Jersey\n\n► Population: 8,908,520\n\n► Size (square miles): 7,354\n\n► Capital: Trenton\n\n► Founded: Dec. 18, 1787 (3rd state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Washington's Crossing\n\nNew Jersey was originally a Dutch colony founded by Henry Hudson and called New Netherlands. Then the British took over in 1664. They divided the colony in half and gave control of the eastern portion to George Carteret and the western side to John Berkley. The land was renamed New Jersey after the Isle of Jersey of which Carteret had been governor. The Delaware River separates New Jersey from Pennsylvania in the west; the Hudson River provides the eastern border with New York; and the Delaware Bay divides New Jersey from Delaware.\n\n31. New Mexico\n\n► Population: 2,095,428\n\n► Size (square miles): 121,298\n\n► Capital: Santa Fe\n\n► Founded: Jan. 6, 1912 (47th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Palace of the Governors\n\nThe southern border of New Mexico with Mexico was established following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 that ended the Mexican-American War. To organize the lands the U.S. got from Mexico, Congress passed The Compromise of 1850. This established a straight line at 37 degrees latitude north as the territory's northern border. Part of the western border of the New Mexico Territory was the Colorado River. The border in the east between New Mexico and Texas was established by The Compromise of 1850.\n\n32. New York\n\n► Population: 19,542,209\n\n► Size (square miles): 47,126\n\n► Capital: Albany\n\n► Founded: July 26, 1788 (11th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Times Square\n\nAfter the British took the colony of New York from the Dutch, they controlled a region that included present-day New York state, the western half of Connecticut and Massachusetts, and all of Vermont. Present-day New York took shape after Vermont became its own state in 1789 and Connecticut and Massachusetts expanded west. The state has mostly natural river and lake borders to its west and north. New York had a dispute along its southern border with Pennsylvania, which wanted the 43rd parallel latitude as the boundary instead of the 42nd. That would have put Buffalo in Pennsylvania. However, New York prevailed.\n\n33. North Carolina\n\n► Population: 10,383,620\n\n► Size (square miles): 48,617\n\n► Capital: Raleigh\n\n► Founded: Nov. 21, 1789 (12th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Kitty Hawk\n\nAn Atlantic Coastal state, North Carolina's northern and southern boundaries were determined even before the U.S. declared independence. The Carolina Province was split from Virginia by Charles II in 1663 along the 36th parallel. The border was adjusted in 1665 and again in 1728.\n\nNorth and South Carolina were considered to be separate territories before the 1700s, but the dividing line was not made official until 1737. That border was adjusted several times throughout the late 1700s and early 1800s.\n\n34. North Dakota\n\n► Population: 760,077\n\n► Size (square miles): 69,000\n\n► Capital: Bismarck\n\n► Founded: Nov. 2, 1889 (39th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Border monuments on Dakotas border\n\nThe western part of what is now North Dakota was part of the Louisiana Purchase. Its northern boundary with Canada was set at the 49th parallel as determined by the Treaty of Peace in 1818. The Red River comprises the eastern border of North Dakota and separates the state from Minnesota. The western boundary is based on longitudinal measurements and the line is the 27th meridian. The southern boundary split the Dakota Territory into North and South Dakota and is almost 362 miles long.\n\n35. Ohio\n\n► Population: 11,689,442\n\n► Size (square miles): 40,860\n\n► Capital: Columbus\n\n► Founded: March 1, 1803 (17th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame\n\nOhio was the first state created out of the Northwest Territory, so its shape was largely determined by its southern and western neighbors and surrounding bodies of water. Its entire southern border as well as much of its eastern edge run along the Ohio River. The portion of the state border that runs north-south was set by the preexisting border of Pennsylvania. The western border extends north from where the Great Miami and Ohio Rivers meet.\n\nOhio's northern boundary mostly runs across Lake Erie. The rest was supposed to be delineated by an \"east-and-west line drawn through the southerly bend or extreme of Lake Michigan,\" according to Congress in 1787, but lawmakers were using an inaccurate map, so Ohio extends a bit farther north than it was supposed to.\n\n36. Oklahoma\n\n► Population: 3,943,079\n\n► Size (square miles): 68,594\n\n► Capital: Oklahoma City\n\n► Founded: Nov. 16, 1907 (46th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Price Tower\n\nThe borders of Oklahoma, one of the last states to join the Union, were determined by the issue of slavery and relations with Native Americans. The state affixed its western boundary on the 100th meridian in 1930 after a series of failed attempts to find the meridian. The northern border was settled in 1861, when Kansas became a state and lawmakers set the boundary at 37 degrees latitude. The panhandle of Oklahoma -- one of its distinguishing characteristics -- was sold to the federal government in 1850 by Texas. Texas did this because as a slave state, it did not want its northern border to go above the 36 1/2 parallel, which would have violated the Missouri Compromise. Until 1890, when it was attached to Oklahoma Territory, the panhandle was a lawless land. Oklahoma's southern boundary, the south bank of the Red River, was not officially settled until 2000 with the signing of the Red River Boundary Compact.\n\n37. Oregon\n\n► Population: 4,190,713\n\n► Size (square miles): 95,988\n\n► Capital: Salem\n\n► Founded: Feb. 14, 1859 (33rd state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Mount Hood\n\nWith tensions rising between the U.S. and Britain, the two countries in 1846 signed a treaty that gave the U.S. all the territory from the 42nd parallel to the 49th parallel and as far east as the Continental Divide. The geographical region was named the Oregon Territory in 1848 and included what are now the states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and western Montana. Oregon joined the Union in 1859 with its current boundaries. Some wanted to limit Oregon's eastward boundary to the Cascade Mountains, but that proposal was rejected.\n\n38. Pennsylvania\n\n► Population: 12,807,060\n\n► Size (square miles): 44,742\n\n► Capital: Harrisburg\n\n► Founded: Dec. 12, 1787 (2nd state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Independence Hall\n\nOne of the 13 original colonies, Pennsylvania's borders consistently expanded for about a century after the land was chartered to William Penn in 1681. The Delaware River still separates it from its eastern neighbors New York and New Jersey, as it did in the 1600s. Pennsylvania added vast swaths of land throughout the 1700s, expanding westward until finally acquiring the northwestern part of the state that runs across Lake Erie in 1792.\n\nPennsylvania was involved in an eight-year border dispute with its southern neighbor Maryland. The dispute was finally settled with the establishment of the Mason-Dixon line, which would go on to become the dividing line between North and South in the Civil War.\n\n39. Rhode Island\n\n► Population: 1,057,315\n\n► Size (square miles): 1,033\n\n► Capital: Providence\n\n► Founded: May 29, 1790 (13th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: The Flying Horse Carousel\n\nRhode Island was created after the Puritans in Massachusetts Bay Colony banished Roger Williams, who set up a colony founded on religious tolerance. The Connecticut-Rhode Island border was disputed all through the 17th and 18th centuries. Both states' legislatures ratified a survey taken in 1840. Another survey begun in 1940 and interrupted by World War II was not ratified by either state's lawmakers, though Rhode Island has long observed it. Connecticut continues to honor the 1840 survey. The border of the Ocean State was originally established by surveyors Nathaniel Woodward and Solomon Saffery, who had been tasked with marking Massachusetts Bay Colony's southern border, a straight line west from a point three miles south of the southernmost branch of the Charles River. Block Island Sound is on Rhode Island's southern border.\n\n40. South Carolina\n\n► Population: 5,084,127\n\n► Size (square miles): 30,060\n\n► Capital: Columbia\n\n► Founded: May 23, 1788 (8th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Fort Sumter\n\nSouth Carolina and North Carolina were one colony until 1729, when they separated and became their own colonies. Border disputes arose, and the two colonies created a commission to settle the dispute. They agreed that the boundary should begin 30 miles south of Cape Fear and a straight line should run northwest until it reached the 35th parallel and then go west to the Pacific Ocean. Surveying errors forced a correction and the boundary was moved 17 miles north of the 35th parallel and west to the Saluda Mountains. The southern boundary had been established by the second Carolina charter in 1665, placing that border near where Daytona Beach, Florida, is today. The Atlantic Ocean is to the east of South Carolina.The Savannah River comprise the western border between South Carolina and Georgia.\n\n41. South Dakota\n\n► Population: 882,235\n\n► Size (square miles): 75,811\n\n► Capital: Pierre\n\n► Founded: Nov. 2, 1889 (40th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Mount Rushmore\n\nSouth Dakota's eastern boundaries were set by the states that came before it. The northern section of its eastern border runs along the Bois de Sioux River, then goes due south and meets up with the Big Sioux River. Its southern border was determined by the northern border of Nebraska, which was set at the 43rd parallel to the Missouri River.\n\nThe dividing line of the Dakotas is set at the northern tip of the Coteau des Prairies plateau.\n\nSouth Dakota's western edge was set at the 104th meridian back when it was part of the Dakota Territories.\n\n42. Tennessee\n\n► Population: 6,770,010\n\n► Size (square miles): 41,234\n\n► Capital: Nashville\n\n► Founded: June 1, 1796 (16th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Graceland\n\nLandlocked Tennessee borders eight states. At one time, the Mississippi River was its western border. But the river has meandered, causing confusion with neighboring states Missouri and Arkansas. The Supreme Court has ruled that the western border of Tennessee can't be shifted because of geographic changes caused by river movements.\n\nAs for the southern border, in 1818 Georgia and Tennessee appointed University of Georgia professor James Camak and Tennessee mathematician James Gaines to survey the border of their respective states. When Congress voted to make Tennessee a state in 1796, it set the boundary between Georgia and Tennessee at 35 degrees north latitude. Camak and Gaines put the border about a mile south of 35 degrees north. That border continues west to the Mississippi River.\n\nTo the east is North Carolina, from which northeast Tennessee separated in the 18th century. Its northern border was created during the colonial era when the British Crown declared that the border between North Carolina and Virginia would be 36 degrees, 30 minutes north latitude. That line continued west when Kentucky and Tennessee were established.\n\n43. Texas\n\n► Population: 28,701,845\n\n► Size (square miles): 261,231\n\n► Capital: Austin\n\n► Founded: Dec. 29, 1845 (28th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: The Alamo\n\nThe independent Republic of Texas once stretched into present-day Wyoming before it was pared down for statehood. A treaty with Spain mandated that Texas' eastern border traces the path of the Sabine River until the 32nd parallel, then due north to the Red River, west to the 100th meridian, then north again.\n\nTexas' southern boundary was set along the Rio Grande after the land was acquired through the Treaty of Velasco in 1836 after Texas won the war for its independence. After nine years of independence, Texas began the process of becoming a U.S. state. It got its distinctive shape after the Compromise of 1850, when it sold some of its northwestern land area in exchange for the U.S. taking on its massive debt load.\n\n44. Utah\n\n► Population: 3,161,105\n\n► Size (square miles): 82,169\n\n► Capital: Salt Lake City\n\n► Founded: Jan. 4, 1896 (45th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Monument Valley\n\nThe land where Utah is now located was ceded from Mexico in 1848. Mormon settlers moved there from New York years before to try to leave the relatively new U.S. The Mormons wanted to form their own state, called Deseret, but Congress shrunk the land and named it Utah. From 1850 to 1861, the Utah Territory included all of present-day Utah, as well as parts of Nevada, Wyoming, and Colorado.\n\nAfter silver was discovered in Nevada, it became its own state. The same happened when gold was discovered in Colorado and in Wyoming. Utah's border with Wyoming was established along the 111th meridian, giving Utah its distinctive shape and the borders it now has to this day.\n\n45. Vermont\n\n► Population: 626,299\n\n► Size (square miles): 9,216\n\n► Capital: Montpelier\n\n► Founded: March 4, 1791 (14th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Rudyard Kipling House-Naulakha\n\nVermont had been part of the colony of New York, but when the king of England ruled in favor of New York over land disputes, Vermonters declared themselves a republic in 1777. Led by Ethan Allen, the fledgling nation even tried to join the province of Quebec during the Revolution but was rejected. After the war ended, Vermont paid New York money to settle land claims, and it was admitted to the Union in 1791. The Vermont-New Hampshire border meanders along the Connecticut River that forms a major part of Vermont's eastern border. Vermont's southern border with Massachusetts is basically a straight line on the 42nd latitude and its shortest boundary.\n\n46. Virginia\n\n► Population: 8,517,685\n\n► Size (square miles): 39,490\n\n► Capital: Richmond\n\n► Founded: June 25, 1788 (10th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Arlington National Cemetery\n\nVirginia was the first colony settled by the English in 1607, and since that time, its size has changed. In 1792, nine counties called the Kentucky District of Virginia broke away from Virginia and became their own state. In 1863, the western counties of Virginia split to become the state of West Virginia. The Potomac River divides Virginia and Maryland. The borders between the two were determined in colonial times by various charters, agreements, and several Supreme Court rulings. Virginia also has territory on the southern part of the Delmarva peninsula because of aggressive claims by Surveyor General of Virginia Edmund Scarborough in the late 17th century. The Virginia-North Carolina border was delineated in 1665 as the 36° 30\" parallel of latitude and was resolved in two major joint survey efforts in 1728 and 1749. The Atlantic Ocean is to the east of Virginia.\n\n47. Washington\n\n► Population: 7,535,591\n\n► Size (square miles): 66,455\n\n► Capital: Olympia\n\n► Founded: Nov. 11, 1889 (42nd state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Space Needle\n\nSitting at the northwestern tip of the contiguous U.S., Washington's northern border with Canada and western boundary with the Pacific Ocean were in place well before it became a state. The area that is now Washington joined America as part of the Oregon Territory in 1848.\n\nIn just a few years, people in the northern part of the Oregon Territory felt neglected by their legislators, and in 1853, Congress allowed for the creation of the Washington Territory, which includes present-day Washington, Idaho's panhandle, and part of western Montana. Washington was reshaped to its current borders in 1863, when the Idaho Territory was established, though it would have to wait more than 25 more years as a territory before gaining statehood.\n\n48. West Virginia\n\n► Population: 1,805,832\n\n► Size (square miles): 24,038\n\n► Capital: Charleston\n\n► Founded: June 20, 1863 (35th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: The Greenbriar\n\nIn 1863, the western counties of Virginia split to become the state of West Virginia. The state's eastern border runs along the Mason-Dixon Line. The state has two panhandles. The Northern Panhandle was formed by the Ohio River along West Virginia's western border. The southern section of the Eastern Panhandle was created after West Virginia separated from Virginia. To the north, the Potomac River and the North Branch of the Potomac River create a natural border.\n\n49. Wisconsin\n\n► Population: 5,813,568\n\n► Size (square miles): 54,157\n\n► Capital: Madison\n\n► Founded: May 29, 1848 (30th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Lambeau Field\n\nWisconsin was included in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and it used to make up a vast landmass in the Midwest when it was called the Wisconsin Territory. That area included present-day states of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and the eastern half of the Dakotas. The Upper Peninsula was part of the Wisconsin Territory, but the federal government took that away from Wisconsin in 1836 and gave it to Michigan to help resolve a dispute with Ohio. Chicago would have been in Wisconsin had not Illinois lobbied to move its border northward. The Mississippi River forms a section of Wisconsin's western border, while Great Lakes Superior and Michigan border Wisconsin to the north and east, respectively.\n\n50. Wyoming\n\n► Population: 577,737\n\n► Size (square miles): 97,093\n\n► Capital: Cheyenne\n\n► Founded: July 10, 1890 (44th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Old Faithful\n\nUnlike many territories that later became states, Wyoming's shape never changed throughout its time as a territory. The rectangular state was made from parts of the Dakota, Idaho, and Utah territories and used longitudinal and latitudinal lines to mark its borders. The state's borders run along the 104 and 111 degrees west longitude lines and 41 and 45 degrees north latitude lines.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

The post came a day after a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was removed in Charlottesville, Virginia, the site of a violent white supremacist rally in 2017.\n\n“So you can stop basing your hate for an entire race for the actions of a mere 1.6%,” the 2019 Twitter post says. “Am I right?”\n\nNot exactly. PolitiFact and Snopes have previously evaluated similar claims that popped up in 2017 and 2019, respectively.\n\nMore:How an accidental encounter brought slavery to the United States\n\nData archived from the 1860 census shows the 1.6% is slightly off. But historians say the bigger issue is that measuring slaveholders as a percent of the total population is misleading because slavery was illegal in most states by that point. Where it was still legal, slavery was far more widespread than the number in the post indicates, they said.\n\nFact check:Decades-old essay about Declaration of Independence signatories is partly false\n\n“You can use statistics to demonstrate a lot of things that aren’t relevant or true,” said Calvin Schermerhorn, a history professor at Arizona State University. “When you search for context the context very quickly arrives in terms of what was actually going on.”\n\nThe user who posted the original tweet and the Facebook user who shared it on July 11 did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNumber minimizes extent of slavery\n\nIn 1860, slavery was still legal in 15 of the 33 U.S. states, and slaves represented nearly a third of the population in those slaveholding states.\n\nAt the time, the total U.S. population was about 31.4 million, including more than 3.9 million slaves. That left about 27.5 million free people in the U.S., according to 1860 data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe U.S. had 395,216 slaveholders at that time, so about 1.4% of free people were classified as slave owners in the 1860 census, according to data archived by the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series at the University of Minnesota. That’s slightly different from the 1.6% in the July 11 Facebook post.\n\nHistorians, though, say that statistic is hugely misleading since it both wrongly factors in the entirety of the non-slave-owning states and ignores that families owned and had power over slaves, not just one individual adult.\n\nUsing total population as a reference point also includes babies and children, for example, said Stephanie McCurry, history professor at Columbia University. Doing so is “clearly designed to make that form of property seem marginal. It wasn’t,” she said.\n\nEvaluating the share of households that owned slaves in seceding states is “a much more effective means,” said Joseph Glatthaar, history professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. In 1860, nearly 20% of households in seceding states owned slaves, he said.\n\n“To break it down about how many U.S. citizens owned slaves is absurd,” Glatthaar said in an email.\n\nIf you only focus on who technically owned slaves, though, a better metric would be to evaluate the proportion of slave owners in the 15 states where slavery was still legal in 1860, Arizona State's Schermerhorn said.\n\nMore:Court clears way for removal of Confederate statue at the center of deadly Charlottesville 'Unite the Right' rally\n\nAbout 5% of people in those states were considered slaveholders, the data shows. That’s nearly three times higher than the number shared in the post.\n\nBut Schermerhorn said even that minimizes the number of white people who benefitted from slavery. For example, the patriarch of a family might have been counted as the slave owner in the census, but other members of the household had authority to commit “violence with impunity” on enslaved people, he said.\n\nSlaves also were rented out. So while a slave owner was only counted once, other people and businesses, including railroad companies, could benefit from slavery as well, Schermerhorn said.\n\nOur rating: Missing context\n\nThe claim that only 1.6% of U.S. citizens owned slaves in 1860 is MISSING CONTEXT, based on our research. The stat itself is slightly off: Census Bureau data from that period shows about 1.4% of free people owned slaves in 1860. Historians, though, say that grossly underrepresents the extent of slavery in the U.S. before the Civil War because it includes babies, children and people in states where slavery was illegal in the calculation. Slavery was illegal in all but 15 states by 1860. A more accurate way to portray the extent of slavery would be to note 20% of households in seceding states owned slaves, even though the individual owner was counted as only one person in that household.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Its popularity peaked in the postwar U.S., prior to the civil rights movement. It became a signature lawn ornament for white families, particularly in the South, although decades of scrutiny over the statue’s racist overtones sapped its popularity.\n\nThe Facebook post, which includes a photo of a Black lawn jockey, asserts the statues were used in the Underground Railroad, with the statues' colors offering different messages to runaways searching for freedom. The post also claims the statues were “largely a northern thing” until Northerners \"moved south\" after World War II, and that they became a symbol for Southern whites sympathetic to the civil rights movement.\n\nThough more than a year old, the post regained traction in mid-February, when it had more than 7,000 shares.\n\nFollow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks\n\n“Thank you, this is a valuable piece of learning. You cannot always believe what you hear from people,” one user commented Feb. 14.\n\nOther Facebook posts similarly invoke the Underground Railroad signpost explanation. In 2019, an account for Harriet Tubman Tours, for example, reiterated the claim. The claim has also long appeared in newspaper opinion sections and sources within reported pieces.\n\nBut experts consider the revisionist history highly dubious and say there is “little to no” evidence to support claims that the statues were part of any conspicuous signaling system. Instead, the statues are a relic of Jim Crow, a period of state-legitimized anti-Black racism predominantly in the South.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the Facebook users who shared the post for comment.\n\nExperts say claim doesn't add up\n\nExperts say there is no proof Black lawn jockey statues were regularly used in the Underground Railroad.\n\nKenneth W. Goings, a professor emeritus at Ohio State University who has written on the depiction of Black Americans in the decorative arts, told USA TODAY in an email the claim is \"completely false.\" He said it's not consistent with what scholars know about the production history of these statues.\n\n\"I have read and have had students read dozens and dozens of narratives of escaped slaves, histories of the Underground Railroad and African Americans living in the North and South. Not once did anyone mention lawn jockeys,\" he said.\n\nMore:Is it racism or justice? The legal tangle behind a Black woman's six-year sentence for voter fraud.\n\nOther scholars agree with him.\n\nDavid Pilgrim – founder and curator of the Jim Crow Museum, a collection of racist artifacts at Ferris State University – wrote in a 2008 piece that the Underground Railroad narrative fails basic logical tests.\n\nFirst, the color codes would have had to be interpretable by both runaway slaves and those who sought to help them, but not by the bounty hunters sent to capture them after the second Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. The statues, he added, would not have been valuable signals in the nighttime, when runaway slaves often traveled.\n\nFact check:Photo of woman holding rifle on bus not taken recently in Ukraine\n\nPilgrim also noted that, while some versions of the claim use modern interpretations of color – such as green for safety and red for danger – those interpretations would not have applied in much of the 19th century. That's because they developed after the emergence of the railroad, decades after the end of slavery in the U.S.\n\nThough “it is possible that someone used the lawn jockey in” the capacity described in the Facebook post, Pilgrim wrote in 2008 that “there is no evidence that this practice was commonplace.” The Jim Crow Museum restated its negation of the claim in a 2020 article.\n\nNo evidence statue had northern origins, role in civil rights movement\n\nExperts say several other claims in the post also ring hollow.\n\nThe post asserts that, after World War II, Black lawn jockey statues were used \"mostly to show that the white homeowners supported early civil rights efforts\" and were initially \"largely a northern thing.\"\n\nBut Goings wrote in his 1994 book “Mammy and Uncle Mose” that the popularity of the Black lawn jockey in that era came from the statue’s value as a signpost of class and racial positioning for white Americans in suburban communities.\n\nAt an October 2021 panel on the history of the Black lawn jockey at the National Sporting Museum, Goings dismissed the idea that the statues were not a part of the Jim Crow South. He said the statues were meant to reinforce the racial hierarchies in place in the South, to elevate white residents and demean Black ones.\n\n“These objects I see as an attempt to show African Americans as comical and miniature human beings and, more importantly, still happy to be working for their masters,” he said.\n\nMore:'An intergeneration issue': Why a rising gap between Black and white homeownership will only keep growing\n\nScholars on the panel, including Goings, said these types of statues were likely not widespread until the rise of southern consumerism many decades after the end of the Civil War.\n\n“As a cast-iron object that's being manufactured, they weren’t cheap,” Claudia Pfeiffer, deputy director of the National Sporting Museum, said during the panel.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nBased on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that Black lawn jockey statues are remnants of the Underground Railroad. Experts say they have found no proof to support any link to the Underground Railroad. They also say it's unreasonable to think the statues could have been universally understood by runaway slaves and their supporters but not by those opposing them. Instead, experts say the statues were a signpost of class and racial positioning for white Americans in suburban communities.\n\nSources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Iowa City, Waterloo, Cedar Rapids and Cedar Falls each declared Juneteenth a holiday in 2020, while the state of Iowa has recognized Juneteenth as a state holiday since 2002.\n\nCelebrating the June 19, 1865, anniversary of the emancipation of enslaved people in Texas, Juneteenth was first celebrated nearly three years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nDwana Bradley, the general chairperson of Iowa Juneteenth Observance, said she is glad to see more cities recognizing the holiday, which she views as a Fourth of July-type holiday for African Americans.\n\n\"We can't stop educating people about the history of Juneteenth and the importance it has for African Americans,\" she said. \"For each city in the state of Iowa that recognizes that, it puts a little more pressure on the country for this to be a federally recognized holiday.\"\n\n(Update: President Joe Biden signed legislation making Juneteenth a federal holiday after this article published.)\n\nBradley said Iowa Juneteenth Observance started celebrating the holiday on Saturday this year and will wrap up its festivities on the holiday, making it a weeklong celebration for the first time in the state's history.\n\nMetro cities recognize Juneteenth\n\nBradley said Juneteenth has been celebrated in Iowa since 1990, when Iowa Juneteenth Observance was founded. Since she became the group's leader in October 2015, she said the celebrations have grown and adapted — especially in the last year.\n\nDes Moines announced on March 22 that the city would recognize Juneteenth as an official holiday, closing city buildings and offices each year on June 19 or the adjoining weekday when the date falls on a weekend.\n\nMore:Juneteenth celebrations growing in 2021 in the Des Moines metro\n\nAl Setka, a spokesperson for the city of Des Moines, said this is the first year Des Moines has recognized the holiday in the city.\n\nIndianola Mayor Pamela Pepper also made history by recognizing Juneteenth as an official city holiday via a mayoral proclamation at the June 7 Indianola City Council meeting.\n\nFormer Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack recognized Juneteenth as a state holiday back in 2002, but most cities in Iowa wouldn't recognize the holiday until 2020, after the Black Lives Matter protests and increased calls for racial justice garnered the holiday even wider recognition.\n\nBradley said she applauds Indianola and Des Moines for taking the step, but added that Juneteenth's recognition is \"overdue.\"\n\n\"We have a lot of places doing this big talk of diversity, equity and inclusion and wanting to make people feel a part of (the community),\" she said. \"What better way than to take the step that Indianola and Des Moines have taken. I hope to see this gravitate to other cities, as well.\"\n\nPepper said she agrees that Juneteenth, as a recognized holiday, is getting more momentum as more people and cities recognize it than did in the past.\n\n\"I love that we are just trying to educate people,\" she said. \"It's not forcing people to take this on and have to participate, but educating people about different cultures, different people and different backgrounds.\"\n\nPepper said she sees her job as representing all different types of people and thinks recognizing more holidays is a small, but important, step. She said Indianola will also issue its first LGBT Pride month proclamation at its next city council meeting, on Monday, June 21.\n\nPepper said Indianola will not take the extra step of closing city buildings, like Des Moines will, because there hadn't been any conversations with other city officials. She said the city might close public buildings for the holiday in the future.\n\nShe said that, while recognizing more holidays is important to making people feel welcome, the city is also talking with activists to bring back a human and civil rights commission, which was phased out in the early 2000s.\n\nWhile Indianola and Des Moines took the step to recognize Juneteenth for the first time, other central Iowa cities, including Ankeny and Norwalk, considered it but ended up choosing not to make official proclamations this year.\n\nAmy Baker, Ankeny's communications director, said the city won't issue a proclamation this year, but Renee Potts, from the Ankeny Community Action Network, spoke at the last city council meeting during the public forum about Juneteenth and the Juneteenth event that her group is planning.\n\nNorwalk City Manager Luke Nelson said in an email that Lindsey Offenberger, Norwalk's City Clerk, and Mayor Tom Phillips were working together to craft a proclamation for Juneteenth on the June 17 city council agenda. Offenberger later said the city doesn't plan to issue a proclamation this year.\n\nIowa Juneteenth celebrates holiday for one week starting Saturday\n\nBradley said Iowa Juneteenth Observance is taking a whole new approach this year, in celebrating the holiday for an entire week. She said the move is partly due to the ongoing pandemic, but also a result of her always having wanted to have a weeklong celebration.\n\n\"Every day there will be something different,\" she said.\n\nOn Saturday, the celebration kicked off downtown with a \"Health Day,\" featuring health instructors and health advocates speaking at Western Gateway Park and a vaccination clinic.\n\nLeading up to Saturday, June 19, there will be other events like a drive-in movie at the new Valley West drive-in theater in West Des Moines on Monday, with plans to show a free screening of Hidden Figures at 6 p.m.\n\nOther groups in Des Moines are joining in on the Juneteenth celebration, including the Des Moines Black Liberation Movement, which is holding its second annual celebration at the Wilkie House at 4 p.m. on Saturday.

Last year, Juneteenth became the latest federal holiday in the US – the first to be approved since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983.\n\nWith Juneteenth now a national holiday, many public and private sector employees enjoy an extra day off from work while brands and corporations capitalize on the event with celebratory marketing campaigns. But there’s much more to Juneteenth than a long weekend and branded products.\n\nAs Black Americans continue to face the same challenges and inequities that inspired so many to take to the streets in 2020, it’s worth reflecting on the history behind the holiday.\n\nIt celebrates the end of slavery\n\nJuneteenth – also known as Juneteenth Independence Day, Freedom Day and Emancipation Day – commemorates the end of slavery in the United States.\n\nA blend of the words June and nineteenth, it marks June 19, 1865: the day that Union Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas, and issued General Order No. 3, proclaiming that the enslaved African Americans there were free.\n\n“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free,” the order read. “This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor.”\n\nFreedom for the enslaved people of Galveston, Texas, came two-and-a-half years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which couldn’t be enforced in areas under Confederate control. It also came about two months after Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered to the Union Army at Appomattox Court House, Virginia – an event generally considered to be the end of the Civil War.\n\nHow it’s celebrated\n\nWhat began as an informal celebration of freedom by locals in Galveston eventually grew into a wider commemoration of the end of slavery as African Americans in Texas moved to other parts of the country. Today, many African Americans mark Juneteenth with parties, parades and gatherings with family and friends.\n\nTexas became the first state to make Juneteenth a state holiday in 1980. In addition to it being a federal holiday, all 50 states and Washington, DC, recognize Juneteenth in some form.\n\nAs Juneteenth has made its way into the mainstream, some activists and leaders point to the systemic inequities that Black Americans continue to face, such as the racial wealth gap, disproportionate incarceration and longstanding health disparities. One coalition of civil and human rights groups, in particular, is acknowledging the holiday by installing a pan-African flag in front of the White House and calling for a commission to study reparations.\n\nAs many of those calling for widespread changes suggest, observing Juneteenth might then be an opportunity to reflect on how far the nation has come – and how much further there is to go.", "authors": ["Harmeet Kaur"], "publish_date": "2022/06/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/01/oregon-lawmakers-vote-recognize-juneteenth-official-holiday/7496573002/", "title": "Oregon State Senate votes to recognize Juneteenth as an official ...", "text": "Oregon lawmakers voted unanimously Tuesday to recognize Juneteenth, a day recognizing the Emancipation Proclamation, as a state holiday every June 19, starting in 2022.\n\nThe holiday commemorates June 19, 1865, the day enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, were told President Abraham Lincoln had freed people held in bondage in rebel states two years earlier. The passage of the bill, introduced by Oregon Gov. Kate Brown earlier this year, falls on the same day as the 100th anniversary of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, when hundreds of Black residents of Tulsa, Oklahoma were attacked or killed by a white mob.\n\n“With House Bill 2168, we can learn from another time,\" said Sen. Lew Frederick in/ a statement released by Oregon Senate Democrats. \"We can change the future now, in real time. We can work towards equality – even without a declaration or official holiday.

Florida was next in 1991, followed by Oklahoma in 1994 and Minnesota in 1996.

Both Floyd and Taylor were Black. Their deaths spotlighted ongoing racial inequities in the justice system as well as the legacy of slavery in encounters between Black people and the police.\n\nThis month, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey authorized Juneteenth as a holiday for workers in the state, joining 47 other states that already recognize it as a holiday.\n\nWhat is the significance of Juneteenth? Here's what we know:\n\nWhat is Juneteenth?\n\nThe holiday commemorates the Emancipation Proclamation in the U.S. President Abraham Lincoln issued the proclamation to free enslaved African Americans in secessionist states on January 1, 1863, but enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, would not learn of their freedom until two years later.\n\nOn June 19, 1865, Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger informed the community of Galveston of Lincoln's proclamation. Though it was issued years prior, enslavers were held responsible for telling the enslaved they were free, and some ignored the directive. Maj. Gen. Gordon demanded Galveston locals comply with the proclamation.\n\nWhy is it called Juneteenth?\n\nTexas was the last Confederate state where the proclamation was announced, and the first to recognize the date of June 19 – Juneteenth – statewide. The inaugural Juneteenth to commemorate the official day enslaved people in Galveston were freed began in 1866. The holiday, also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day, spread across the country as African Americans migrated away from the South.\n\nWhy is Juneteenth important?\n\nIt is a lesser-known fact that the Emancipation Proclamation did not result in all enslaved African Americans being freed. Juneteenth is part of recognizing the conditions underwent by some Americans unknowingly liberated by law. The proclamation, moreover,guaranteed freedom to enslaved people in secessionist states like Texas, but not Union states like Maryland, which did not secede during the Civil War. The 13th Amendment, ratified in 1865, freed all enslaved people in the country.\n\nWhen did Juneteenth become a federal holiday?\n\nCongress passed The Juneteenth National Independence Day Act in June 2021, a day after the Senate passed the bill with unanimous consent. Biden signed the bill into law on June 17 – two days before Juneteenth.\n\nThe federal government followed the lead of 47 states that already recognized Juneteenth.\n\nSen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., first introduced the Juneteenth bill in 2020 in the wake of the murders of Floyd and Taylor, but it did not pass.\n\n\"Today’s Senate passage of our legislation to commemorate Juneteenth as a federal holiday will address this long-ignored gap in our history, recognize the wrong that was done, acknowledge the pain and suffering of generations of slaves and their descendants, and finally celebrate their freedom,\" Markey said on June 17 of last year.\n\nUnder the act, federal employees are granted a day off on June 19. This year's work reprieve falls on Monday, June 20 because June 19 falls on a Sunday.\n\nDo people celebrate the holiday? Is it OK to say 'Happy Juneteenth'?\n\nJuneteenth is celebrated nationwide with parades, barbecues, competitions for \"Miss Juneteenth,\" rodeos, races and block parties, according to Juneteenth.com, a resource website. A reading of the Emancipation Proclamation is also commonplace.\n\n\"Happy Juneteenth Day\" is considered an appropriate greeting to mark the occasion, according to the website. The color red is also symbolic. It is featured on the red, white and blue Juneteenth flag and symbolizes that \"from the middle passage to George Floyd, our blood has been spilled across America,\" according to Steve Williams, president of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation.\n\nThe foundation has planned a Juneteenth Freedom Festival to be held June 17-19 in Washington, D.C.\n\nReach out to Chelsey Cox on Twitter at @therealco.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/06/18/noem-issues-juneteenth-proclamation-some-south-dakotans-push-state-recognized-holiday/3212781001/", "title": "Some South Dakotans push for state-recognized Juneteenth holiday", "text": "Gov. Kristi Noem has proclaimed Friday as Juneteenth Day in South Dakota to commemorate the end of slavery in the United States.\n\nJuneteenth has been celebrated by cities and states since shortly after the 13th Amendment was passed in 1865. The first official state recognition of the holiday was by Texas in 1980, growing to 47 states over the next 40 years.\n\nSouth Dakota remains one of three states that don't recognize Juneteenth as an annual state holiday or observance. Noem's proclamation only recognizes Juneteenth Day for 2020 and doesn't make it a permanent state-recognized holiday.\n\nThousands of former Union Army soldiers settled in the Dakota Territory following the Civil War and many of those veterans joined the Grand Army of the Republic, a fraternal organization that advocated for equal treatment of Blacks. Many early South Dakota leaders, including Gen. William Henry Harrison Beadle and Gov. Arthur C. Mellette, were Union Army veterans, according to Noem's proclamation.\n\n\"It is fitting and proper for all South Dakotans to celebrate this milestone toward achieving the American ideal that 'all men are created equal,'\" she wrote in the proclamation.\n\nThis year, the annual celebration of freedom comes amid protests against police brutality and racism after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. An increasing number of cities and states — such as Philadelphia and New York state — plan to observe it as a holiday and give employees the day off for future Juneteenth celebrations. There has also been a recent push to make Juneteenth a federal holiday.\n\nWhat to know about Juneteenth: :Holiday marking Emancipation Proclamation takes on extra importance in 2020\n\nSeeking the next stage\n\nOn June 19, 1865, Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger informed the community in Galveston, Texas, that President Abraham Lincoln had freed enslaved people in rebel states with the Emancipation Proclamation more than two years earlier.\n\nAlthough slaves were free effective Jan. 1, 1863, slave owners were responsible for telling slaves that they were free, and some owners ignored the order until Union troops arrived to enforce it, said Steve Williams, president of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation. Texas was the last Confederate state to have the proclamation announced.\n\nSouth Dakota, North Dakota and Hawaii are the only states that don't recognize Juneteenth as a state holiday or observance. Both Noem and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum signed proclamations this week declaring Friday as Juneteenth Day.\n\nProclamations are good, \"but they're not the final stage,\" said Deborah Evans, spokeswoman for the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation. She said she's glad South Dakota is taking the step with the proclamation, but it's not considered a recognized holiday yet.\n\nSen. Reynold Nesiba, D-Sioux Falls, plans to propose a bill during the 2021 legislative session to permanently add Juneteenth to the list of state recognized holidays.\n\nCelebrating Juneteenth isn't limited to people who are the descendants of freed slaves, Nesiba told the Argus Leader. The day celebrates the \"inclusive values of a more perfect union\" and bringing the country closer to \"liberty and justice for all.\"\n\nAt this particular time, it's important for South Dakotans to understand the nation's history, of which emancipation is \"a powerful part,\" he said.\n\n'We are still trying to get free':Black Americans continue fight for equality on Juneteenth\n\n\"This is an American idea,\" Nesiba said. \"Slavery was an important part of our history, and the end of slavery and what has happened since that period is also an essential part of our history. Juneteenth is that a celebration of a group of people learning that they had been emancipated.\"\n\nRep. Tom Pischke, R-Dell Rapids, disagreed with Nesiba on Facebook on Wednesday night, saying that Juneteenth becoming a state holiday would divide the state because it celebrates only a group of South Dakotans. He also said he doesn't believe South Dakota should recognize Native American Day.\n\n\"I don't think we should concentrate on anything that potentially divides us even more,\" he wrote on Facebook.\n\nPischke declined to comment any further to the Argus Leader.\n\n'Little bit of ignorance'\n\nAlthough Sioux Falls residents have celebrated the day locally for years, it's time for the state to recognize the day, said Mark Blackburn, president of Establishing Sustainable Connections and dean of students at Augustana University.\n\n\"I think it's a little bit of ignorance, and it's contradictory to what our state prides itself on in terms of inclusivity and opening up to the community,\" Blackburn said. \"The Black community is part of this community as well.\"\n\nMalcom Chapman, a professional speaker and former Rapid City councilor, is a member of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation and said he introduced the topic nearly 15 years ago, but nothing came of the discussions. He started to reintroduce the topic to legislators again this year.\n\n\"I think it's important that we recognize all of the people that have made contributions to this country, and we just need to acknowledge that freedom, that independence,\" Chapman said. \"I think it's important.\"\n\nThough the story of Texas' emancipation is the most widely known, Williams said, other significant events in the history of emancipation took place on and around that date. He said the first known Juneteenth celebrations began in 1866 and spread across the country as African Americans migrated to new cities.\n\nChapman is working with the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation to get the day recognized as a holiday in South Dakota. The organization's mission is to educate about Juneteenth and ultimately have it recognized as a federal holiday.\n\n\"Juneteenth is about unification of the American people,\" Williams said.\n\nAnalysis:Why modeling that predicted COVID-19 hospital overflow missed badly\n\nJuneteenth in Sioux Falls\n\nThe Sioux Falls Juneteenth celebration will be virtual this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The celebration is usually held at Terrace Park, Blackburn said.\n\n\"That is the true freedom day for the Black community,\" Blackburn said. \"Knowing the history of the country and where we are at right know, this day needs to be celebrated because it's similar to the Fourth of July. Independence. It's the exact same thing for African Americans in this country as well.\"\n\nBut Blackburn questions if Black citizens are truly free, grappling with America's long-standing history of systemic racism.\n\n\"You think about our country's history with slavery,\" Blackburn said, referencing the slow announcement among states of the Emancipation Proclamation. \"Especially where we are today, there's always been this underlying tone and mindset of keeping things as is.\"\n\nDuring the virtual event, Blackburn said there will be both celebratory and educational pieces. Community leaders will speak to the importance of the day, including Mayor Paul TenHaken; Vaney Hariri, co-founder of a Sioux Falls-based consulting firm that specializes in leadership development; and Laura Renee Chandler, director of the South Dakota African American history museum.\n\nAt the end, Blackburn plans to call attendees to action — addressing issues of systemic racism throughout America, including barriers for people of color in cities like Sioux Falls.\n\n\"We really need to get a handle on this,\" Blackburn said. \"We need to understand the significance of diversity, inclusivity and understanding ways we can get along and move forward from history.\"\n\nAlthough Noem's proclamation isn't an official state recognition, the observation is a start, supporters of the movement said.\n\n\"I'm sure it'll get done in South Dakota, just like all those other states,\" Williams said. \"I have no hesitation that it will be accomplished.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/17/ohio-observe-juneteenth-state-holiday-first-time-june-18/7739946002/", "title": "Ohio will observe Juneteenth as state holiday for first time Friday", "text": "Ohio will observe Juneteenth as a state holiday for the first time on Friday, after President Joe Biden signed federal legislation designating June 19 a federal holiday.\n\nThe federal legislation, passed quickly this week, means the day is automatically recognized as a state holiday in Ohio, Gov.

This year's celebrations come amid a culture war.\n\nIn a statement, Markey said the U.S. has \"failed to acknowledge, address, and come to grips with our nation’s original sin of slavery.\"\n\n\"Today’s Senate passage of our legislation to commemorate Juneteenth as a federal holiday will address this long-ignored gap in our history, recognize the wrong that was done, acknowledge the pain and suffering of generations of slaves and their descendants, and finally celebrate their freedom,\" he said.\n\nToday, 47 states and the District of Columbia observe the date in some manner.

The protest movement sparked an ongoing dialogue around systemic racism and police brutality.\n\nThe protests also raised attention for the importance of Juneteenth as companies including Nike, Twitter and Uber are giving employees paid days off.\n\nWith 144 million Americans fully vaccinated against COVID-19, many will gather in person after celebrating virtually in 2020.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the history of Juneteenth and what celebrations are taking place this year.\n\nWhat is Juneteenth?\n\nOn June 19, 1865, Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger informed a reluctant community in Galveston, Texas, that President Abraham Lincoln had freed enslaved people in rebel states two and a half years earlier. He pressed locals to comply with the directive.\n\nAlthough Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation became effective Jan. 1, 1863, people who owned slaves were responsible for telling them that they were free, and some ignored the order until Union troops arrived to enforce it, according to Cliff Robinson, founder of Juneteenth.com. Texas was the last Confederate state to have the proclamation announced.\n\nThough the story of Texas' emancipation is the most widely known, other significant events in the history of emancipation took place on and around that date. Steve Williams, president of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, said the first known Juneteenth celebrations began in 1866 and spread across the country as African Americans migrated to new cities.\n\nHer grave was paved over and her story hardly known:She was the first Black person freed by Lincoln, long before his presidency.\n\nStarting in 2022:Oregon State Senate votes to recognize Juneteenth as an official holiday\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed legislation Thursday marking Juneteenth as a federal holiday, effective immediately. Before Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Juneteenth was recognized as either a state or ceremonial holiday in 48 states and Washington, D.C.\n\nIn pop culture, Juneteenth celebrations have been seen in TV shows including \"Black-ish\" and \"Atlanta.\"\n\nWhat is Juneteenth's flag?\n\nThe original Juneteenth flag was created in 1997 by Ben Haith, the founder of the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation. The flag has a blue and red stripe with a white star in the middle, an outline surrounding the star, and an arc that extends across the width of the flag.\n\nAccording to Oprah Daily, the star in the middle is supposed to represent the \"Lone Star State\" of Texas where Juneteenth was first celebrated. The arc is supposed to symbolize a new horizon of opportunities and futures for the Black community, and the outline surrounding the star is supposed to mean a new beginning for all. The colors on the flag are the same as the U.S. flag to show that former enslaved people and their descendants are free Americans, too.\n\nThe flag underwent revisions in 2000, according to the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, and the date \"June 19, 1865,\" was added in 2007.\n\nHaith initiated the first Juneteenth flag-raising ceremony in Boston in 2000. Flag-raising ceremonies have become an essential part of the holiday in states including Tennessee and Texas.\n\nWhat celebrations are taking place?\n\nPeople across the country will be celebrating Juneteenth with parties, music, festivals and parades.\n\nNew York on Friday will kick off its annual Juneteenth three-day summit, where 5,000 people attended in person in 2019, and 20,000 attended virtually in 2020. The festival will feature talent show performers, a health and wellness screening center, educational activities for children and much more.\n\nThe Smithsonian Museum of African American Culture and History in Washington, D.C., will hold presentations on the history and significance of Juneteenth and the stories that celebrate the wisdom of elders.\n\nIn addition to celebrations, Juneteenth is a time for reflection and conversation. You can listen to dialogue centered around race and equality and contribute to the conversation in a positive way. Supporting Black-owned businesses, listening to Black artists, reading books written by Black poets and authors, and donating to organizations are other ways to celebrate Juneteenth.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/15"}]}

Still, expectations for Biden were sky high among Democrats after Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock won run-off elections in Georgia to become the Peach State’s senators and flip the chamber to the Democrats, giving the Democrats control of Congress by the narrowest of margins.\n\nOver the last year, Biden managed to get some of his top priorities passed through Congress but remains stymied on others, leaving him with less than a year to work with Democrats to pass his legislative agenda before the next Congress is sworn-in following the 2022 midterm elections. He also used his executive branch powers to sign 77 executive orders in his first year in office, outpacing his predecessors former President Donald Trump, who signed 58 executive orders in the same time; former President Barack Obama, who signed 41; and former President George W. Bush, who signed 56, according to data from the Federal Register.\n\nHere are the top five bills Biden signed into law this year, his top five executive orders and the top five things he will prioritize in 2022.\n\nFive marquee laws Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. The American Rescue Plan Act and extending existing Covid-19 programs\n\nUS President Joe Biden signs the American Rescue Plan on March 11, 2021, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC. - Biden signed the $1.9 trillion economic stimulus bill and will give a national address urging \"hope\" on the first anniversary of the start of the coronavirus pandemic. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBiden signed the American Rescue Plan, a sweeping $1.9 trillion package, into law in early March. The series of measures – which make up one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in decades intended to bolster the US’ recovery from the coronavirus pandemic – included stimulus payments of up to $1,400 per person for about 90% of American households, a $300 federal boost to weekly jobless benefits and an expansion of the child tax credit of up to $3,600 per child.\n\nThe plan, which did not receive support from any Republicans in Congress, also included $350 billion in state and local aid, as well as billions of dollars for K-12 schools to help students return to the classroom, to assist small businesses hit hard by the pandemic and for vaccine research, development and distribution.\n\nThat same month, Biden also signed two bills extending existing economic relief during the pandemic. He signed legislation into law extending the Paycheck Protection Program – the federal government’s key relief effort to deliver aid to small businesses hard hit by the pandemic. He also signed through the COVID-19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension Act, which extended temporary bankruptcy relief provisions granted by the CARES Act.\n\n2. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\n\nBiden signed the legislation into law in November, which infuses $1.2 trillion dollars into Americans’ traditional “hard” infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. The bill’s passage was marked at a White House event with lawmakers from both parties.\n\nThe legislation provided $550 billion in new federal investments for American roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports and waterways. The package also included $65 billion for improving broadband infrastructure and billions for improving the electric grid and water systems. Another $7.5 billion is going toward establishing a nationwide network of plug-in electric vehicle chargers.\n\nThe “hard” infrastructure package is part one of a two-part infrastructure plan proposed by Biden. The second portion, a $1.75 trillion economic and climate package called “Build Back Better,” has yet to pass in the Senate.\n\n3. Bills to avoid a government shutdown and keep the federal government running\n\nBiden signed two stopgap measures – one in late September and one in December – to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nDecember’s extension, which came just hours before a midnight deadline, marked the end of an impasse over some Republican senators’ objections to Biden’s Covid-19 vaccine requirements. Funding in the December stopgap bill extends through mid-February.\n\nIn December, Biden also signed a bill raising the national debt limit by $2.5 trillion and extending it into 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the President signed two emergency provisions for funding in July and September – the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act and the Emergency Security Supplemental Appropriations Act.\n\nThe first provided additional emergency funding to address the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, financial needs arising from the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and expenses incurred at the US Capitol as a result of the pandemic. The second bill provided funding for disaster relief and Afghanistan evacuees, among other appropriations.\n\n4. Juneteenth National Independence Day Act\n\nBiden signed a bill into law in the summer establishing June 19 as Juneteenth National Independence Day – a US federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the US.\n\nThe Juneteenth holiday commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union Major General Gordon Granger announced the end of slavery in Galveston, Texas, in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. Efforts to establish Juneteenth as a federal holiday gained momentum following Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd.\n\nJuneteenth is the first federal holiday established since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983 and becomes at least the 11th federal holiday recognized by the US federal government.\n\n5. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act\n\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which banned imports from China’s Xinjiang region, was signed into law in December.\n\nThe new law bans imports unless an importer can prove the goods were not made with forced labor in the region of the country accused of human rights violations over its treatment of Muslim-majority Uyghurs.\n\nFive significant executive orders Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. Reversing Trump-era policies\n\nThe first days of the Biden administration were marked, largely, by a reversal of actions taken by the Trump administration. Biden campaigned, in part, on dismantling his predecessor’s legacy, and moved quickly to undo some of Trump’s policies starting on day one. In his first 100 days in office, Biden signed more than 60 executive actions, 24 of which were direct reversals of Trump’s policies.\n\nIn his first hours after he was inaugurated, Biden halted funding for the construction of Trump’s border wall, reversed his travel ban targeting largely Muslim countries and embraced progressive policies on the environment and diversity that Trump spent four years blocking. Biden also reversed several of Trump’s attempts to withdraw from international agreements, beginning the process of rejoining the Paris climate accord and halting the United States’ departure from the World Health Organization. And he imposed a mask mandate in federal buildings, a symbolic break with Trump’s handling of the pandemic.\n\nBiden later revoked Trump-era executive orders targeting TikTok and other Chinese apps, another aimed at “Preventing Online Censorship,” and an order to build “the Garden of American Heroes” announced by Trump during an Independence Day celebration at Mount Rushmore in 2020.\n\n2. Vaccine requirements\n\nPerhaps the most controversial executive action taken by Biden in the past year was his effort to mandate Covid-19 vaccinations or testing for large businesses, an effort ultimately thwarted by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn September, as part of a push to get more Americans vaccinated, Biden directed the Labor Department to require all businesses with 100 or more employees to ensure their workers are either vaccinated or tested once a week. He also signed an executive order requiring all government employees to be vaccinated, with no option of regular testing to opt out. And he required the 17 million health care workers at facilities receiving funds from Medicare and Medicaid to be fully vaccinated, expanding the mandate to hospitals, home care facilities and dialysis centers around the country.\n\nAs companies rushed to implement policies, the requirement was met with nearly immediate court challenges. And last week, in a devastating blow to the administration, the Supreme Court blocked the requirement for large businesses, but allowed the mandate for certain health care workers to go into effect nationwide. However, the action may have led to some increased vaccinations despite its failure. Citigroup, for instance, reported 99% compliance with its vaccine mandate.\n\n3. Gun control\n\nWhile talks on Capitol Hill have failed to produce any breakthroughs on gun reform legislation, Biden has sought to take some actions on gun control in his first year, which comes amid a record-breaking spike in homicides and gun violence.\n\nUS President Joe Biden speaks about gun violence prevention in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, DC, on April 8, 2021. - Biden unveiled measures aimed at curbing rampant US gun violence, especially seeking to prevent the spread of untraceable \"ghost guns.\" BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLast year, Biden took a limited set of steps directing his administration to tighten restrictions on so-called ghost guns and pistol stabilizing braces that allow the weapons to be used more accurately. He also expanded background checks for certain types of guns, made new investments in intervention programs for violence-prone communities, and created model “red flag” legislation for states to pass.\n\nBiden campaigned on sweeping actions to curb gun violence, but those actions fell short of more significant reforms requiring legislation. Biden and top administration officials have repeatedly called on Congress to pass a bill on background checks, one aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of abusers and the Build Back Better Act, which includes programs for community violence intervention, but those bills remain stalled.\n\n4. Climate targets\n\nBiden leveraged his executive power in December to direct the federal government to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, a step toward meeting his stated climate goals as his sweeping Build Back Better agenda, which has significant climate provisions, remains stalled in Congress.\n\nThe executive order directed the US government to buy clean energy, purchase electric vehicles, and make federal buildings more energy efficient. The federal government maintains 300,000 buildings, drives 600,000 cars and trucks in its vehicle fleet and spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year. That action came after Biden pledged that the US will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% below its 2005 levels by 2030.\n\n5. Improving government processes\n\nBiden also took steps last year to streamline government services, aiming to improve the customer experience on a variety of services run by the federal government that can be frustrating and time-consuming; for instance, waiting in line at the airport, renewing your passport, filing taxes, the process of retiring, paying back student loans, applying for a small business loan, changing your name and using telehealth services.\n\nThat order, signed in December, directed 17 federal agencies to focus on more than 30 key areas where Americans can expect more efficient services and less hassle. The reform efforts are organized around major life experiences, from having a child to surviving a natural disaster. Notably, Americans will be able renew passports online. And it will allow tax filers to schedule a customer support call-back when they are trying to reach the IRS for help. Those actions, officials said, would be completed within the year.\n\nBiden’s top five 2022 priorities\n\n1. Covid-19\n\nHow Biden handles the coronavirus pandemic is the defining issue of his presidency. Nearly two years into the pandemic, the US is grappling with a surge of the Omicron variant, with cases and hospitalizations again on the rise in many states across the country.\n\nThe administration will soon be making one billion at-home rapid tests available to Americans for free after it received criticism for test shortages amid the Omicron surge. The President has also said his administration will distribute 400 million high-quality masks to Americans for free to help stop the spread of the virus. The administration also continues to allocate $1.9 trillion in funds from the Democrats’ Covid-19 emergency relief law the President signed into law last year.\n\nDespite the administration rolling out a national vaccination program last year and vaccines being free and readily available to Americans, the President faces a steep challenge in getting the rest of the country vaccinated. Tens of millions of Americans are bucking the advice of health and medical experts and refuse to get the shot, as disinformation about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines runs rampant throughout the nation.\n\n2. Build Back Better\n\nThe centerpiece of Biden’s domestic agenda – a nearly $2 trillion climate and economic spending package – remains stalled in the Senate amid opposition from Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. The massive piece of legislation includes key party priorities that Democrats want to deliver before the midterm elections in November and while they still have control of the House, Senate and White House.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said the chamber will vote on a revised version of the package that the Democrat-led House has already passed and said, “We will keep voting on it until we get something done.” What the package ultimately looks like remains uncertain. But in the current bill, most of the funding is focused on reducing the cost of child and health care and combating the climate crisis. It would create universal pre-kindergarten, send families an enhanced child tax credit and provide beefed-up subsidies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\n\nThe White House will also be focusing this year on implementing the bipartisan infrastructure law – the first part of Biden’s two-part infrastructure plan – and touting the benefits of the law to the American people ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n3. Voting rights\n\nThe President and congressional Democrats are under pressure to pass legislation to safeguard voting access amid a push by Republicans across the nation to make it harder for people to vote. The Democratic-led House has approved a measure that combined key provisions of two major voting bills – the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act – but its fate remains uncertain in the Senate.\n\nThe problem is Democrats don’t have the votes to pass the voting legislation under the current Senate rules because of Republican opposition and they also do not appear to have the votes to change those rules. Manchin and Sinema have been steadfast in their opposition to changing the filibuster rules, which require 60 votes to end debate on legislation.\n\nThe President recently ramped up efforts on the issue and delivered a forceful speech in Atlanta vowing to protect voting rights and calling on the Senate to amend the filibuster rules.\n\n4. Inflation\n\nPrices rose at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years last month as the US economy continues to struggle to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. Global supply chain issues, worker shortages and high consumer prices are all contributing to the economic anxiety currently gripping the United States and causing Biden’s approval ratings to dip.\n\nThe White House has taken several steps to attempt to mitigate supply chain issues and lower prices for Americans, including extending hours and speeding up operations at key ports and assembling a task force dedicated to the issue. In an attempt to lower high gas prices, Biden directed the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve – the largest release from the reserve in US history – in coordination with other major countries. The Omicron variant is now threatening to put renewed pressure on global supply chains and exacerbate existing issues that the administration will be working to manage this year.\n\n5. Foreign policy challenges\n\nBiden came into office vowing to restore the US’ credibility on the world stage and is currently facing several foreign policy challenges that will test that promise.\n\nRussia has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border and the world is watching to see whether Russian President Vladimir Putin invades the nation. US officials have grown increasingly pessimistic about the possibility of salvaging the Iran nuclear deal and have warned of turning to other options if diplomacy fails. And China remains accused of forced labor and human rights abuses in the country’s western region of Xinjiang.\n\nParticularly in the wake of the a messy withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden faces the challenge of defining the US’ role in the world under his administration as well as responding to crises that may occur.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Kate Sullivan Betsy Klein", "Maegan Vazquez", "Kate Sullivan", "Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/17/juneteenth-federal-holiday-after-biden-signs-legislation/7734814002/", "title": "Juneteenth is a federal holiday after Biden signs legislation", "text": "It was a busy day in Washington.\n\nIt's Mabinty, with the news of the day.\n\nWant this news roundup in your inbox every night?

It’s also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day.\n\nIn the wake of 2020's racial reckoning over the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, the celebration of Juneteenth spread outside the African American community.

But the Monday after the big game can feel like a letdown – whether you had a team to pull for in the event or not.\n\nSuper Bowl parties can spill over into late Sunday night. And that can leave revelers – as well as those who traveled to the game or traveled to gather and watch with friends – scrambling to make it to work on Monday.\n\nOver the years, many have had a game plan of making the Monday after the event a national holiday, handing off a three-day weekend to football fans.\n\nThat would also benefit children and teens who want to watch the game – and the commercials, of course – even though it could push up against bedtime on a school night.\n\nFor that reason, some Philadelphia and Phillly-area schools are delaying the start of school Monday for two hours. Last year, Cincinnati Public Schools and some Cincinnati-area school districts canceled classes the day after the game.\n\nSuper Bowl 2023 food ideas:Amazing recipes to make your Super Bowl party rock\n\nThe move makes some sense, said Martin Conway, an adjunct professor in the sport industry management program at Georgetown University. \"While it hasn’t risen to the official status of a national holiday, there has been research done to conclude that it is one of the most ‘unproductive’ days on the calendar,\" he said.\n\n42% of U.S. employees said the day after the Super Bowl should be a national holiday, according to a survey of more than 1,200 Americans, conducted Jan. 26-30, 2023 by The Harris Poll for The Workforce Institute at UKG.\n\nNearly 19 million people suggested they might call in sick on Super Bowl Monday.\n\nMore than 26 million American workers said they are likely to miss at least some work on Super Bowl Monday.\n\nThe estimated lost productivity for absent and distracted workers on Super Bowl Monday is $6.5 billion, outplacement company Challenger, Gray & Christmas said last year.\n\nDo fans want the day off after Super Bowl?\n\nBack in 2014, Budweiser, with the help of Hall of Fame shortstop Ozzie Smith, supported a White House petition to make Major League Baseball's opening day a national holiday. The Biden administration has not kept the \"We the People\" petition feature up and running – could it be because of this very reason?\n\nNearly half of U.S. sports fans would give up one of their current work holidays to have the day off after Super Bowl Sunday, a survey from 2020 found.\n\nMore than 40% said they would rather work Presidents Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day or Columbus Day than the Monday after the Super Bowl.\n\nAbout 10% said they would even prefer working Christmas or Thanksgiving.\n\nLooking for more signs of love for a prolonged Super Bowl weekend? Change.org, a different petition site, has gotten more than two dozen petitions since 2017 asking Congress, the president or the NFL to make the Monday after the Super Bowl a national holiday.

In June 2021, Congress passed a bill making June 19 a federal holiday commemorating the symbolic end of slavery in the United States and President Joe Biden signed the bill.\n\nEven though these are considered federal holidays, they are not \"national holidays,\" and are only applicable to federal employees and the District of Columbia, notes a Congressional Research Service report updated in July 2021.\n\nEach state gets to determine its legal holidays, the report states.\n\nAs an example, at least nine states have made Juneteenth an official paid holiday for state employees, while several other states have laws that make federal holidays a state holiday. But the majority of states may simply observe or recognize the holiday.\n\nStudent's Super Bowl request:Can we have a two-hour delay Monday after the game?\n\nTwo state legislators in Tennessee have proposed a bill making the first Monday after the Super Bowl into a legal holiday. With so many folks already taking the day off, \"it is already kind of like a de facto holiday,\" Rep. Joe Towns, who co-sponsored the bill with state Sen. London Lamar, told USA TODAY. \"People are not going in and they are calling in sick or taking a sick day, a rest day, a mental health day, whatever you want to call it.\"\n\nHowever, he notes, the holiday could eventually occur naturally if the NFL continues to expand its season. \"If they extend the number of games they play, Presidents Day could end up being the holiday,\" Towns said.\n\nThat could be the most likely path for Super Bowl Monday to happen. Realistically, creating a Super Bowl Monday federal holiday faces plenty of hurdles, even if hospitality and leisure industries would get a bump around the celebration, said Columbia Business School professor and corporate strategy expert Rita McGrath.\n\n\"The paid day off holidays tend to be very contentious, and it is extremely hard to get one through,\" she said. \"It also diminishes the seriousness of other national holidays which are about truly pivotal people or events.\"\n\nAnd, realistically, the intensity of the interest is in several markets in the country –the cities from which the two teams come from, plus, a few other sports intense markets on the coasts and in states such as Florida and Texas, Conway said.\n\n\"Today, for an event, or commemorating an individual, to rise to the level of national holiday status, I think there would need to more universal support around the country, which by about 12 noon the day after the game, that interest has dissipated,\" he said.\n\nWell, how about the NFL move the game to Saturday? That way most would have Sunday off.

Haith created the flag in 1997 with the help of collaborators, and Boston-based illustrator Lisa Jeanne Graf brought their vision to life.\n\nThe flag was revised in 2000 into the version we know today, according to the National Juneteenth Observation Foundation. Seven years later, the date “June 19, 1865” was added, commemorating the day that Union Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas, and told enslaved African Americans of their emancipation.\n\nFor two decades now, communities around the country have held flag-raising ceremonies on Juneteenth in celebration of their freedom.\n\n“This country has so many aspects to it that are spiritual, and I believe this flag is of that nature,” Haith said. “It (the idea for the design) just came through me.”\n\nDesigning the flag and its symbols was a deliberate process, Haith said. Here’s what each element of the flag represents.\n\nThe star\n\nThe white star in the center of the flag has a dual meaning, Haith said.\n\nFor one, it represents Texas, the Lone Star State.

The Year of Return celebrates the resilience of all the African victims of the Transatlantic slave trade and seeks to attract millions of African descendants back to Ghana to connect to their ancestry and identity.\n\nGhana is especially significant for African Americans because so many of our ancestors were taken from the Ghanaian coast and shipped to the Americas. It is the site of 75 percent of the so-called slave castles on the West coast of Africa.\n\nThis year, as a part of the President’s Award for Global Learning, I am one of three faculty mentors to a group of undergraduate students who were selected to explore the influences of colorism and skin bleaching in Ghana.\n\nAs a result, I have finally fulfilled my dream of going to Africa. Standing in the dungeons of Cape Coast Castle and Elmina Castle and hearing about the unspeakable atrocities experienced by my African ancestors was one of the most profoundly moving and powerful experiences I have ever had.\n\nThis is why the Year of Return is so incredibly important. It is a spiritual, birthright journey for African Americans and the global African family.\n\nResearch has found that African Americans lack a sense of connection to Africans, which is attributed to Africans’ purported sense of superiority and disregard for African Americans’ ongoing struggle to end racial oppression.\n\nHaving taught a class on the Psychology of the African American Experience for more than 20 years, I have consistently observed several dynamics. First, many of my African American students do not readily embrace their African heritage. Instead, they share stereotypes about Africans — “they smell” or “they think they’re better than us” — and admit to using derogatory and degrading language, such as “African booty-scratcher.”\n\nMany of my African students report having heard or being called an African booty-scratcher by African American students but also report having stereotypes of their own about African Americans — “they don’t value education,” “they don’t respect their elders,” or “they have no sense of family.” The Yoruba people have a word, “akata”— meaning, a wild cat who does not live at home — that is often used to refer to African Americans. Though, there are many debates (origin, urban dictionary, and BlacknBlack) about whether the word is intended to be derisive.\n\nIn both cases, there are misunderstandings that have been exacerbated by slavery and colonialism. Africans and African Americans have both been miseducated about each other and have been influenced by racist narratives about each other.\n\nTo be sure the tensions are not imagined, and are rooted in a reality that the educational and economic profile of Africans is far above that of African Americans. However, these differences do not negate the fact that Africans and African Americans (and for that matter Afro-Caribbeans) share an African ancestral cultural bond.\n\nOur Ghanaian tour guide had no anger or malice as he walked us through the sites that are representative of our shared, sordid history. Instead, he implored us to never forget and to work to ensure that this history will never repeat itself. One of the Ghanaians present during the tour spoke about our common humanity, commenting that it doesn’t matter the color of our skin, we all bleed red blood.\n\nAs we celebrate Juneteenth, let us also remember that African Americans have a special connection to Africa, to Africans, and especially to Ghana. It is my hope that Juneteenth will not only be a time to celebrate the emancipation of enslaved Africans but will also serve to motivate African Americans to truly embrace their African cultural heritage.\n\nKevin Cokley is the Oscar and Anne Mauzy Regents professor of Educational Research and Development and Professor of African and African Diaspora Studies at The University of Texas at Austin.

To make matters worse, she said, watermelon has historically been used as a racist trope against Black Americans.\n\n“People were very offended by it,” said Starks-Richardson, an educator in the Indianapolis area. “Everybody is trying to capitalize off Juneteenth to make money. But we don’t need the food. I want education. I want people to understand the purpose of (Juneteenth).”\n\nThe Indianapolis Children’s Museum has since apologized and removed the salad from its food court. In a statement, the museum said it routinely relies on a food vendor to create “thematic menu items” and that the “inappropriate” name and label on the salad was not reviewed by museum staff.\n\nOther organizations and major retailers are also receiving backlash for their attempts to monetize Juneteenth with new products since President Joe Biden signed a bill declaring it a national holiday last year.\n\nFrom the Indianapolis Children’s Museum’s watermelon salad to Walmart’s swirled red velvet and cheesecake flavored ice cream to Dollar Tree’s Pan African-themed plates and napkins, inclusion experts say corporations are missing the mark with Juneteenth. By failing to provide any historical context with these items, the companies don’t appear to have considered how they could promote stereotypes or offend Black people, experts say.\n\nSome social justice activists also insist the efforts are more performative than genuine as they don’t address the systemic inequalities that demonstrators marched for in 2020 after the death of George Floyd. Among the issues were police violence against Black people, voting rights and reparations.\n\nAmara Enyia, a public policy expert for the Movement for Black Lives, said the Juneteenth product lines are “tone deaf” and “devoid of any real impact.”\n\nEnyia said companies should be using the Juneteenth holiday to reexamine their hiring and promotion practices to ensure they are being more inclusive of Black applicants and employees.\n\n“What people are demanding is not a new ice cream flavor or a new salad or any other symbolic gesture that really is just about generating profit from a commercialized holiday,” Enyia said. “What Black folks have demanded are structural and systemic changes to the systems in this country that have been harmful and oppressive.”\n\nSome experts say the Juneteenth-themed foods and products show corporations are suddenly trying to commercialize a holiday that Black Americans have celebrated since June 19, 1865, when Union Major General Gordon Granger announced the end of slavery in Galveston, Texas, in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nAcross the US, Black families who honor the holiday traditionally host cookouts, music festivals, prayer services and rodeo events. Some also indulge in red food and drink, which represents the blood shed during enslavement.\n\nStephanie Leonard, an assistant professor of management at Howard University who specializes in workplace diversity, equity and inclusion, said corporations should not be profiting off the culture of marginalized groups – especially when they don’t have a track record of supporting and being inclusive of those communities.\n\nCorporations, she said, can be more thoughtful in how they honor Juneteenth by doing more research and appointing a Black-led committee that is invested in educating the public about the holiday. She called it “tokenism” when companies rely solely on one or two Black employees to decide how Juneteenth should be marked.\n\n“It’s tough for organizations to put forth an ice cream or watermelon salad without having done the prior work,” Leonard said. “Because it just comes off as performative, as a last-ditch effort. It does not come off as this organization values its Black employees or values its Black customers.”\n\nLast month, Walmart was blasted on social media when shoppers discovered the retail chain was selling “Celebration Edition: Juneteenth Ice Cream,” under its Great Value label.\n\n“Share and celebrate African-American culture, emancipation and enduring hope,” the label on the swirled red velvet and cheesecake flavored ice cream read. The ice cream tub was designed with Pan African colors and Black and brown hands.\n\nOne critic accused Walmart of capitalizing off Black culture and said the retailer can better honor Juneteenth by promoting products by Black-owned brands.\n\nWalmart later apologized for the ice cream and removed it from the shelves.\n\n“Juneteenth holiday marks a celebration of freedom and independence,” a Walmart spokesperson said in a statement. “However, we received feedback that a few items caused concern for some of our customers and we sincerely apologize. We are reviewing our assortment and will remove items as appropriate.”\n\nDollar Tree also faced criticism on social media when it shared a post about a Juneteenth product line that included plates, cups and napkins in Pan African colors with the words “Celebrate Freedom.”\n\nLauren Tucker, an inclusive leadership consultant, said major corporations are not giving Juneteenth the thought, research and care it deserves. Tucker compared the products to companies simply “checking a box” that says they recognized the holiday.\n\nSelling red foods without providing historical context shows that retailers “don’t really understand the meaning behind this commemoration,” Tucker said.\n\n“These are meaningful in terms of articulating both the pain and suffering (of Black Americans) but also the celebration of freedom,” Tucker said. “And without contextualizing these foods, by the context, the history, you are just perpetuating more pain, more frustration and signifying that you don’t really understand or care about the history.”\n\nTucker said companies should look to bring in independent consultants, research Juneteenth, and survey their customer base before putting out products for a culturally significant holiday such as Juneteenth.\n\n“We need to start taking our history much more seriously in the marketing and business community and provide a platform for people to understand what these events mean to us as Americans,” Tucker said.", "authors": ["Nicquel Terry Ellis"], "publish_date": "2022/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/07/07/fact-check-convict-leasing-forced-black-people-into-unpaid-labor/5368307002/", "title": "Fact check: Southern states used convict leasing to force Black ...", "text": "Editor’s note: In two former legal statutes referenced below, a racist term was replaced with the word Black in brackets.\n\nThe claim: Convict leasing, an example of systemic racism, was used to force Black people into unpaid labor for private and state industry.\n\nPrior to the Juneteenth holiday commemorating the end of slavery, a now-unavailable Facebook post asserted that the convict leasing system used in the Southern United States forced Black people into unpaid labor.\n\nIt argues Black Codes, or laws specifically for Black people, were used to criminalize many aspects of everyday life for Black citizens and create harsher sentences for petty crimes.\n\nThe Facebook post was later shared on other accounts and provides a variety of data related to the convict leasing system, but no sources are cited for the content.\n\nThe user who shared the original post could not be reached for comments or clarification.\n\nMore:Fact check: Devastating 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre wasn't worst U.S. riot, isn't ignored in books\n\nDue to the length of the post, it requires an examination of the data presented as facts.\n\nConvict leasing in the South\n\nInitial assertions in the June 15 Facebook post reference several Southern states leasing convicts after ratification of the 13th Amendment ended slavery. Nine states — Alabama, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Florida, Tennessee and South Carolina — are mentioned.\n\nThese states did use a convict leasing system after the Civil War. Some states, like Louisiana, also used convict leasing pre-war, but the numbers exploded after slavery ended.\n\nAn Alabama History Education Initiative lesson explains: “Huge numbers of convicts, primarily Black males, many of whom had been legally but unjustly imprisoned, often on trumped up charges, were leased by governments across the South to various businesses in search of a source of cheap labor.”\n\nThe convict leasing system exploited a clause in the 13th Amendment to provide a basis for involuntary servitude.\n\nThe 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states, “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\"\n\nBlack Codes and policing\n\nThe Facebook post further asserts states hired hundreds of white men as police officers to assist with the business of arresting Black people.\n\nA U.S. Department of Justice publication, Perspectives on Policing, released in January 1990, features a report titled “The Evolving Strategy of Police: A Minority View” by Hubert Williams and Patrick V. Murphy.\n\nThe report argues modern-style American policing finds its origins in slave patrols developed by white slave owners. It also references a passage from “Reconstruction: America’s Unfinished Revolution” by E.E. Foner regarding enforcement of Black Codes, or laws used to regulate Black behavior.\n\nMore:Fact check: Congress did not designate Confederate veterans as U.S. veterans\n\n“The entire complex of Black Codes was enforced: ‘by a police apparatus and judicial system in which Blacks enjoyed virtually no voice whatever. Whites staffed urban police forces as well as State militias.”\n\nIn 1865, a white person in Mississippi said it was to keep “good order and discipline” among the Black population.\n\nThe Facebook posts states police sought out and arrested Black people who were violating Black Codes and leased these people — men, women and children — to plantation, coal mines or railroad companies. The business or plantation owners paid the state for every prisoner who worked for them.\n\nIn an 1893 speech manuscript housed at the Library of Congress, Frederick Douglass discusses the convict leasing system:\n\n“Under the Convict Lease System the criminals are leased in bulk in their respective states, to whoever has the political ring, and that party, by paying a small sum to the state, sublets them in gangs to R.R.s and other corporations, and to plantations. The state throws off the entire responsibility of caring for her convicts, and turns them over into the hands of the lessee, whose only interest in them is, to secure for himself, what profit he can for their labor.”\n\nMore:Fact check: No, Taylor Swift did not say the Statue of Liberty should be removed\n\nDouglass also said county officials and corporations had a mutual interest in increasing the number of convicts for “selfish and pecuniary purposes.”\n\nHow many people were victims of the convict leasing system?\n\nThe Facebook post states, “It is believed that after the passing of the 13th Amendment, more than 800,000 Blacks were part of the system of peonage, or re-enslavement through the prison system.”\n\nThe data provided as an estimate cannot be proven or disproven because accurate records for the convict leasing system do not exist in the various states.\n\nIn a 2009 interview with Newsweek, “Slavery by Another Name” author Douglas A. Blackmon was asked for a number and stated, “It is impossible to determine the precise numbers.”\n\nMore:Fact check: Before Obama there was no Black Lives Matter, but there was ISIS and antifa\n\nBlackmon said at least 200,000 African Americans were subjected to the convict leasing system in Alabama. Over the 80-year period before the system was formally ended in 1941, he estimates tens of millions were either forced to live on a farm, in a lumber camp or forced into convict leasing by the justice system.\n\nThe documentary “Slavery by Another Name,” financed in part by the National Endowment of the Humanities, estimates that 800,000 faced the corrupt justice system with “huge numbers of those arrested forced into involuntary servitude.”\n\nHow did the convict leasing system end?\n\nThe Facebook post references peonage not ending until after World War II began, around 1940.\n\nIn fact, it ended five days after Pearl Harbor on Dec. 12, 1945.\n\nA National Archives record featuring FBI classifications includes Classification 50: Involuntary Servitude and Slavery. It references Department of Justice Departmental Circular #3591 issued on Dec. 12, 1941.\n\nThis circular amended a previous definition of peonage “as involuntary servitude plus debt” and removed the debt element. Instead, “Attorneys were instructed to disregard the element of debt and to depend upon the issue of involuntary servitude and slavery.”\n\nExploitation of the 13th Amendment\n\nThe 13th Amendment’s phrasing allowed lawmakers to use criminal punishment to legally force involuntary servitude.\n\nBlack Codes and \"pig laws\" are some of the better-known examples of this abuse.\n\nThe term “pig law” derives from Mississippi, where the theft of any property over $10 became grand larceny. According to the Mississippi Department of History’s historic timeline, the prison population subsequently quadrupled. The convict leasing system benefited by providing cheap labor across the state.\n\nBlack Codes use a variety of restrictions to limit the freedom of Black people and made arrest easy.\n\nMore:Frederick Douglass escaped slavery and became a famed abolitionist; his first wife made that possible\n\nAccording to the Texas State Historical Association, “A vagrancy law allowed local courts to arrest people whom they defined as idle, fine them and contract their labor if they could not pay the fine”\n\nLocal courts were able to force people into any type of labor until a fine was paid. Any person sentenced to time in a county jail for a misdemeanor or petty offense could also be forced into labor.\n\nWhat are some examples of Black Codes?\n\nExamples of Black Codes featured in the Facebook post are true.\n\nIn Louisiana, the St. Landry Parish Police jury established codes limiting the movement of Black people.\n\nSection 1 of the code prohibited Black people from passing within the limits of the parish without a special permit in writing from an employer. Punishment was a $2.50 fine, four days of work on the public road or corporeal punishment.\n\nSection 4 required every Black person to be in the regular service of a white person or former owner who would be responsible for their behavior.\n\nMore:'We are still trying to get free': Black Americans continue fight for equality on Juneteenth\n\nSection 6 is specifically highlighted in the Facebook post and states Black people are not allowed “to preach, exhort or otherwise declaim to congregations of (Black) people, without a special provision in writing from the president of the police jury.”\n\nOf note is the Facebook post states the “president of the police.” In Louisiana, a police jury is the governing entity of a parish and takes the place of a County Board of Commissioners and similar bodies in the counties of other states.\n\nIn South Carolina, Black Codes also regulated the children of Black people who were considered vagrants.\n\nIn Volume 13 of The Statutes at Large of South Carolina, a section on Master and Apprentice states:\n\n“(Black) children, between the ages mentioned, who have neither father nor mother living in the District in which they are found, or whose parents are paupers, or unable to afford them habits of industry and honesty, or are persons of notoriously bad character, or are vagrants, or have been, either of them, convicted of infamous offense, may be bound as apprentices by the District Judge, or one of the Magistrates for the aforesaid term.”\n\nThe accepted age range started at 2 and ended when an apprenticeship term would conclude at age 18 for a Black woman and age 21 for a Black man.\n\nSystemic racism and peonage\n\nIn the Facebook post, peonage is framed as an example of systemic racism, or racism established and perpetuated by government systems.\n\nA June 15 USA Today article focused on systemic racism features multiple definitions of the term.\n\nNAACP President Derrick Johnson defined systemic racism, also called structural racism or institutional racism, as \"systems and structures that have procedures or processes that disadvantages African Americans.\"\n\nThe implementation and use of the convict leasing system is an example of systemic racism.\n\nOur ruling: True\n\nWe rate the claim that convict leasing, an example of systemic racism, was used to force Black people into unpaid labor for private and state industry as true. This rating is supported by our research. Black people were overwhelmingly the victims of the convict leasing system after the Civil War. Laws were passed to create the basis for arresting Black people for a variety of small offenses or, in some instances, for moving freely within a state without written permission from an employer.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Nuclear fusion happens when two or more atoms are fused into one larger one, a process that generates a massive amount of energy as heat.\n\nScientists around the world have been studying nuclear fusion for decades, hoping to recreate it with a new source that provides limitless, carbon-free energy – without the nuclear waste created by current nuclear reactors. Fusion projects mainly use the elements deuterium and tritium – both of which are isotopes of hydrogen.\n\nThe deuterium from a glass of water, with a little tritium added, could power a house for a year. Tritium is rarer and more challenging to obtain, although it can be synthetically made.\n\n“Unlike coal, you only need a small amount of hydrogen, and it is the most abundant thing found in the universe,” Julio Friedmann, chief scientist at Carbon Direct and a former chief energy technologist at Lawrence Livermore, told CNN. “Hydrogen is found in water so the stuff that generates this energy is wildly unlimited and it is clean.”\n\nHow is fusion different from nuclear fission?\n\nWhen people think about nuclear energy, cooling towers and mushroom clouds may come to mind. But fusion is entirely different.\n\nWhereas fusion fuses two or more atoms together, fission is the opposite; it is the process of splitting a larger atom into two or more smaller ones. Nuclear fission is the kind of energy that powers nuclear reactors around the world today. Like fusion, the heat created from splitting atoms is also used to generate energy.\n\nNuclear is a zero-emission energy source, according to the Department of Energy. But it produces volatile radioactive waste that must be stored safely and carries safety risks. Nuclear meltdowns, although rare, have occurred throughout history with wide-ranging and deadly results such as at the Fukushima and Chernobyl reactors.\n\nNuclear fusion does not carry the same safety risks, and the materials used to power it have a much shorter half-life than fission.\n\nHow could nuclear fusion power eventually turn the lights on in your house?\n\nThere are two main ways to generate nuclear fusion, but both have the same result. Fusing two atoms creates a tremendous amount of heat, which holds the key to producing energy. That heat can be used to warm water, create steam and turn turbines to generate power – much like how nuclear fission generates energy.\n\nThe big challenge of harnessing fusion energy is sustaining it long enough so that it can power electric grids and heating systems around the globe. The successful US breakthrough is a big deal, but it’s still on a far smaller scale than what’s needed to generate enough energy to run one power plant, never mind tens of thousands of power plants.\n\nThis illustration provided by the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory depicts a target pellet inside a hohlraum capsule with laser beams entering through openings on either end. The beams compress and heat the target to the necessary conditions for nuclear fusion to occur. (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory via AP) Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory via AP\n\n“It’s about what it takes to boil 10 kettles of water,” said Jeremy Chittenden, co-director of the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College in London. “In order to turn that into a power station, we need to make a larger gain in energy – we need it to be substantially more.”\n\nWhy is DOE’s forthcoming announcement about a fusion reaction resulting in a net energy gain important?\n\nThis is the first time scientists have ever successfully produced a nuclear fusion reaction resulting in a net energy gain, instead of breaking even as past experiments have done.\n\nWhile there’s many more steps until this can be commercially viable, it’s essential for scientists to show that they can create more energy than they started with. Otherwise, it doesn’t make much sense for it to be developed.\n\n“This is very important because from an energy perspective, it can’t be an energy source if you’re not getting out more energy than you’re putting in,” Friedmann told CNN. “Prior breakthroughs have been important but it’s not the same thing as generating energy that could one day be used on a larger scale.”\n\nWhere does the fusion take place?\n\nSeveral fusion projects are in the US, United Kingdom and Europe. France is home to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, on which thirty-five countries are collaborating – including main members China, the United States, the European Union, Russia, India, Japan and South Korea.\n\nIn the US, much of the work is happening at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, in a building that spans the size of three football fields.\n\nThe west gate entrance to the US Department of Energys Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California, US, on Monday, Dec. 12, 2022.

Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe National Ignition Facility project creates energy from nuclear fusion by what’s known as “thermonuclear inertial fusion.” In practice, US scientists fire pellets that contain hydrogen fuel into an array of nearly 200 lasers, essentially creating a series of extremely fast, repeated explosions at the rate of 50 times per second. The energy collected from the neutrons and alpha particles is extracted as heat.\n\nIn the UK and the ITER project in France, scientists are working with huge donut-shaped machines outfitted with giant magnets called a tokamak to try to generate the same result. After fuel is put into the tokamak, its magnets are turned on and temperatures inside are raised exponentially to create plasma.\n\nPlasma needs to reach at least 150 million degrees Celsius, 10 times hotter than the core of the sun. The neutrons then escape the plasma, hitting a “blanket” lining the walls of the tokamak, and transferring their kinetic energy as heat.\n\nWhat are the next steps?\n\nScientists and experts now need to figure out how to produce much more energy from nuclear fusion on a much larger scale.\n\nAt the same time, they need to figure out how to eventually reduce the cost of nuclear fusion so that it can be used commercially.\n\n“At the moment we’re spending a huge amount of time and money for every experiment we do,” said Chittenden. “We need to bring the cost down by a huge factor.”\n\nScientists will also need harvest the energy produced by fusion and transfer it to the power grid as electricity. It will take years – and possibly decades – before fusion can be able to produce unlimited amounts of clean energy, and scientists are on a race against the clock to fight climate change.\n\n“This will not contribute meaningfully to climate abatement in the next 20-30 years,” Friedmann said. “This the difference between lighting a match and building a gas turbine.”", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen René Marsh", "Ella Nilsen", "René Marsh"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2023/06/15/america-divided-racism-racial-equality-hidden-common-ground/70321030007/", "title": "Juneteenth and racial justice: Americans believe in equal opportunity", "text": "Shakiyla Smith and Bob Boisture\n\nOpinion contributors\n\nThe new Public Agenda/USA TODAY Hidden Common Ground poll offers important data about how Americans view racism and racial justice.

This involves being honest about where we differ and where we can imagine a shared future in which we all flourish.\n\nReading the poll's findings in this way, we see that most Americans agree that racial equality is important, even while we have different ideas about how to address racism and inequality. But to make any real progress together, we need to go beyond power struggles and agreeing to disagree.\n\nAnd as our nation prepares to celebrate Juneteenth on Monday, it's critical for us to find the courage to engage consistently in the hard, often difficult work to secure equality for all Americans.\n\nRacial equality unites us:Nearly every American endorses racial equality. It's how to get there that divides us.\n\nAmericans' faith traditions call us to love each other\n\nNotwithstanding the real differences in our lived experiences and perspectives, our deepest values call us to act in service to what the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. referred to as beloved community. Certainly, when we add faith and spirituality into the conversation, we know that all the faith traditions and spiritual paths call us into Love.\n\nAnd by Love, with a capital L, we mean the most powerful force for our highest good, rather than merely a sentimental feeling or deep affection.\n\nThink you know where 'woke' comes from?Inside the word's musical history – and influence.\n\nOur faith traditions and spiritual paths also invite us to care for the other beyond our own self- and clan-interest as an expression of Love. Indeed, this call and commitment to Love and beloved community go beyond categories of race and political affiliation.\n\nFrom this stance, we can approach racial equality and justice from a much more loving, spiritually grounded and constructive perspective rather than from zero-sum identity politics.\n\nHere, Love has teeth and makes demands. More specifically, Love calls us not only to express what we believe in theory about racial equality and shared flourishing – flourishing for all of us rather than some of us – but to do the often hard inner and relational work toward these values.\n\nThis involves leaning into different perspectives to understand another’s lived experience, even when we want to shut down or turn away.\n\nSometimes, as in any loving relationship, it involves healing and repair work when harm has happened either intentionally or unintentionally. Furthermore, if we value equality and shared flourishing, this invites us to regularly ask, \"Who is not flourishing?\" – whether for historic reasons or because of current circumstance, and then to do the individual and collective work needed to give them a brighter future.\n\nCNN CEO Chris Licht is out.Can 'balanced' news exist in the post-Trump era?\n\nThis is not easy work, but it is necessary. And it’s the work that our faith and spirituality asks us to do, that Love asks us to do.\n\nThere's no simple solution to achieving racial equality\n\nThe truth is perhaps we can’t agree on methodology precisely because there is no one, simple solution to achieving racial equality and shared flourishing. It’s work that we all must live into through trial and error, and deep, ongoing personal and communal work – very much like living into our religious and spiritual paths.\n\nOne way that we are leaning into this and combining inner work with outer action at the Fetzer Institute is through our Racial Justice Praxis Project. This two-year project funds and brings together diverse faith and spiritual leaders of color to consider how racial justice, love and spiritual transformation can be braided together to support beloved community and shared flourishing.\n\nIt is a reminder and commitment to do the hard and sacred work of Love through racial justice. Through this project, we are exploring and learning how Love calls us to racial justice and how racial justice animates Love and is connected to shared flourishing.\n\nThe most powerful aspect of this project is the consideration of these often-separated ideas together − of love, racial justice and spiritual transformation. It has invited us into a depth and care around racial justice that gets to the heart of the matter.\n\nWe also find it powerful to acknowledge that we don’t fully know the answers to addressing such a longstanding and complex challenge as racial equality and justice.\n\nHowever, through our commitment to our deepest values, especially Love and shared flourishing, we can do our inner work to deepen our understanding as well as the outer work in beloved community that is ours to do.\n\nBob Boisture is president and CEO of the Fetzer Institute.

On one of those plantations a continent away, 10-year-old Ima helped harvest the fruit that makes its way into a dizzying array of products sold by leading Western food and cosmetics brands.\n\nIma is among the estimated tens of thousands of children working alongside their parents in Indonesia and Malaysia, which supply 85% of the world’s most consumed vegetable oil. An Associated Press investigation found most earn little or no pay and are routinely exposed to toxic chemicals and other dangerous conditions. Some never go to school or learn to read and write. Others are smuggled across borders and left vulnerable to trafficking or sexual abuse. Many live in limbo with no citizenship and fear being swept up in police raids and thrown into detention.\n\nGirls Scouts speak out:Girl Scouts call on its cookie bakers to address child labor in Southeast Asia\n\nShopping malls:Struggle before COVID-19 and now have more empty stores. What's ahead post-pandemic?\n\nThe AP used U.S. Customs records and the most recently published data from producers, traders and buyers to trace the fruits of their labor from the processing mills where palm kernels were crushed to the supply chains of many popular kids’ cereals, candies and ice creams sold by Nestle, Unilever, Kellogg’s, PepsiCo and many other leading food companies, including Ferrero – one of the two makers of Girl Scout cookies.\n\nTwo girls' lives intersect\n\nOlivia, who earned a badge for selling more than 600 boxes of cookies, had spotted palm oil as an ingredient on the back of one of her packages but was relieved to see a green tree logo next to the words “certified sustainable.” She assumed that meant her Thin Mints and Tagalongs weren’t harming rainforests, orangutans or those harvesting the orange-red palm fruit.\n\nBut later, the whip-smart 11-year-old saw the word “mixed” in all caps on the label and turned to the internet, quickly learning that it meant exactly what she feared: Sustainable palm oil had been blended with oil from unsustainable sources. To her, that meant the cookies she was peddling were tainted.\n\nThousands of miles away in Indonesia, Ima led her class in math and dreamed of becoming a doctor. Then one day her father made her quit school because he needed help meeting the high company targets on the palm oil plantation where she was born. Instead of attending fourth grade, she squatted in the unrelenting heat, snatching up the loose kernels littering the ground and knowing if she missed even one, her family’s pay would be cut.\n\nShe sometimes worked 12 hours a day, wearing only flip flops and no gloves, crying when the fruit’s razor-sharp spikes bloodied her hands or when scorpions stung her fingers. The loads she carried, sometimes so heavy she would lose her footing, went to one of the very mills feeding into the supply chain of Olivia’s cookies.\n\n“I am dreaming one day I can go back to school,” she told the AP, tears rolling down her cheeks.\n\nChronicling child labor\n\nChild labor has long been a dark stain on the $65 billion global palm oil industry. Though often denied or minimized as kids simply helping their families on weekends or after school, it has been identified as a problem by rights groups, the United Nations and the U.S. government.\n\nWith little or no access to daycare, some young children follow their parents to the fields, where they come into contact with fertilizers and some pesticides that are banned in other countries. As they grow older, they push wheelbarrows heaped with fruit two or three times their weight. Some weed and prune the trees barefoot, while teen boys may harvest bunches large enough to crush them, slicing the fruit from lofty branches with sickle blades attached to long poles.\n\nIn some cases, an entire family may earn less in a day than a $5 box of Girl Scout Do-si-dos.\n\n“For 100 years, families have been stuck in a cycle of poverty and they know nothing else than work on a palm oil plantation,” said Kartika Manurung, who has published reports detailing labor issues on Indonesian plantations. “When I … ask the kids what they want to be when they grow up, some of the girls say, ‘I want to be the wife of a palm oil worker.’”\n\nThe AP’s investigation into child labor is part of a broader in-depth look at the industry that also exposed rape, forced labor, trafficking and slavery. Reporters crisscrossed Malaysia and Indonesia, speaking to more than 130 current and former workers – some two dozen of them child laborers – at nearly 25 companies. Their locations are not being disclosed and only partial names or nicknames are being used due to fears of retribution.\n\nDunkin' Extra Charged Coffee:New drink has 20% more caffeine\n\nThe AP found children working on plantations and corroborated accounts of abuse, whenever possible, by reviewing police reports and legal documents. Reporters also interviewed more than 100 activists, teachers, union leaders, government officials, researchers, lawyers and clergy, including some who helped victims of trafficking or sexual assault.\n\nIndonesian government officials said they do not know how many children work in the country’s massive palm oil industry, either full or part time. But the U.N.’s International Labor Organization has estimated 1.5 million children between 10 and 17 years old labor in its agricultural sector. Palm oil is one of the largest crops, employing some 16 million people.\n\nIn much smaller neighboring Malaysia, a newly released government report estimated more than 33,000 children work in the industry there, many under hazardous conditions – with nearly half of them between the ages of 5 and 11. The study was conducted in 2018 after the country was slammed by the U.S. government over the use of child labor, and it did not directly address the large number of migrant children without documents hidden on many plantations in its eastern states, some of whom have never seen the inside of a classroom.\n\nIndustry attempts at ethical sourcing\n\nMany producers, Western buyers and banks belong to the 4,000-member Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, a global association that provides a green stamp of approval to those committed to supplying, sourcing, financing or using palm oil that’s been certified as ethically sourced.\n\nThe RSPO has a system in place to address grievances, including labor abuse allegations. But of the nearly 100 complaints listed on its case tracker for the two Southeast Asian countries in the last decade, only a handful have mentioned children.\n\n“It is an issue, and we know it’s an issue,” said Dan Strechay, the RSPO’s global outreach and engagement director, adding that the association has started working with UNICEF and others to educate members about what constitutes child labor.\n\nStrechay said many parents in Indonesia and Malaysia believe it’s the “cultural norm” for their kids to work alongside family members, even if it means pulling them out of school. “And that’s not OK,” he said.\n\nPalm oil is contained in roughly half the products on supermarket shelves and in almost three out of every four cosmetic brands, though that can be hard to discern since it appears on labels under more than 200 different names.\n\nAnd in a world where more and more consumers are demanding to know the provenance of the raw materials in the products they purchase, many companies are quick to issue assurances that they are committed to “sustainable” sourcing. But supply chains often are murky – especially in the palm oil industry – and developing countries that produce commodities in large volumes cheaply often do so by disregarding the environment and minimizing labor costs.\n\nA questioning Girl Scout\n\nMost people take words like “organic,” “fair trade” and “sustainable” at face value. But not Olivia. She became increasingly worried about palm oil, rifling through the kitchen cupboards in her family’s century-old farmhouse in Jonesborough, Tennessee, to inspect the ingredients printed on cans and wrappers. Then she began digging through her shampoos and lotions, trying to make sense of the scientific-sounding names she saw there.\n\nNow 14, Olivia has fired letters off to the head of Girl Scouts of the USA, demanding answers about how the palm oil is sourced for the organization’s cookies. She’s started an online petition to get it removed. And she and some other members of Troop 543 have stopped selling them.\n\nThe Girl Scouts did not respond to questions from the AP, directing reporters to the two bakers that make the cookies. Those companies and their parent corporations also had no comment on the findings.\n\n“I thought Girl Scouts was supposed to be about making the world a better place,” Olivia said. “But this isn’t at all making the world better.\"\n\nMany kids are introduced to palm oil soon after they’re born – it’s a primary fat in infant formula. And as they grow, it’s present in many of their favorite foods: It’s in their Pop-Tarts and Cap’n Crunch cereal, Oreo cookies, KitKat candy bars, Magnum ice cream, doughnuts and even bubble gum.\n\n“Let them enjoy it,” said Abang, a skinny 14-year-old who dropped out of the fifth grade to help his father on an Indonesian plantation and has never tasted ice cream. He has accepted his own fate, but still dreams of a better future for his little brother.\n\n“Let me work, just me, helping my father,” Abang said. “I want my brother to go back to school. … I don’t want him in the same difficult situation like me.”\n\nPalm oil's cycle of oppression\n\nThough many consumers aren’t familiar with it, palm oil became ubiquitous nearly two decades ago after warnings about health risks associated with trans fats. Almost overnight, food manufacturers began shifting to the highly versatile and cheap oil.\n\nIndonesia is the world’s largest palm oil producer and, with a population of 270 million, there is no shortage of strong backs. Many laborers migrate from the poorest corners of the country to take jobs that others shun, often bringing their wives and children as helpers in order to meet impossibly high daily quotas.\n\nOthers have been living on the same plantations for generations, creating a built-in workforce – when one harvester retires or dies, another in the family takes his place to hold onto company-subsidized housing, which often is a dilapidated shack with no running water and sometimes only limited electricity.\n\nIt’s a cycle that 15-year-old Jo was trying to break. Even though he had to help his family in the fields each day, heaving palm fruits high over his head and lobbing them onto trucks, his parents let him keep $6 a month to cover school fees so he could attend morning classes.\n\n“I am determined to finish high school to find a job outside the plantation,” said Jo, who toiled alongside his mother, father and grandfather. “My parents are very poor. Why should I follow my parents?”\n\nBut for many migrant children in neighboring Malaysia – which relies almost entirely on foreign workers to fill constant labor shortages – the hurdles to a brighter life seem insurmountable.\n\nMale harvesters technically are not allowed to bring their families to plantations on Borneo island, which is shared by both countries. So children often follow behind, sometimes traveling alone on illicit smugglers’ routes known as “jalan tikus,” or rat roads. The perilous border crossings to the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak can take place at night, either on foot across winding jungle paths or in packed speed boats racing without lights, sometimes colliding or capsizing in the dark.\n\nAn official estimate says 80,000 children of illegal migrants, mostly from Indonesia and the Philippines, are living in Sabah alone, but some rights groups say the true number could be nearly double that. Without birth certificates and with no path to citizenship, they are essentially stateless – denied access to even the most basic rights, and at high risk of exploitation.\n\nMalaysian child labor situation serious\n\nMigrant workers without documents are often treated “inhumanely” in Malaysia, said Soes Hindharno, an official from Indonesia’s Manpower Ministry. He said he had not received any complaints about child labor occurring in his own country, but an official from the ministry that oversees women and children’s issues acknowledged it was an area of growing concern in Indonesia.\n\nMalaysia’s Ministry of Plantation Industries and Commodities did not respond to repeated requests for comment, but Nageeb Wahab, head of the Malaysian Palm Oil Association, a government-supported umbrella group, called allegations of child labor very serious and urged complaints to be reported to authorities.\n\nChildren of migrant parents grow up living in fear they will be separated from their families. They try to remain invisible to avoid attracting the ever-watchful eyes of police, with some keeping backpacks with supplies ready in case they need to flee their houses and sleep in the jungle to avoid raids.\n\nMany never leave their guarded plantations, some so remote that workers must climb hills to search for a phone signal. And for those who dare to go out, trouble can come quickly.\n\nAlex was 12 when he began working 10 hours a day on a small plantation with his father, hoisting fruits so heavy his aching muscles kept him awake at night. One day, he decided to sneak off to visit his favorite aunt in a nearby village. With no passport, Alex said authorities quickly found him and carted him off to a crowded immigration detention center where he was held for a month.\n\n“There were hundreds of other people there, some my age, and also younger children, mostly with their mothers,” he said. “I was very afraid and kept thinking about how worried my mother and father must be. It made it hard to even eat or drink.”\n\nChild workers lack school, health care\n\nBut the biggest obstacles faced by Alex and other child workers in the two countries are lack of access to adequate, affordable education and medical care.\n\nSome companies in Indonesia provide rudimentary elementary schooling on plantations, but children who want to continue their studies may find they have to travel too far on poor roads or that they can’t afford it. In Malaysia, the problem is even bigger: Without legal documents, tens of thousands of kids are not allowed to go to government schools at all.\n\nIt’s such an extensive problem that Indonesia has set up learning centers to help some of its children on plantations in the neighboring country, even sending in its own teachers. But with such heavy workloads on plantations, one instructor said he had to beg parents to let their sons and daughters come for even just a half-day of classes. And many children, especially those living in remote, hard-to-reach areas, still have no access to any type of education.\n\n“Why aren’t companies playing a role in setting up schools in collaboration with the government?” asked Glorene Das, executive director of Tenaganita, a Malaysian nonprofit group concentrating on migrant issues for more than two decades. “Why are they encouraging the children to work instead?”\n\nMedical care also is woeful, with experts saying poor nutrition and daily exposure to toxic chemicals are undermining child laborers’ health and development. Many Indonesian plantations have their own basic clinics, but access may be available only to full-time workers. Travel to a private doctor or hospital can take hours, and most families cannot afford outside care. Migrant children without documents in Malaysia have no right to health care and often are too scared to seek medical help in villages or cities – even in life-threatening emergencies.\n\nMany young palm oil workers also have little understanding about reproductive health. Girls working on remote plantations are vulnerable to sexual abuse, and teen pregnancies and marriages are common.\n\nAna was just 13 when she first arrived in Malaysia, quickly learning, as she put it, that “anything can happen to the female workers there.” She said she was raped and forced to marry her attacker, but eventually managed to break free after years of abuse and return home to start a new life. Now a mother with kids of her own, she abruptly left Indonesia last year again to look for work in Malaysia.\n\nMany children do not have the option to ever leave. They are born on plantations, work there and sometimes die there. Overgrown headstones and crosses marking graves in crude cemeteries are found on some plantations near the towering palm trees.\n\nOthers, like 48-year-old Anna’s husband, are buried in community graveyards along the Indonesian and Malaysian border. A month after the palm oil harvester’s death, Anna lovingly tended his plot at the Christian site in Sabah, crammed with the bodies of hundreds of other migrants.\n\nShe said her son, whose own newborn baby was buried in the adjacent grave, had inherited his father’s job. He is the family’s main breadwinner now.\n\nThe cycle continues.\n\nAttempts at change continue\n\nOlivia is not the first Girl Scout to raise questions about the way palm oil makes its way into the beloved American cookies.\n\nMore than a decade ago, two girls in a Michigan troop stopped selling S’mores and other seasonal favorites because they worried palm oil’s expansion in Indonesia and Malaysia was destroying rainforests and killing endangered animals like orangutans.\n\nAfter they campaigned for several years, the Girl Scouts of the USA became an affiliate member of the RSPO and agreed to start using sustainable palm oil, adding the green tree logo to its roughly 200 million boxes of cookies, which bring in nearly $800 million annually.\n\nThe RSPO was created with the best of intentions and it attempts to factor in the interests of a wide array of groups, including environmental organizations, industry leaders and banks. Its mission was not to flip a switch overnight, but to encourage the mammoth palm oil industry to evolve after years of breakneck growth and little outside oversight.\n\nStill, for many food and cosmetic companies facing increased pressure from conscientious consumers, the association’s stamp of approval has become the go-to answer when questions are raised about their commitments to sustainability.\n\nMonitoring the millions of workers hidden beneath palms covering an area equal to roughly the size of New Zealand, however, is next to impossible.\n\nSome women and children on remote, sprawling plantations told the AP and labor rights groups that they are ordered to hide or stay home when sustainability auditors visit. They said only the optimal, easiest-to-reach parts of a plantation are typically showcased, with poor living and working conditions in distant areas hidden from outside eyes.\n\n“The RSPO promises sustainable palm oil. But it doesn’t mean that that palm oil is free of child labor or other abuses,” said Robin Averbeck of the Rainforest Action Network, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that has found pervasive problems on plantations, including those certified as sustainable. “It has simply become a tool for greenwashing.”\n\nWhen contacted by the AP, companies reaffirmed their support of human rights for all workers, with some noting they rely on their suppliers to meet industry standards and abide by local laws. If evidence of wrongdoing is found, some said they would immediately cut ties with producers.\n\n“We aim to prevent and address the issue of child labor wherever it occurs in our supply chain,” said Nestle, maker of KitKat candy bars. Unilever – the world’s biggest ice-cream maker, including Magnum – noted that its suppliers “must not, under any circumstance, employ individuals under the age of 15 or under the local legal minimum age for work or mandatory schooling.” There was no response from Mondelez, which owns Oreo cookies, or Cap’n Crunch parent company PepsiCo.\n\nConsumers have their own challenges in trying to buy responsibly. Those, like Olivia, who want to make sense of where their palm oil really comes from often find themselves confused, since the dense terms used to explain what makes palm oil sustainable can sometimes raise even more questions.\n\nTake Girls Scout cookies, for instance, which are made by two different U.S. bakers\n\nBoxes from both are stamped with green palm logos. The maker of Olivia’s cookies, Little Brownie Bakers in Kentucky, has the word “mixed” beside the tree, meaning as little as 1 percent of the palm oil might be certified sustainable. ABC Bakers in Virginia says “credits,” which means money is going toward promoting sustainable production.\n\nThe bakers’ parent companies – Italian confectionary brand Ferrero and Canadian-based Weston Foods – would not comment on the issue of child labor, but both said they were committed to sourcing only certified sustainable palm oil.\n\nWeston Foods, which owns ABC Bakers, would not provide any information about its palm oil suppliers, citing proprietary reasons, so the AP could not determine if its supply chain was tainted.\n\nPalm oil, the highest-yielding vegetable oil, is an important part of the two Southeast Asian countries’ economies and the governments bristle at any form of criticism, saying the industry plays an important role in alleviating poverty.\n\nThey have banned products touted as “palm oil-free” from supermarket shelves and created slogans calling the crop “God’s gift.” And when students at an international school in Malaysia were criticized last year for staging a play questioning the industry’s effect on the environment, school administrators responded with an apology.\n\nBack in Indonesia, Ima could give a very different classroom presentation about palm oil, but she has no chance. She continues to toil full time on the plantation alongside her family, even though her mother had promised she eventually could resume her studies.\n\n“Sometimes my friends ask me, ‘Why did you drop out? Why are you not at school?’” Ima said, her resentment readily apparent. “‘Because I have to help my father. If you want to replace me and help my father, then I will go to school. How about that?’”\n\nAfter learning about Ima, Olivia is even more determined to fight on. She sent letters to her customers explaining her reasons for no longer selling Girl Scout cookies, and many responded by donating money to her Southern Appalachian troop to show support.\n\nNow, Olivia is asking Girl Scouts across the country to band with her, saying, “The cookies deceive a lot of people. They think it’s sustainable, but it isn’t.\n\n“I’m not just some little girl who can’t do anything about this,” she says. “Children can make change in the world. And we’re going to.”\n\nThis story was funded in part by the McGraw Center for Business Journalism at CUNY’s Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/30/us/jackson-water-system-failing-tuesday/index.html", "title": "Jackson, Mississippi, water: The water crisis has gotten so bad, the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRecent torrential rain coupled with years of water system issues have resulted in a crisis in Jackson, Mississippi, where the city doesn’t have enough water to fight fires, flush toilets or even hand out to residents in need.\n\nJackson’s main water treatment facility began failing Monday, according to Gov. Tate Reeves. The National Guard was called up to help distribute bottled water as crews work to get the water treatment plant back online, state officials said.\n\nBut the distribution itself proved unsustainable. Residents of all ages were seen waiting in lines more than a mile long at Hawkins Field Airport for at least two hours Tuesday for just one case of bottled water. The event was supposed to span three hours, but barely ran two as people were eventually turned away when the 700 cases of water ran out.\n\n“I keep saying we’re going to be the next Michigan,” said Jeraldine Watts, 86, who was able to get water at a grocery store Monday night. “And it looks like that’s exactly what we’re headed for.”\n\nWatts was referring to the water crisis in the city of Flint, which has battled water issues since a 2014 water crisis in which lead-contaminated water fed to residents’ faucets.\n\nPeople line up for water in Jackson, Mississippi, on August 30, 2022. CNN\n\nJackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba told CNN’s Pamela Brown the city is working on more water distribution events. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency will provide nearly 30 water trucks to help supplement the city events, the mayor said.\n\n“I have been assured by MEMA that they will supplement those locations with about 28 tanker trucks distributed at various points across the city,” Lumumba told CNN.\n\nExplanations for Jackson’s failing system are complicated: Damage this summer to pumps at the main water treatment facility made failure increasingly likely as the summer progressed, the governor said; and flooding of the Pearl River after heavy rains last week affected treatment processes and therefore the amount of running water the system can provide, Lumumba said.\n\nThis week’s troubles come as the water system has been plagued with problems for years and with the city already under a boil water notice since late July for what the state called a water-quality issue.\n\nThe state is “surging our resources to the city’s water treatment facility and beginning emergency maintenance, repairs and improvements,” Gov. Reeves said. “We will do everything in our power to restore water pressure and get water flowing back to the people of Jackson.”\n\nWater for those in the state’s most populous city would have to be provided “for an unknown period of time,” Reeves said.\n\nThe water shortage is expected to last “the next couple of days,” according to the mayor’s office.\n\nLumumba also announced Monday the city’s public works director – a role that oversees the water treatment facilities – has been reassigned. Marlin King will instead serve as deputy director and Jordan Hillman, the city’s planning and development director, will be the interim public works director, according to Melissa Payne, the mayor’s spokesperson.\n\nKing did not respond to CNN requests for comment. Payne said King’s reassignment “is part of restructuring” and is not a result of the current water crisis.\n\nResidents say faucet water is discolored\n\nState Rep. Ronnie Crudup Jr. said he didn’t have running water Monday, but on Tuesday, discolored water came out of his faucet that he used to flush the toilet. He and his family used bottled water Tuesday morning to brush their teeth, Crudup told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota.\n\nCrudup said that although the city has experienced water issues in the past, rain played a part in the current water emergency.\n\n“It’s been building up for years, but we have had an unprecedented amount of rain in the last two to three weeks, and it just kind of created this havoc, what we are dealing with right now,” he said.\n\nJackson resident Daryl Page told CNN he’s been searching for clean, bottled water since the city’s been under a boil water notice “for a whole month.” He was driving to a distribution site, but as he arrived, he noticed there was nothing there.\n\nFirefighters and recruits for the Jackson Fire Department carry cases of bottled water to residents vehicles, August 18, 2022, as part of the city's response to longstanding water system problems. Rogelio V. Solis/AP\n\n“Everyone is turning around because there is nothing here,” Page said, adding that his next plan of action was to drive to another site in hopes that he could find cases of water there.\n\nBecause of Monday’s failure, officials announced all Jackson public schools will shift to virtual learning Tuesday.\n\nHospitals are also feeling the strain. Jackson’s University of Mississippi Medical Center released a statement Tuesday saying the Jackson Medical Mall air conditioning is not functioning properly “because the water pressure feeding its chillers is too low.” Portable restrooms are being used in locations experiencing low water pressure, the statement said.\n\nThe university medical center statement also said a fire watch was declared for its Jackson-based facilities, “because fire suppression systems are fed by the city water system. Low pressure in the systems may cause them to be less effective.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed on the water crisis in Jackson and the White House has been “in regular contact with state and local officials, including Mayor Lumumba, and made clear that the Federal Government stands ready to offer assistance,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“(The Federal Emergency Management Agency) is working closely with the state officials to identify needs, and the EPA is coordinating with industry partners to expedite delivery of critical treatment equipment for emergency repairs at the City of Jackson water treatment facilities,” she said.\n\nIn an emailed statement Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency said “ensuring all people have access to healthy and safe water is a top priority.”\n\n“We are in communication with officials in Mississippi and stand ready to provide support should the State request federal assistance,” the EPA statement read. “In the interim, we are available to provide technical support and information to Mississippi officials as they navigate their plan to address the immediate concerns at the O.B. Curtis Water Plant.”\n\nLater Tuesday, the governor said FEMA has received the state’s declaration asking the federal government to declare the water shortage a federal emergency.\n\nWater system issues go back decades, mayor says\n\nThe problem this week stems from one of two water treatment facilities in the city: the O.B. Curtis plant, which is run by the city of Jackson, according to the governor.\n\nThe main pumps at O.B. Curtis were severely damaged recently, and the facility began operating on smaller backup pumps about a month ago, around the time the latest boil water notice began in July, the governor said, without elaborating about the damage.\n\nThe governor said he was told Friday that “it was a near-certainty that Jackson would fail to produce running water sometime in the next several weeks or months if something did not materially improve,” the governor said.\n\nThe O.B.

Mark Felix/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut Lumumba said during a Monday news conference that it was only a matter time before the water system failed because Jackson’s water system has been faced serious issues for years.\n\n“I have said on multiple occasions that it’s not a matter of ‘if’ our system would fail, but a matter of ‘when’ our system would fail,” the mayor said, adding that the city has been “going at it alone for the better part of two years” when it comes to the water crisis.\n\nIn early 2020, the water system failed an Environmental Protection Agency inspection. The agency wrote the drinking water had the potential to be host to harmful bacteria or parasites, based on observations of the water’s turbidity, or cloudiness, as well as “disinfection treatment concerns, and/or the condition of the distribution system.”\n\nIn March 2020, the EPA issued an order requiring the city to develop a plan to replace and repair monitoring and treatment equipment, to “address dosing processes for disinfection and pH control” and to take more coliform bacteria samples, among other things.\n\nThe city also has endured weather-related shutdowns.\n\nIn February 2021, a winter storm shut down Jackson’s entire water system, leaving tens of thousands of residents without water for a month amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Residents have been under some sort of boil water notice or advisory several times since that storm, including the state-ordered notice posted in July.\n\n“We were here two Februarys ago when we had system failures, and the world was watching us and the world is watching us again,” Lumumba said during Monday’s news conference.\n\nThe mayor also pointed to recent flooding from the Pearl River as an event that triggered the latest water pressure issues.\n\nBecause O.B. Curtis received additional water from the reservoir during the flooding from last week to this week, the facility had to change the way it treats the water, which has led to the reduction of water being put out into the system and reduced tank levels. This is affecting the water pressure at residents’ homes, he said.\n\n“As one crisis may be diverted, another one rears its head,” Lumumba said Monday during a news conference after addressing the flooding in the city.\n\nO.B. Curtis is meant to provide about 50 million gallons for the city daily. The other plant, which usually provides about 20 million gallons daily, has been approved to ramp up its output amid the shortage, authorities said.\n\nIn July 2021, the EPA and the city entered into an agreement to address “long-term challenges and make needed improvements to the drinking water system.” The EPA recently announced $74.9 million in federal water and sewer infrastructure funds for Mississippi, mentioning Jackson without naming specific projects.\n\nHowever, Lumumba has said it would take $2 billion to fully repair and replace the dated system, which city, state and federal officials say also has too much lead in its water in some places.\n\nLumumba declared a water system emergency Monday. The proclamation noted not only the flooding but also numerous previous “unsuccessful attempts to rectify water system issues.”\n\nCNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\nAs for restoring water pressure and flow and performing emergency maintenance and repairs, the state would split the cost with the city, Reeves said Tuesday.\n\n“We will cash flow the operation, and the city will be responsible for half the cost of the emergency improvements that we make,” the governor said in a statement released on Twitter.\n\nAt a Tuesday news conference at the plant, Reeves said he is “encouraged” and at the same time “discouraged” by some of the news coming out of the facility.\n\n“We do have a plan in place to potentially bring in an additional rented pump that will allow us to put at least 4 million gallons of water additionally, hopefully, which will be installed by tomorrow morning. That is progress and will help,” he said.\n\nReeves added there is no time frame as of now for safe drinking water, but that over the next 24 to 36 hours residents will see significant truckloads of clean water start to be delivered to Jackson.\n\nOver the next few days, more than 108 semi-trucks of water are coming into Jackson and seven mega distribution sites will have 36 truckloads of water a day for the public to be able to retrieve, according to Lt. Col. Stephen McCraney, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency director.\n\nSystemic issues also contributed to water crisis\n\nLumumba previously told CNN a lack of political will and years of neglect on a national level has prevented Jackson from getting the help it needs to fix its water and sewer crisis. Besides the infrastructure issues, the plant has also been faced with staffing issues, according to the mayor and governor.\n\n“A far too small number of heroic frontline workers were trying their hardest to hold the system together, but that it was a near impossibility,” the governor said Monday.\n\nJackson’s ongoing water system problems already had some residents reporting low to no water pressure and raw sewage flowing in city streets and neighborhoods before this month.\n\nNow, some residents are taking to Twitter – where #jxnwatercrisis and #jacksonwatercrisis were trending – to post pictures of buckets and even tubs full of brown water coming out of their drains.\n\nSome on social media also pointed to systemic and environmental racism as among the causes of the city’s ongoing water issues and lack of resources, given that 82.5% of Jackson’s population identifies as Black or African American, according to census data, while the state’s legislature is majority White.\n\nNAACP president Derrick Johnson called out the Mississippi governor on Twitter Tuesday.\n\n”.@tatereeves, what are you waiting for!? We demand on behalf of the Jackson communities that you request federal aid from @FEMA and other agencies to ensure people have access to a basic human right: WATER,” Johnson’s tweet read. “Make the damn call. This is personal.”\n\nJackson has undergone drastic changes in the past half century. Its economic decline has occurred rapidly over the past two decades, fueled by population decline and demographic shifts.\n\nThe city’s population shrank from almost 200,000 in 1990 to about 160,000 in 2020. Its decline in population in these three decades was driven almost entirely by White flight. The city was 56% Black in 1990. By 2020, 82% of the city’s residents were Black.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Jason Hanna Nouran Salahieh", "Amir Vera", "Jason Hanna", "Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/health/variants-covid-winter-surge/index.html", "title": "Quick and stealthy new Covid-19 variants are poised to drive a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA flurry of new Covid-19 variants appears to be gaining traction globally, raising fears of a winter surge.\n\nIn the United States, these are BQ.1, BQ.1.1, BF.7, BA.4.6, BA.2.75 and BA.2.75.2. In other countries, the recombinant variant XBB has been rising quickly and appears to be fueling a new wave of cases in Singapore. Cases are also rising in Europe and the UK, where these variants have taken hold.\n\nDr. Peter Hotez, who co-directs the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, says he thinks of them collectively as the Scrabble variants because they use letters that get high scores in the board game like Q, X and B.\n\nAs the US moves into the fall, Covid-19 cases are dropping. Normally, that would be a reason for hope that the nation could escape the surges of the past two pandemic winters. But virus experts fear that the downward trend may soon reverse itself, thanks to this gaggle of new variants.\n\nLumped together, the variants accounted for almost 1 in 3 new Covid-19 infections nationwide last week, according to the latest estimates from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe updated bivalent booster vaccines and antiviral drugs like Paxlovid are expected to continue to be protective against severe outcomes from Covid-19 infections caused by the new variants.\n\nBut the new variants are particularly devastating for millions of Americans who have weakened immune systems. New research suggests that changes in these variants make them impervious to the last lab-created antibodies available to help treat and prevent severe cases of Covid-19, and the US government has run out of money to incentivize the creation of new ones.\n\nA crowded field of rising variants\n\nIt’s not clear whether this gang of new variants will continue to run around together, each sharing a piece of the Covid-19 infection pie, or whether one will rise to outcompete the others, as has happened in previous surges.\n\nThough they each descend from slightly different branches of the Omicron family tree, these new offshoots have evolved to share many of the same mutations, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution.\n\nSome experts think this convergence means we’ve entered a new phase of the evolution of the virus, one that will see circulation of several variants at the same time.\n\n“What is likely to happen is that we have several co-circulating, semi-dominate lineages going into the winter season,” said Nathan Grubaugh, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health.\n\n“That’s because with convergent evolution, perhaps several different lineages can independently obtain similar transmissibility levels versus a single new variant taking over.\n\n“This is what predominantly happens for most pathogens, such as the flu and RSV,” Grubaugh wrote in an email. “Now that the virus has adapted pretty well to human transmission, most of what is circulating has high fitness.”\n\nMaria Van Kerkhove, the Covid-19 response technical lead for the World Health Organization, said Wednesday that the large mix of new variants was becoming more difficult for WHO to assess because countries were dialing back on their surveillance.\n\n“So we need to be prepared for this. Countries need to be in a position to conduct surveillance, to deal with increases in cases and perhaps deal with increases and hospitalizations. We don’t see a change in severity yet. And our vaccines remain effective, but we have to remain vigilant,” she said.\n\nInaction gives the virus an edge\n\nFor now, the Omicron subvariant BA.5 still holds the top spot in the US. According to CDC estimates, it caused about 68% of new infections in the US last week, but it is quickly being outcompeted by several new sublineages – notably BQ.1 and BQ.1.1.\n\nThe BQs each caused just 6% of new infections in the US last week, but in recent weeks, the share of new Covid-19 infections caused by these viruses has doubled every six to seven days – a rapid rate of growth against BA.5, which is already a highly fit virus, says Dr. Anthony Fauci, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nAnd these are just two of the new crop of Omicron descendants making a move.\n\n“The projections vary a little, but generally, most people feel somewhere in the middle of November that they’ll wind up being a substantial proportion and have bumped BA.5 off as the dominant variant,” Fauci told CNN.\n\nThese variants are different from BA.4 and BA.5, but they’re descended from those viruses, the result of genetic drift. So they share many parts of their genomes with that virus.\n\nTheir changes aren’t on the scale of what happened when the original Omicron arrived on the scene in November 2021. That strain of the virus, which is now long gone, came out of genetic left field, leaving researchers and public health officials scrambling to catch up.\n\nFauci says that this time, we are as ready as we could be for the latest batch of variants.\n\n“It isn’t that different from BA.5 that it would completely escape the protection that you would get from vaccine” – if people would just get the shot, Fauci said.\n\nThe bivalent booster vaccine, authorized in September, protects against the original strain of the coronavirus as well as the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\n“We have a BA.5 bivalent updated vaccine as a booster that we’re pushing people to do. It’s matched against the still-dominant variant, which is BA.5, and almost certainly will have a reasonably good degree of cross-protection against the BQ.1.1 and the others, and yet the uptake of these vaccines, as we are already in the middle of October, is disappointing,” he said.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the CDC, 14.8 million people have gotten an updated bivalent booster six weeks into the campaign promoting it. That’s less than 10% of the population that’s eligible to get one.\n\nThe poor uptake of the new boosters, combined with the immune evasiveness of the new variants and the waning of population immunity, is almost surely a recipe for rising cases and hospitalizations in the weeks ahead.\n\n“It’s probably going to be significantly bigger than the BA.5 wave, at least that’s what I expect,” said Mark Zeller, a project scientist who monitors variants at the Scripps Research Institute. But Zeller says he doesn’t expect this winter’s surge to reach heights of January’s Omicron wave.\n\nHotez says people shouldn’t panic about this news but should pay attention.\n\n“We’re underperforming as a nation with people getting their bivalent boosters,” Hotez said.\n\nThe genetic changes these variants share appear to help them escape the immunity created by vaccines and past infections – a recipe for reinfections and breakthrough infections, particularly for people who haven’t had an updated booster.\n\nCritical therapies could soon stop working\n\nCrucially, some of the variants also appear to be impervious to the last lab-created antibodies available to ward off severe Covid-19 infections: an antibody treatment called bebtelovimab, which is made by Eli Lilly, and the combination of two long-acting antibodies in Evusheld, a shot made by AstraZeneca that helps keep people who are immunocompromised from getting sick in the first place.\n\nIf these antibodies stop working against the virus, the United States will still have Covid-19 antiviral drugs like Paxlovid, molnupiravir and remedsivir to help those at risk of severe complications.\n\nBut antibody therapies are particularly important for people with immune function that has been blunted by drugs, disease or age. These are the same people whose bodies don’t respond robustly to vaccines.\n\nThe antibodies are also needed to help people who can’t take antiviral therapies because of possible reactions with other medications.\n\nWhite House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha says the federal government has been spurring the development of new monoclonal antibodies during the pandemic by promising to purchase new therapies after they’re made.\n\nThe government can’t do that anymore, he said, because Congress has declined to pass additional funding for the Covid-19 response.\n\nAs a result, development of new antibodies – and other new therapeutics – is lagging.\n\n“So even if we got money today, it would take us many months to bring a monoclonal into the marketplace, and we don’t have the money today anyway,” Jha told CNN.\n\nJha said that means the nation is facing fall and winter with a smaller arsenal against the virus, just when it needs to expand its options.\n\n“There is not a monoclonal sitting ready to go tomorrow that we could just buy off the shelf,” he said.\n\nAntibodies are a losing proposition for companies because it takes millions of dollars of investment to make them and because the virus is evolving so fast, they might be effective for only a few months.\n\n“That is a terrible business model,” Jha said.\n\nThe administration has been thinking about ways to commercialize some parts of the Covid-19 response – to get out of the business of buying vaccines and therapies – ultimately passing the costs on to consumers and insurers. But Jha says the process has to be guided by “the needs on the ground and the realities of the virus.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHe says current realities require that the government continue to incentivize the production of new therapies, and he expects that the Biden administration will again try to ask Congress to pass more funding to do that.\n\n“And the truth is that if we want monoclonals to protect high-risk people – which we do – then at this point, given the speed of viral evolution, the US government has to be a major player in that role,” Jha said. “The market cannot take care of it by itself.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/23/health/rsv-symptoms-treatments-wellness/index.html", "title": "RSV in children: Symptoms, treatment and what parents should ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn September, an 8-month-old baby came into Dr. Juanita Mora’s office in Chicago with an infection the doctor hadn’t expected to see for another two months: RSV.\n\nLike her peers across the country, the allergist and immunologist has been treating little ones with this cold-like virus well before the season usually starts.\n\n“We’re seeing RSV infections going rampant all throughout the country,” Mora said.\n\nAlmost all children catch RSV at some point before they turn 2, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Most adults who catch it have a mild illness; for those who are elderly or who have chronic heart or lung disease or a weakened immune system, it can be dangerous. But RSV can be especially tricky for infants and kids.\n\nMora, a volunteer medical spokesperson for the American Lung Association, says it’s important for parents, caregivers and daycare workers to know what to watch for with RSV, which stands for respiratory syncytial virus. That way, they know whether a sick child can be treated at home or needs to go to a hospital.\n\n“The emergency department is getting completely flooded with all these sick kids, so we want parents to know they can go to their pediatrician and get tested for RSV, influenza and even Covid-19,” Mora said.\n\nHere’s what else parents need to know amid the surge of respiratory illnesses.\n\nWhat to watch for\n\nFor many, RSV causes a mild illness that can be managed at home.\n\nOn average, an infection lasts five days to a couple of weeks, and it will often go away on its own, the CDC says. Sometimes, the cough can linger for up to four weeks, pediatricians say.\n\nSymptoms may look like a common cold: a runny nose, a decreased appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing. Young infants may seem only irritable or lethargic and have trouble breathing.\n\nNot every child will have every potential RSV symptom.\n\n“Fevers are really hit or miss with RSV infections, especially in young infants,” said Dr. Priya Soni, assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Cedars Sinai Medical Center.\n\nParents should watch for any changes in behavior, she said, including taking longer to eat or not being interested in food at all. The child can also develop a severe cough and some wheezing.\n\nIt’s also important to watch for signs that your child is struggling to breathe or breathing with their ribs or belly – “symptoms which may kind of overlap with many of the other viruses that we’re seeing a resurgence of,” Soni added.\n\nSince it’s not easy for parents to tell the difference between respiratory illnesses like, say, RSV and flu, it’s good to take a sick child to a pediatrician, who can run tests to pinpoint the cause.\n\n“You may need to take your baby to be evaluated sooner rather than later,” Soni said.\n\nWhen it comes to RSV, parents should be especially cautious if their children are preemies, newborns, children with weakened immune systems or neuromuscular disorders, and those under age 2 with chronic lung and heart conditions, the CDC says.\n\n“Parents should be really astute to any changes, like in their activity and their appetite, and then pay particular attention to any signs of respiratory distress,” Soni said.\n\nRSV treatment\n\nTesting is important because treatment for things like flu and Covid-19 may differ.\n\nThere’s no antiviral or specific treatment for RSV like there is for the flu, nor is there a vaccine. But if your child is sick, there are things you can do to help.\n\nFever and pain can be managed with non-aspirin pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Also make sure your child drinks enough fluids.\n\n“RSV can make kids very dehydrated, especially when they’re not eating or drinking, especially when we’re talking infants,” Mora said. “Once they stop eating or their urine output has decreased, they’re not having as many wet diapers, this is a sign they may have to go to the pediatrician or emergency department.”\n\nTalk to your pediatrician before giving your child any over-the-counter cold medicines, which can sometimes contain ingredients that aren’t good for kids.\n\nWhen to go to the hospital\n\nYour pediatrician will check the child’s respiratory rate – how fast they’re breathing – and their oxygen levels. If your child is very sick or at high risk of severe illness, the doctor may want them to go to a hospital.\n\n“RSV can be super dangerous for some young infants and younger kids, particularly those that are less than 2 years of age,” Soni said.\n\nMora said labored breathing is a sign that a child is having trouble with this virus. RSV can turn into more serious illnesses such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, and that can lead to respiratory failure.\n\nIf you see that a child’s chest is moving up and down when they breathe, if their cough won’t let them sleep or if it’s getting worse, “that might be a sign that they need to seek help from their pediatrician or take them to the emergency department, because then they might need a supplemental oxygen, or they may need a nebulization treatment.”\n\nCNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen says this respiratory difficulty – including a bobbing head, a flaring nose or grunting – is one of two major trouble signs with any respiratory infection. The other is dehydration. “That particularly applies to babies with stuffy noses. They may not be feeding.”\n\nMuch of the care provided by hospital staff will be to help with breathing.\n\n“We provide supportive measures for RSV and these kids with oxygen, IV fluids and respiratory therapies, including suctioning,” Soni said.\n\nA thin tube may need to be inserted into their lungs to remove mucus. A child can get extra oxygen through a mask or through a tube that attaches to their nose. Some children may need to use an oxygen tent. Those who are struggling a lot may need a ventilator.\n\nSome babies might also need to be fed by tube.\n\nHow to prevent RSV\n\nThe best ways to prevent RSV infections, doctors say, is to teach kids to cough and sneeze into a tissue or into their elbows rather than their hands. Also try to keep frequently touched surfaces clean.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIf a caregiver or older sibling is sick, Mora says, they should wear a mask around other people and wash their hands frequently.\n\nAnd most of all, if anyone is sick – child or adult – they should stay home so they don’t spread the illness.\n\nThere is a monoclonal antibody treatment for children who are at highest risk for severe disease. It’s not available for everyone, but it can protect those who are most vulnerable. It comes in the form of a shot that a child can get every month during the typical RSV season. Talk to your doctor about whether your child qualifies.", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/10/23"}]}

Go step-by-step and play every game to win a game, as simple as that.\"\n\nHe didn’t win the award he didn’t care about, but earned the accomplishment he wanted. Jokic is an NBA champion. Despite his monotone pleas that he is just a one player, he is much more than that. He is among the top-3 players in the league, and for his work against the Heat, Jokic earned Finals MVP. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nDon't tire of the Nuggets yet. Jokic & Co. built for more NBA titles\n\nThe Nuggets were a rolling train, picking up speed and confidence, and through April and May and then into June, the Nuggets Express was unstoppable as it went through Minnesota, Phoenix, Los Angeles Lakers and Miami before stopping in Denver for a season-ending celebration.\n\nCoach Michael Malone was the conductor, getting his team to play some of its best basketball of the season. Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray formed the engine, and a roster built through the draft, free agency and trades provided fuel for a title.\n\nThe Nuggets, who were atop the Western Conference from December until the end of the regular season and earned the No. 1 seed, have arrived, a combination of talent, patience, health and vision coming together at the right time.\n\n“Since day one (in training camp) in San Diego, it was something different about this team,” Jokic said. “I felt it. I felt some different energy and every day since then I had the same feeling. I'm not really optimistic guy, but that gave me hope that we can do something.”\n\nNow, the Nuggets have their starting five under contract for at least next season and possibly longer. They will be among the favorites next season.\n\n\"We accomplished something this franchise has never done before,\" Malone said. \"But we have a lot of young talented players in that locker room, and we just showed through 16 playoff wins what we're capable of on the biggest stage in the world.\" — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nWatch: Nikola Jokic and brothers have hilariously heartwarming NBA Finals celebrations\n\nFor NBA Finals MVP Nikola Jokic, the Denver Nuggets' first championship was a family affair.\n\nAfter the buzzer sounded and his team had won 94-89, Jokic's teammates were visibly emotional. The icy two-time regular season MVP remained stoic as he told Lisa Salters, \"The job is done, we can go home now.\"\n\nBut the center's brothers were not going to let him avoid the celebration.\n\nStrahinja, the oldest of the three, lifted up his 6-11, 284-pound youngest brother by holding him under a leg and bouncing him up and down.

Yes, Larry always goes well with obtuse goggles and champagne spray.\n\nBut, even though neither the Nuggets nor the Heat are the glitziest teams in the league, there were plenty of good looks from throughout the series, including designer shirts and cozy matching sweatsuits. The stars came to shine. Here’s the NBA Finals drip check. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nCalling his shot broken, Michael Porter Jr. has impact on Game 5, Nuggets' NBA title\n\nMichael Porter Jr. called his jump shot broken.\n\n\"I didn't play well offensively, to my capabilities,\" Porter said, adding, \"I don't know what was going on with my shot. I really don't care. I'll fix it in the offseason.\"\n\nPorter doesn’t need to worry about his shot now. He is an NBA champion following the Denver Nuggets’ 94-89 victory against the Miami Heat in Game 5 of the NBA Finals.\n\nPorter is right. He didn’t play well offensively in the Finals. He averaged 9.6 points, well below his season average of 17.4 points, and against Miami, he made just 32.8% of his shots and just 14.3% on 3-pointers.\n\nBut he also averaged 8.4 rebounds, and despite his lack of offense, the Nuggets were better with Porter on the court than off the court against Miami. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nJimmy Butler vows NBA Finals loss not end for battle-tested Heat\n\nThe Miami Heat made history by becoming only the second No. 8 seed to reach the NBA Finals. They did it with grit and will power, but it wasn't enough to become the only No. 8 seed to win the championship as they lost a five-game series to the Denver Nuggets on Monday night.\n\nJimmy Butler was the undeniable leader of the team. He played through an ankle injury that he suffered in Game 1 of the second round of the playoffs against the New York Knicks. He sat out one game and played the rest of the playoffs. After losing the Finals, he said was \"fine,\" there was \"zero\" pain and \"no excuse.\"\n\nHe led by example and encouragement. He brought the Heat to an escape room ahead of Game 2 of the Finals for a bit of bonding and regrouping after dropping the first matchup. Afterward, Miami captured its sole win of the series.\n\nEn route to the Finals, his confidence never wavered as the Boston Celtics rallied from down 0-3 to force a Game 7. Butler guaranteed a win in Game 6 and when that didn't happen, he made sure it did in the final matchup. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nDenver Nuggets announce parade date\n\nThe Nuggets announced that their championship parade will be Thursday, June 15. The parade will start at Denver's Union Station and stop at Civic Center Park.\n\nNikola Jokic named MVP\n\nNikola Jokic paced the Nuggets with 28 points, 16 rebounds and four assists in the hard-fought Game 5 win. The Nuggets center shot an efficient 12-of-16 from the floor. He played a team-high 42 minutes in the series-clinching victory.\n\nJokic was named MVP for his performance in the NBA Finals.\n\n— Tyler Dragon\n\nJamal Murray able to overcome tough shooting night\n\nJamal Murray shot a subpar 6-of-15 from the floor, but he did make timely plays in the second half to help the Nuggets overcome a pesky Heat squad. Murray tallied 14 points, eight rebounds and eight assists in the win. The Nuggets were a +12 when he was on the floor, a sign of his overall impact for Denver.\n\n— Tyler Dragon\n\nNikola Jokic, Nuggets win first NBA title in Game 5 nail-biter over Heat\n\nDENVER — Style points in an NBA Finals closeout game are insignificant.\n\nWin pretty, win ugly, it doesn’t matter. Just win.\n\nThat’s what the Denver Nuggets did, beating Miami 94-89 in Game 5 Monday and winning the franchise’s first championship in its 47-year NBA history.\n\nThe Nuggets overcame a 10-point deficit and horrible 3-point shooting (16.7%), outscoring the Heat 50-38 in the second half.\n\nDenver struggled to make 3-pointers (just 3-for-23 through three quarters) and committed careless turnovers. But Miami wasn’t much better on 3-pointers, and the Nuggets have one thing the Heat do not: Nikola Jokic.\n\nJokic had 28 points and 16 rebounds, and 19 of his points came in the second half when the Nuggets found a way to win.\n\nBruce Brown’s putback with 1:31 left gave Denver a 90-89 lead, and Jimmy Butler’s turnover with 24.7 seconds left led to two Kentavious Caldwell-Pope free throws for a 92-89 Nuggets lead. Miami called timeout. Jimmy Butler missed a 3-pointer and Bruce Brown secured the title with two more free throws.\n\nThe Nuggets received contributions from starters and reserves, and just as in the overall scope of the series, the Nuggets’ talent emerged as superior over the course of four quarters in Game 5.\n\nMichael Porter Jr. had 16 points and 13 rebounds, and Jamal Murray finished with 14 points, five rebounds and five assists. Brown added 10 points and Caldwell-Pope had 11.\n\nThe Heat were a remarkable postseason story. They lost their first play-in game, had to beat Toronto in the second play-in game just to get the No. 8 seed and then eliminated top-seeded Milwaukee in the first round. Miami beat New York and then stopped Boston in seven games in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nIt was an admirable team that played hard and made it difficult for opponents to win games. However, Denver proved to be a different Miami foe -- too much talent led by Jokic, the two-time MVP and now NBA Finals MVP.\n\nButler led the Heat with 21 points, and Bam Adebayo had 20 points and 12 rebounds.\n\n— Jeff Zillgitt\n\nThird quarter update: Heat 71, Nuggets 70\n\nAfter being down 51-44 at halftime, the Nuggets were able to generate some momentum in the third quarter. Jamal Murray drilled a three to tie the game 60-60 with 6:46 in third quarter and forced a Heat timeout.\n\nAt the time it was only Denver’s second made 3-point field goal of the game.\n\nDespite the rough shooting from behind the arc, Denver was able to trim its deficit 71-70 at the end of the third quarter in large part because of Michael Porter Jr. The small forward had a creative drive and finish in transition.\n\nPorter also made a three to give the Nuggets a brief lead. Porter has 16 points entering the fourth quarter.\n\nBam Adebayo has a team-best 20 points for the Heat.\n\n― Tyler Dragon\n\nTerrible shooting from long range\n\nThe Nuggets haven't been able to find their touch from three-point range. Denver was 2-20 on three-point field goals at the 3:58 mark of the third quarter. The Heat haven't shot much better. Miami's shooting 5-22 from behind the arc.\n\nHalftime update: Heat 51, Nuggets 44\n\nThe Heat took their momentum from the end of the first quarter into the second while Denver had foul trouble. Besides Aaron Gordon picking up his third foul of the half, Jamal Murray committed a shooting foul on Jimmy Butler midway through the quarter that had the crowd at Ball Arena booing loudly. Butler made both his free throws.\n\nBruce Brown had a steal and a layup that brought the Nuggets to within four and forced Erik Spoelstra to call a timeout. The Heat outscored Denver 12-9 from there, but neither team’s shots were falling consistently.\n\nA long toss from Jokic at the buzzer bounced off the rim.\n\nBam Adebayo leads the Heat with 18 points and nine rebounds. Michael Porter Jr. and Jokic each have nine points for the Nuggets. Murray has been held to four points. He’s averaged 23 in the series.\n\n― Victoria Hernandez\n\nAaron Gordon in early foul trouble\n\nAaron Gordon found himself on the bench in the first half.\n\nThe Nuggets power forward picked up his third personal foul with over nine minutes remaining in the second quarter. Nuggets coach Mike Malone quickly subbed Gordon out following his third foul.\n\nThe Nuggets trailed 30-27 when Gordon checked out of the lineup.\n\nGordon had a breakout performance in Denver's Game 4 win with a game-high 27 points.\n\n― Tyler Dragon\n\nFirst quarter update: Heat 24, Nuggets 22\n\nNeither team started well. The Nuggets committed four turnovers in the first four minutes of the opening quarter, and the Heat missed 12 of their first 14 shots.\n\nThe Nuggets found composure and took a 12-5 lead ‒ after falling behind 5-0 to start the game. Miami settled in, too, getting production from Bam Adebayo (14 points, six rebounds) and Max Strrus (eight points), who combined for 22 of Miami’s 24 points in the first quarter.\n\nNuggets star Nikola Jokic had three points, three rebounds and two assists, but he picked up his second foul with 2:51 left in the quarter, sending him to the bench. Jokic’s foul situation is worth watching. He had foul trouble in Game 4, but the Nuggets managed the minutes without him on the court. Michael Porter Jr. led the Nuggets with seven points and seven rebounds.\n\nDenver was 10-for-24 from the field but just 1-for-8 on 3-pointers; Miami was 10-for-28 and 1-for-6.\n\n— Jeff Zillgitt\n\nDenver rapper Trev Rich hypes crowd up for Game 5 of NBA Finals\n\nDenver rapper Trev Rich opened Game 5 of the NBA Finals by narrating a Nuggets hype video ahead of the national anthem. He has made his name as a leader of the local music scene and was nominated for a Grammy for his work on the soundtrack for “Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse.” He appeared on “Elevate” with Denzel Curry and Cordae, who is expecting a child with tennis star Naomi Osaka. He also was featured on “Whole Team,” which was part of the “Madden ‘23” soundtrack.\n\n— Victoria Hernandez\n\nGame 5 starting lineups\n\nThe Nuggets went with their usual starting lineup of Jamal Murray, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Michael Porter Jr., Aaron Gordon and Nikola Jokic for Game 5.\n\nThe Heat started Gabe Vincent, Max Strus, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Love and Bam Adebayo.\n\n— Tyler Dragon\n\nNathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats performed Game 5 national anthem\n\nNathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats gave a folksy rendition of the “Star Spangled Banner” at Ball Arena ahead of Game 5 of the NBA Finals. The group wore Denver Nuggets shirts as they stood at center court together while the arena lit up in red, white and blue lights.\n\nThe group, who also performed the national anthem ahead of Game 1, is best known for their platinum-certified song “S.O.B.” They released their newest EP, “What If” earlier this month.\n\n— Victoria Hernandez\n\nNikola Jokic 2023 playoff stats\n\nThe two-time league MVP is averaging a near triple-double through 19 games this postseason: 30.1 points, 13.3 rebounds and 9.8 assists per game.\n\nJimmy Butler playoff stats\n\nThrough 21 playoff games, Butler is averaging 27.2 points on 47.6% shooting, including 35.6% from 3. He’s also grabbing 6.6 rebounds, dishing out 5.9 assists and snagging 1.7 steals per game.\n\nOver 64 regular-season games, Butler averaged 22.9 points on 53.9% shooting (35% from 3), 5.9 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game.\n\nTyler Herro available for Game 5\n\nTyler Herro (hand) is available to play in Game 5, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra announced pregame. The guard hasn't played since Game 1 of Miami's opening-round series against the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\n\"He's done everything he needed to do. We appreciate all the work that he's put in. It's been a long whatever, six, seven weeks of this. He's put himself out there, available. It's all hands on deck,\" Spoelstra said pregame. \"So we'll go with our initial, our normal rotation, and then we'll just see how the game plays out. We have no idea how this game's going to play out, but it's great to have everybody available.\"\n\nThe Heat upgraded Herro to questionable hours before for Monday's game. He averaged 20.1 points, 5.4 rebounds and 4.2 assists during the 2022-23 regular season.\n\nMike Malone: ‘This is gonna be the hardest thing we’ve ever done’\n\nThe Nuggets are on the verge of winning their first championship in franchise history. Is Denver up for the challenge? Mike Malone believes his team is ready.\n\n“Our guys have been really locked in and focused. We all fully understand the opportunity that we have in front of us. It’s not gonna be easy,” Malone said during his pregame press conference. “This is gonna be the hardest thing that we’ve ever done. (Kentavious Caldwell-Pope) is the only guy in that room who has ever won a championship. Tonight is gonna be another example of us trying to achieve something that none of us have achieved. All the guys are excited for the opportunity.”\n\n— Tyler Dragon\n\nNBA Finals Game 5 referees\n\nCrew chief Marc Davis, referee David Guthrie, umpire Josh Tiven and alternate Ed Malloy are the officials for Game 5.\n\nHave the Nuggets ever won a championship?\n\nThis would be Denver’s first NBA Finals victory. The Nuggets are at the door, making their first Finals appearance in franchise history. Injuries slowed the Nuggets for a couple of seasons, but they’ve been headed in this direction since they reached the conference finals and lost to the Lakers in the 2020 Orlando bubble.\n\nBest finish before this season: Lost in the conference finals five times, most recently to the Lakers in 2020.\n\n— Jeff Zillgitt\n\nNot watching the spellbinding Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray? You're missing NBA history.\n\nThere are great duos in the NBA, and the Jokic-Murray duo has emerged as one of the best. Their pick-and-roll game is devastating to opponents. They try to make sure the other is getting enough touches to make the offense work. They know how to maximize their strengths and each other's.\n\n\"I'd say it's a trust and a feel, that's the best way for me to put it. It's not really Xs and Os,\" Murray said. \"It's just reading the game and trusting that the other is going to make the right play. If he throws it to me, he knows and expects what to see from me, and he knows the mood I'm in, the intensity I'm playing with. ...\n\n“I think it's just a feel and a trust that we're going to figure it out, and it's a lot of unselfishness. It's free flowing. If something is there, we go. If it's not, we don't force it.”\n\nIt is spellbinding to watch two players control a game with scoring, rebounding and passing.\n\nOther than the NBA and its broadcast partners, it’s no one else’s job to sell these Finals to a sports-watching public. But you’re missing out if you’re not watching Jokic and Murray. You’re missing NBA history.\n\n— Jeff Zillgitt\n\nNuggets ‘not satisfied’ yet heading into Game 5\n\nPure joy and satisfaction remain one victory away for the Denver Nuggets.\n\nBeating Phoenix and advancing to the Western Conference finals and beating the Los Angeles Lakers and reaching the NBA Finals were just steps, part of a larger mission to win an NBA championship.\n\n\"I speak for 17 players in that locker room and the entire organization: We are not satisfied,\" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said nearly three weeks ago after Denver swept the Lakers.\n\nThe only thing will make this season redeeming and successful is beating the Miami Heat one more time. Up 3-1 in the Finals after Friday’s 108-95 victory, the Nuggets are in position to claim the franchise’s first NBA championship in Game 5 Monday.\n\n— Jeff Zillgitt\n\n'He's tough. He's chill.' Aaron Gordon just being himself is everything for Nuggets\n\nNikola Jokic didn’t have a triple-double.\n\nJamal Murray didn’t score 30-plus points.\n\nBut Aaron Gordon scored a playoff career-high 27 points and had seven rebounds and six assists, and when Jokic went to the bench with five fouls early in the fourth quarter, the Nuggets faced a moment of truth.\n\nThey emerged with a 108-95 victory against the Miami Heat in Game 4 of the NBA Finals, putting Denver up 3-1.\n\nGordon is part of a thriving team that is playing great basketball at the right time and on the cusp of the franchise’s first NBA championship.\n\n\"Aaron did it all for us tonight. He really did,\" Denver coach Michael Malone said. \"We've seen that now in four games in the Finals where Aaron has had moments where he has carried us offensively. He made threes tonight (3-for-4), obviously, which is always a good thing, but I couldn't be more proud of Aaron Gordon and his impact across the board.”\n\n— Jeff Zillgitt\n\nNikola Jokic in rare company\n\nNikola Jokic is the third player to average 30 points, 10 rebounds and 55% shooting through the first four games of an NBA Finals, per ESPN Stats & Info. The Nuggets center joins Giannis Antetokounmpo (2021) and Shaquille O'Neal (three times) as the only players to every accomplish the feat.\n\n— Tyler Dragon\n\nBruce Brown is the latest Nuggets reserve to star in NBA Finals\n\nDenver Nuggets reserve Bruce Brown scored 26 points in the first three games of the NBA Finals against the Miami Heat.\n\nIn Game 4 − when the Nuggets needed an additional scorer − Brown scored 21 points, including 11 in the fourth quarter, as Denver pulled away for a 108-95 victory and a 3-1 series lead.\n\n\"Bruce Brown in the fourth quarter was amazing,” Denver coach Michael Malone said. \"They were giving Jamal (Murray) so much attention that, 'Let's get Jamal off the ball, let Bruce make some plays.' He was aggressive, got to the basket, made shots, and tonight was an impressive performance.\"\n\n— Jeff Zillgitt\n\nBang! ABC/ESPN's Breen enters rarified air in Game 5 of NBA Finals with 100th broadcast\n\nMike Breen is currently the dean of television announcers for the NBA Finals — and he is about to enter rarified air space.\n\nThe ABC/ESPN announcer will reach another milestone on Monday night in Game 5 of the Denver-Miami series. It will be Breen’s 100th NBA Finals broadcast, making him the third basketball announcer on radio or television to reach that mark. He'll be the sixth U.S. play-by-play voice to eclipse the mark, including the World Series and Stanley Cup Final.\n\nBreen missed the first two games of last year’s series due to COVID, which briefly delayed him from reaching the century mark.\n\n“I knew how many years I had done the finals, but I never put it into a specific number of games,” said Breen, who is calling his 18th championship series. “I would have never said 100. For some reason, to hear that number was surprising to me, and it’s not something even in my wildest dreams that I thought I could do.”\n\n— Joe Reedy, Associated Press\n\nAfter Conor McGregor punches, Miami Heat mascot Burnie ready for potential Game 6\n\nBurnie, the Miami Heat mascot who had to visit the emergency room after taking two punches from MMA star Conor McGregor during a promotional announcement in Game 4 on Friday, will be available for a potential Game 6.\n\n\"That's the Miami Heat toughness that we're talking about,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said Sunday, adding, \"We won't reveal who that is, but yeah, he can take a punch and get back up. He's not going to miss any time.\"\n\nThe incident happened with 7:35 remaining in the third quarter of Denver’s 108-95 victory in Game 4. The Heat revealed their partnership with McGregor and his pain relief spray called TIDL Sport. It was an awkward presentation as some fans booed McGregor who also sat courtside for the game.\n\n— Jeff Zillgitt\n\nHeat's Udonis Haslem spoke for many Floridians (and Americans) by bashing Ron DeSantis | Opinion\n\nMiami Heat player Udonis Haslem did something recently that a lot of Floridians likely want to. That a lot of athletes in Florida would probably like to do as well. Hell, that a lot of Americans want to.\n\nHe bashed Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida and a Presidential hopeful, as an embarrassment to the state. Haslem did it in no uncertain terms. No holding back. No caveats. Haslem spoke the truth and did something important while doing it. He used his power not just to bring attention to the abhorrent things DeSantis is doing in Florida, but also condemn them.\n\nMake no mistake: what Haslem has done is courageous because he risks an attack from DeSantis and his allies. They can try and make his life miserable but Haslem doesn't seem to care.\n\n— Mike Freeman\n\nNBA Finals Game 5 odds\n\nTipico Sportsbook has the spread favoring Denver by 8.5 points over Miami.

It's a good win. We've done our job. But we're not celebrating like we've done anything yet.'\n\n\"We know we're going to have to go home and turn off the TV, the radio, don't read the papers, don't listen to everybody telling you how great you are because we haven't done a damn thing yet. We have to win another game to be world champions, and we're going to do that by simply taking it one quarter at a time.\"\n\nMalone’s cliched but necessary approach is part of what has allowed the Nuggets to get this far. And he’s right, his team shouldn’t pay attention to the media because we have the Nuggets winning the series soon.\n\nThe Nuggets were the best team in the playoffs after two rounds, the best after beating the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference finals and through four games of the NBA Finals, there is no doubt who the best team is.\n\nThey have the best player left in the playoffs in Nikola Jokic and the best 1-2 combo in the playoffs in Jokic and Jamal Murray, the best starting five and the best rotation. They’re getting necessary contributions from the tight eight-man rotation.\n\nDenver Nuggets have 'tools' to claim franchise's first title\n\n\"We’re just ready to win a championship,\" Murray said. \"We have the tools to do it. It's been on our minds for a while. We're just locked in. I don't think you've got to overthink it. We're just dialed in, ready to win.\"\n\nMurray had 15 points, 12 assists and zero turnovers in Game 4, becoming the first player to have at least 10 assists in his first four Finals games and joining Magic Johnson as the only two players to have at least 10 assists in four consecutive Finals games.\n\nJokic’s 23 points, 12 rebounds and four assists Friday made him the first player to have at least 500 points, 250 rebounds and 150 assists in one postseason.\n\nThe contributions come from everywhere. Aaron Gordon had a playoff career-high 27 points, Bruce Brown scored 11 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, Michael Porter Jr. reached double figures in points after struggling to score in Games 2 and 3 and Jeff Green and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope made important 3-pointers in Game 4. That followed Christian Braun’s 15 points off the bench in Game 3, a game in which Murray and Jokic each had triple-doubles including the first 30-point, 20-rebound triple-double in a Finals game from Jokic.\n\nDenver’s three victories have been by at least 10 points. The Nuggets have the best offense in the playoffs, scoring 119.3 points per 100 possessions and the best defense for any team that advanced beyond the second round, allowing 111.1 points per 100 possessions. They have limited Miami’s 3-point shooting which was a league-best 39% after the first three rounds and 43.4% in the Eastern Conference finals against Boston.\n\nThe Heat are down to 36.6% against Denver, including 32.3% in their three losses.\n\nNuggets 'locked in' on defense\n\n\"That’s two games in a row, and even the first game that we won, our defense has been playing at a high level,\" Malone said. \"I've got to give our guys so much credit for being locked in, being disciplined. That's three wins now where our defense has held them under 100 points, and the three-point line once again was a huge part of that. Only eight made threes for them tonight, and our guys are locked in. We're focused.”\n\nHeat coach Erik Spoelstra tried to conjure the same confidence he displayed against Boston headed into Game 7 after a 3-0 Heat lead turned into a 3-3 series.\n\n\"All we are going to focus on,\" Spoelstra said, \"is getting this thing back to the 305.\"\n\nMiami’s competitiveness is and should be admired.

Building a Hall of Fame resume, Jokic was the 41st pick in the second round in 2014 ― the greatest second-round pick in the league history and the only modern-day second-rounder to win MVP.\n\nFrom Sombor, Serbia, Jokic professes a love of family and horses and eschews fame and media appearances. \"My journey, I don't think it's that interesting,\" he said, refusing to open up about his life story.\n\nHe came to the NBA with potential. But concerns existed: slow feet, can’t jump, out of shape and overweight. He was not a sure-fire, can't-miss lottery pick.\n\nSeason by season, he dispelled those concerns and emerged first as an All-Star, then All-NBA and then MVP winner in 2021 and 2022.\n\n\"It just so happens that the two-time MVP and a great player in Nikola kind of embodies everything,\" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \"When you have a guy that has had the success that Nikola has had, being your hardest worker and being as selfless as he is and trusting as much as he does, well, that allows everybody else to kind of fall in line.\"\n\nJokic is an NBA champion and Finals MVP, just the sixth international player to win the award, joining Hakeem Olajuwon, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Dirk Nowitzki and Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nNikola Jokic shares moment with daughter\n\nJokic shared a special moment with his daughter Ognjena, who turns 2 in September.

Nuggets beat Heat behind Nikola Jokic", "text": "DENVER — The biggest concern for the Miami Heat against the Denver Nuggets played out over four quarters in Game 1 of the NBA Finals.\n\nDenver’s explosive offense, loaded with size, versatility, options, quickness and talented scorers, proved too much for the Heat. The Nuggets toppled Miami 104-93 Thursday for a 1-0 series lead, and the winner of Game 1 in the Finals has won the championship 69.7% of the time.\n\nGame 2 is Sunday in Denver (8 p.m. ET, ABC).\n\nIt was a great start for the Nuggets, who received an efficient scoring effort from two-time MVP Nikola Jokic and his presence as a facilitator opened up opportunities for his teammates.\n\nJokic recorded his ninth playoff triple-double this season with 27 points on 12 shots, 14 assists and 10 rebounds. He now has 15 playoff triple-doubles, third most all-time behind Magic Johnson (30) and LeBron James (28).\n\nDenver’s Jamal Murray had 26 points, Aaron Gordon had 16 points (12 in the first quarter) and Michael Porter Jr. added 14 points and 12 rebounds.\n\nDenver had ample space driving to the rim and shooting from distance and made 51.3% of its shots.\n\nMiami won Game 1 on the road in its three previous playoff series this season but wasn’t able to pull that off against Denver, which improved to 9-0 at home in the postseason.\n\n\"I reminded our group, if they didn't know that Miami went into Milwaukee and won Game 1. They went into the Garden in New York City and won Game 1. They won Game 1 up in Boston. So, we did not want them coming in here taking control of the series on our court,\" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said.\n\nThe Heat trailed 84-60 with 40.6 seconds left in the third quarter and cut the deficit to 96-87 with 2:34 left in the fourth. But Denver had enough distance to secure the victory.\n\n\"Our disposition, the multiple efforts, the resolve in the second half was much better,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \"But you get to this level, it has to be complete games of that kind of disposition. Even if you have that, you are not always going to win all the possessions that you want.\"\n\nDynamic duo:Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray are potent one-two punch. Miami must stop one of them to win\n\nSilver lining?:Bam Adebayo had record night in Miami Heat's NBA Finals Game 1 fumble to Denver Nuggets\n\nHow do Heat get back into NBA Finals?:For Erik Spoelstra it starts with their 'toughness'\n\nThe Heat lacked the same shooting they had against Boston in the Eastern Conference finals. Bam Adebayo scored a team-high 26 points and had 13 rebounds but he didn’t have much help.\n\nMax Strus missed all 10 of his shots, including nine 3s, and Strus and Caleb Martin were a combined 1-for-17 from the field. The Heat shot 43.4% on 3s against the Celtics but just 13-for-39 (33.3%) against Denver.\n\nJimmy Butler added a bland 13-point, seven-rebound, seven-assist effort for Miami.\n\n\"Our game is not built just on the 3-point ball,\" Spoelstra said. \"We have proven that time and time again. We can win games. We can win series, regardless of how the 3 is going.\n\n\"But we also have ignitable guys. You see a couple go through and that also can become an avalanche. One way or the other, we have to find a way to get the job done.\"\n\n— Jeff Zillgitt\n\nNikola Jokic, Jamal Murray make history with Game 1 performances\n\nJokic (27 points, 10 rebounds, 14 assists) and Murray (26 points, six rebounds, 10 assists) made some history in Game 1 with their box scores.\n\nPer ESPN Stats & Info, they became just the second pair of teammates to have at least 25 points and 10 assists in an NBA Finals game, joining Hall of Famers Magic Johnson and James Worthy, who did it for the Lakers in 1987. Jokic and Murray are also just the third and fourth players to post 25-5-10 lines in their NBA Finals debut, joining Michael Jordan and Russell Westbrook, according to the NBA.\n\nJokic became just the second player, behind Jordan, to finish with outright game-highs in points and assists in his Finals debut, per the Elias Sports Bureau. (His Airness actually lost that game in 1991, to the Lakers.) Jokic also became just the second player, behind Jason Kidd, to finish with a triple-double in his Finals debut, per the league.\n\nHeat had NBA Finals record-low 2 free throw attempts in Game 1\n\nMiami \"made history,\" Bam Adebayo said, but not in a good way. The Heat only had two free throw attempts in their Game 1 loss to the Nuggets, setting a record for the fewest free throw attempts for a team in the NBA Finals.\n\nNone of the Heat starting five made it to the free throw line. Haywood Highsmith made two free throws off the bench. The Denver Nuggets, in comparison, had 20 free throw attempts.\n\n“When we got in the locker room and seen the stat sheet, I feel like we were all shocked that we only had two free throws,\" said Adebayo, who finished with a team-high 26 points. When reporters asked him about the free throw disparity again, Adebayo quipped: \"If I do say something, will you take the fine?\"\n\nJimmy Butler said the Heat settled on jump shots instead of “putting pressure on the rim, getting layups and getting to the free throw line.” Coach Erik Spoelstra agreed: “We are an aggressive, attacking team, and so if we are not getting those kind of opportunities at the rim or at the free throw line, we have to find different ways to be able to do it.”\n\nBefore Miami, the Los Angeles Lakers recorded a record-low five free throw attempts against the Philadelphia 76ers on May 26, 1983.\n\nHeat go on 11-0 run to cut Denver's lead to 10, but Nuggets respond\n\nMiami isn’t done yet. The Heat opened the fourth quarter with an 11-0 run to close the Nuggets' lead to 10. Kyle Lowry knocked down back-to-back 3-pointers to cut the lead to 84-74. Lowry has 11 points off the bench.\n\nJeff Green ended the run and scored the Nuggets’ first points of the fourth quarter with 9:02 remaining. Then the Nuggets quickly extended their lead back to 16 (90-74), thanks to two made free throws from Jokic and a layup.\n\nJokic is one rebound away from a triple double – 19 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds.\n\nQ3: Nuggets 84, Heat 63\n\nDENVER — The Miami Heat went on a 7-0 run to start the third quarter and closed the gap to 10. Four of those points were from Bam Adebayo.\n\nA layup and-one from Denver’s Jamal Murray halted their momentum and the Heat couldn’t recover.\n\nEven a dunk from Jimmy Butler midway through the quarter couldn’t give the Heat hope.\n\nAaron Gordon exemplified the Nuggets’ stalwart defense by swatting Max Strus’ attempt at a long jumper. The play got the crowd back into the game after a lull.\n\nThree-point buckets from Nikola Jokic and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope continued Denver’s dominance and a trey from Bruce Brown was a dagger that gave the Nuggets a 19-point lead and caused Miami coach Erik Spoelstra to call a timeout.\n\nDenver continued to extend the gap ended the third quarter up 84-63.\n\nMurray and Adebayo lead each of their teams with 24 points.\n\n— Victoria Hernandez\n\nCaleb Martin, Max Strus remain scoreless in Game 1\n\nCaleb Martin was the unlikely hero of the Heat’s Game 7 victory over the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals, but he’s pulled a disappearing act so far in Game 1 of the NBA Finals.\n\nMartin has struggled to get on the board, shooting 0-for-6 and 0-for-1 from three nearly halfway through the third quarter. He’s not the only Heat starter struggling. Max Strus is 0-for-9, including 0-for-8 from three.\n\nBam Adebayo leads the Heat with 22 points and eight rebounds, but has three fouls. Meanwhile, four of five starters for the Nuggets are in double figures, lead by Jamal Murray's 24 points\n\nMiami trails Denver 71-55 with 6:12 remaining in the third.\n\nHalftime: Nuggets 59, Heat 42\n\nDENVER — The Nuggets turned their nine-point lead after the first quarter into a 17-point margin in the second quarter.\n\nThe Nuggets had too much space to operate offensively in the first half, creating several easy opportunities. The Nuggets outscored the Heat 32-18 in points in the paint and shot 59.5% from the field and 45.5% on 3-pointers. And they did it with Nikola Jokic taking just three shots in the half. However, he had 10 points, 10 assists and three rebounds, threatening to record another playoff triple-double.\n\nJamal Murray scored 18 points, Aaron Gordon had 14 (12 in the first quarter) and Michael Porter Jr. had 10 points and seven rebounds for Denver.\n\nBam Adebayo scored 16 points for Miami, which shot just 37.5% from the field and 23.5 % on 3-pointers (4-for-17) in the opening two quarters — after torching Boston from 3 in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\n— Jeff Zillgitt\n\nDenver fired up as Nuggets play first NBA Finals game in franchise history\n\nDENVER — The atmosphere at Ball Arena was electric Thursday night as the venue was glittering gold with a packed house.\n\nFans were given goldenrod T-shirts and glowing wristbands that changed colors between blue and yellow to help create excitement.\n\nThey cheered loudly from the time Rocky the mascot descended from the ceiling prior to tipoff. They kept up the high energy as Jamal Murray’s dunk in the first quarter gave the Nuggets an eight-point lead.\n\nThe boos abounded as Denver’s Christian Braun was called for a shooting foul on Miami’s Haywood Highsmith shortly after the start of the second quarter.\n\nWhen former Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning was shown on the Jumbotron, he was given an enthusiastic ovation. Current Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson and actor Ken Jeong were among other celebrities in attendance.\n\n— Victoria Hernandez\n\nMichael Porter Jr. takes elbow to the face\n\nMichael Porter Jr. took a shot to the face from Bam Adebayo. Both Porter and Adebayo were under the basket when Porter was struck in the face by Adebayo’s elbow. He fell to the floor and missed a possession on the other end before the Nuggets called a timeout with 7:18 remaining in the first half. A foul was not called.\n\nPorter got looked at by trainers on the bench before he reentered the game following the timeout. He has 10 points, five rebounds and two blocks so far. The Nuggets lead 48-37.\n\nQ1: Nuggets 29, Heat 20\n\nThe Denver Nuggets got off to a hot start at home and lead by nine after the first quarter. Aaron Gordon accounted for 12 of the Nuggets’ 29 points and Jamal Murray added eight points. Nikola Jokic got on the board with 3.1 seconds remaining in the first. He has two points and six assists.\n\nBam Adebayo leads the Heat with eight points. Jimmy Butler has seven.\n\n\"(The Nuggets) did a good job with their cutting, their passing and setting screens,\" Gabe Vincent said after the first. \"I think we got some good looks.\"\n\nAaron Gordon storms out of the gate, Nuggets take early lead\n\nThe Nuggets' game plan: take advantage of the Heat's size, starting with Aaron Gordon's size advantage over Miami's wings. Gordon exploded for 12 points and four rebounds in the first quarter to give Denver a seven-point lead over Miami. The Nuggets have 18 points in the paint. Nikola Jokic hasn’t taken a shot yet, but he has six assists.\n\nBoth teams are struggling from three. The Nuggets started 1-for-5 from beyond the arc and Miami is 2-for-6 from three.\n\nAdam Silver: Ja Morant's punishment will be released after NBA Finals\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver said the results of the NBA’s investigation into Ja Morant for allegedly displaying a handgun on Instagram for the second time will be released after the Finals.\n\n“We’ve uncovered a fair amount of additional information,” Silver said when asked by USA TODAY Sports how close the league was to wrapping up the investigation. “We probably could have brought it to a head now, but we’ve made the decision that it would be unfair to these players and these teams to announce that decision in the middle of this series.”\n\nThe Grizzlies suspended Morant two weeks ago after a recording of Morant on Instagram Live appeared to show him holding a handgun – almost two months after the league suspended him eight games for a similar incident in a Denver-area strip club.\n\nJeff Zillgitt's full story here.\n\nRest vs. Rust?\n\nIt's an age-old debate.\n\nThe Denver Nuggets, who swept the Los Angeles Lakers on May 22, are going into Game 1 with seven days more rest than the Miami Heat, who advanced following a Game 7 win over the Boston Celtics on May 29.\n\n\"It's gonna be one of two things, (the Heat) have tremendous rhythm... We've had 10 days off,\" Denver coach Mike Malone said ahead of Game 1. \"You can't replicate game rhythm without playing a game. We've tried doing the best job we can do, but we're gonna find out.\"\n\nShaq asks Tyler Herro: 'Hey, you playing?!'\n\nShaquille O'Neal went straight to the source.\n\nThe \"Inside the NBA\" analyst asked Tyler Herro if he was playing in Game 1 while passing each other in the hallways of Denver's Ball Arena. Herro was ruled out by Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra earlier this week, but apparently O'Neal didn't get the memo.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Herro can return to the lineup as soon as Game 2 on Sunday.\n\nWho is Caleb Martin, the Heat's unlikely hero?\n\nIf the average NBA fan didn't know who Miami Heat guard Caleb Martin was before Monday's Eastern Conference final Game 7 against the Boston Celtics, they certainly know now. Especially Celtics fans.\n\nMartin started for the first time in the series, played 45 minutes and scored 26 points on 11-of-16 shooting, while also grabbing 10 rebounds as the Heat avoided a monumental collapse and beat the Celtics 103-84 to advance to the NBA Finals where they will take on the Denver Nuggets starting Thursday night.\n\n— Scooby Axson\n\nRanking the 12 NBA teams without a title by who's closest to winning first championship\n\nTwelve NBA teams have never won a championship. A few who haven’t − such as the Phoenix Suns, Utah Jazz, Orlando Magic, Indiana Pacers, Oklahoma City Thunder − have been close, reaching the NBA Finals at least once.\n\nThe Denver Nuggets, who have never won an NBA championship, are in the Finals for the first time with a great chance of capturing their first title. The Nuggets have been the best team in the postseason with a 12-3 record, and they have the best playoff performer in two-time MVP Nikola Jokic.\n\nHere’s our rankings of the teams closest to winning their first NBA championship.\n\n— Jeff Zillgitt\n\nDenver Nuggets make their first Finals appearance\n\nThe Nuggets are one of six teams who have never won an NBA title. This is their first championship series appearance since losing to Julius Erving and the New York Nets in 1976, after which the wonderful and wacky ABA was disbanded.\n\n— Arnie Stapleton, Associated Press\n\nNikola Jokic playoff stats\n\nTwo-time MVP Nikola Jokic averaged a triple-double against both the Suns and the Lakers, and enters these finals averaging 29.9 points, 13.3 rebounds and 10.3 assists per game. One of his signature moves of late has been pointing to his ring finger while looking at his family; he’s now four wins away from the piece of jewelry he wants most.\n\n— Tim Reynolds, Associated Press\n\nDid Nikola Jokic go to college?\n\nNo. Before the 6-foot-11 two-time MVP was drafted in 2014, he played three seasons for Mega Basket in the Adriatic League in Serbia.\n\nHas Jimmy Butler won a championship?\n\nThe six-time All-Star has not won an NBA championship, but he’s led his team to the Finals once previously, in the 2020 bubble season, where the Heat lost to the Lakers.\n\nJimmy Butler playoff stats 2023\n\nIn 17 games this postseason, Butler averaged 28.5 points on 48.3% shooting, including 35.6% from 3. He’s also grabbing 7 rebounds, dishing out 5.7 assists and snagging 2.1 steals per game.\n\nOver 64 regular-season games, Butler averaged 22.9 points on 53.9% shooting (35% from 3), 5.9 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game.\n\nNuggets DJ Austin 'Paws the Music' Pawelka carries father's legacy\n\nAustin Pawelka turned heads when, at nine years old, he announced LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony at the 2004 NBA Rising Stars game during All-Star weekend. He wasn't new to announcing as he had been introducing Denver Nuggets players for a year at the then-Pepsi Center.\n\nNow, he's the official DJ of the Nuggets and will orchestrate Ball Arena in his first NBA Finals. \"It doesn’t really feel like it’s real,\" Pawelka, who goes by the DJ name \"Paws the Music\" told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nHe found a calling toward music at a young age as his father, Shawn \"Tribal Touch\" Martinez, has been a DJ for 33 years. Martinez is now the Senior Director of Live Presentation for the Phoenix Suns and Phoenix Mercury.\n\n— Victoria Hernandez\n\nFULL STORY: Nuggets DJ Austin Pawelka speaks on NBA Finals\n\nLarry O'Brien Trophy skydives into Game 1\n\n\"It’s a bird. It’s a plane. It’s The Larry O’Brien Trophy skydiving.\"\n\nYes, you read that correctly. The Larry O'Brien Trophy took a page out of Tom Cruise's book and skydived its way into downtown Denver for Game 1 of the NBA Finals. ESPN host Malika Andrews greeted the trophy after its flight and safely transported it to Ball Arena, complete with a police escort.\n\n\"Welcome to Denver, Larry,\" Andrews said.\n\n— Cydney Henderson\n\nWho is favored to win the NBA Finals?\n\nFanduel Sportsbook favors the Nuggets to win their first NBA championship over the Heat.\n\n— Arnie Stapleton, Associated Press\n\nIs Tyler Herro playing tonight?\n\nTyler Herro has been ruled out for Game 1 of the NBA Finals.\n\nOn Wednesday, Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra confirmed that the 2022 Sixth Man of the Year will not be ready to suit up when the Heat head to Denver to take on the Nuggets in the first game of the championship series.\n\n\"He will not play tomorrow,\" Spoelstra said during the NBA Finals Media Day. \"We don't want to get ahead of ourselves right now. He's still just starting this (ramp-up) process. We do have a few days here just to continuous work. I can't even make any kind of proclamation until he takes these next important steps, and that's with contact and doing things more on the court live.\"\n\n— Cydney Henderson\n\nJamal Murray stats\n\nOver 15 games this postseason, the Nuggets guard averaged 27.7 points on 48% shooting (39.8% from 3), 5.5 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game. In 65 regular-season games this season, the 26-year-old averaged 20 points on 45.4% shooting (39.8% from 3), 4 rebounds and 6.2 assists per game.\n\nJimmy Butler, Heat believe they can win NBA Finals. At this point, who can doubt them?\n\nOne year ago, Jimmy Butler spoke after losing to the Boston Celtics in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nSolemn and measured, he told reporters, “We had enough. Next year, we will have enough and we're going to be right back in the same situation, and we're going to get it done.”\n\nWith most players, it’s bloviating. Not with Butler. With him, it’s prophetic. You can’t dismiss what he says.\n\nOne year to the date, Miami was in the same situation − Game 7 against the Celtics in the conference finals − and Butler and the Heat got it done, defeating Boston 103-84 on Monday in almost an unimaginable way.\n\n\"You have to have a guy that you can hold on to, particularly in those moments of truth,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said of Butler. \"I've said this before, there's no way to quantify the confidence that he can instill in everybody.\"\n\n— Jeff Zillgitt\n\nHow Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray went from bench to leading Nuggets' NBA Finals charge\n\nNikola Jokic and Jamal Murray were reserves for the Denver Nuggets early in the 2016-17 season. It was Murray’s rookie season and Jokic’s second season.\n\nThose with a discerning eye saw the start of what is now apparent to everyone. Jokic and Murray had the skills to become one of the best 1-2 combos in the NBA.\n\n\"They're both dynamic,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said ahead of the NBA Finals, which start Thursday (8:30 p.m. ET, ABC). \"They both can do it on their own, but they also both really complement each other. That's hard to find in this league, when your two best players just absolutely complement each other. They both have scored 50 in a playoff game, and they both can be facilitators.\n\n\"I don't think either one of them care how many points they score. It's just about getting the most efficient shot for the offense.\"\n\nRead Jeff Zillgitt’s full feature on the duo here.\n\nHow Heat were built: Stars like Jimmy Butler, finding hidden gems have Miami in NBA Finals\n\nThe Miami Heat like their stars, no question about that.\n\nAlonzo Mourning, Shaquille O’Neal, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Chris Bosh and Jimmy Butler.\n\nBut the Heat's front office led by Pat Riley, Andy Elisburg and Adam Simon also like their hidden gems and finding players who fit their system − players that other teams may have overlooked, players like Duncan Robinson, Max Strus, Caleb Martin, Gabe Vincent. They were all undrafted, and it’s not unusual to get those kind of players into their system and develop them.\n\n“Quite frankly, we've needed more guys like Gabe and Caleb to show how much they have improved with their player development,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.\n\nLet’s take a look at how the Heat were built.\n\n— Jeff Zillgitt\n\nHave the Nuggets ever made the NBA Finals?\n\nThe Nuggets are at the door, making their first Finals appearance in franchise history. Injuries slowed the Nuggets for a couple of seasons, but they’ve been headed in this direction since they reached the conference finals and lost to the Lakers in the 2020 Orlando bubble.\n\nBest finish: Lost in the conference finals five times, most recently to the Lakers in 2020.\n\n— Jeff Zillgitt\n\nNo. 8 seeds to make the NBA Finals\n\nThe Miami Heat are the second No. 8 seed to make it to the NBA Finals. The other? The New York Knicks in the 1998-99 season. They lost to the San Antonio Spurs in five games.\n\nNBA Finals referees: Eric Lewis not included\n\nMarc Davis, David Guthrie and Ed Malloy will officiate Game 1 of the 2023 NBA Finals.\n\nHere are all the officials who are assigned to work the Finals: Tony Brothers (12th Finals), Courtney Kirkland (third), Marc Davis (12th), Ed Malloy (eighth), Scott Foster (16th), Kevin Scott (first), John Goble (seventh), Josh Tiven (fourth), David Guthrie (sixth), James Williams (third), Bill Kennedy (fifth) and Zach Zarba (10th).\n\nNotably missing from the group is 19-year veteran referee Eric Lewis, who is currently under investigation for the potential use of a burner Twitter account to defend himself and other officials. Based on previous experience and playoff grades, Lewis would have otherwise made the cut, a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nMiami Heat, Denver Nuggets do have a history\n\nJimmy Butler says there isn't any bad blood between the Heat and Nuggets. \"I don’t think that’s a rivalry. It sounds good. But I don’t even want to get into it. (Jokic) is a hell of a player,\" Butler told Complex in February 2022.\n\nBut the Nuggets and Heat were involved in an altercation on Nov. 8, 2021, that resulted in a suspension for Jokic and a fine for Butler. Jokic shoved Markieff Morris (who's now on the Dallas Mavericks) from behind following a hard foul from Morris. Heat players were upset at what they perceived to be a cheap shot from Jokic and Butler could be seen telling Jokic to \"bring your (expletive) to the back.\" A viral photo showed Butler, Kyle Lowry and Bam Adebayo lined up outside the Nuggets locker room postgame.\n\nJokic was ejected from the game and received a one-game suspension. Morris received a flagrant foul, $50,000 fine for his role and subsequently missed 58 games with whiplash. Butler received a technical foul and $30,000 fine \"for attempting to escalate the altercation and failing to comply with an NBA Security interview as part of the review process pertaining to an on-court matter,\" the league said. But it appears to be water under the bridge.\n\n“I don't think it has too much to do with anything, this thing in the past,\" Butler said Wednesday. “It's high-level competition. But I will say I wasn't talking to Jokic. That wasn't my beef. Make sure you write that.”\n\nSaid Denver coach Michael Malone: “It hasn't come up in any of my thoughts, discussions, narratives. That's a question probably more suited for the Miami Heat. For us, all we're worried about is winning Game 1. That's our sole focus. None of the storylines that accompany this series are going to distract us from that focus.”\n\n— Cydney Henderson and Jeff Zillgitt\n\nNBA Finals uniform schedule for Heat and Nuggets\n\nHere is which uniform each team will wear for each game, via the NBA’s LockerVision:\n\nGame 1\n\nHeat: All red Statement Edition with Miami on the front of the jersey.\n\nNuggets: All Royal blue Statement Edition with Mile High City on the front of the jersey.\n\nGame 2\n\nHeat: All white Association Edition with Heat on the front of the jersey.\n\nNuggets: All navy blue Icon Edition with Denver on the front of the jersey.\n\nGame 3\n\nHeat: All white Association Edition with Heat on the front of the jersey.\n\nNuggets: All Royal blue Statement Edition with Mile High City on the front of the jersey.\n\nGame 4\n\nHeat: All white Association Edition with Heat on the front of the jersey.\n\nNuggets: All navy blue Icon Edition with Denver on the front of the jersey.\n\nDenver Nuggets vs. Miami Heat regular season\n\nThe Nuggets won both matchups against the Heat during the regular season, once at home in Denver's Ball Arena and on the road in Miami's Kaseya Center.\n\nOn Dec. 30, Denver defeated Miami 124-119.

Butler recorded his own double-double (24 points, 10 rebounds) and neared a triple-double with nine assists.\n\nMiami hasn’t won a game in Denver since 2016 -- which is also the last season Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray were Nuggets reserves.

The Nuggets have given their fans comparatively little to cheer in their 47 seasons in the NBA, and they've rarely seized the basketball world's attention despite a solid list of famous alumni.\n\nBut with their confidence soaring in the midst of a dominant playoff run, these Nuggets were determined to secure their latest bit of history Monday night. They kept that attitude even after LeBron James dropped a 31-point first half that could have made a lesser team with a 3-0 series lead start thinking about Game 5 back home.\n\n“Yeah, that’s never been our mentality,” Aaron Gordon said. “That hasn’t been our mentality all year, like, to concede. We’re not that type of team.”\n\nAfter Nikola Jokic conjured his latest triple-double playoff masterpiece and Gordon blocked James' shot at the buzzer, the Nuggets had torn up their franchise's history and written a bold new chapter with a clinching 113-111 victory.\n\nThey're the first Denver team to earn the right to play for an NBA title, and this often-overlooked franchise will be favored to win when the Nuggets get back on the court in nine days. No wonder the conference championship celebration had a little extra energy, with the Nuggets mobbing Jokic after he received his conference finals MVP trophy.\n\nHigh-scoring Jamal Murray took a moment to savor the slow growth of a team that has finally blossomed into something beautiful and sturdy.\n\n“We just want to make the most of the opportunity,” Murray said. \"First Nuggets team to do this and that. We want to go all the way and stay locked in. I think our chemistry is at an all-time high, the way we play, the way we read the game without even speaking. We talk that language on the court. It’s just beautiful basketball, honestly. It’s so fun to play with this team and with (Jokic) and with the coaching staff that has groomed us into the team that we are.”\n\nThis group led by Jokic and Murray has surpassed all the greats who have worn the many, many uniforms of the team that started life as the ABA’s Denver Rockets in 1967. The Nuggets had plenty of winning seasons and kept their fans entertained while frequently playing a high-octane, high-altitude style of ball in the NBA, but they never got closer to a title than the conference finals.\n\nThe team that showcased David “Skywalker” Thompson, Alex English, Dan Issel, Dikembe Mutombo, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and Carmelo Anthony to the world finally has the chance to hang its first championship banner, thanks to a Serbian second-round pick, a Canadian sharpshooter and its talented, selfless supporting cast.\n\n“It’s just a great mixture,” Gordon said. “It’s a great group of guys. The camaraderie is there, the chemistry is there, the talent is there, the IQ is there and the unselfishness is there. It’s really a brotherhood. We really do it for the person next to us. It’s rare in this league to find a team that has a bunch of unselfish guys that buy in and really do it for the man next to them.”\n\nThe Nuggets are one of 11 active NBA franchises without a title, and three additional teams haven’t won it in their current city. Denver lost the 1976 ABA Finals to the New York Nets in its only other championship series, but this June certainly looks like the Mile High City's turn to celebrate.\n\nCoach Michael Malone shared warm hugs after the game with Nuggets owners Stan and Josh Kroenke, who are about to have the third team in their Kroenke Sports & Entertainment portfolio playing for a championship in the past 16 months: The Los Angeles Rams won the Super Bowl in February 2022, and the Colorado Avalanche claimed the Stanley Cup four months later. Arsenal is also finishing second in the Premier League in what could be its best season in nearly two decades.\n\n“We all know in this business, patience is not a word that comes easily,” Malone said. “For them to have patience after that third-year, 46-win effort that came up just short of the playoffs (in 2017-18), they saw something in Nikola, in Jamal, in myself, and allowed it to come to fruition. That’s a rarity in this business.”\n\nJokic averaged a triple-double in the Western Conference finals, putting up 27.8 points, 14.5 rebounds and 11.8 assists in the four-game series, and he did it against Anthony Davis, one of the world’s best defensive players when healthy.

The Nuggets sharing hugs while passing around the NBA championship trophy.\n\nThose scenes that, for almost a half-century, seemed impossible, then more recently started feeling inevitable, finally turned into reality Monday night.\n\nThe Nuggets outlasted the Miami Heat 94-89 in an ugly, frantic Game 5 that did nothing to derail Nikola Jokic, who bailed out his teammates with 28 points and 16 rebounds on a night when nothing else seemed to work.\n\nJokic became the first player in history to lead the league in points (600), rebounds (269) and assists (190) in a single postseason. Not surprisingly, he won the Bill Russell trophy as the NBA Finals MVP — an award that certainly has more meaning to him than the two overall MVPs he won in 2021 and ’22 and the one that escaped him this year.\n\n“We are not in it for ourselves, we are in it for the guy next to us,” Jokic said. “And that’s why this (means) even more.”\n\nDenver's clincher was a gruesome grind.\n\nUnable to shake the tenacious Heat or their own closing-night jitters, the Nuggets missed 20 of their first 22 3-pointers. They missed seven of their first 13 free throws. They overcame that to take a late seven-point lead, only to see Miami’s Jimmy Butler go off. He scored eight straight points to give the Heat a one-point lead with 2:45 left.\n\nButler made two free throws with 1:58 remaining to help Miami regain a one-point lead. Then, Bruce Brown got an offensive rebound and tip-in to give the Nuggets an edge they wouldn't give up.\n\nTrailing by three with 15 seconds left, Butler jacked up a 3, but missed it. Brown and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope made two free throws each down the stretch to clinch the title for Denver.\n\nButler finished with 21 points.\n\n“Those last three or four minutes felt like a scene out of a movie,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “Two teams in the center of the ring throwing haymaker after haymaker, and it’s not necessarily shot making. It’s the efforts.”\n\nGrueling as it was, the aftermath was something the Nuggets and their fans could all agree was beautiful. There were fireworks exploding outside Ball Arena at the final buzzer. Denver is the home of the Larry O’Brien Trophy for the first time in the franchise’s 47 years in the league.\n\n“The fans in this town are unbelievable,” said team owner Stan Kroenke, who also owns the Colorado Avalanche, the team that won its third Stanley Cup last year. “It means a lot to us to get this done.”\n\nThe Heat were, as Spoelstra promised, a gritty, tenacious bunch. But their shooting wasn’t great, either. Miami shot 34% from the floor and 25% from 3. Until Butler went off, he was 2 for 13 for eight points. Bam Adebayo finished with 20 points.\n\nThe Heat, who survived a loss in the play-in tournament and became only the second No. 8 seed to make the finals, insisted they weren’t into consolation prizes.\n\nThey played like they expected to win, and for a while during this game, which was settled as much by players diving onto the floor as sweet-looking jump shots, it looked like they would.\n\nThe Nuggets, who came in shooting 37.6% from 3 for the series, shot 18% in this one. They committed 14 turnovers.\n\nThe tone was set with 2:51 left in the first quarter, when Jokic got his second foul and joined Aaron Gordon on the bench. Jeff Green and Jamal Murray, who finished with 14 points and eight assists on an off night, joined them there, too.\n\nIt made the Nuggets tentative on both sides of the court for the rest of the half. Somehow, after shooting 6.7% from 3 — the worst first half in the history of the finals (10-shot minimum) they only trailed by seven.\n\nTrue to the Nuggets' personality, they kept pressing, came at their opponent in waves and figured out how to win a game that went against their type. Their beautiful game turned into a slugfest, but they figured it out nonetheless.\n\n“What I was most proud about is, throughout the game, if your offense is not working and your shots are not falling, you have to dig in on the defensive end,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said.\n\nIt felt almost perfect that an unheralded and once-chubby second-round draft pick from Serbia would be the one to lift Denver to the top of a league that, for decades, has been dominated by superstars, first-round draft picks and players who lead the world in sneaker and jersey sales.\n\nOver their near five-decade stay in the league, the Nuggets have been the epitome of a lovable NBA backbencher – at times entertaining, adorned by rainbows on their uniforms and headlined by colorful characters on the floor and bench. But never quite good enough to break through against the biggest stars and better teams to the east, west and south of them.\n\nBefore this season, there were only two teams founded before 1980 – the Nuggets and Clippers – that had never been to an NBA Finals. The Nuggets took their name off that list, then joined San Antonio as the second original ABA team to capture the NBA’s biggest prize. The other two ABAers, the Pacers and Nets, have been to the finals but lost.\n\nIt was the Joker’s blossoming into a do-everything force that made the Nuggets a team to watch. Not everybody did. A shift to winning couldn’t change Denver’s location on the map – in a weird time zone in flyover territory – and it didn’t shift everyone’s view of the Nuggets.\n\nEven in Denver.\n\nThere’s little doubt that this has always been a Broncos-first sort of town. No single Denver victory will outshine the day in 1998 when John Elway broke through and that team’s owner, Pat Bowlen, held the Lombardi Trophy high and declared: “This one’s for John!”\n\nBut this one? It won't take a back seat to much. It’s for every Dan (Issel), David (Thompson), Doug (Moe) or Dikembe (Mutombo) who ever came up short or got passed over for a newer, shinier model with more glitter and more stars.\n\nFor the first time in 47 seasons, nobody in the NBA shines brighter than the Nuggets.\n\n“You live vicariously through these guys,” said Denver great LaPhonso Ellis, as he pointed to the big scoreboard announcing the Nuggets as champions. “And to see that there, ‘2023 NBA Champions’ here in Denver, that's so cool, and I'm honored to be a part of it.\"\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/16/sport/nba-finals-2022-warriors-celtics-game-6/index.html", "title": "NBA Finals: Led by MVP Steph Curry, Golden State Warriors win ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nLed by 34 points from Stephen Curry, the Golden State Warriors defeated the Boston Celtics 103-90 on Thursday night to claim their fourth NBA championship in the last eight seasons.\n\nThe victory gives the trio of Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green their fourth title together – all under head coach Steve Kerr – adding to their championships from 2015, 2017 and 2018. They’ve won 21 NBA Finals games together, having recently passed Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili (19) for the most NBA Finals wins by a trio over the last 30 years.\n\nCurry, who was in tears on the court after the final whistle, won NBA Finals MVP honors for the first time in his career.\n\n“This is what it’s all about, playing for a championship and what we’ve been through the last three years,” he said. “Beginning of the season, nobody thought we’d be here except everybody on this court right now, and it’s amazing. Very surreal, though.\n\n“You never take this for granted because you never know when you’re going to be back here. And to get back here and get it done, it means the world,” he said.\n\nKerr said Curry reminded him of Duncan, the Hall of Fame center who played his entire career for the San Antonio Spurs. “Totally different players. But from a humanity standpoint, talent standpoint, humility, confidence, this wonderful combination that just makes everybody want to win for him,” he said.\n\nThis title ends a blip for the Warriors, as they were marred by injuries for a couple of years and were back in the postseason for the first time since 2019.\n\nMVP Stephen Curry drives past Jayson Tatum of the Celtics in the deciding Game 6 in Boston. Elsa/Getty Images\n\nThe way Game 6 unfolded at TD Garden in Boston didn’t initially look like it would be a surefire win for Golden State. Boston was up 14-2 to start the game. But the Warriors didn’t just claw back – they hit the gas pedal.\n\nGolden State went on a 52-25 run to end the first half. That included a 21-0 run – the longest scoring run in an NBA Finals game in the last 50 years.\n\nThe Celtics cut the Warriors’ lead to single digits late in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter but could get no closer.\n\nBoston, which made the Finals for the first time since the 2009-10 season, had previously excelled in do-or-die games in this year’s playoff run.\n\nUntil their Game 5 loss in these Finals, they were unbeaten in postseason games following a defeat. They have been victorious in two win-or-go-home games against the Milwaukee Bucks and a Game 7 against the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nYet the Celtics were up 2-1 in the series before losing three straight to Golden State, including Games 4 and 6 in Boston.\n\n“There are a lot of guys in there, very emotional right now,” Celtics head coach Ime Udoka said after the game.\n\n“The message was we thanked them for the effort and the growth and everything they allowed us to do coaching-wise this year. The biggest message was ‘Learn from this, grow from it, take this experience and see there is another level to get to,’” Udoka said. “A team like Golden State who has been there, done that, it was evident in a lot of ways.”\n\nThis is the Warriors’ seventh league title in franchise history – two of which were won as the Philadelphia Warriors in 1947 and 1956.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver, who normally presents the Larry O’Brien Trophy to the NBA champion, did not attend Games 5 or 6 due to the NBA’s health and safety protocols.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story said the game was broadcast on ESPN.

Only six of the last 39 champions in this format got through the playoffs by facing just one top-three seed along the way.\n\nMiami — which ousted East No. 1 seed Milwaukee in Round 1 this year — was bidding to be the fifth team in this format that defeated both No. 1 seeds on their way to a championship. The teams that got that done: Toronto in 2019, the Lakers in both 2001 and 2002, and Houston in 1995.\n\nThat Rockets team had — by far — the toughest road, in terms of seeds faced, on the way to a title in this format. Houston was the No. 6 seed out of the West that season and had to beat No. 3 Utah in Round 1, No. 2 Phoenix in Round 2, No. 1 San Antonio for the West title and East No. 1 Orlando in the finals.\n\nThat was the Houston team that prompted Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich, now a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, to famously proclaim “Don’t ever underestimate the heart of a champion” when those NBA Finals concluded.\n\nLEBRON TAKES OVER\n\nBarring some unforeseen comebacks, the Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James will start next season as the oldest player in the NBA.\n\nUdonis Haslem was the oldest in the league this season; his 20-year career, all with Miami, is now complete. Haslem turned 43 last week.\n\nGolden State’s Andre Iguodala has also said he is retiring; Iguodala is 39.\n\nThat leaves James as the new holder of the oldest-player crown. The NBA's all-time scoring leader — he passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for that distinction this season — turns 39 in December.\n\nHaslem was the fifth-oldest player to ever appear in an NBA game —- and the oldest to play in a playoff game, when he got into a Heat game last week at the age of 42 years, 363 days.\n\nVince Carter played until he was 43, as did Robert Parish. Kevin Willis appeared in five games late in the 2006-07 season as a 44-year-old.\n\nThe oldest player in NBA history is little-known Nat Hickey, who was two days shy of his 46th birthday when he played his last game on Jan. 28, 1948. Hickey appeared in only two games in his brief career as a player-coach with the Providence Steamrollers; his first was the day before his finale. He scored two points in his playing career.\n\nJOKIC THE SIXTH\n\nDenver's Nikola Jokic — the pride of Serbia — won the NBA Finals MVP award, and it's the sixth time that an international player claimed that honor.\n\nHouston's Hakeem Olajuwon (Nigeria) won finals MVP in 1994 and 1995. San Antonio's Tony Parker (France) won it in 2007, Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki (Germany) won it in 2011 and Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo (Greece) won it in 2021.\n\nLOOKING AHEAD\n\nIt's not exactly a rule, but it's generally assumed that the NBA finalists will find their way into the Christmas Day lineup the next season.\n\nShould Denver be picked to play on Dec. 25 next season, it would be the fourth time in the last five years that the Nuggets are part of the league's holiday quintupleheader. If Miami gets picked, it would be the second Heat appearance on Christmas since 2015; the last Heat game on Dec. 25 was against New Orleans in 2020, that game getting played in an empty arena in Miami because of the pandemic.\n\nHeat coach Erik Spoelstra is 8-0 in Christmas games.\n\n20TH CHAMPION\n\nDenver becomes the 20th current franchise now with an NBA championship.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and Boston are tied with 17 apiece. Golden State, Chicago, San Antonio, Philadelphia, Detroit, Miami, New York, Houston, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Atlanta, Washington, Oklahoma City, Portland, Toronto, Sacramento and Dallas also have championships in their franchise histories -- although not all of those titles were won while playing in their current city.\n\nDenver’s win leaves Phoenix, Utah, Brooklyn, Orlando, Indiana, Charlotte, Memphis, Minnesota, New Orleans and the Los Angeles Clippers as the 10 current franchises still waiting for a first NBA championship.\n\nMONEY WINNERS\n\nDenver, as would be expected, claimed the biggest share of the NBA playoff pool this season. The Nuggets got $7,129,558, or about 26% of the money that the league distributes to playoff teams.\n\nMiami will collect $4,837,547. Boston will get the third-biggest share, earning $2,217,347.\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2023/05/30/with-matchup-finally-set-nuggets-malone-says-beating-heat-will-be-biggest-challenge-of-our-lives/70271206007/", "title": "With matchup finally set, Nuggets' Malone says beating Heat will be ...", "text": "ARNIE STAPLETON\n\nAP\n\nAaron Gordon bristled at the notion the Denver Nuggets must operate the “rust versus rest” seesaw with 10 days between their Western Conference title celebration in Los Angeles and the start of the NBA Finals against the Miami Heat.\n\nRest?\n\n“We've been working,” Gordon declared about 15 hours after the Nuggets finally learned who they'll have to beat to secure the franchise's first Larry O'Brien gold ball trophy. “It's not like we've had our hands back and feet kicked up.\"\n\nRust?\n\n“We've been locked in, in the gym, working diligently,” Gordon insisted. “So, we feel like we're in a good space. It's been a good balance of work to rest. Happy we have home court advantage.”\n\nMiami's 103-84 shellacking of the Celtics in Boston in Game 7 on Monday night sent the Heat to Denver for Game 1 on Thursday night. Had the Celtics been the first of 151 teams to ever overcome a 3-0 deficit in a best-of-seven basketball series, the Nuggets would have headed East for Games 1 and 2.\n\nInstead, the Nuggets get to stay in the Mile High City, where they've been since returning from their 113-111 win over the Lakers on May 22, and host a Heat team that's been playing every other night and won't have much time to acclimate to the city's mile-high altitude.\n\nSo, yes, Gordon acknowledged, he was actually rooting for Jimmy Butler to come to Denver this week, and not because he wanted to avoid Jayson Tatum, either.\n\n“You always want to keep home court,” Gordon said. “So, first and foremost what we worked for all season was to get home court advantage.”\n\nTop-seeded in the West for the first time in franchise history, the Nuggets have won all eight of their playoff games at Ball Arena, pushing their league-best home record to 42-7, while going 12-3 overall in these playoffs, including series clinching wins on the road against the Suns and Lakers.\n\nThe Heat haven't won in Denver since Nov. 30, 2016, but it's the Nuggets who are novices on this stage.\n\nMiami has been to the Finals many times before, winning it all in 2006, 2012 and 2013.\n\n“We’ve got the utmost respect for them. They fight and they scrap, they have no quit in them,” Gordon said\n\nThe Nuggets are one of six teams who have never won an NBA title. This is their first championship series appearance since losing to Julius Erving and the New York Nets in 1976, after which the wonderful and wacky ABA was disbanded.\n\nFanduel Sportsbook favors the Nuggets to win their first NBA championship over the Heat, who are the second No. 8 seed to make it this far. But coach Michael Malone repeated his admonition to his players not to pay attention to all the accolades or outside noise.\n\n“Well, as I told our team, forget the eight seed stuff,” Malone said. “They beat Milwaukee 4-1. That team had the most wins in the NBA this year. They beat Boston 4-3 and they were up 3-0, the team with I think the second most wins in the NBA this year.”\n\n“So, you get to the NBA Finals, it’s not about seeding anymore,” added Malone, \"and for those who are thinking that this is going to be an easy series, I don’t even know what to say to you people.\n\n“This is going to be the biggest challenge of our live. This is the NBA Finals. We're trying to win the first NBA championship in franchise history, and it’s going to be the hardest thing that we’ve ever done, which is the way it should be.”\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2023/05/29/the-nba-finals-are-set-it-s-the-heat-and-the-nuggets-for-the-larry-o-brien-trophy/70267576007/", "title": "The NBA Finals are set: It's the Heat and the Nuggets for the Larry O ...", "text": "TIM REYNOLDS\n\nAP\n\nCancel that flight plan, Denver. Turns out, the NBA Finals are starting in the Mile High City after all.\n\nAnd Jimmy Butler was proven right.\n\nFinally, we have a title-series matchup: The Miami Heat, champions of the Eastern Conference even after getting in as only the No. 8 seed, will take on the Western Conference champion Nuggets in Game 1 of the NBA Finals. The series starts in Denver on Thursday night.\n\nThe Heat got there by winning Game 7 of the East title series in Boston on Monday night. It came one year to the day after the Celtics won a Game 7 on Miami's floor to win the East title a year ago.\n\n\"Next year, we will have enough and we’re going to be right back in the same situation, and we’re going to get it done,\" Butler vowed that night.\n\nThe Heat made those words prophetic.\n\nThe Nuggets had a flight to Boston tentatively scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, just in case they would be facing the Celtics — who would have had home-court advantage in the title series.\n\nBut the Heat had other ideas, won the deciding game to avoid becoming the first team in NBA history to fall after claiming a 3-0 series lead, and Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets now await. The Heat are in the finals for the seventh time and seeking their fourth championship; the Nuggets are in the finals for the first time in franchise history.\n\n“When we wake up tomorrow morning, we know who we’re playing,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said Monday, a few hours before the Celtics and Heat tipped off in Game 7. “We know who we’re preparing for and we can kind of turn the page and really focus in on that. The Eastern Conference finals has been a hell of a series.”\n\nMalone will try to win an NBA title for the first time, and if Denver prevails he’ll become the 36th coach in league history to win a championship. Miami’s Erik Spoelstra is seeking his third title as a head coach; if he wins it, he’d join only Phil Jackson, Red Auerbach, Heat President Pat Riley, John Kundla, Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr as three-time champion coaches.\n\nDenver hasn’t faced any real trouble yet in these playoffs. The Nuggets are 12-3 in the playoffs, winners of their last six games — and grabbed control of their matchups against Minnesota in Round 1, Phoenix in Round 2 and the Lakers in the West finals right away.\n\nTwo-time MVP Jokic averaged a triple-double against both the Suns and the Lakers, and enters these finals averaging 29.9 points, 13.3 rebounds and 10.3 assists per game. One of his signature moves of late has been pointing to his ring finger while looking at his family; he’s now four wins away from the piece of jewelry he wants most.\n\n“Nikola is still a humble, selfless person and he cares about home, he cares about family, he cares about his horses -- the guy is just who he is,” Malone said. “I couldn’t have more respect for him as a man because of that.”\n\nA week ago, Miami was in position to do what Denver did — get to the finals with a sweep. It’s almost like the Heat forgot they were a 44-38 team that needed two play-in games just to get into the playoffs; they ousted No. 1 overall seed Milwaukee in Round 1, got past New York in Round 2 and then avenged last season’s loss to Boston in the East finals by somehow going onto the Celtics’ home floor and winning a Game 7 to avoid the permanent stench of being the first team in NBA history to waste a 3-0 series lead.\n\n“Sometimes you have to suffer for the things that you really want,” Spoelstra said. “And this group has shown fortitude. ... We still have more to do.”\n\nIt was a hellish week, for certain. But the Heat got there, just the second No. 8 seed to ever make the finals.\n\n“Everybody rallied around each other,” Heat center Bam Adebayo said.\n\nMiami has three players with championships – Udonis Haslem has been part of all three Heat titles, Kevin Love won a championship with Cleveland and Kyle Lowry got a ring with Toronto. The Nuggets have one champion on their roster; Denver’s Kentavious Caldwell-Pope got one with the Lakers at the NBA’s restart bubble in 2020 against the Heat.\n\nAlso back from that Heat finals team: Butler, Adebayo, Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro and Gabe Vincent. The only Denver player besides Caldwell-Pope with finals experience is Jeff Green, who played in the title series alongside Love with Cleveland in 2018.\n\nSo, most players will be seeking their first ring. Haslem is trying to end his career with a fourth, and Lowry is among the lucky few who are trying to smudge the Larry O’Brien Trophy for the second time.\n\nHe remembers how long it took him in 2019, after the Raptors won their title, to start thinking about winning his next one.\n\n“Maybe like the day after,” Lowry said. “And every champion, every NBA champion, would tell you this: There’s a high that you never have felt and you want that high again. And there’s nothing like that.”\n\nDenver swept both games against Miami in the regular season. And both sides will inevitably say that those games won’t matter much starting Thursday.\n\n“The Heat are playing an unbelievable high level,” Malone said. “Jimmy Butler, what he’s been doing since Round 1 against Milwaukee, continued that Round 2 against New York and now what he’s doing against Boston is just historical in nature. And Erik Spoelstra … obviously Spo is one of the best coaches in the league, someone who I have a tremendous amount of respect for as a coach but also just as a friend.”\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/29"}]}

He was 89.\n\nHis death by natural causes was confirmed by his son, John McCarthy, according to a statement from his publisher.\n\nMcCarthy was both revered and criticized for his brutally violent, morally ambiguous, often bleak novels in which men were pitted against primal forces, books that read like a sock to the jaw numbed by a slug of whiskey.\n\nMcCarthy was born Charles McCarthy Jr. on July 20, 1933, in Providence, Rhode Island, one of six children in an Irish Catholic family. When McCarthy was a child, his family relocated to Knoxville, Tennessee, where his father worked as a lawyer. \"We were considered rich because all the people around us were living in one- or two-room shacks,\" McCarthy told The New York times in a rare interview.\n\nCormac McCarthy's 'The Passenger':A genius stares down the barrel of mortality\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2023\n\nIt was the South where McCarthy drew much of his literary inspiration for his Southern gothic and neo-Western stories, following in the narrative literary tradition of William Faulkner. McCarthy is noted for his style, which employs deceivingly simple, declarative sentences, sparse punctuation, and dialogue free of quotation marks and often missing attribution.\n\nIn the early '50s, McCarthy attended the University of Tennessee, but dropped out to join the Air Force. Following his service, he returned to the university and published two short stories in student literary magazine \"The Phoenix\" before dropping out for good.\n\nHe published his first novel, \"The Orchard Keeper,\" in 1965, which won the William Faulkner Foundation Award for notable first novel. That and his next three books were set in Appalachian Tennessee and heavily stamped by his Southern upbringing.\n\nHis fifth book broke the mold. Perhaps no book better exemplifies McCarthy’s style and craft than \"Blood Meridian,\" a bloody anti-Western that follows a band of scalp hunters across 1800s Texas. \"'Blood Meridian' comes at the reader like a slap in the face, an affront that asks us to endure a vision of the Old West full of charred human skulls, blood-soaked scalps, a tree hung with the bodies of dead infants,\" reads a 1985 New York Times book review by Caryn James. \"But while Cormac McCarthy's fifth novel is hard to get through, it is harder to ignore.\"\n\nMcCarthy first achieved popular acclaim in 1992 with \"All the Pretty Horses,\" a best-seller and winner of the National Book Award. In 2000, it was adapted into a film starring Matt Damon and Penélope Cruz, directed by Billy Bob Thornton.\n\nDirectors Joel and Ethan Coen brought McCarthy even more popular acclaim with their 2007 film adaptation of his novel “No Country for Old Men,” starring Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin. The film won four Academy Awards, including best picture, and even drew the reclusive McCarthy to the Oscars ceremony. In 2013, McCarthy’s first original feature-length screenplay became the film “The Counselor,” directed by Ridley Scott and starring Michael Fassbender, Penélope Cruz and Cameron Diaz.\n\nMcCarthy is most widely known for his post-apocalyptic novel \"The Road.\" Published in 2006, \"The Road\" is a bleak and haunting fable about a father and young son journeying through a ravaged landscape eradicated of civilization and most life on Earth. In March 2007, Oprah Winfrey selected the title for her book club; his subsequent televised interview on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" was the famously press-shy author’s first. Later that year, McCarthy was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in fiction.

McCarthy said the inspiration came from a trip he took to El Paso, Texas with his young son. While his son slept, McCarthy stood at the window and looked over the town in the dead of night. \"There was nothing moving, but I could hear the trains going through, and that very lonesome sound,\" McCarthy said. \"I just had this image of what this town might look like in 50 or 100 years. I just had this image of these fires up on the hill and everything being laid waste, and I thought a lot about my little boy.\"\n\nIt would be 16 years until McCarthy published again. He was 89 years old when he surprised readers with the one-two punch of linked novels \"The Passenger\" and \"Stella Maris\" in late 2022, a diptych of existential suffering. McCarthy focused his apocalyptic bent inward, on the human soul, peering deep into the broken hearts of a brother and sister cursed by their shared parentage, brilliance and forbidden love for one another.\n\nA ★★★½ (out of four) review for USA TODAY reads, \"It's impossible to read 'The Passenger' and 'Stella Maris' apart from the looming mortality of their author; this is the work of a man peering into the void of his own soon-to-be nonexistence.\"\n\nMcCarthy was married and divorced three times and fathered two sons, Cullen McCarthy and John Francis McCarthy – “The Road” is dedicated to the latter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/01/04/former-new-jersey-governor-brendan-byrne-dies/1006122001/", "title": "Brendan Byrne, former New Jersey governor, dies at age 93", "text": "Joshua Jongsma\n\nThe (Bergen County, N.J.)

It's a wonderful game that we never seem to be on top of, yet at the same time we always come back for more, get beat up and come back for more.\"\n\nIrwin, though, has done his share of beating up the competition for some time. After winning 20 times during his heyday on the PGA Tour, including three U.S. Opens, Irwin continued to clean up on the Champions Tour.\n\nHe has won a record 45 times on the Champions Tour, with Lee Trevino's 29 in second. Irwin's seven Champions Tour majors, which include four Senior PGAs and two U.S. Senior Opens, are second to Jack Nicklaus (eight).\n\nThough six years removed from his last Champions Tour victory, Irwin nearly won the Senior PGA Championship last year, a few days shy of his 67th birthday. He ended finishing in a tie for third, three shots behind Roger Chapman.\n\nThis season has not been to his liking, with two top-25 finishes in 12 starts, but that has done nothing to damper Irwin's competitiveness.\n\n\"At the age of 68 I don't feel like I'm over the hill, although it's a pretty big hill in front of me and kind of a small hill back there,\" said Irwin, pointing behind him as he spoke. \"I understand most of my career's in my rearview mirror — there's no doubt about that — but there's still things I think I still want to do.\n\n\"I still have goals and achievements that I want to have. Whether I make them or not I don't know, but that's the way I've kind of driven myself. If that next victory were to be this week, there would be no one happier than me, believe me.\"\n\nFor someone as accomplished on the golf course as Irwin, he remains approachable with fans. An enduring memory is of him running along the ropes giving fans high-fives after sinking a 45-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole during the final round of the 1990 U.S. Open, which he later won in a playoff with Mike Donald to become the oldest champion at 45.\n\nYou get the sense if he were to somehow win this week, Irwin might do the same — albeit at a slightly slower pace. It's that relationship with the fans that means as much as any titles he has won, and much of what still keeps him out here.\n\n\"If I can leave this game better than what I found it, then I think I've done my job,\" Irwin said. \"If that's because I've won tournaments or because I've added one more person to the game that enjoys it, if it mean's that I've enhanced an amateur's fun time at the golf course, then I think those are all small steps that really lead to a big step.\"\n\nMangan writes for the (Binghamton, N.Y.)

It was Klum alone who had access to the Golden Buzzer and the power to send an act straight to the finals. A second spot in the finals would be decided by a voting panel of \"superfans\" viewing the auditions and deciding on their favorite. The other acts, unfortunately, would face elimination once more.\n\nHere's how the evening played out:\n\nThe Golden Buzzer act: Teenage magician Aidan McCann\n\nThirteen-year-old Aidan McCann worked his magic on Klum, moving her to hit the Golden Buzzer. The Irish illusionist said he picked up the interest at age 5 and competed on \"Britain's Got Talent\" in 2020.\n\nOn Monday, he sought assistance from show host Terry Crews, who selected a superhero name from McCann's deck that was not revealed. A blindfolded McCann then instructed the judges to color in a drawing of a superhero. Cowell colored the cape green. Klum chose pink for the hero's shirt. Mandel selected orange for the hero's shorts and blue for his tights.\n\nMcCann said he predicted each move the judges and host would make.\n\nTo prove his point, he removed his tear-away suit to reveal a hero's outfit that matched the judge's artwork and Crews' pick of a superhero name. Titan Jr. was written across McCann's chest. Crews, tearing away his own suit, revealed he had a superhero suit matching McCann's with Titan written on his chest.\n\n\"Wow,\" Cowell said repeatedly in astonishment. \"Thank God you're here! That was unbelievable!\"\n\n\"I love the magic, but really it is you who is the magic,\" Klum said. \"You really are. I think you're such a little star. You sparkle, and I don't know. What's my head saying? What?\" she said reaching for the buzzer.\n\nAll about the backwash: Human Fountains return\n\nWhat's a little spit between friends? The novel act Human Fountains, who competed in 2018, returned with their water bottles in hand. As the name suggests, the trio of men (previously a foursome) sip water and then project it like a fountain would.\n\nThe group performed a patriotic routine to \"God Bless America\" as they spit water into each other's mouths. In another stomach-churning moment, one group member took a hot dog from his mouth, placed a bun inside, and then passed it to another member who spat mustard onto it. The lucky third member ate it.\n\nShortly thereafter, Cowell his buzzer, giving the group an \"X.\" Crews called the act \"incredible,\" and Klum said she was excited by the group's return.\n\n\"We're definitely missing the fourth person, in my opinion,\" Cowell said over the audience's boos. \"And I think the spitting was higher last time, from memory.\"\n\nSacred Riana unnerves Howie Mandel\n\nA haunting magic act proved too much for Mandel to handle. Sacred Riana, a contestant on \"AGT\" in 2018, pulled the judge to the stage to help him with her eerie act and directed him to sit in a chair.\n\nStanding at a nearby table, she drove a knife into its surface causing Mandel to jump. \"I feel like I got stabbed in the back,\" he said.\n\nLater Mandel said he heard a voice saying Howie, though no one else appeared to hear it. \"I swear to you,\" he told the audience.\n\nWhen Mandel returned to the judge's table he found a note that read, \"I'm coming for you, Howie!!!\" Then the stage went black and Riana disappeared.\n\n\"Are we at the end of the act?\" Klum asked. \"Is everyone as confused as I am?\"\n\n\"Well apparently somebody's coming for me,\" a shaken Mandel said. \"So I would like to get the judging out of the way so that I can leave.\"\n\n\"I'm really, legitimately, I'm not kidding,\" he added. \"I'm telling you that I'm terrified.\"\n\n\"Terrified of what?\" Cowell asked.\n\n\"Read the note!\" Mandel shot back. \"I was poked in the back, I was stabbed in the back. He knows my name, and he's coming for me.\"\n\nWith that, the judges continued on with the show.\n\nWho did the superfans vote through to the finals?\n\nWhich one of the remaining acts would be sent through to the finals thanks to a group of \"AGT\" enthusiasts? Crews revealed the voters' Top 3 to be: married aerialists Power Duo, the Ndlovu Youth Choir and dancer Darius Mabda.\n\nThe young dancer received third place, and the choir second, meaning the superfans championed the moving Power Duo to the finals.\n\nCatch up on the season so far:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/eagles/2015/03/21/chuck-bednarik-dead-philadelphia-eagles/25135055/", "title": "Hall of Famer Chuck Bednarik dead at 89", "text": "USA TODAY Sports\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles Hall of Famer Chuck Bednarik has died at age 89.\n\nThe Eagles announced he died early Saturday morning after a brief illness at an assisted living center in Richland, Penn.\n\nHis daughters said Bednarik had dementia, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"He died from dementia from football-related head injuries,\" Charlene Thomas told the The Express-Times of Easton \"It was not brief.\"\n\nPamela McWilliams, who also believes football injuries played a role in his decline, said her father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"I certainly think it played a big role in it — he took a lot of blows and they certainly didn't have the safety equipment they have now back then,\" McWilliams told The Express-Times. \"It seemed like quite a few of the guys he played with and against had it.\"\n\nBednarik played linebacker and center for the Eagles, one of the last great two-way players of the game. His game-saving tackle helped the Eagles capture the 1960 NFL championship, the last title won by the franchise.\n\nAfter a franchise-record 14 seasons with the Eagles, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967, his first year of eligibility.\n\n\"With the passing of Chuck Bednarik, the Eagles and our fans have lost a legend,\" Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie said in a statement. \"Philadelphia fans grow up expecting toughness, all-out effort and a workmanlike attitude from this team and so much of that image has its roots in the way Chuck played the game. He was a Hall of Famer, a champion and an all-time Eagle. Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones during this time.\"\n\nNicknamed \"Concrete Charlie\" for his offseason job as a cement salesman, he was the son of a Bethlehem, Pa., steelworker and was a gunner on a B-24 in World War II.\n\n\"I grew up in the tough days, where on the street corners we had gangs,\" he said. \"I just felt I could take on anybody. Whether I could or not, I didn't know. I just felt that way.\"\n\nDuring World War II, he flew 30 combat missions over Germany with the Army Air Corps. \"That was pressure. . . . All that anti-aircraft fire they threw at us and being a 19-year-old kid. That gave me some toughness. So when I survived the war and came home and went out on a football field, I figured, 'Shoot, this is easy.' \"\n\nHe had two signature moments during his career with the Eagles. The first is a snapshot of Bednarik standing over Frank Gifford just after he knocked the New York Giants halfback unconscious with a blindside hit Nov. 20, 1960.\n\nNot only did it cause the fumble that the Eagles recovered to seal the game, but it also showed them they were better than the Giants, who had played for the NFL title the previous two seasons.\n\nThe Eagles would go on to finish 10-2 en route to facing the Green Bay Packers in the 1960 title game -- a contest in which Bednarik played 58 of the 60 minutes at center and linebacker.\n\nIn the title game, he sealed the 17-13 victory by stopping Jim Taylor in the closing seconds.\n\n\"So many of the timeless moments in Eagles history are associated with Chuck Bednarik,\" said team president Don Smolenski in a statement. \"He played his entire career in Philadelphia, college and pro, and he lived his entire life here and in the Lehigh Valley. He was a proud competitor and a dedicated and devout family man who loved Eagles fans as much as they loved him. He left his mark on this team and will forever be a legend within this organization.\"\n\nEagles coach Chip Kelly said he had spent time with Bednarik, calling him \"one of the most unique players that this game has ever seen.\"\n\n\"The foundation of this organization and this league is built on the backs of past greats, with Chuck at the forefront,\" Kelly said in a statement. \"The way he played the game with an endless passion and tenacity helped establish the standard of excellence that this organization stands for; one that we strive to achieve each and every day.\"\n\nBednarik would later scoff at the idea that players today could achieve what he did on both sides of the ball.\n\n\"Impossible,\" he said. \"The reason they can't is they're 350-60-70-80 pounds. . . . They would die.\"\n\nHe arrived with the Eagles as the NFL's first overall draft pick in 1949 after two All-American seasons at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nKnown for his toughness, Bednarik made eight Pro Bowls and missed three games in 14 years.\n\nHe said he missed none with his worst injury, a torn biceps in his right arm: \"They just pushed it up and taped it. I continued playing,\" he said. \"You can feel a little dent up above where the attachment was.\"\n\nHe was an Eagles assistant coach from 1976 to 1982.\n\nSince 1995, the \"Chuck Bednarik Award\" has been given to college football's best defensive player.\n\nBednarik is survived by Emma, his wife of 67 years, five daughters, 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/03/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/05/24/wnew-memorial-day-weekend-beach-concerts-asbury-park-remembering-big-shows/5252706002/", "title": "WNEW Memorial Day weekend beach concerts in Asbury Park ...", "text": "Where were you 32 years ago this weekend?\n\nIf you’re from the Jersey Shore and of a certain age, there’s a good chance you were at the 1988 WNEW Memorial Day weekend beach concert, held on the morning of Friday, May 27 in Asbury Park. Seventy thousand attended to see the Georgia Satellites, Roger McGuinn, Joan Jett and hometown hero Glen Burtnik.\n\n“It was packed,” Burtnik said. “It was amazing.”\n\nEven though the city was in a downward spiral in the late ‘80s, the crowds showed up for the WNEW concerts. The New York City station, 102.7 on the FM dial, was tops in the area for mainstream rock 'n' roll with disc jockeys like Scott Muni, Pete Fornatale, Carol Miller, Jim Monaghan and Dave Herman. The concerts, which also included end of season shindigs, started in 1986 with Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes and fizzled out by 1993, when the shows were moved to the Saturday of the holiday weekend to cut down on kids cutting class to be there Friday morning tor the show.\n\nMore:Coronavirus NJ: Hospital discharge songs celebrate teamwork in battle against COVID-19\n\nMore:8 great NJ podcasts to spend your coronavirus outbreak downtime with\n\nMore:Coronavirus NJ: Ron Frangipane, played on Sugar, Sugar and taught at Monmouth U., has died\n\nHalf of Keansburg High School skipped school in ‘88, according to the Asbury Park Press.\n\nBurtnik was the Stone Pony regular who had broken out with the MTV hit “Follow You” on A&M Records.\n\n“We had to be there really early in the morning so we stayed in what was called at the time the Berkeley-Carteret Hotel (now the Berkeley Oceanfront Hotel) and we were going to go on after Joan Jett,\" Burtnik said. “I was trying to get to know her but she was not interested.”\n\nMike Black, then a disc jockey for Monmouth College’s WMCX-FM, was also on stage and he snapped the now locally famous pic of the overflowing crowd on the beach and boardwalk that day.\n\nThe stage was set up facing north where the Casino formerly stood.\n\n“The cool thing was that no one had cell phones, everybody was digging the show,” Black said. “You can tell in the picture the ’80s fashions were in full effect.”\n\nA lot of attendees were also digging late morning beers.\n\n“By noon, a large portion of the unprecedented beer-drinking crowd was already slurring its words,” reported Shannon Mullen in his Asbury Park Press story of the event.\n\n“The biggest problem is drinking on an empty stomach,” said Asbury Park Fire Department Capt. Joseph Mirachi to the Press. “The beer and empty stomach and drugs don’t go with the heat.”\n\nThe WNEW Memorial Day Friday concerts relocated to New York in 1989 as Asbury Park officials were concerned about crowd control, according to the Press, only to return in 1990. By 1992, it was moved to Saturday of the holiday weekend and 100,000 came out to see the Smithereens, Stray Cats and Cracker. The 1993 show, headlined by Black 47 with locals Mr. Reality, was the last.\n\nBig beach concerts took a hiatus in Asbury Park until the 2012 edition of the Bamboozle, which drew tens of thousands to a stages on the North Breach. Bon Jovi, the Foo Fighters and Incubus were the headliners. The annual Indian Summer drew hot national acts to a stage just north of Convention Hall in recent years, and there's overnight camping, too.\n\nThe Danny Clinch-curated Sea.Hear.Now has been a big hit on the beach for the last two years. Incubus, Jack Johnson, Dave Matthews Band and the Lumineers have headlined, and Pearl Jam is at the top of the bill for this year's fest, still on as of press time for Sept. 19 and 20.\n\nYet, the Jams on the Sand summer series on the beach next to the Anchor's Bend, inside Convention Hall, has been canceled due to the COVD-19 outbreak, as has most of the shows at the Stone Pony, Wonder Bar and Asbury Lanes through August.\n\nThe WNEW concerts will always remain a unique experience for those who attended them.

Close to half of baby boomers (45%) have no savings at all, according to a report from the Insured Retirement Institute, and of those who do, more than one-quarter have less than $100,000 squirreled away.\n\nBut if you've been working hard to prepare for the future, you may be one of the few who is able to retire with a healthy fund that will last. While everyone's definition of \"rich\" differs, these three signs indicate you're on track to enjoy retirement without worrying about running out of money.\n\nDon't let a 3-digit number define you:Here's what to do with a low credit score\n\nAnalysis:If these 3 things apply to you, you'll have to postpone retirement\n\n1. You've been saving consistently for decades\n\nBecause you'll likely need to save bundles of cash for retirement, it takes decades of consistent work to build a healthy nest egg. The average worker estimates retirement will cost around $1.7 million, according to a survey from Charles Schwab, and around 1 in 10 survey respondents believe they'll need at least $3 million to retire comfortably.\n\nThese numbers may be intimidating, but the earlier you begin saving, the easier it will be to achieve lofty goals. Say you want to save $1.5 million by age 67. If you started saving at 25, you'd need to save around $550 per month, assuming you're earning a modest 7% annual rate of return. But wait until 40 to begin saving, and you'll have to sock away roughly $1,700 per month to reach that goal, all other factors remaining the same.\n\nEven if you're off to a late start and don't have 40 to 50 years to save for retirement, it's never too late to begin. By starting now, you'll give yourself the best chance to build a strong retirement fund.\n\n2. You've set saving goals and have a plan to reach them\n\nWithout a goal, it's tough to tell whether your savings are on track or not. Even if you do have a goal in mind, you need an action plan that will help you achieve it.\n\nTo set your savings goal, figure out how much you should aim to save by retirement age. A retirement calculator is helpful here, but make your inputs as accurate as possible – don't just guess at how much you expect to spend each year or what age you plan to retire. While you can't be 100% accurate, try to come up with as precise an estimate as possible.\n\nOnce you have a savings goal, consider how to reach it. Thinking about how many hundreds of thousands (or even millions) of dollars you need to save by retirement can be overwhelming, so try breaking it down into smaller goals.\n\nMost retirement calculators will tell you how much you should save each month to reach your target, so start there. You may want to break it down even further into weekly or even daily goals. Saving a few dollars per day is much more manageable than saving an enormous amount by retirement age, and these smaller goals can help keep you on track.\n\n3. You've considered how much (or how little) to rely on Social Security\n\nSocial Security benefits are an important factor in your retirement plan, but many retirees depend too heavily on them. For the average worker, monthly checks are designed to replace only about 40% of pre-retirement income. But around half of unmarried beneficiaries and close to one-quarter of married couples rely on their benefits for around 90% of their income in retirement.\n\nBe honest with yourself about how much of your income will come from Social Security and how much you'll need to save on your own. You can check your estimated benefit amount online by creating a my Social Security account. You can then see your future benefit amount based on your real earnings, which can give you an idea of how much you can expect to receive. This number is assuming you'll start claiming benefits at your full retirement age. If you choose to file before then, your monthly checks will be reduced.\n\nOnce you have an idea of what you'll be receiving in benefits, you can adjust your savings goals accordingly.\n\nSaving for retirement isn't easy, and retiring rich can be even more challenging. But putting in the extra work now to ensure you won't struggle in retirement is worth it.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

They're handling a lot of it.\n\nKids ages 4 to 14 received an average $454 in allowance over the course of 2017, in addition to cash gifts for birthdays and holidays, according to a forthcoming survey from allowance tracker RoosterMoney. The average kid takes home around $8.74 a week.\n\nThe app polled 10,000 of its users.\n\nOffering an allowance is an opportunity to teach children how to spend and save. People form many of their financial habits by seven years old, a 2013 University of Cambridge study found.\n\nBut the way these payments are doled out and stored is changing. Apps like RoosterMoney, FamZoo and Threejars offer ways to digitize the allowance and induct children into the economy, which itself is becoming increasingly virtual.\n\n\"Parents are finding it harder to have conversations about money because they don't have cash around,\" said William Carmichael, CEO of RoosterMoney.\n\nParents are actually doing a disservice to their children by teaching them about finances solely via cash, Carmichael said.\n\n\"That's not the world their kids will live in,\" he said.\n\nHere are some tips to teach your kids about money in the age of screens.\n\n1) Make digital currency feel real\n\nIt can be hard for a 5- or 6-year-old to understand what is happening when their parents swipe their credit cards at the grocery store. Parents should explain the process.\n\n\"Parents are the number one influence on how kids will spend their money,\" said Paul Golden, a spokesman for the National Endowment for Financial Education. \"You want to teach your kids when you go to the ATM, you're keeping the receipt, and how it comes off the bottom line.\"\n\nPiggy bank apps can also reinforce the consequences of spending. The FamZoo app, for example, sends a reminder text message to the child when they've purchased something. Parents can also require their child to gain permission from them before they buy something.\n\n\"That's putting the pain back into spending,\" said Bill Dwight, founder of FamZoo.\n\n2) Reward saving\n\nMany of these online piggy banks allow parents to set an interest rate. The RoosterMoney app, for example, has a default rate of 9%. (In its user survey, they found that the average kid saves 43% of his allowance.)\n\n\"We might not be getting those rates with banks,\" Carmichael said, \"but when you're six or seven [years old], you need to make it exciting.\"\n\nMore:For kids’ allowance, no cash required\n\nMore:How much will I have when I retire if I max out my 401(k)?\n\nMore:Should you give your children an allowance? Two experts weigh in\n\nThe FamZoo app will notify children of their returns (paid, of course, by parents).\n\n\"We're trying to teach kids basic principles like compound interest,\" Dwight said.\n\nGolden said that parents need to \"understand their kid's financial personality,\" as well: One of his kids is a spender while the other is a saver. Recognizing a child's tendencies can help a parent realize what lessons they will need to reinforce.\n\n3) Teach them \"the pain\" of debt\n\nChildren will learn to spend their money better if allowances are given out on a set schedule, Golden said. Many of the allowance apps allow parents to establish recurring disbursements.\n\n\"If they're only getting an allowance when they've done something good, that's not how the world works,\" he said. \"We want to teach them how to make ends meet.\"\n\nThe FamZoo app even allows children to receive loans from their parents, with a real-world cost.\n\n\"We model all the things adults see in the world with our child products,\" Dwight said.\n\n© CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Roy Cooper called the incidents a “criminal attack.” The Democrat said the state will make sure critical services have support.\n\nCooper told CNN’s “The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer” it is important to find the perpetrators but also to think about preventative measures.\n\n“We need to look forward, to look at how we can harden our electrical grid and make sure that our power sources are protected,” he said, adding the grid “can’t be this vulnerable that someone with knowledge of how to disable the electrical system could come in and actually do that in a very short amount of time.”\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, about 38,000 homes and businesses remain without power, according to Duke Energy spokesperson Jeff Brooks. He said it could take until Thursday to restore power to everyone affected.\n\nAuthorities announced a county-wide mandatory curfew from 9 p.m. until 5 a.m., starting Sunday night, with Fields saying the decision was made to protect residents and businesses.\n\nThe North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation also has joined the investigation, officials said.\n\nWork continues Monday at one of the damaged power substations in central North Carolina. Karl B DeBlaker/AP\n\nLocal business owner driving an hour for generator fuel\n\nIn the town of Southern Pines, one business owner has generator power and pancakes.\n\n“We’re trying to help people who don’t really have an alternative,” Southern Pines Growler owner Gerald Bateman told CNN.\n\nWith the help of volunteers, Bateman is opening his business to the public from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., he said. He also has to drive 50 to 70 miles every night to pick up fuel to keep the generators running in his business, he explained.\n\n“We’re seeing about 20 to 30 people an hour. People have been coming in, grabbing some coffee, food and charging their phones,” Bateman said. “Multiple people have also told me how they’ve had to go to other counties for food.”\n\nAll schools in the county are closed Monday and Tuesday. Authorities have opened a shelter running on a generator.\n\nMapbox\n\nOvernight temperatures should be in the 40s\n\nTraffic lights are also out, and while a few stores with generators were able to open their doors, several businesses and churches in Moore County were closed Sunday, CNN affiliate WRAL reported.\n\n“We were just getting over Covid. And now this,” the sheriff said, adding, “It’s gonna hurt all of our restaurants and businesses.”\n\nInside people’s homes, it’s become difficult to keep the cold out.\n\n“We have a 6-month-old baby in the house. We’re out of heat. We are trying to get heat for her,” Carthage resident Chris Thompson told WRAL.\n\nOfficials warn drivers that power is out to traffic signals. Karl B DeBlaker/AP\n\nForecasters say temperatures will be in the mid-40s overnight. Tuesday afternoon temperatures will reach the lower 60s, forecasters say. For the rest of the week, low temperatures will be in the mid-50s and highs in the afternoon will top 70.\n\nCarthage, the seat of Moore County, is about 45 miles northwest of Fayetteville and about 60 miles southwest of Raleigh. The county is also home to Pinehurst, a very popular golfing destination.\n\nFirstHealth Moore Regional Hospital in Pinehurst is postponing some elective procedures and running on a backup generator, the hospital said in a statement.\n\n“The widespread outages are impacting outlying FirstHealth clinics across Moore County,” said the statement. “Primary Care, Internal Medicine, Family Medicine and Convenient Care clinics in Moore County will be closed until power is restored,” said hospital officials.\n\nNational Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby said the White House is monitoring the “intentional vandalism” at the power station closely, and shoring up infrastructure against external threats is a major priority, CNN affiliate WTVD reported.\n\nMillions of dollars worth of damage\n\nThe estimated cost of the substation damage is in the millions, the sheriff said Sunday.\n\nThe damage has been significant and rerouting power isn’t an option, said Brooks, the Duke Energy spokesperson.\n\nDamage to the gate to the Duke Energy West End substation is seen Sunday in Moore County. John Nagy/The Pilot/AP\n\n“Equipment will have to be replaced,” Brooks said. “We’re pursuing multiple paths of restoration so that we can restore as many customers as quickly as possible. Recognizing that, we are looking at pretty sophisticated repair with some fairly large equipment.”\n\nIn addition to the gunfire damage at the substations, a gate at one of the locations appears to have been taken off its hinges, Asst. Chief Mike Cameron of the Southern Pines Fire and Rescue Department told CNN.\n\nWhile it’s unclear what motivated the alleged vandalism, the sheriff on Sunday addressed rumors circulating on social media that the attack was an attempt to thwart a local drag show.\n\nFields said investigators “have not been able to tie anything back to the drag show,” which was scheduled in the town of Southern Pines at 7 p.m. Saturday, around the time the power went out.\n\nDuke Energy workers gather Sunday as they plan how to repair an electrical substation in Carthage, North Carolina. Jonathan Drake/Reuters\n\nThe head of the LGBTQ+ group that helped organize the drag show said Monday she was unaware of any threats to the event before the attacks. Lauren Mathers, the executive director of Sandhills PRIDE, told CNN they received a lot of “hateful comments” on social media, but nothing that could be considered a threat.\n\nThe house lights were down between numbers when the power went out, so they didn’t realize anything was wrong when the lights didn’t come back on, she said.\n\nCNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem said the fact that the shooting was “targeted enough to bring down two different facilities” probably has investigators looking at an “insider threat.”\n\n“They will be looking at the potential that there was either casing or someone who knew the area, knew the facilities and knew exactly where to shoot,” she said on CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper.” “These aren’t drive-by incidents. These are ones in which you’re targeting directly.”\n\nAccording to CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller, these incidents are similar to one more than nine years ago in California.\n\nSniper fire hit a Silicon Valley substation in April 2013, when 150 bullets from a rifle took out 17 transformers. Workers rerouted power in that case, but repairs to the transformers took nearly a month.\n\nAfter that incident, power companies and the government undertook a systemic review of grid security and made changes to add more cameras and motion sensors, Miller said.", "authors": ["Nouran Salahieh Hannah Sarisohn", "Nouran Salahieh", "Hannah Sarisohn"], "publish_date": "2022/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/26/china/china-protests-xinjiang-fire-shanghai-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China Covid: Protests erupt in unprecedented challenge to Xi ...", "text": "Beijing CNN —\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday faced unprecedented dissent after thousands of demonstrators protested in cities across China over the weekend against his zero-Covid strategy – with some daring to openly call for his removal in the streets.\n\n“Step down, Xi Jinping! Step down, Communist Party!” some protesters yelled among hundreds who gathered in the financial hub Shanghai – one of multiple major cities where protests broke out following a deadly fire Thursday at an apartment block in the far western region of Xinjiang.\n\nThe fire appeared to act as a catalyst for searing public anger over China’s strict zero-Covid measures after videos emerged that seemed to suggest lockdown measures delayed firefighters from reaching the victims.\n\nHear protesters in China call for Xi Jinping's resignation 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\nFrom Shanghai to the capital Beijing, residents gathered to grieve the 10 people killed in the blaze in Xinjiang’s capital Urumqi, speak out against zero-Covid and call for freedom and democracy. On dozens of university campuses, students demonstrated or put up protest posters. In many parts of the country, residents in locked-down neighborhoods tore down barriers and took to the streets, following mass anti-lockdown protests that swept Urumqi on Friday night.\n\nSuch widespread scenes of anger and defiance – some of which stretched into the early hours of Monday morning – are exceptionally rare in China, where the ruling Communist Party ruthlessly cracks down on all expressions of dissent.

When asked about protesters calling on Xi to step down, he replied: “I’m not aware of the situation you mentioned.”\n\nThough the protests made headlines in international media, Chinese state media carried stories and opinion pieces stressing the severity of the Covid outbreak and the need to persevere with methods to stamp it out.\n\n“Practices have proven that our Covid measures can stand the test of history, they are scientific and effective,” said an opinion piece published by the Xinhua news agency on Monday. “Perseverance prevails.”\n\nBut the challenge to zero-Covid posed by the spread of more contagious variants was underlined Monday when China reported 40,052 new local cases – the sixth consecutive day of record figures, according to the National Health Commission.\n\nNearly 4,000 of those infections were identified in Beijing, where – without referring to the protests – city authorities on Sunday banned blocking entrances to residential compounds under lockdown, adding that access must be granted to emergency services.\n\nProtests in Shanghai\n\nDemonstrators stand by protest signs in Shanghai, China, on Saturday, Nov. 26, 2022. AP\n\nBrewing anger over the fire deaths led to remarkable acts of defiance in Shanghai, where many of its 25 million residents hold deep resentment toward the government’s zero-Covid policy after being subjected to a two-month lockdown in the spring.\n\nLate on Saturday night, hundreds of residents gathered for a candlelight vigil on Urumqi Road, which was named after the city, to mourn the victims of the Xinjiang fire, according to videos widely circulated – and promptly censored – on Chinese social media and a witness account.\n\nSurrounding a makeshift memorial of candles, flowers and placards, the crowd held up blank sheets of white paper – in what is traditionally a symbolic protest against censorship – and chanted, “Need human rights, need freedom.”\n\nWhy protesters in China are holding up white paper 01:32 - Source: CNN\n\nIn multiple videos seen by CNN, people could be heard shouting demands for Xi and the Communist Party to “step down.” The crowd also chanted, “Don’t want Covid test, want freedom!” and “Don’t want dictatorship, want democracy!”\n\nSome videos show people singing China’s national anthem and The Internationale, a standard of the socialist movement, while holding banners protesting the country’s exceptionally stringent pandemic measures.\n\nRows of police officers, who initially looked on from the outside, started to move in to push back and divide the crowd around 3 a.m., sparking tense face-offs with the protesters, according to a witness.\n\nThe witness told CNN they saw several people arrested and taken into a police vehicle next to the makeshift memorial after 4.30 a.m. They also saw several protesters being grabbed by the officers from the crowd and taken behind the police line. The protest gradually dispersed before dawn, the witness said.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, hundreds of Shanghai residents returned to the site to continue protesting despite a heavy police presence and road blocks.\n\nVideos showed hundreds of people at an intersection shouting “Release the people!” in a demand for the police to free detained demonstrators.\n\nCrowds shouting \"Release the people!\" in Shanghai. @whyyoutouzhele/Twitter\n\nThis time around, police adopted a more hardline approach, moving faster and more aggressively to make arrests and disperse the crowds.\n\nIn one video, a man holding a bundle of chrysanthemum gave a speech while walking on a pedestrian crossing, as a police officer tried to stop him.\n\n“We need to be braver! Am I breaking the law by holding flowers?” he asked the crowd, who shouted “No!” in reply.\n\n“We Chinese need to be braver!” he said to the applause of the crowd. “So many of us were arrested yesterday.

A small crowd first gathered along the Liangma River for a vigil for the victims of the Xinjiang fire, before it grew in size and eventually marched down the city’s Third Ring Road.\n\nPeople chanted slogans against zero-Covid, voiced support for the detained protesters in Shanghai, and called for greater civil liberties. “We want freedom!

Sign up here.\n\nDoha CNN —\n\nQatar is unrecognizable from the country it was 12 years ago when it won its bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Around $220 billion has been pumped into building an entirely new city, a state-of-the-art metro system and hundreds of new hotel and apartment buildings.\n\nLike previous countries to host major events, Qatar has been under the watchful eye of the international community. At the same time, its own people have been exposed to international ideals as well as shifting cultural and societal norms as they anticipated the influx of over a million football fans to their tiny country.\n\n“Qatar changed a lot in the past 12 years and, culturally speaking, this has made a huge impact,” 30-year-old Qatari football fan Ali Adnan Abel told CNN. “We have seen more diversity that has made Qataris realize it’s time to let the shields down.”\n\nIn hosting the World Cup, Qatar has been under intense pressure to enact legal changes. It dismantled the controversial Kafala system, a long-established regional labor practice that gives companies and the minority citizen population control over migrant workers’ employment, movement, and immigration status.\n\n“What we’ve seen in this case is, certainly there was no attention whatsoever internationally or even on a national level to the treatment of migrant workers in Qatar and that certainly did change after Qatar won the ability to host the World Cup,” James Lynch, director of the human rights group FairSquare and a former British diplomat in Doha, told CNN on Saturday.\n\nBut questions remain as to whether the reforms will stick once the tournament is over and the world’s gaze shifts away from the Gulf nation.\n\nThe Qatari organizers of the event insist those changes are here to stay.\n\n“All of this is actually part of the vision that we have for 2030 and it is one of the pillars of that vision,” Fatma Al Nuaimi, a spokesperson for the organizers, Qatar’s Supreme Committee, told CNN’s Becky Anderson, referring to the government’s blueprint for its future.\n\nQatar, a deeply conservative Muslim country, relaxed alcohol laws in the lead-up, allowing fans to drink in specific zones even though being drunk in public is illegal – although just two days before kick-off, FIFA announced that no alcohol would be sold at stadiums.\n\nThe tournament has also given the opportunity for men and women to mingle in an otherwise segregated country. Women and children have had a strong presence in fan zones and stadiums , watching the games in what has traditionally been a male-dominated sphere.\n\nHowever, history shows that it is uncommon for large sporting events like the World Cup or the Olympics to be long-term catalysts for societal change. Russia infamously hosted the World Cup in 2018 and sought to project an image of tolerance by allowing fans to carry rainbow flags despite a yearslong crackdown on the LGBTQ community.\n\nBut Russian President Vladimir Putin has since shunned liberalism, as tensions with the West spiraled, and after invading Ukraine earlier this year, Moscow came down hardon any subsequent anti-war protests. And just last week, the lower house of the country’s parliament passed an amendment to its “LGBT propaganda” law, banning all Russians from promoting or “praising” homosexual relationships or publicly suggesting that they are normal.\n\nOn the other hand, studies have shown that the international perception of Germany was enhanced after it hosted the 2006 World Cup, and much of the sporting infrastructure put in place is still in use.\n\n“For there to be a positive legacy, this change has to keep on going,” said Thomas Ross Griffin, an assistant professor of American and postcolonial literature at Qatar University. “And what the history of tournaments in London, Brazil, Russia told us, is that change often ends once the final whistle is blown. It’s on Qatar to demonstrate to the world that their change is something that would be kept going beyond the final game of the tournament.”\n\nWhile changes have been made to Qatar’s labor laws, human rights groups say more needs to be done. Just one month before the World Cup began, Amnesty International said the 2020 labor reforms had not been implemented or enforced properly. Qatar, it said, continues to lack freedom of expression and association and discriminates against women and LGBTQ people in law.\n\n“Now, the question is if [this reform] wasn’t implemented properly before the World Cup with the eyes of the world on Qatar, what are the prospects after the World Cup that’s the big concern,” Lynch said.\n\nWhile some have called for a boycott of Qatar for its treatment of LGBTQ people, others have argued that going to Doha and showing solidarity with the LGBTQ community there can affect lasting change. Spain’s openly gay sports minister, Miquel Iceta, said Thursday that hosting the World Cup will mean long-lasting improvement in Qatar’s human rights record by bolstering freedom and tolerance in the country.\n\nJakob Jensen, the Danish football association chief commended the changes that have taken place in Qatar since 2010 in an interview with CNN’s Becky Anderson Thursday. “We do not believe in boycotting. We do believe you make a difference participating, discussing, engaging and dialogue,” he said.\n\nOthers however see Qatar hosting the event as a slap in the face for human rights activists. At FIFA’s 72nd annual Congress in April, the Norwegian football association President Lise Klaveness delivered a stinging speech that labeled the decision to award Qatar the tournament as “unacceptable” and demanded that FIFA do more to defend its principles.\n\nIt will likely take months and even years before the true extent of the World Cup’s influence on the tiny Gulf state is known, says Lynch.\n\n“I think there will be an expectation that there will be comparable scrutiny for future major projects, and I think that’s a good thing,” he said. “Whether it leads to whole-scale reform, I think that’s a bigger question and I think we’ll have to wait to see.”\n\nIran protests\n\nFarideh Moradkhani, a niece of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, called on foreign governments to cut all ties with the Iranian government in a video statement shared on YouTube by her brother, Mahmoud Moradkhani, two days after she was arrested.\n\nFarideh, who is a well-known rights activist opposed to the Iranian regime, was arrested on Wednesday when she went to the prosecutor’s office to serve a court order, according to a tweet from her brother that day.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify when Farideh recorded the video statement shared by her brother on YouTube on Friday, and have reached out to Mahmoud for clarification.\n\nHere’s the latest:\n\nUNICEF on Sunday called for an end “to all forms of violence and abuse that have reportedly claimed the lives of over 50 children and injured many more” in Iran.\n\nIranian footballer Voria Ghafouri has been bailed out after being arrested on charges of “incitement against the regime,” Fars reported on Saturday.\n\nState-aligned Fars News was hacked on Friday, according to a message displayed on its website.

Erdogan shook hands with Sisi in Qatar last week in what was described by an Egyptian presidency statement as a new start in bilateral relations. In a televised discussion program on Saturday, Erdogan said that he and Sisi had spoken for around half an hour to 45 minutes on the sidelines of the World Cup in Qatar.\n\nArab Monetary Fund signs $1 billion pact to support Yemeni government reforms\n\nThe Arab Monetary Fund has signed a $1 billion agreement to support Yemen’s economic reform program to its Saudi-backed government, Saudi state media said on Sunday. The new package by the Abu Dhabi-based fund, which includes countries from the Middle East and North Africa, will provide support for the Yemeni government’s efforts to stabilize the economy from 2022 to 2025, Reuters reported, citing Saudi Ekhbaria TV.\n\nBackground: After the Houthi rebels stormed the capital Sanaa in 2014 and ousted the government, sending it into exile, Yemen’s central bank split into two branches – one in Sanaa, under Houthi control, and one internationally recognized branch in Aden, which has access to money printers. Aden’s branch is under the control of the Saudi-backed administration.\n\nWhy it matters: The war between the Houthi group and a Saudi-led coalition has brought Yemen’s economy to its knees and caused the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. Inflation and foreign currency shortages have made food, water and fuel unaffordable for many in Yemen, which imports most of its needs. The Yemeni riyal has reached all-time lows in provinces controlled by the Saudi-backed government.\n\nThis year has been the deadliest for Palestinians and Israelis since early 2000s\n\nThis year is already the deadliest in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in Israel and the West Bank since the early 2000s, a CNN analysis of official numbers from both Israel and the Palestinian Authority shows. The Israel number includes security forces and civilians killed in Palestinian attacks in Israel and the West Bank. Most were Israeli citizens, but the number includes foreigners living in Israel, according to the Israeli Security Agency, more commonly known as the Shin Bet. The Palestinian Ministry of Health told CNN that 150 Palestinians in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Israel have been killed this year, mostly by Israeli security forces – a number that includes militants and civilians.\n\nBackground: The death over the weekend of Tadasa Tashume Ben Ma’ada from wounds in last Wednesday’s double bombing in Jerusalem brings the number of people killed on the Israeli side to 31 this year, according to Israeli Security Agency (ISA) data and a CNN count.\n\nWhy it matters: The Israeli military is increasingly targeting new militant groups in Jenin and Nablus and claims most of the Palestinians killed were militants or engaging violently with their forces. Human rights groups say dozens of unarmed civilians have been killed as well.\n\nWorld Cup\n\nIranian state media has called for the US to be kicked out of the World Cup after the United States Soccer Federation changed Iran’s flag on its social media platforms to show support for protesters in Iran.\n\nThe federation had temporarily displayed Iran’s national flag on its official Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts without the emblem of the Islamic Republic.

She’d planned to arrive early enough that the campus would be deserted, but her fellow students were already beginning to filter in to start their day.\n\nIn the hallway of an academic building, Jolie, who’d worn a face mask to obscure her identity, waited for the right moment to reach into her bag for the source of her nervousness – several pieces of A4-size paper she had printed out in the small hours of the night.\n\nFinally, when she made sure none of the students – especially those who, like Jolie, come from China – were watching, she quickly pasted one of them on a notice board.\n\n“Life not zero-Covid policy, freedom not martial-lawish lockdown, dignity not lies, reform not cultural revolution, votes not dictatorship, citizens not slaves,” it read, in English.\n\nThe day before, these words, in Chinese, had been handwritten in red paint on a banner hanging over a busy overpass thousands of miles away in Beijing, in a rare, bold protest against China’s top leader Xi Jinping.\n\nAnother banner on the Sitong Bridge denounced Xi as a “dictator” and “national traitor” and called for his removal – just days before a key Communist Party meeting at which he is set to secure a precedent-breaking third term.\n\nVideo shows rare protest in Beijing as Chinese leader is set to extend his reign 02:09 - Source: CNN\n\nBoth banners were swiftly removed by police and all mentions of the protest wiped from the Chinese internet. But the short-lived display of political defiance – which is almost unimaginable in Xi’s authoritarian surveillance state – has resonated far beyond the Chinese capital, sparking acts of solidarity from Chinese nationals inside China and across the globe.\n\nOver the past week, as party elites gathered in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People to extoll Xi and his policies at the 20th Party Congress, anti-Xi slogans echoing the Sitong Bridge banners have popped up in a growing number of Chinese cities and hundreds of universities worldwide.\n\nIn China, the slogans were scrawled on walls and doors in public bathrooms – one of the last places spared the watchful eyes of the country’s ubiquitous surveillance cameras.\n\nOverseas, many anti-Xi posters were put up by Chinese students like Jolie, who have long learned to keep their critical political views to themselves due to a culture of fear. Under Xi, the party has ramped up surveillance and control of the Chinese diaspora, intimidating and harassing those who dare to speak out and threatening their families back home.\n\nAnti-Xi posters are seen on a university campus in the Netherlands. Obtained by CNN\n\nCNN spoke with two Chinese citizens who scribbled protest slogans in bathroom stalls and half a dozen overseas Chinese students who put up anti-Xi posters on their campuses. As with Jolie, CNN agreed to protect their identities with pseudonyms and anonymity due to the sensitivity of their actions.\n\nMany said they were shocked and moved by the Sitong Bridge demonstration and felt compelled to show support for the lone protester, who has not been heard of since and is likely to face lifelong repercussions. He has come to be known as the “Bridge Man,” in a nod to the unidentified “Tank Man” who faced down a column of tanks on Beijing’s Avenue of Eternal Peace the day after the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989.\n\nFew of them believe their political actions will lead to real changes on the ground. But with Xi emerging triumphant from the Party Congress with the potential for lifelong rule, the proliferation of anti-Xi slogans are a timely reminder that despite his relentless crushing of dissent, the powerful leader may always face undercurrents of resistance.\n\n‘A tiny spark’\n\nAs China’s online censors went into overdrive last week to scrub out all discussions about the Sitong Bridge protest, some social media users shared an old Chinese saying: “A tiny spark can set the prairie ablaze.”\n\nIt would appear that the fire started by the “Bridge Man” has done just that, setting off an unprecedented show of dissent against Xi’s leadership and authoritarian rule among mainland Chinese nationals.\n\nThe Chinese government’s policies and actions have sparked outcries online and protests in the streets before. But in most cases, the anger has focused on local authorities and few have attacked Xi himself so directly or blatantly.\n\nCritics of Xi have paid a heavy price. Two years ago, Ren Zhiqiang, a Chinese billionaire who criticized Xi’s handling of China’s initial Covid-19 outbreak and called the top leader a power-hungry “clown,” was jailed for 18 years on corruption charges.\n\nBut the risks of speaking out did not deter Raven Wu, a university senior in eastern China. Inspired by the “Bridge Man,” Wu left a message in English in a bathroom stall to share his call for freedom, dignity, reform, and democracy. Below the message, he drew a picture of Winnie the Pooh wearing a crown, with a “no” sign drawn over it. (Xi has been compared to the chubby cartoon bear by Chinese social media users.)\n\nA protest slogan is scribbled on the wall in a public bathroom in China. Obtained by CNN\n\n“I felt a long-lost sense of liberation when I was scribbling,” Wu said. “In this country of extreme cultural and political censorship, no political self-expression is allowed. I felt satisfied that for the first time in my life as a Chinese citizen, I did the right thing for the people.”\n\nThere was also the fear of being found out by the school – and the consequences, but he managed to push it aside. Wu, whose own political awakening came in high school when he heard about the Tiananmen Square massacre by chance, hoped his scribbles could cause a ripple of change – however small – among those who saw them.\n\nHe is deeply worried about China’s future. Over the past two years, “despairing news” has repeatedly shocked him, he said.\n\n“Just like Xi’s nickname ‘the Accelerator-in-Chief,’ he is leading the country into the abyss … The most desperate thing is that through the [Party Congress], Xi Jinping will likely establish his status as the emperor and double down on his policies.”\n\nChen Qiang, a fresh graduate in southwestern China, shared that bleak outlook – the economy is faltering, and censorship is becoming ever more stringent, he said.\n\nChen had tried to share the Sitong Bridge protest on WeChat, China’s super app, but it kept getting censored. So he thought to himself: why don’t I write the slogans in nearby places to let more people know about him?\n\nHe found a public restroom and wrote the original Chinese version of the slogan on a toilet stall door. As he scrawled on, he was gripped by a paralyzing fear of being caught by the strict surveillance. But he forced himself to continue. “(The Beijing protester) had sacrificed his life or the freedom of the rest of his life to do what he did. I think we should also be obliged to do something that we can do,” he said.\n\nChen described himself as a patriot. “However I don’t love the (Communist) Party. I have feelings for China, but not the government.”\n\nOf course I love my country. However, I don’t love the (Communist) Party. Chen Qiang, a fresh graduate\n\nSo far, the spread of the slogans appears limited.\n\nA number of pro-democracy Instagram accounts run by anonymous Chinese nationals have been keeping track of the anti-Xi graffiti and posters. Citizensdailycn, an account with 32,000 followers, said it received around three dozen reports from mainland China, about half of which involved bathrooms. Northern_Square, with 42,000 followers, said it received eight reports of slogans in bathrooms, which users said were from cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Wuhan.\n\nThe movement has been dubbed by some as the “Toilet Revolution” – in a jibe against Xi’s campaign to improve the sanitary conditions at public restrooms in China, and a nod to the location of much of the anti-Xi messaging.\n\nWu, the student in Eastern China, applauded the term for its “ironic effect.” But he said it also offers an inspiration. “Even in a cramped space like the toilet, as long as you have a revolutionary heart, you can make your own contribution,” he said.\n\nFor Chen, the term is a stark reminder of the highly limited space of free expression in China.\n\n“Due to censorship and surveillance, people can only express political opinions by writing slogans in places like toilets. It is sad that we have been oppressed to this extent,” Chen said.\n\n‘A glimmer of light’\n\nFor many overseas Chinese students, including Jolie, it is their first time to have taken political action, driven by a mixture of awe and guilt toward the “Bridge Man” and a sense of duty to show solidarity.\n\nAmong the posters on the notice boards of Goldsmiths, the University of London, is one with a photo of the Sitong Bridge protest, which showed a plume of dark smoke billowing up from the bridge.\n\nAbove it, a Chinese sentence printed in red reads: “The courage of one person should not be without echo.”\n\nA poster at Goldsmiths, the University of London, reads in Chinese: \"The courage of one person should not be without echo.\" Obtained by CNN\n\nPutting up protest posters “is the smallest thing, but the biggest I can do now – not because of my ability but because of my lack of courage,” Jolie said, pointing to her relative safety acting outside China’s borders.\n\nOthers expressed a similar sense of guilt. “I feel ashamed. If I were in Beijing now, I would never have the courage to do such a thing,” said Yvonne Li, who graduated from Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands last year.\n\nLi and a friend put up a hundred posters on campus and in the city center, including around China Town.\n\n“I really wanted to cry when I first saw the protest on Instagram. I felt politically depressed reading Chinese news everyday. I couldn’t see any hope. But when I saw this brave man, I realized there is still a glimmer of light,” she said.\n\nWhen I saw this brave man, I realized there is still a glimmer of light. Yvonne Li, recent graduate in Rotterdam\n\nThe two Instagram accounts, Citizensdailycn and Northern_square, said they each received more than 1,000 submissions of anti-Xi posters from the Chinese diaspora. According to Citizensdailycn’s tally, the posters have been sighted at 320 universities across the world.\n\nTeng Biao, a human rights lawyer and visiting professor at the University of Chicago, said he is struck by how fast the overseas opposition to Xi has gathered pace and how far it has spread.\n\nWhen Xi scrapped presidential term limits in 2018, posters featuring the slogan “Not My President” and Xi’s face had surfaced in some universities outside China – but the scale paled in comparison, Teng noted.\n\n“In the past, there were only sporadic protests by overseas Chinese dissidents. Voices from university campuses were predominantly supporting the Chinese government and leadership,” he said.\n\nThe risks\n\nIn recent years, as Xi stoked nationalism at home and pursued an assertive foreign policy abroad, an increasing number of overseas Chinese students have stepped forward to defend Beijing from any criticism or perceived slights – sometimes with the blessing of Chinese embassies.\n\nThere were protests when a university invited the Dalai Lama to be a guest speaker; rebukes for professors perceived to have “anti-China” content in their lectures; and clashes when other campus groups expressed support for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests.\n\nBut as the widespread anti-Xi posters have shown, the rising nationalistic sentiment is by no means representative of all Chinese students overseas. Most often, those who do not agree with the party and its policies simply choose to stay silent. For them, the stakes of openly criticizing Beijing are just too high. In past years, those who spoke out have faced harassment and intimidation, retaliation against family back home, and lengthy prison terms upon returning to China.\n\nPosters calling for Chinese leader Xi Jinping's removal on a university campus in London. Obtained by CNN\n\n“Even liberal democracies are influenced by China’s long arm of repression. The Chinese government has a large amount of spies and informants, monitoring overseas Chinese through various United Front-linked organizations,” Teng said, referring to a party body responsible for influence and infiltration operations abroad.\n\nTeng said Beijing has extended its grip on Chinese student bodies abroad to police the speech and actions of its nationals overseas – and to make sure the party line is observed even on foreign campuses.\n\n“The fact that so many students are willing to take the risk shows how widespread the anger is over Xi’s decade of moving backward.”\n\nMost students CNN spoke with said they were worried about being spotted with the posters by Beijing’s supporters, who they fear could expose them on Chinese social media or report them to the embassies.\n\n“We were scared and kept looking around. I found it absurd at the time and reflected briefly upon it – what we were doing is completely legal here (in the Netherlands), but we were still afraid of being seen by other Chinese students,” said Li, the recent graduate in Rotterdam.\n\n‘We’re not alone’\n\nThe fear of being betrayed by peers has weighed heavily on Jolie, the student in London, in particular while growing up in China with views that differed from the party line. “I was feeling really lonely,” she said. “The horrible (thing) is that your friends and classmates may report you.”\n\nBut as she showed solidarity for the “Bridge Man,” she also found solidarity in others who did the same. In the day following the protest in Beijing, Jolie saw on Instagram an outpouring of photos showing protest posters from all over the world.\n\n“I was so moved and also a little bit shocked that (I) have many friends, although I don’t know them, and I felt a very strong emotion,” she said. “I just thought – my friends, how can I contact you, how can I find you, how can we recognize each other?”\n\nAnti-Xi posters at a university in New York. Obtained by CNN\n\nSometimes, all it takes is a knowing smile from a fellow Chinese student – or a new protest poster that crops up on the same notice board – to make the students feel reassured.\n\n“It’s important to tell each other that we’re not alone,” said a Chinese student at McGill University in Quebec.\n\n“(After) I first hung the posters, I went back to see if they were still there and I would see another small poster hung by someone else and I just feel really safe and comforted.”\n\n“I feel like it is my responsibility to do this,” they said. If they didn’t do anything, “it’s just going to be over, and I just don’t want it to be over so quickly without any consequences.”\n\nNot everyone is brainwashed. (We’re) still a nation with ideals and hopes. Matt, a Chinese student in New York\n\nIn China, the party will also be watching closely for any consequences. Having tightened its grip on all aspects of life, launched a sweeping crackdown on dissent, wiped out much of civil society and built a high-tech surveillance state, the party’s hold on power appears firmer than ever.\n\nBut the extensive censorship around the Sitong Bridge protest also betrays its paranoia.\n\n“Maybe (the bridge protester) is the only one with such courage and willingness to sacrifice, but there may be millions of other Chinese people who share his views,” said Matt, a Chinese student at Columbia University in New York.\n\n“He let me realize that there are still such people in China, and I want others to know that, too.

Tate Reeves. The National Guard was called up to help distribute bottled water as crews work to get the water treatment plant back online, state officials said.\n\nBut the distribution itself proved unsustainable. Residents of all ages were seen waiting in lines more than a mile long at Hawkins Field Airport for at least two hours Tuesday for just one case of bottled water. The event was supposed to span three hours, but barely ran two as people were eventually turned away when the 700 cases of water ran out.\n\n“I keep saying we’re going to be the next Michigan,” said Jeraldine Watts, 86, who was able to get water at a grocery store Monday night. “And it looks like that’s exactly what we’re headed for.”\n\nWatts was referring to the water crisis in the city of Flint, which has battled water issues since a 2014 water crisis in which lead-contaminated water fed to residents’ faucets.\n\nPeople line up for water in Jackson, Mississippi, on August 30, 2022. CNN\n\nJackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba told CNN’s Pamela Brown the city is working on more water distribution events. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency will provide nearly 30 water trucks to help supplement the city events, the mayor said.\n\n“I have been assured by MEMA that they will supplement those locations with about 28 tanker trucks distributed at various points across the city,” Lumumba told CNN.\n\nExplanations for Jackson’s failing system are complicated: Damage this summer to pumps at the main water treatment facility made failure increasingly likely as the summer progressed, the governor said; and flooding of the Pearl River after heavy rains last week affected treatment processes and therefore the amount of running water the system can provide, Lumumba said.\n\nThis week’s troubles come as the water system has been plagued with problems for years and with the city already under a boil water notice since late July for what the state called a water-quality issue.\n\nThe state is “surging our resources to the city’s water treatment facility and beginning emergency maintenance, repairs and improvements,” Gov. Reeves said. “We will do everything in our power to restore water pressure and get water flowing back to the people of Jackson.”\n\nWater for those in the state’s most populous city would have to be provided “for an unknown period of time,” Reeves said.\n\nThe water shortage is expected to last “the next couple of days,” according to the mayor’s office.\n\nLumumba also announced Monday the city’s public works director – a role that oversees the water treatment facilities – has been reassigned. Marlin King will instead serve as deputy director and Jordan Hillman, the city’s planning and development director, will be the interim public works director, according to Melissa Payne, the mayor’s spokesperson.\n\nKing did not respond to CNN requests for comment. Payne said King’s reassignment “is part of restructuring” and is not a result of the current water crisis.\n\nResidents say faucet water is discolored\n\nState Rep. Ronnie Crudup Jr. said he didn’t have running water Monday, but on Tuesday, discolored water came out of his faucet that he used to flush the toilet. He and his family used bottled water Tuesday morning to brush their teeth, Crudup told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota.\n\nCrudup said that although the city has experienced water issues in the past, rain played a part in the current water emergency.\n\n“It’s been building up for years, but we have had an unprecedented amount of rain in the last two to three weeks, and it just kind of created this havoc, what we are dealing with right now,” he said.\n\nJackson resident Daryl Page told CNN he’s been searching for clean, bottled water since the city’s been under a boil water notice “for a whole month.” He was driving to a distribution site, but as he arrived, he noticed there was nothing there.\n\nFirefighters and recruits for the Jackson Fire Department carry cases of bottled water to residents vehicles, August 18, 2022, as part of the city's response to longstanding water system problems. Rogelio V. Solis/AP\n\n“Everyone is turning around because there is nothing here,” Page said, adding that his next plan of action was to drive to another site in hopes that he could find cases of water there.\n\nBecause of Monday’s failure, officials announced all Jackson public schools will shift to virtual learning Tuesday.\n\nHospitals are also feeling the strain. Jackson’s University of Mississippi Medical Center released a statement Tuesday saying the Jackson Medical Mall air conditioning is not functioning properly “because the water pressure feeding its chillers is too low.” Portable restrooms are being used in locations experiencing low water pressure, the statement said.\n\nThe university medical center statement also said a fire watch was declared for its Jackson-based facilities, “because fire suppression systems are fed by the city water system. Low pressure in the systems may cause them to be less effective.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed on the water crisis in Jackson and the White House has been “in regular contact with state and local officials, including Mayor Lumumba, and made clear that the Federal Government stands ready to offer assistance,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“(The Federal Emergency Management Agency) is working closely with the state officials to identify needs, and the EPA is coordinating with industry partners to expedite delivery of critical treatment equipment for emergency repairs at the City of Jackson water treatment facilities,” she said.\n\nIn an emailed statement Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency said “ensuring all people have access to healthy and safe water is a top priority.”\n\n“We are in communication with officials in Mississippi and stand ready to provide support should the State request federal assistance,” the EPA statement read. “In the interim, we are available to provide technical support and information to Mississippi officials as they navigate their plan to address the immediate concerns at the O.B. Curtis Water Plant.”\n\nLater Tuesday, the governor said FEMA has received the state’s declaration asking the federal government to declare the water shortage a federal emergency.\n\nWater system issues go back decades, mayor says\n\nThe problem this week stems from one of two water treatment facilities in the city: the O.B. Curtis plant, which is run by the city of Jackson, according to the governor.\n\nThe main pumps at O.B. Curtis were severely damaged recently, and the facility began operating on smaller backup pumps about a month ago, around the time the latest boil water notice began in July, the governor said, without elaborating about the damage.\n\nThe governor said he was told Friday that “it was a near-certainty that Jackson would fail to produce running water sometime in the next several weeks or months if something did not materially improve,” the governor said.\n\nThe O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant in Jackson, Mississippi, seen on March 24, 2022. Mark Felix/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut Lumumba said during a Monday news conference that it was only a matter time before the water system failed because Jackson’s water system has been faced serious issues for years.\n\n“I have said on multiple occasions that it’s not a matter of ‘if’ our system would fail, but a matter of ‘when’ our system would fail,” the mayor said, adding that the city has been “going at it alone for the better part of two years” when it comes to the water crisis.\n\nIn early 2020, the water system failed an Environmental Protection Agency inspection. The agency wrote the drinking water had the potential to be host to harmful bacteria or parasites, based on observations of the water’s turbidity, or cloudiness, as well as “disinfection treatment concerns, and/or the condition of the distribution system.”\n\nIn March 2020, the EPA issued an order requiring the city to develop a plan to replace and repair monitoring and treatment equipment, to “address dosing processes for disinfection and pH control” and to take more coliform bacteria samples, among other things.\n\nThe city also has endured weather-related shutdowns.\n\nIn February 2021, a winter storm shut down Jackson’s entire water system, leaving tens of thousands of residents without water for a month amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Residents have been under some sort of boil water notice or advisory several times since that storm, including the state-ordered notice posted in July.\n\n“We were here two Februarys ago when we had system failures, and the world was watching us and the world is watching us again,” Lumumba said during Monday’s news conference.\n\nThe mayor also pointed to recent flooding from the Pearl River as an event that triggered the latest water pressure issues.\n\nBecause O.B. Curtis received additional water from the reservoir during the flooding from last week to this week, the facility had to change the way it treats the water, which has led to the reduction of water being put out into the system and reduced tank levels. This is affecting the water pressure at residents’ homes, he said.\n\n“As one crisis may be diverted, another one rears its head,” Lumumba said Monday during a news conference after addressing the flooding in the city.\n\nO.B. Curtis is meant to provide about 50 million gallons for the city daily. The other plant, which usually provides about 20 million gallons daily, has been approved to ramp up its output amid the shortage, authorities said.\n\nIn July 2021, the EPA and the city entered into an agreement to address “long-term challenges and make needed improvements to the drinking water system.” The EPA recently announced $74.9 million in federal water and sewer infrastructure funds for Mississippi, mentioning Jackson without naming specific projects.\n\nHowever, Lumumba has said it would take $2 billion to fully repair and replace the dated system, which city, state and federal officials say also has too much lead in its water in some places.\n\nLumumba declared a water system emergency Monday. The proclamation noted not only the flooding but also numerous previous “unsuccessful attempts to rectify water system issues.”\n\nCNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\nAs for restoring water pressure and flow and performing emergency maintenance and repairs, the state would split the cost with the city, Reeves said Tuesday.\n\n“We will cash flow the operation, and the city will be responsible for half the cost of the emergency improvements that we make,” the governor said in a statement released on Twitter.\n\nAt a Tuesday news conference at the plant, Reeves said he is “encouraged” and at the same time “discouraged” by some of the news coming out of the facility.\n\n“We do have a plan in place to potentially bring in an additional rented pump that will allow us to put at least 4 million gallons of water additionally, hopefully, which will be installed by tomorrow morning. That is progress and will help,” he said.\n\nReeves added there is no time frame as of now for safe drinking water, but that over the next 24 to 36 hours residents will see significant truckloads of clean water start to be delivered to Jackson.\n\nOver the next few days, more than 108 semi-trucks of water are coming into Jackson and seven mega distribution sites will have 36 truckloads of water a day for the public to be able to retrieve, according to Lt. Col.

Zhou and his son made a dozen calls for an ambulance, he said, claiming security guards blocked relatives from entering the building to take the 58-year-old grandfather to a hospital.\n\nAn hour later, an ambulance finally arrived to drive Zhou’s father to a hospital just five minutes away. But it was too late to save him.\n\n“The local government killed my dad,” Zhou told CNN in his Beijing home, breaking down in tears. He said he’s received no explanation about why the ambulance took so long to arrive, just a death certificate stating the wrong date of death.\n\nZhou’s anger is part of a growing torrent of dissent toward China’s unrelenting zero-Covid lockdowns, which officials insist are necessary to protect people’s lives against a virus that, according to the official count, has killed just six people from tens of thousands of symptomatic cases reported in the last six months.\n\nBut increasingly, the restrictions – not the virus – are being blamed for heartbreaking deaths that have sparked nationwide outrage on social media.\n\nHe fully supported China's zero-Covid policy.

Two weeks later, a 4-month-old girl died in hotel quarantine in the central city of Zhengzhou after a 12-hour delay in medical care.\n\nMany more families, like Zhou’s, have likely suffered similar tragedies outside the social media spotlight.\n\nZhou said he contacted several state media outlets in Beijing to report on his story, but no reporters came.

Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nGrowing discontent\n\nAcross China, anger and frustration with zero-Covid has reached new heights and led to rare scenes of protest, as local authorities rushed to reintroduce restrictions amid record infections – despite a recent government announcement of a limited easing of some rules.\n\nLast week, in the southern city of Guangzhou, some residents revolted against an extended lockdown by tearing down barriers and marching down streets.\n\nIn the central city of Zhengzhou this week, workers at the world’s biggest iPhone assembly factory clashed with hazmat-suited security officers over a delay in bonus payment and chaotic Covid rules.\n\nAnd on Thursday, in the sprawling metropolis of Chongqing in the southwest, a resident delivered a searing speech criticizing the Covid lockdown on his residential compound. “Without freedom, I would rather die!” he shouted to a cheering crowd, who hailed him a “hero” and wrestled him from the grip of several police officers who had attempted to take him away.\n\nThese acts of defiance echoed an outpouring of discontent online, notably from Chinese football fans – many under some form of lockdown or restrictions – who have only been able to watch from home as tens of thousands of raucous fans pack stadiums at the World Cup in Qatar.\n\n“None of the fans are seen wearing face masks, or told to submit proof of Covid test results. Are they not living on the same planet as us?” asked a Wechat article questioning China’s insistence on zero-Covid, which went viral before it was censored.\n\nThere are signs that Chinese officials are feeling the heat of the growing public discontent, which came on top of the heavy social and economic tolls inflicted by the widening lockdowns.\n\nEarlier this month, the Chinese government released a 20-point guideline to limit the disruption of zero-Covid rules on daily life and the economy. It shortened quarantine from 10 to eight days for close contacts of infected people and for inbound travelers. It also scrapped quarantine requirements for secondary contacts, discouraged unnecessary mass testing drives and removed a major restriction on international flights.\n\nThe announcement had raised hopes of a pivot toward reopening, triggering a rally of Chinese stocks. But a surge in infections as China heads into its fourth winter of the pandemic is quickly dampening such hopes. On Friday, the country reported a record 32,695 local cases, as infections for a second straight day surpassed the previous peak recorded in April during Shanghai’s months-long lockdown.\n\nHazmat-suited Covid workers help delivery drivers drop goods for residents under lockdown in Beijing on November 24. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nWhat reopening?\n\nInstead of relaxing controls, many local officials are reverting to the zero-tolerance playbook, attempting to stamp out infections as soon as they flare up.\n\nSome of the cities that dropped mass testing requirements following the announcement are already tightening other Covid restrictions.\n\nThe northern city of Shijiazhuang was among the first to cancel mass testing. It also allowed students to return to schools after a long period of online classes. But as cases rose over the weekend, authorities reimposed a lockdown on Monday, telling residents to stay home.\n\nVideo captures the harsh reality of China's zero-Covid strategy 03:28 - Source: CNN\n\nOn Tuesday, financial hub Shanghai banned anyone arriving in the city from entering venues including shopping malls, restaurants, supermarkets and gyms for five days. Authorities also shut down cultural and entertainment venues in half of the city.\n\nIn Guangzhou, officials this week extended the lockdown on Haizhu district – where the protest took place – for the fifth time, and locked down its most populous Baiyun district.\n\nZhengzhou, home to the Foxconn factory where workers clashed with police, imposed a five-day lockdown on its main urban districts.\n\nPeople ride bikes on an empty street near Beijing's central business district on November 24.

Schools across several districts also moved to online classes this week.\n\nLow vaccination rates among China’s elderly have led to fears that a loosening of restrictions could overwhelm the country’s health system. As of November 11, about two-thirds of people age 80 and older had received two doses, and only 40% had received a booster shot.\n\nYanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the re-tightening of Covid controls reflected a typical public policy dilemma in China: “If you relax the policy, there will be chaos; but if you tighten up, it will be stifling.”\n\nHuang said he does not expect any fundamental changes to the zero-Covid policy in the short term. “Because the local governments’ incentive structure has not been changed. They are still held accountable for the Covid situation in their jurisdiction,” he said.\n\nFor their part, Chinese officials have repeatedly denied that the 20 measures listed in the government guidelines were meant for a pivot to living with the virus.\n\nThe measures are about “optimizing” existing Covid prevention and control policy, Shen Hongbing, a disease control official, told a news conference last week. “They are not an easing (of control), let alone reopening or ‘lying flat’,” he said.\n\nBack on the outskirts of Beijing, Zhou said while the zero-Covid policy “is beneficial to the majority,” its implementation at a local level had been too draconian.\n\n“I don’t want things like this to happen again in China and anywhere in the world,” he said. “I lost my father. My son lost his beloved grandfather. I’m furious now.”", "authors": ["Selina Wang Nectar Gan", "Selina Wang", "Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/11/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/04/world/iran-internet-blackout-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "The US says it's helping Iranians navigate a massive internet ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs protesters took to the streets of Iran following the death in detention of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman apprehended for apparently not wearing her hijab properly, videos of the uprising began to flood the internet.\n\nClips of students tearing up pictures of Iran’s Supreme Leader in northern Iran.

The most severe crackdown was in 2019, during which more than 100 protesters were killed and the internet was cut off for 12 days, according to Amnesty International.\n\nActivists in Iran say that the primary purpose of the shutdowns is to disrupt communication among people organizing protests on the ground and stifle dissent.\n\n“They don’t want you to be able to communicate with your friends, with your family, with your colleagues, because simply if you’re going to basically create a group […] you’re going to be more effective in the way that you are doing protest,” Amir Rashidi, director of digital rights and security at human rights organization Miaan Group, told CNN.\n\nAs a result of these frequent blackouts, tech-savvy Iranians have learned increasingly to rely on more advanced tools like VPNs or Tor network as workarounds to stay connected. But even these are now being restricted by authorities and are therefore far from reliable. “I can hardly get in touch with my friends because we can’t always get connected to VPNs,” 22-year-old Ali, whose name CNN changed because he fears for his safety, told CNN via an encrypted ProtonMail conversation.\n\nA VPN, or virtual private network, encrypts the user’s traffic and connects it to a remote server, protecting the data and activity; Tor is an open-source network which allows anonymous web browsing; ProtonMail is an end-to-end encrypted email service.\n\n“This time they are not just limiting the internet,” Ali added. “They have removed WhatsApp and Instagram from local app stores, they have blocked our connection to Google Play store and App Store so we can’t download any VPN or social media apps […] they do this so protesters can’t connect to each other and can’t share news on social media, the high censorship starts from 4pm to 11:59pm, sometimes we have issues even for calling each other!”\n\nAnother user, 18-year-old Nima, whose name CNN changed because he fears for his safety, told CNN there were no messaging apps that work in Iran right now without using VPNs, “The government is blocking VPNs right now, one by one. Our accessibility is getting limited each day. We are hardly able to know about the protests and the victims in my country,” he said.\n\nIn comparison to the full shutdown in 2019, this blackout is more targeted and sophisticated, according to Alp Toker, director of international technology platform NetBlocks, which tracked three different methods – internet outages, mobile service disruptions, and the ban on Instagram and WhatsApp – that Iranian authorities have used to restrict online communications.\n\n“You have an environment that makes it very difficult for people to speak out to express discontent about the government in any form,” he told CNN.\n\nPeople light a fire during a protest over the death of Mahsa Amini in Tehran, Iran September 21, 2022. West Asia News Agency/Reuters\n\nHowever, the challenges Iranians face come not just from their own regime but from the international community as well, including governments and tech companies.\n\nThe Biden administration last month expanded its general license to Iran to “support the free flow of information” and authorize American tech companies to provide people inside the country access to certain tools that help them communicate with each other amid one of the worst internet shutdowns in history in Iran for breadth and scope. On Monday, President Biden said the US was making it easier for Iranians to access the internet, “including through facilitating greater access to secure, outside platforms and services.”\n\nWhile digital activists and Iranian digital natives welcome these moves, they fear they may not be enough to address the issues average Iranians face every day while attempting to connect to the internet.\n\n‘Better late than never’\n\nCNN has spoken with digital rights activists, tech experts and Iranian internet users who spoke out about the unintended consequences of US sanctions. Exemptions to tech sanctions were introduced in 2013 but failed to go far enough, activists say. The new exemptions weren’t introduced until September 23.\n\n“It has been almost 10 years that Iranians have had to wait for this update in the license. Better late than never, it has been a belated action by the US government. And so there has been a lot of harm done in the interim,” said Mahsa Alimardani, senior internet researcher at Article 19, a freedom of expression organization.\n\nUS sanctions unwittingly accelerated Iran’s development of an internal network, the National Information Network project, ironically making it cheaper and easier for Iran’s government to shut off the internet without disrupting government operations such as banks, financial systems and hospitals, Rashidi said.\n\nThese sanctions also pushed tech companies to over-comply or withdraw entirely from Iran, leaving Iranians with no alternative but to use government-controlled domestic servers at heightened personal risk in terms of safety, privacy and security, Rashidi added.\n\n“What US sanctions have done on one level is give the government basically an excuse to further nationalize and isolate Iran’s internet,” Alimardani said.\n\nIranian internet users who spoke to CNN shared the same frustration. “I gotta complain, why do tech companies […] restrict Iranian people? They are targeting directly people not the government,” said Ali, who says he’s posting on social media “to inform people about the different ways they can connect to the internet in this hard censorship because I believe it’s a human right.”\n\nNot only has the Iranian government blocked the Apple Store and Google Play – making it impossible for users to access tools that could circumvent the blackout – but activists in Iran say they are unable to upload their own apps for wider distribution.\n\nCNN approached Apple for a comment but had not received a statement by the time of publication.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Google said: “Google has allowed users in Iran to access free, publicly available services related to communications and/or sharing of informational materials. This includes products like Google Search, free consumer Gmail, Google Maps and YouTube. It is important to note that, although Google can decide to make these services available, we cannot ensure they are accessible within Iran.”\n\nWhen asked about the inability of Iranian app developers to upload their own apps to Google Play Store, Google said the new US sanction exemptions do “not extend to accepting or hosting Iranian-origin apps.”\n\nGoogle also recently announced it would make more of its tools available, including more VPNs and location sharing on Google apps, in the light of updated US sanctions.\n\n‘A new sadness, anger and despair’\n\nBut digital activists Alimardani and Rashidi call this “low-hanging fruit,” saying Google needs to do more. “Google Cloud Platform, Google App Engine, they have been very important in terms of internet infrastructure, helping Iranian technologists right now. So that really needs to be made available,” Alimardani said.\n\nSee why a woman is cutting her hair over her brother's coffin 03:09 - Source: CNN\n\nAsked why other Google services, such as Google Classroom, Google Analytics, Google Developers, Google chat, remain inaccessible, including many services accessible via the Google Play Store, the company replied: “Ongoing legal or technical barriers may block the provision of certain services, but we are exploring whether additional products might be made available.”\n\nAlimardani and Rashidi point favorably to GitHub, a popular code hosting platform for IT developers, which last year secured a license from the US government to offer its services in Iran.\n\nSignal, the encrypted messaging network, is also offering instructions to people in Iran and suggesting help for whoever is able to host a proxy server and direct download.\n\nCNN contacted the Iranian government for comment but received no reply at the time of publication.\n\nWhile more people inside Iran now rely on the Tor browser, which has seen a spike in users since the start of the protests, a sense of defiance is spreading among Iranian digital natives.\n\n“We suffered a lot from the Islamic Republic for many years. We were hurt in different ways,” said 30-year-old Reza, whose name CNN changed because he fears for his safety.\n\n“But the recent tragedy gave us a new sadness, anger and despair that we cannot stop thinking about it, and the way the Islamic Republic responded and the future of us and our loved ones.\n\n“If we don’t react and stand up against oppression, we are either a bad person or a stupid person.”", "authors": ["Katie Polglase Gianluca Mezzofiore Lauren Kent", "Katie Polglase", "Gianluca Mezzofiore", "Lauren Kent"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/02/china/china-covid-lockdown-protests-2022-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "title": "China Covid protests: How a deadly fire ignited a week of dissent ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nStunning scenes of dissent and defiance played out across China over the past week, marking the country’s largest protests in decades – and an unprecedented challenge to leader Xi Jinping.\n\nDeep public anger after nearly three years of snap lockdowns, border closures and financial hardship brought thousands out onto the streets to demand an end to mainland China’s zero-Covid policy – with some also calling for democracy.\n\nThe country’s security forces moved swiftly to snuff out the protests, while health officials tried to appease the public by promising to soften tough Covid measures. But furious posts on Chinese social media, which continued despite censors’ best efforts, suggested it wasn’t enough.\n\nThen came Friday, and the first known remarks from Xi on the protests – an unexpected acknowledgment of people’s frustration, according to a European Union official who declined to be named.\n\n“Xi also said Omicron is less deadly than Delta, which makes the Chinese government feel more open to further relaxing Covid restrictions,” the EU official added, raising hopes of greater freedoms after an extraordinary week.\n\nThe deadly fire\n\nOn November 24, Ali Abbas’ granddaughter was charging her tablet device when an electrical fault caused smoke to fill their Urumqi home, in China’s far western Xinjiang region, he told CNN on the phone from Turkey.\n\nSmoke quickly turned to flames, which raced through the wood-furnished apartment. Abbas’ granddaughter and daughter were able to evacuate – but residents on higher floors found themselves stranded after the elevator stopped working.\n\nSome households with previous Covid cases were also locked inside their apartments, leaving them with no way to escape. Urumqi has been under strict lockdown since August, with most residents banned from leaving their homes.\n\nThe fire broke out in Urumqi, Xinjiang, on November 24, according to Chinese authorities. Credit: Douyin\n\nVideos of the incident, taken from other buildings and on the street, suggest firefighters may have been delayed in reaching victims due to street-level lockdown restrictions. Footage shows one fire truck struggling to spray water at the building from a distance.\n\nState-run media reported the fire killed 10 people and injured nine, but reports from local residents suggest the real toll is far higher. A day after the blaze, Urumqi local government officials denied the city’s Covid policies were to blame for the deaths, adding that an investigation was underway.\n\nWhat happened to my neighbors is really a big disaster. I would like to express my sincere sorrow to all Uyghur people, to all those loved ones who lost their family members. Ali Abbas, apartment owner\n\nPublic anger quickly swelled. Videos online showed people marching to a government building in Urumqi on the night of November 25, demanding an end to the lockdown, chanting with fists in the air. Residents in other parts of the city broke through lockdown barriers and confronted Covid workers dressed in PPE; at one point, the crowd sang the national anthem, roaring the chorus: “Arise, arise, arise!”\n\nThe scenes were extraordinary in a city subject to some of China’s most stringent surveillance and security. The government has long been accused of committing human rights abuses against ethnic Uyghurs and other minorities in the region, including placing up to 2 million people in internment camps. Beijing has repeatedly denied these accusations, claiming the camps are vocational training centers.\n\nThe next morning, the Urumqi government said it would gradually ease the lockdown in certain areas. But by then, it was too late to quell the protests erupting across the nation.\n\nMounting frustrations\n\nThe protests tapped into a well of anger that had been brewing over China’s zero-Covid policy – and the damage it has often caused – as the rest of the world ended lockdown restrictions and eased other mandates, including masking.\n\nThe cost has been immense. Unemployment has skyrocketed. The economy is flailing. Those trapped in unexpected lockdowns have found themselves without adequate food, basic supplies, or even medical care in non-Covid emergencies.\n\nAnd, like those in the Urumqi fire, many deaths have been blamed on the zero-Covid policy in the last six months – far more than the six official Covid deaths reported during the same period. Demands for accountability are growing, especially after a September bus crash that killed 27 people while transporting residents to a Covid quarantine facility, and the November death of a toddler during a suspected gas leak in a locked-down residential compound.\n\nFrom left, a protest banner is seen on Sitong Bridge in Beijing on October 13, and Foxconn employees in Zhengzhou take buses home on October 30. Twitter/Getty Images\n\nThe policy had been broadly popular at the start of the pandemic, but many residents have now had enough. In a rare demonstration in October, a sole protester hung banners on a Beijing bridge that decried Covid restrictions and demanded Xi’s removal.\n\nThough all references to the banners were wiped from the Chinese internet, versions of those slogans began appearing in other parts of the country and in universities around the world – scrawled on bathroom walls and pinned on bulletin boards. More acts of disobedience came in November; workers fled China’s largest iPhone assembly factory in Zhengzhou when it was placed under lockdown, while residents of Guangzhou, also a manufacturing hub, tore down lockdown barriers and surged onto the streets in a nighttime revolt.\n\nFrom June to November 22, American think tank Freedom House recorded at least 79 protests against Covid restrictions, spanning from social media campaigns to gatherings on the street. But most of these voiced grievances against local authorities – a far cry from some of the nationwide protests that, for the first time in a generation, took aim at the country’s powerful leader and central government.\n\nAn unprecedented wave of protest\n\nProtesters gather in Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai on November 26.

Grief turned to anger as the crowd chanted slogans calling for freedom and political reform, while holding blank sheets of paper in a symbolic protest against censorship. In videos, people can be heard shouting for Xi and the Communist Party to “step down,” and singing a famous socialist anthem.\n\nAround 300 kilometers (186 miles) away, dozens of students in Nanjing gathered to mourn the victims, with photos showing a crowd of young people lit by cell phone flashlights. Images of the protests raced across social media faster than censors could erase them – igniting demonstrations in other university campuses, including the prestigious Peking University in Beijing. One wall at Peking University bore a message in red paint, echoing the slogans used by the protester who had hung the Beijing bridge banners in October: “Say no to lockdown, yes to freedom.”\n\nProtesters and students demonstrate outside Nanjing University, November 26.

In Shanghai, one protester told CNN around 80 to 110 people had been detained by police on the night of November 26, adding they were released 24 hours later after officers collected their fingerprints and retina patterns.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify the number of protesters detained and it is unclear how many people, if any, remain in custody.\n\nBeijing emerged as a protest hotspot on November 27, as hundreds of students gathered at the elite Tsinghua University, shouting: “Democracy and rule of law! Freedom of expression!” Elsewhere in the city, a large crowd gathered for a vigil and a march through the commercial center, chanting slogans for greater civil liberties.\n\nAmid the mourning and frustration, a strong sense of solidarity emerged as people shared the rare chance to stand side by side and voice grievances long silenced.\n\nIt turns out there are so many people who are wide awake Protester in Chengdu\n\nOnline, China’s vast army of censors worked overtime to erase content about the demonstrations – prompting many to get creative. Some posts on social media consisted only of one or two characters repeated for several paragraphs, in the long tradition of using codes and wordless icons to convey dissent on China’s internet.\n\nSimilar tactics were used on the ground, with videos on social media showing crowds shouting, “We want lockdowns, we want tests” after reportedly being told not to chant the opposite.\n\nProtesters in Shanghai hold up pieces of white paper to symbolize censorship, November 27.

In Shanghai, huge barricades were erected to prevent crowds from congregating on sidewalks, while police officers checked passengers’ cell phones on the street and on subway trains, according to eyewitnesses and videos on social media.\n\nIn a veiled warning, the Communist Party’s domestic security committee vowed to “strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces, as well as criminal activities that destabilize social order,” according to state media.\n\nOthers in Beijing described receiving phone calls from authorities asking about their participation. One protester told CNN they received a call on Wednesday from a police officer, who revealed that their cell phone signal had been detected near a protest site three days before.\n\nAccording to a recording of the phone conversation heard by CNN, the protester denied being near the site that night – to which the officer asked, “Then why did your cell phone number show up there?”\n\nPolice form a cordon during a protest in Beijing on November 27. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nAt the same time as the crackdown, health officials tried to appease the public, acknowledging in a news conference on Tuesday that some Covid control measures had been implemented “excessively.” Authorities were adjusting measures to “limit the impact on people as much as possible,” they said, reiterating similar recent statements.\n\nThe promises failed to soothe some listeners who seethed in comments on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter, where the conference was livestreamed. “You’ve lost all credibility,” one said. Another wrote: “We’ve cooperated with you for three years. Now, it’s time to give our freedom back.”\n\nThe following day, a top official gave the clearest indication yet that the country was considering a new direction.\n\n“With the decreasing toxicity of the Omicron variant, the increasing vaccination rate and the accumulating experience of outbreak control and prevention, China’s pandemic containment faces (a) new stage and mission,” said Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, who oversees the country’s Covid response, according to state media.\n\nSeveral cities moved quickly to loosen restrictions. On Friday, Beijing’s municipal government reversed rules set just 10 days ago that required residents to show a negative Covid-19 test taken in the previous 48 hours to board public transport in the capital city.\n\nTianjin and Chengdu also scrapped requirements for commuters to present a negative test result, effective immediately, according to notices from both cities’ metro operators on Friday.\n\nIn Chongqing and Guangzhou, close contacts of positive cases can quarantine at home instead of at a government facility. Several lockdowns were also lifted, including in Zhengzhou and in Guangzhou.\n\nWhile these measures are expected to bring some relief, authorities have repeatedly voiced concerns that vaccination rates aren’t high enough to fully open up without risking spikes in Covid deaths.\n\nChina recorded 34,772 new Covid cases on Thursday, then 32,827 on Friday, continuing a downward trend in daily infections from record highs on November 27.\n\nAs of Friday, thousands of buildings and residential communities across China remain under lockdown restrictions due to their classification as “high risk.”\n\n\n\nIt’s not opening up, don’t misinterpret this Comment on Weibo\n\nOne user on Weibo urged authorities to further relax rules “so people can live a normal life,” warning that strict Covid measures could push some too far.\n\n“If they don’t open up soon, people will really go crazy,” one comment read.\n\nAnother wrote: “The pressure is too great.”", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Carlotta Dotto Henrik Pettersson", "Jessie Yeung", "Carlotta Dotto", "Henrik Pettersson"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/22/health/kids-activism-parenting-wellness/index.html", "title": "Yes, your kid can change the world.

Climate change, racism, discrimination, poverty and gun violence are affecting their daily lives, giving them plenty to be upset about it and often inspiring them to fight for change. Role models such as Greta Thunberg and Malala Yousafzai prove that sometimes when kids take action, adults listen.\n\nAspiring Thunbergs and Yousafzais tend to be drawn to online activism and social media, the destination for many young people curious about causes and eager to express themselves. It can be a great way to spark interest, but it’s not always the best way to effect real change. For that to happen, kids need to understand the power of quieter, slower and historically effective approaches to activism, says Gal Beckerman – those that tend to take place off of social media.\n\nGal Beckerman Rozette Rago\n\nIn his new book, “The Quiet Before: On the Unexpected Origins of Radical Ideals,” Beckerman examines social movements throughout history, chronicling how effective revolutions tend to start with intimate conversation and deliberation about issues, not shouting in the streets or, today’s version, online. His lessons are relevant to young activists, including the many who are fired up by Earth Day to heal and protect our planet.\n\nCNN spoke with Beckerman, a father of two, about why children need to understand the quiet and slow side of activism. He explains why dinnertime or drive-time talk, or conversations in small groups, are so important in helping kids understand the complexity of issues and perfect the art of speaking and listening. He also talks about why a visit to a soup kitchen or a day spent registering voters will teach them more about changing the world than TikTok.\n\nThis conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nCNN: Your kid reads or hears about a cause at school and is excited about it. What could a parent encourage them to do next?\n\nGal Beckerman: It’s wonderful when kids gain an interest in a cause that impassions them and gets them excited, and if that comes from social media or something they are seeing online, that’s great. The role of a parent can be to help them figure out what to do with it.\n\nI suggest that parents direct kids toward local activism connected to whatever cause they care about, places where they will feel that their growing sense of commitment to a cause can be attached to concrete action. This could be volunteering at a soup kitchen or helping plan a protest.\n\nCNN: What could we say to them about their online activism?\n\nBeckerman: It’s important for parents to make a distinction between expressing solidarity with causes you believe in and doing something to effect change. You don’t want kids to think that all they have to do is post a hashtag of something they agree with or post a picture at a protest to be an effective activist.\n\nSwedish activist Greta Thunberg urges action to combat the climate crisis in April 2019 in Rome. Antonio Masiello/Getty Images\n\nIt doesn’t take much dedication to commit to climate change or ending racism on social media, compared with the hard work of committing to doing something about it in real life. Help them think: “What is the goal? What is my goal? And what am I doing to achieve the goal?” It’s OK if their goal is small.\n\nParents also need to manage the expectations of kids who might not understand that real change is slow. To go on a Saturday to work at a soup kitchen or register people to vote might feel like a small boring activity. It is the parents’ role to connect that to the bigger, more exciting things they see on TikTok.\n\nCNN: Effective activism can be boring, right?\n\nBeckerman: It’s important for kids to understand this because it is often out of the hard work of bringing a cause to life, walking the street to collect signatures, organizing community forums, contacting local politicians again and again, that your sense of commitment and solidarity grows. If something is easy, it is often forgettable.\n\nA problem like climate change demands fresh thinking as well as careful and sometimes painstaking work. We do our kids a disservice by not teaching them this.\n\nCNN: Your book demonstrates the value of cultivating activism in intimate places – as opposed to in public or on social media.\n\nBeckerman: It’s helpful to be able to gather with a small group of people, in person or online, and share ideas and not worry about being shamed for something you proposed. You need a space where you can do more than just exclaim how you feel but where you can also have a conversation about it and build on one another’s ideas. This lets you take a step back and see which tools exist and figure out which ones are the right ones to pick up.\n\nYoungsters hold up placards during a 2019 climate change protest at Parliament Square in London. Angeles Rodenas/SOPA Images/Sipa USA/AP\n\nFor older kids and teens, apps like Signal, private groups on Facebook, or email chains can create this intimacy online. In these quiet spaces, the concern is not about going viral but to keep the conversations going.\n\nTo be clear, it can’t just be quiet. There is a role to play for protesting and all the passion that comes along with chanting a slogan in the streets. But what kids do need to understand is that this isn’t enough. They need space to dream and argue and whittle that passion into a sharper point.\n\nCNN: Can you give me an example from history of a time when slow, persistent activism paid off?\n\nBeckerman: Most social movements in history were slow builds, if only because the tools we have today that allow us to mobilize so quickly and with such numbers didn’t exist.\n\nBut to take a concrete example, you can look at Chartism, a movement that began in England in the 1830s. Working-class people at the time did not have the right to vote, so they came up with the idea of petitioning Parliament for that right. It was a long struggle, and instead of social media they had the pen-and-paper petition, which they took around the country, starting up conversations and trying to convince people to sign. That first petition, delivered to Parliament in 1839, had 1.3 million petitions and was on a scroll that stretched 3 miles long. They failed in that first effort, but the petitions kept coming, each one widening their constituency, until three decades later they finally won political representation.\n\nCNN: When has making big statements online not brought about much change?\n\nBeckerman: The Arab Spring is a great example of this. It’s not so much that the expressions of outrage that started on social media didn’t bring change – in Egypt it got hundreds of thousands of people to (Cairo’s) Tahrir Square, where their physical presence brought down a dictator. The problem was the day after, when those activists in the square then needed to transform themselves into a political opposition with a clear ideology and set of goals and a method for working together. Social media didn’t provide them the tools they needed to do this building. Instead, it undermined them by making them think the only kind of activism that mattered was loud and attention-grabbing. As a result, they were never able to pose a real challenge to the more entrenched forces in the country.\n\nCNN: In your book, you refer to philosopher Hannah Arendt talking about the importance of a physical table to “draw individuals into deliberation, their faces turned toward one another.” Can that start with the family table?\n\nBeckerman: One of the positive sides to Covid for my family is that we have dinner together every night. Our kids come to us and bring us whatever they experienced that day, and we talk about it.\n\nSometimes they talk about feeling upset by the homeless people they see on their way home. We ask them: “Why do you think that is? What do you think led them to that situation?” We also help them think about the challenges the city faces in dealing with the situation.\n\nThe dinner table becomes this space where we can talk over these things, and more importantly, it is a place where they can practice having a conversation. Not just about homelessness but about anything. There is a skill and art to the kind of exchanges that happen around the table, which is different from the exclamations or declarations they will hear online. They are learning to listen, to go back and forth, to take somebody’s ideas and improve on them. This is all great for a kid to practice under the safety net of their family.", "authors": ["Elissa Strauss"], "publish_date": "2022/04/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/17/entertainment/little-mermaid-racist-backlash-halle-bailey-disney-cec/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Why racist 'The Little Mermaid' arguments don't hold up ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nEver since Disney released the first look for its 2023 live-action remake of “The Little Mermaid,” the internet has been sodden with wave after wave of racist critics complaining that Ariel, the completely fictional underwater fish woman, shouldn’t be Black. Hashtags like #notmyariel are bouncing around social media, and YouTube hid the dislike counter on the official video after it was bombarded with racist comments and more than 1.5 million “dislikes.” One group of critics went as far as to share a digitally altered version of the teaser that featured a White woman in place of the movie’s star Halle Bailey, who they called a “woke actress.”\n\nBy now, we know it’s not unusual to see racist responses whenever a person of color is cast in a role considered “traditionally” White. While there are plenty of legitimate reasons to dislike a movie, these critics often hide their discomfort behind other thin arguments, claiming historical or cultural accuracy or, of all things, science.\n\nHere are some real arguments people have levied to protest the casting choice. The facts prove they just don’t hold water.\n\nClaim: ‘The Little Mermaid’ is a Danish story, therefore Ariel should be White\n\nThe original “Little Mermaid” story was written by Hans Christian Andersen and first published in 1837. If we’re going to dignify this argument, according to the text, Ariel and the rest of her mermaid kin are from “far out in the ocean” (literally the opening lines of the story) at the “bottom of the sea.” So, not Denmark or anywhere near it.\n\nIf critics are truly worried about staying faithful to the original story, we shouldn’t gloss over the original ending where the mermaid is instructed to kill her prince, but throws the knife away in despair and dissolves into sea foam instead. Not to mention, while the 1989 Disney version has a Prince Eric with bright blue peepers, Anderson specifically described the prince as having “coal-black eyes” and “raven hair.” (Also “The Little Mermaid,” who doesn’t even have a name in the original story, isn’t real.)\n\nClaim: Mermaids live under the sea and therefore would not have dark skin\n\nCould be a mermaid, who knows. @adopamanatee\n\n“From a scientific perspective, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to have someone with darker skin who lives deep in the ocean.” So says far-right pundit Matt Walsh, who opined about the “Little Mermaid” casting on “The Matt Walsh Show.” He claims he framed the comment as a joke, since he goes on to say that “​​not only should the Little Mermaid be pale, she should, actually, be translucent.” However, the context of his comment is still racially charged, and he still implies pale skin is closer to a “scientific” mermaid than dark skin.\n\nAgain, if we’re going to take an academic look at these unnecessary bits of discourse, not all abyssal creatures are pale. Not all underwater creatures are pale. Also, since mermaids also get close enough to the surface to see other humans, if you want to look at it scientifically, mermaids would probably have a specific type of pigmentation that allowed for both a deep sea and shallow water existence. We also know that, centuries ago, seafarers often mistook one particular animal for a mermaid: the manatee, which is not pale. (Also “The Little Mermaid” isn’t real.)\n\nClaim: Mermaids are a European mythological figure and therefore Ariel should be White\n\nNumerous Twitter scraps have cropped up with people trying to argue European folklore, or even Homerian epics like “The Odyssey,” have some sort of monopoly on the idea of mermaids. In reality, it’s fascinating to see how many different cultures throughout history have arrived at parallel folklorical themes. Humanoid creatures that dwell in the water are part of innumerable mythologies around the world.\n\nEast Asian and Oceanic folklore is replete with stories of underwater kingdoms and merpeople both good and evil, from the Magindara in some Philippine regions to the tale of the Indian Princess Suriratna or Hwang-ok that reached South Korea. Middle Eastern folktales compiled in the classic “Arabian Nights” collection, which dates back more than a thousand years, feature several accounts of sea-dwelling human creatures. In parts of continental Africa and among the African diaspora, folklore describing water spirits, oftentimes in the shape of beautiful women, are common. According to Shona mythology in Zimbabwe, the “njuzu” are mermaids who occupy lakes or rivers.\n\n(Also, not all Europeans are White. Also, “The Little Mermaid” isn’t real.)\n\nClaim: Making Ariel Black is ruining childhoods and changing the character\n\nOn message boards and comment sections across the internet, people are debating whether a new, dark-skinned Ariel somehow negates or erases the classic 1989 version.\n\nDisney’s 1989 “The Little Mermaid” is still available to watch, own and share. The animated character of Ariel is part of Disney’s wildly profitable “Disney Princess” franchise and her name and image are valuable and heavily trademarked Disney properties. The red-haired, fair-skinned Ariel is here to stay.\n\nFar from ruining childhoods, many fans think making a different iteration of Ariel will only increase the Disney magic. Just look at the sweet reactions of young Black children and the praise of Disney icons like Jodi Benson, the voice of the original Ariel.\n\nVideos of young Black girls reacting to 'Little Mermaid' trailer go viral 01:07 - Source: CNN\n\nMore importantly, the remake of one film doesn’t erase the existence of the previous films: 1999’s Mr. Darcy and 2005’s Mr. Darcy live in harmony with every other character from the roughly 300 “Pride and Prejudice” film remakes. Pennywise looks different in every “It” iteration, as does Frankenstein’s monster. The story of “Cinderella,” which predates even the famous Brothers Grimm version, seems to have a different remake out every year. One notable version, 1997’s “Rodgers & Hammerstein’s Cinderella,” featured a racially diverse cast that included singer Brandy as the first Black Cinderella and Whitney Houston as the fairy godmother. It aired on TV as part of the “Wonderful World of Disney.”\n\nWhile Disney has produced a very famous iteration of “The Little Mermaid,” it isn’t the first, only, or universally definitive work. No one owns the concept of mermaids or what they look like. A White, red-haired animated teenager is not the only version of “The Little Mermaid” to exist.\n\nAlso – and this is very important – “The Little Mermaid” isn’t real.", "authors": ["Aj Willingham"], "publish_date": "2022/09/17"}]}

White, 66, and Sajak have hosted since the show debuted in syndication in 1983. She’s unveiled the letters in four- to five-inch heels, which she told me in 2019 weren’t a problem, and wearing gorgeous formalwear that couldn’t hinder her ability to reach the top row to spin letters.\n\nWhat’s most important when considering job applicants? Experience. White has 40 seasons as co-host under her belt. Who could possibly be more qualified? She’s also filled in for Sajak over the years, once when he lost his voice and most recently when he underwent emergency surgery in 2019.\n\nSajak has set a Guinness World Record for the longest career of a host for a single game show. Who better to usher viewers through such a transition than White? I imagine it would provide the same type of comfort as \"Jeopardy!\" legend Ken Jennings hosting the quiz show (a gig he shares with Mayim Bialik). With a show as beloved as \"Wheel,\" so ingrained in its viewers lives, you need a replacement who respects the institution and will handle the responsibility with care.\n\nPat Sajak is retiring:Look back at quotes from the 'Wheel of Fortune' host\n\nAnother benefit to White is that she is 10 years Sajak’s junior, so she could be in it for the longish haul. White is also warm and funny when she and Sajak interact in post-game chatter.\n\nThere is one hitch, though. When I spoke with White in 2019, she was quite territorial over her spot. “I can’t imagine anybody else on my puzzle board,” she said with a laugh. “That’s a scary thought. It’s mine!”\n\nLongest running hosts:Is 'Wheel of Fortune' host Pat Sajak's record unbreakable? These game show hosts are closest.\n\nSo who would replace White? And would she give her blessing? One option is Sajak’s daughter, Maggie, the show’s social correspondent since 2021. She briefly took over White’s duties in May when White competed on \"Celebrity Wheel of Fortune.\" Why not let two women host? It’s worked for the “Today” show.\n\n“Wheel” fans on Twitter have also voiced their wish for White to get the gig. So what do you say, producers? Make a choice that's likely to satisfy the masses.

Bill money, in order to avoid having to follow any federal regulations.\n\nAmong other federal rules, the school does not follow Title IX guidelines, which prevent discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation.

I can’t even describe the feelings in my stomach right now. It’s everything you can imagine.”\n\nA closer look at Game 5:\n\nHow the Golden Knights beat the Panthers in Game 5\n\nThe Panthers' power play had struggled throughout the Final and it put them behind in Game 5.\n\nVegas goalie Adin Hill stopped Aleksander Barkov in close and soon after, Stone took advantage of a turnover to start a 2-on-1 break with Chandler Stephenson. With the pass taken away, he made a slick move in front of the net and shot the puck past Panthers goalie Sergei Bobrovsky for a short-handed goal.\n\nThe Golden Knights took advantage of another odd-man break less than two minutes later, and defenseman Nicolas Hague finished it off by firing a loose puck into the net.\n\nIn the second period, Florida defenseman Aaron Ekblad cut the deficit to 2-1 with a shot through a screen, then Vegas took over again.\n\nDefenseman Alec Martinez put Vegas back up by two goals nine years after he had scored the Cup-clinching goal for the Los Angeles Kings in the 2014 Final.\n\nShea Theodore and William Karlsson set up fellow original Golden Knight Reilly Smith to make it 4-1 before Stone made it 5-1 on a one-timer. Michael Amadio finished up the dominant period, putting his own rebound past Bobrovsky with 1.2 seconds left.\n\nVegas' Ivan Barbashev made it 7-1 in the third period before Florida's Sam Reinhart and Sam Bennett scored. Stone's third goal was scored into an empty net at 14:06 and Nicolas Roy scored the final goal with just over a minute to play.\n\nAdin Hill shines for Golden Knights\n\nEven though the game was a rout, Hill had to come up with big saves. He stopped Anton Lundell early, made the save on Barkov and robbed Anthony Duclair with a glove save in the third period.\n\nHill was one of five goalies that the Golden Knights used during the regular season. He entered play after Laurent Brossoit was injured in the second round and went 11-4 the rest of the playoffs.\n\nJonathan Marchessault wins Conn Smythe Trophy\n\nMarchessault, who was left unprotected by the Panthers in the expansion draft, won the award for playoff MVP. He finished with 13 goals, tied for the playoff lead, and 25 points, which was second overall.\n\n“He went on a heck of a run,” said Eichel, who led playoff scoring in his first postseason appearance. \"So deserving of the Conn Smythe. I’m so happy for him. He’s been here since the beginning.”\n\nStone, as is tradition for the team captain, got to lift the Stanley Cup first. He handed off to Smith and the remaining original members of the Golden Knights got their turn.\n\nCoach Bruce Cassidy also put out five of the six original players in the starting lineup.\n\nGolden Knights franchise's path to the Stanley Cup\n\nThe Golden Knights' run to the Stanley Cup Final in their first season in 2017-18 pushed them to be aggressive. They traded for Stone in 2019, signed Alex Pietrangelo in 2020 and traded for Jack Eichel in 2021. Last season, cap woes and injuries caused the team to miss the playoffs for the first time, leading to the firing of Peter DeBoer and hiring of coach Bruce Cassidy. Hill was acquired to be a backup goalie in 2022.\n\nThey overcame major injuries this season (Stone, multiple goaltenders) and added physical forward Barbashev at the deadline, clinching the West's best record. With Stone back for the playoffs, Eichel healthy and original Golden Knights players (Marchessault, Karlsson, Theodore, Smith, etc.) producing, Vegas got past Winnipeg, Edmonton, Dallas and Florida to win it all.\n\nThe previous quickest expansion team to win a Cup after the Original Six era was the 1973-74 Philadelphia Flyers in their seventh season. The Edmonton Oilers, who arrived in a merger with the World Hockey Association, won in their fifth season.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk unable to play in Game 5\n\nTkachuk, the Panthers' leading scorer, wasn't able to dress for the game because of a broken sternum. He absorbed a big hit in Game 3 and returned to score the tying goal of Florida's overtime win. But he was limited to four shifts in the third period of Game 4. Russian winger Grigori Denisenko made his playoff debut on the fourth line.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/06/14/trump-whales-i95-russia-ukraine-stanley-cup/70320385007/", "title": "I-95 collapse, Trump arraignment, Stanley Cup Final, gas stove ban ...", "text": "Current damage is estimated to leave the Philadelphia section of I-95 unusable for months.

Sunday's fire, which ignited when a tractor-trailer hauling gasoline flipped on an I-95 off-ramp under the overpass, is estimated to have burned as hot as 2,000 °F, leading to the collapse. While a state disaster declaration helps start rebuilding, experts say it will take months to fix the interstate, which still has to be fully inspected in order to find out the extent of the damage.

While en route to the Miami courtroom, Trump used his social media megaphone to cast the indictment as an act of political persecution before his lawyer entered a not guilty plea before the judge. The former president then returned to his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey and told supporters that Tuesday was \"a day of infamy\" for America. In his speech, Trump made clear that he will make the charges a central part of his 2024 campaign, claiming without evidence that Democrats are targeting him via the legal system.

Goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy wasn't as dominant.\n\nNow, they appear to be heading in the right direction, winning seven of their final nine games, routing first-round opponent Toronto and ending the Florida Panthers' 13-game winning streak.

The Maple Leafs traded him after his second suspension. Kadri is an unrestricted free agent and has a career high in assists and points. A suspension-free, productive postseason could lead to an even bigger payday. Expect him to play with an edge but not cross it. He has missed a few practices because of an illness and is a game-time decision.\n\nCalgary Flames\n\nIs this Johnny Gaudreau's last season in Calgary?\n\nThe Flames and Gaudreau's camp have said little publicly, but general manager Brad Treliving told Hockey Night in Canada After Hours in April that he would \"move heaven and earth\" to bring back the unrestricted free agent, who recorded a career-best 115 points this season. Gaudreau is from the Philadelphia area, but the Flyers are rebuilding. Calgary will give him a better chance at a Cup. The Flames also have to re-sign restricted free agents Matthew Tkachuk, Andrew Mangiapane and Oliver Kylington.\n\nMinnesota Wild\n\nHow will they split their goaltending?\n\nThe Wild can't go wrong with newcomer Marc-Andre Fleury or Cam Talbot. But they didn't acquire Fleury, a three-time Stanley Cup champion, to be a backup. He started four of five games down the stretch. Last year, Fleury started 16 of 19 playoff games for the Vegas Golden Knights, but he's 37, so a more even split could happen. Coach Dean Evason isn't announcing his Game 1 starter. \"We're excited about the opportunity to have both guys available if we need it, and we probably will,\" he said.\n\nSt. Louis Blues\n\nIs this team better than the 2019 champions?\n\nYes, that team had one 70-point scorer and three 50-point scorers. This one has four and eight, respectively. Robert Thomas, Jordan Kyrou and Ivan Barbashev have bigger roles. Offseason acquisitions Pavel Buchnevich and Brandon Saad are thriving. Defensemen Alex Pietrangelo and Jay Bouwmeester are gone, but Torey Krug, Faulk and Nick Leddy are playing well. The big difference is 2019 goalie Jordan Binnington has been up and down this season, but Ville Husso has been solid. Husso will get the Game 1 start.\n\nEdmonton Oilers\n\nCan they make up for last season's playoff disaster?\n\nConnor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl were shut out in the first two games of the Winnipeg Jets' eventual first-round sweep. The Oilers have added Zach Hyman (27 goals) and Evander Kane (22 goals in 43 games), meaning the team doesn't have to put its superstars on the same line. The coaching change helped. Jay Woodcroft is 26-9-3 since replacing Dave Tippett. The last three Finals have featured a team that made a midseason coaching change.\n\nLos Angeles Kings\n\nCan they send Dustin Brown out a winner?\n\nBrown, an 18-year veteran, will retire after the playoffs. Will the Kings win another Stanley Cup? Probably not, even though there's a good mix of youngsters and veterans. But Brown will retire a winner. He had an impressive career that includes leading the Kings in career regular-season games and serving as captain from 2008-09 to 2015-16, including the team's two Cup wins. His number will be retired eventually.\n\nNashville Predators\n\nHas Juuse Saros played too many games?\n\nSaros played 67 games this season, picking up 38 wins. But he recorded 13 sub.-900 games in his last 29 games. He didn't play the last two regular-season games because he limped off the ice in the third period on April 26. Predators coach John Hynes told reporters on Monday that Saros would miss the first two games. David Rittich will start Game 1.\n\nDallas Stars\n\nDo the Stars have another surprise run in them?\n\nThe Stars reached the Final in the 2020 bubble and they're facing the Flames again in the first round. But another run seems unlikely this time. They're essentially a one-line team (a very impressive line) and Calgary is much better this year. Goalie Jake Oettinger might be able to steal a game or two, but a first-round exit is likely.\n\nEASTERN CONFERENCE\n\nFlorida Panthers\n\nWill Claude Giroux win his first Stanley Cup?\n\nThe former Flyers captain made a solid choice on where to go when waiving his no-trade clause, picking up 23 points in 18 games. The Panthers have been aggressive in remaking their forward lines since the 2021 trade deadline. With injured defenseman Aaron Ekblad expected back, they're one of the top contenders.\n\nCarolina Hurricanes\n\nWhat's their goalie situation?\n\nFrederik Andersen and Antti Raanta won the Jennings Trophy for fewest team goals allowed, but Andersen is injured and won't play in Game 1. Raanta started and won Thursday after leaving early with \"a little tweak.\" Pyotr Kochetkov has three wins in three games. Raanta got the Game 1 start.\n\nToronto Maple Leafs\n\nCan they finally get past the first round?\n\nThey haven't done that since 2004 and have to face the Lightning, who routed them 8-1. Though the Maple Leafs were unable to upgrade their goaltending at the trade deadline, they added defensemen Mark Giordano and Ilya Lyubushkin. Plus, Auston Matthews scored 60 goals. He had three goals and seven points in three games against the Lightning.\n\nNew York Rangers\n\nDo they have enough playoff experience?\n\nNew York has a lot of younger players, but it brought in playoff veterans. Barclay Goodrow won two Cups. Coach Gerard Gallant went to the 2018 Final with Vegas, and Ryan Reaves was on that team. Justin Braun went to the 2016 Final and Andrew Copp went to a conference final. They join Chris Kreider, the last Ranger left from the 2014 Final team.\n\nBoston Bruins\n\nWill the power play get back on track?\n\nThe Bruins had no power-play goals in 12 games before scoring three in their final two games. Forward David Pastrnak and defenseman Hampus Lindholm were injured for a big chunk of that time, so their return should help. Hurting their cause: The Hurricanes have the top penalty kill in the league.\n\nPittsburgh Penguins\n\nIs this the last of the Big Three?\n\nSidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang won the Stanley Cup in 2009, 2016 and 2017. Malkin and Letang are unrestricted free agents this summer. It's possible one won't be back, especially with the Penguins also needing to re-sign Bryan Rust. The Penguins, meanwhile, will enter the playoffs without No. 1 goalie Tristan Jarry for at least a couple games, coach Mike Sullivan said.\n\nWashington Capitals\n\nHow effective will Alex Ovechkin be?\n\nHe missed the final three games with an upper-body injury after tripping and slamming into the boards. He has been practicing and has never missed a playoff game. Asked Sunday whether he would play in Game 1, he said, \"We'll see.\" But he added that he could have played last week had it been the playoffs. Coach Peter Laviolette said Monday that everything \"is moving in the right direction\" for Ovechkin. Tuesday, Laviolette said that the team captain would play. The team went 1-4 without him in the lineup this season.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2018/04/07/bruins-beat-senators-to-preserve-chances-for-easts-top-spot/33650857/", "title": "Bruins beat Senators to preserve chances for East's top spot", "text": "AP\n\nBOSTON (AP) — David Pastrnak and Tommy Wingels scored 51 seconds apart in the second period, and Boston beat the Ottawa Senators 5-2 on Saturday night, preserving the Bruins' chances for the No. 1 playoff seed in the Eastern Conference.\n\nDanton Heinen also scored for Boston, which added late goals by Noel Acciari and David Backes in the final two minutes to put away the Senators and complete the season sweep.\n\nAnton Khudobin stopped 26 shots for the Bruins, who host Florida on Sunday night in a game postponed by a winter storm Jan. 4.

(AP) — Elias Lindholm scored 49 seconds into overtime, and Carolina prevented Tampa Bay from clinching the top spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\nJustin Williams had a goal and an assist, Jordan Staal scored a deflected goal and Phil Di Giuseppe had two assists for the Hurricanes. They had lost three straight and four of five down the stretch during their ninth straight season without making the playoffs — tied for the third-longest such drought in NHL history.\n\nOndrej Palat scored the tying goal with 8:49 left and Ryan Callahan also scored for Tampa Bay.

What drove him. What inspired him. The biggest titles from his sport’s biggest stages were Djokovic’s main aim and now he finally stands alone — ahead of Rafael Nadal, ahead of Roger Federer, ahead of every man who ever has swung a racket.\n\nIf Djokovic could wait this long to hold this record, he certainly could wait for the half-hour or so it took to straighten out his strokes in the French Open final. And so, after a bit of a shaky start in thick, humid air and under foreboding clouds Sunday, he imposed himself. The opponent at Court Philippe Chatrier, Casper Ruud, never really stood a serious chance after that.\n\nDjokovic earned his men’s-record 23rd Grand Slam singles championship, breaking a tie with Nadal and moving three in front of the retired Federer, with a 7-6 (1), 6-3, 7-5 victory over Ruud that was not in doubt for most of its 3 hours, 13 minutes.\n\nDjokovic puts this one alongside the French Open titles he earned in 2016 and 2021, making him the only man with at least three from each major. He won his very first at the 2008 Australian Open and now possesses a total of 10 trophies from there, seven from Wimbledon and three from the U.S. Open.\n\n“I knew that going into the tournament, going into the match, especially, today, that there is history on the line, but I try to focus my attention and my thoughts into preparing for this match in the best way possible to win, like any other match,” Djokovic said, wearing a red jacket with “23” stitched on the chest. “Of course I would lie if I say that I didn’t think about the finish line that is right there and that one more match is needed to win a trophy — a historic one.”\n\nAlso worth noting: He again is halfway to a calendar-year Grand Slam — winning all four majors in one season — something no man has achieved since Rod Laver in 1969. Djokovic came close in 2021, when he won the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon and made it all the way to the title match at the U.S. Open before losing to Daniil Medvedev.\n\nDjokovic will resume that pursuit at Wimbledon, which begins on the grass of the All England Club on July 3.\n\n“He has this software in his head that he can switch (on) when a Grand Slam comes,” said his coach, Goran Ivanisevic. “The day we arrived here, he was better, he was more motivated, he was more hungry. Every day, he played better and better.”\n\nEntering the 2011 season, this is how the Slam count looked: 16 for Federer, nine for Nadal, one for Djokovic.\n\n“Pretty decent 12 years, I must say, for me,” Djokovic said with a smile.\n\nThe climb began with a trio that year and accelerated lately: He has clutched the trophy at 11 of the last 20 Slams, a remarkable run made even more so when considering that he did not participate in two majors during that span because he did not get vaccinated against COVID-19. Djokovic was deported in January 2021 before the Australian Open, and he was not allowed to fly to the United States ahead of last year’s U.S. Open under a rule that since has been lifted.\n\nGetting to 23 not only sets the mark for men, but it also lets Djokovic equal Serena Williams, who wrapped up her career last year, for the most by anyone in the Open era, which began in 1968. Margaret Court won some of her all-time record of 24 Slam trophies in the amateur era.\n\nAt 20 days past his 36th birthday, the Serb is the oldest singles champion at Roland Garros, considered the most grueling of the majors because of the lengthy, grinding points required by the red clay, which is slower than the grass or hard courts underfoot elsewhere.\n\nNadal’s 22nd major arrived in Paris a year ago, two days after he turned 36. He has been sidelined since January by a hip injury and had arthroscopic surgery on June 2.\n\n“Many congrats on this amazing achievement,” Nadal tweeted shortly after the final concluded. “23 is a number that just a few years back was (impossible) to think about, and you made it!”\n\nDjokovic’s triumph on Sunday means he will return to No. 1 in the ATP rankings on Monday, replacing Carlos Alcaraz. Djokovic already has spent more weeks at the top spot than any player — man or woman — since the inception of computerized tennis rankings a half-century ago.\n\nIt was Djokovic who eliminated Alcaraz in the semifinals on Thursday, wearing him down over two thrilling sets until the 20-year-old Spaniard’s body cramped up badly. Alcaraz continued to play, but the scores of the last two sets of the four-set match told the story: 6-1, 6-1.\n\nThis was the third Slam final in the past five events for Ruud, a 24-year-old from Norway, but he is now 0-3. He lost to Nadal at the French Open a year ago and to Alcaraz at the U.S. Open last September.\n\nPerhaps due to an awareness of all that was at stake, Djokovic, in his 34th major final, was the one who got off to a shaky start.\n\n“Maybe feeling a bit nervous, little stressed,” Ruud said about his opponent.\n\nBut by the close of the first set, Djokovic was downright Djokovic-esque, as he was while taking 12 of the last 13 points of the match, most accompanied by spectators' thunderous chants of his two-syllable nickname, “No-le! No-le! No-le!”\n\nWhen one last miscue from Ruud landed out, Djokovic dropped onto his back with limbs spread wide.\n\n“He kind of pressures you, in a way, to go for more risks, and that’s tough,” Ruud said. “He just stepped up, like he knows how to do.”\n\nAt first, though, Djokovic kept missing forehands — into the net, wide, long — then made a different sort of mistake, shanking an overhead from near the net way beyond the opposite baseline to get broken and trail 2-0.\n\nFor whatever reason, that shot always has been Djokovic’s “bête noire,” and he missed another overhead later in the set.\n\nSoon, Ruud led 4-1, thanks in part to Djokovic’s troubles. By then, Djokovic accumulated 13 unforced errors, while Ruud made just four.\n\nAnd then everything changed.\n\nAfter finishing the first set with 18 unforced errors, Djokovic recalibrated himself, with merely 14 over the last two sets combined.\n\nThen it was Ruud’s turn to flub an overhead, rocking back and depositing his into the net to end a 29-stroke point. Djokovic's first service break made it 4-3, and he shook his right fist.\n\n“A bit devastating,” Ruud called it.\n\nThey went to a tiebreaker, truly Djokovic’s dominion. When the import rises, along with the tension, he simply excels.\n\n“He sort of just goes into this mode,” Ruud said, “where he just becomes like a wall.”\n\nDuring the first-to-7 segment, Djokovic contributed four winners and zero unforced errors.\n\nThat made his career mark in tiebreakers 308-162, a winning percentage of .655. In 2023, he is 15-4, including 6-0 in Paris — there were 55 points played across that half-dozen, and Djokovic’s sum total of unforced errors was zero.\n\n“He just steps up,” Ruud said. “Either he plays ridiculous defense or he plays beautiful winners. Just doesn’t do any mistakes.”\n\nThat set alone lasted 1 hour, 21 minutes, chock full of extended exchanges, the sort of points about which entire stories could be written. There were those that lasted 20, 25, 29 strokes. One was won by Ruud with the help of a back-to-the-net, between-the-legs shot. On another, Djokovic tumbled behind the baseline, smudging his red shirt, blue shorts and skin with the rust-colored clay.\n\nDjokovic's scrambling and stretching and bending and twisting on defense shows up on the scoreboard, for sure. But all of the long points also sap an opponent's energy and will.\n\n“It's just annoying for me,” Ruud said, “but it’s very, very impressive.”\n\nWhen Djokovic broke to lead 3-0 in the second set, his powers now on full display, he jabbed his right index finger against his temple over and over and over. He wheeled to face his nearby box in the stands, where the group included Ivanisevic, Djokovic's wife and two children, his parents, his agent and even seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady.\n\nThe retired Brady is widely viewed as the NFL’s “Greatest Of All Time” — or “GOAT,” for short — and there has been a debate in the tennis world for quite some time over which among Djokovic, Nadal or Federer deserves that sobriquet.\n\nIf the barometer is Grand Slam championships, no one can argue against Djokovic’s status at the moment.\n\n“I leave those kind of discussions of ‘who is the greatest?’ to someone else. I have, of course, huge faith and confidence and belief (in) myself and for everything that I am and who I am and what I am capable of doing,\" Djokovic said at his news conference, the Coupes des Mousquetaires at arm's length. “So this trophy obviously is another confirmation of the quality of tennis that I’m still able to produce, I feel.”\n\n___\n\nAP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2023/05/28/french-open-2023-novak-djokovic-stands-alone-among-men-with-23-grand-slam-titles/70264647007/", "title": "French Open 2023: Novak Djokovic stands alone among men with ...", "text": "AP\n\nPARIS (AP) — Novak Djokovic now stands alone among men with 23 Grand Slam titles.\n\nAfter all those years of chasing rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, Djokovic is on top of the list of most major championships for a man.\n\nDjokovic did it by beating Casper Ruud 7-6 (1), 6-3, 7-5 in the French Open final on Sunday. The first set was tight until 6-all, and then Djokovic simply took over, dominating the tiebreaker — as he often does — and the second set, before grabbing 12 of the last 13 points to seal the victory.\n\nThat allowed Djokovic to break his tie with Nadal at 22 majors. Federer, who announced his retirement last year, is next among men with 20, while Djokovic's idol, Pete Sampras, is fourth with 14. And to think: Sampras set that mark by winning his last Slam in what turned out to be the last match of his career, the 2002 U.S. Open final.\n\nHere we are, just 21 years later, and not only did three guys surpass Sampras, but Djokovic moved way past him.\n\nSerena Williams finished her career last year with 23 majors, the most for a woman in the Open era. Margaret Court won 24, some during the amateur era.\n\nDjokovic's win also moved back into the top spot of the ATP rankings, jumping from No. 3 to replace Carlos Alcaraz at No. 1. Djokovic beat Alcaraz in the semifinals.\n\nThe women's singles title in Paris was won on Saturday by Iga Swiatek, who defeated Karolina Muchova 6-2, 5-7, 6-4. That gave Swiatek two trophies in a row at Roland Garros and three in the past four years. She also won last year's U.S. Open and is just the third woman to start a career by going 4-0 in Slam finals.\n\nThe next Grand Slam tournament is Wimbledon, which begins on the grass courts of the All England Club on July 3. Djokovic will head there halfway to a calendar-year Grand Slam. In 2021, he came quite close to becoming the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win all four major tournaments in one season but lost in the U.S. Open final.\n\nNovak Djokovic is listed as a minus-155 money-line pick to win Wimbledon, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.

It is such an honor to have my name at the top amongst the biggest names of the game,” said Thitikul.\n\n“It is very special to get to the top but it is much harder to retain it. I still have a lot to learn from all the legends and current players both on and off the course. I will continue to work hard for my family, my team, my fans and my country.”\n\nAs we take a look at some of the most talented prodigies in the history of golf, where better to start than Tiger Woods: Six junior world championships to his name, the only player to win three US junior championships in a row, and a three-peat winner of the US amateur from 1994 to 1996. Woods turned pro in August 1996. Within a year, he'd scooped three PGA Tour events, become the youngest winner of The Masters at 21, and become the fastest player to reach No. 1 after turning professional, just 290 days into his pro career.

Cuban/Getty Images North America/Getty Images Following a series of wins in Canadian amateur events, Brooke Henderson became the youngest-ever winner of the KPMG Women's PGA Championship (at the Sahalee Country Club, pictured) when she won her first major aged 18 in 2016. Henderson has since racked up eight wins on the LPGA Tour, her most recent coming at the LA Open in April 2021.\n\nScott Halleran / Getty Images After becoming the youngest player to win the British Amateur Championship in 2009 (at Formby Golf Club, pictured) and make the cut at The Masters as a 16-year-old the following year, Italy's Matteo Manassero burst onto the pro scene, becoming the first teenager to win three times on the European Tour. Victories at the Castello Masters, Malaysian Open, and the BMW PGA Championship suggested the arrival of a new superstar, but Manassero has since endured a difficult spell. He hasn't won on the European Tour since 2013, though 7th and 8th Tour finishes already in 2022 have made for a solid start to the year for the Italian. Richard Heathcote / Getty Images The youngest-ever known winner of a professional golf tour event, 14-year-old Atthaya Thitikul made headlines around the world when she triumphed at the Ladies European Thailand Championship in 2017. A string of amateur titles followed before Thitikul turned pro in 2020, and the Thai prodigy's meteoric rise continued with three more Ladies European Tour wins by September 2021. She won her first LPGA Tour event in March 2022 at the JTBC Classic in Southern California (pictured), and in May, rose to No. 4 in the world rankings. Donald Miralle / Getty Images Continuing Thailand's recent trend of golf prodigies, Ratchanon \"TK\" Chantananuwat narrowly missed out on besting compatriot Thitikul's record when he became the youngest male player to win on a major Tour aged 15 years and 37 days. Victory at the Trust Golf Asian Mixed Cup in April 2022 (pictured) set a new peak in the schoolboy's amateur career, having already become the youngest player to make the cut in the history of the All Thailand Golf Tour in 2020, aged 13 years and four months. Orange Pictures/BSR Agency/Getty Images Having already won on the ALPG Tour earlier that year, New Zealand's Lydia Ko became the youngest golfer to win on the LPGA Tour when -- at 15 years old -- she triumphed at the CN Canadian Women's Open in August 2012 (pictured). After turning pro in October 2013, Ko has gone from strength to strength with an already-glittering trophy cabinet. At 17 years old, she was the youngest golfer to reach the No. 1 ranking in 2015, and today boasts 17 victories on the LPGA Tour. Harry How / Getty Images Arguably the greatest golfer never to go pro, Bobby Jones is one of the sport's most influential figures. A prodigious young talent with a string of wins by the age of 14, it took longer than expected for Jones to win his first major, triumphing at the US Open in 1923, aged 21. He soon added three more and three British Open titles before retiring at just 28. He proceeded to found and help design the course at Augusta National Golf Club, where The Masters -- then known as the Augusta National Invitational -- was first hosted in 1934.\n\nTopical Press Agency / Hulton Archive / Getty Images One of the most famed golf prodigies in recent history, a 10-year-old Michelle Wie became the youngest player to qualify for a USGA amateur Championship in 2000. Aged 14 in 2004, she bested many of the world's top men's players' and major winners at the Sony Open (pictured) despite narrowly missing the cut. With a professional career marred by injury, victory at the US Women's Open in 2014 has proven to be the career peak for Wie, who told CNN she had been considering retirement before the birth of her daughter in 2020. Jonathan Ferrey / Getty Images Golf's greatest-ever prodigies Prev Next\n\nBreakneck climb\n\nThitikul made headlines around the world in 2017 when, just four months after her 14th birthday, she won the Ladies European Thailand Championship to become the youngest winner of a professional golf tournament.\n\nSince turning professional in 2020, the teen has steadily climbed up the rankings.\n\nShe broke into the top-100 for the first time in July 2021, surging to 61st the following month with a stunning fifth-place finish at the Evian Championship.\n\nAfter adding her fourth win on the Ladies European Tour (LET) at the Swiss Ladies Open, Thitikul secured her card for the LPGA Tour in December, setting the stage for her rookie season this year.\n\nAhead of the opening event in January, she was ranked 18th. By the time she clinched her first LPGA Tour win at the JTBC Classic in California in March, Thitikul was already world No.5 on her first entry into the top 10.\n\nWith seven-top 10 finishes, Thitikul never dropped lower than sixth before adding her second LPGA title at the Arkansas Championship in September.\n\nTwo consecutive top-10 outings followed before a sixth-place finish at the BMW Ladies Championship last month, securing Thitikul enough ranking points to oust South Korea’s Jin-young from top spot after 38 weeks at the summit.\n\nThitikul celebrates winning the Arkansas Championship at Pinnacle Country Club in September. Andy Lyons / Getty Images\n\nKo was the LPGA’s rookie of the year in 2014, but had to wait until her second season on the Tour to become world No.1, albeit at almost two years younger than Thitikul.\n\nAdding her 18th LPGA title at the BMW Ladies Championship, two-time major champion Ko has already enjoyed a career most would dream of.\n\nStill only 25, the New Zealander is as well-placed as any to speak to the pressures of being labeled a child prodigy, and predicted Thitikul’s imminent rise to the top following her most recent win.\n\n“The golf that Atthaya has been playing has been absolutely amazing,” Ko said. “I think she’s got a run to be world No.1.\n\n“Having been in that position I think it’s such a cool experience and it seems like she’s handling all the media pressure really well. That just shows what kind of a world class player she is.”\n\nKo is congratulated by Thitikul after winning the BMW Championship last month. Chung Sung-Jun / Getty Images\n\nThitikul is the second Thai player to claim the women’s top spot after Ariya Jutanugarn in 2017, and leads a recent surge in exciting young players to emerge from her country.\n\nIn April, compatriot Ratchanon “TK” Chantananuwat became the youngest male player to win on a major Tour, just a month after his 15th birthday.", "authors": ["Jack Bantock"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}]}

Purchases you make through the links below may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.\n\nOn Sunday, June 11, a tanker truck exploded on highway I-95 in Philadelphia, setting the busy interstate road ablaze and causing it to collapse. Many will still feel the effects of this accident in the coming days and even months until that part of the road can be repaired. Whether you live in Philadelphia or are just passing through, the high traffic of I-95 will lead to backed-up lanes and drivers having to reroute, likely adding significant time to travel. If your commute has been extended thanks to the collapse, we’re here to help you make your ride a bit more bearable with these products.\n\nMake smart choices without hours of googling. Subscribe to The Checklist newsletter for expert product advice and recommendations.\n\nWhy did I-95 collapse?\n\nI-95 collapsed as the result of a tanker truck crashing into a wall beneath the section that collapsed and catching aflame. Unfortunately, the tanker was filled with gasoline. The combined force of the crash and the gasoline-fueled fire quickly led to the elevated northbound section of I-95 to fall.\n\nLearn more: Best travel insurance\n\nHow long will I-95 be inaccessible?\n\nIt’s unclear how long I-95 will be down, but it is closed indefinitely for the time being. Officials have stated that fixing the compromised section of the road could take months.\n\nA water bottle\n\nIf you find your drive extended thanks to the I-95 collapse, you should make sure to keep a water bottle in your cupholder so you can stay hydrated. Among other nasty symptoms, dehydration can leave you feeling fatigue and dizziness—two things you don't want to experience while driving. To keep your water cool throughout your drive, we recommend our favorite water bottle, the Brita BB11 Premium Filtering Water Bottle. It keeps water cold for up to 24 hours and opens with one hand for easy use when driving.\n\nA soft cooler\n\nGoing for a roadtrip? You'll want a way to keep all your snacks and drinks cool for the long ride, even more so now with expected delay times. That's why you should get the best soft cooler we've tested, Arctic Zone Titan Deep Freeze, which we love for its portability, storage compartments and excellent temperature retention.\n\nA travel mug\n\nWhile traveling for an extended period or at night, you may need something caffeinated to keep you alert. For this, we recommend traveling with a quality travel mug, such as the Zojirushi SM-KHE48. This is the best travel mug you can buy thanks to its excellent temperature retention. Plus, it opens with one hand, making it easy to use while driving.\n\nA phone charger\n\nA phone charger is vital for long car rides whether you're using your phone for navigation or just keeping it charged in case of emergencies. You have many options for connecting your phone to your car's charger including plugging it into the USB outlet directly if you have a newer car or using an adapter if you have an older one.\n\nA digital multimedia receiver\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto have been game changers in the way that many use their cars. These programs, often standard with newer cars, make it easier to use navigation, listen to the music you want and conduct hands-free calls using Bluetooth. Older cars can utilize CarPlay or Android Auto, too, if you have the know-how to install a digital multimedia receiver.\n\nJumper cables and a spare tire\n\nA longer journey means that there's a higher chance something goes wrong with your car. You can knock on wood and keep your fingers crossed, but you may want to try something a bit more practical than \"hope\" in case your car dies on the road. Instead, make sure you have basic car tools like jumper cables and a spare tire. This listing by NOCO not only provides jumper cables, but a battery booster. Many buyers rave about its effectiveness. If you’re looking for a spare tire, you can browse all the listings on Advance Auto Parts.\n\nA GPS\n\nPerhaps you’re looking to take a different route and avoid the chaos of I-95. We don’t blame you one bit. There are many ways to go about navigating a new route. If your car doesn't have a built-in GPS, you can have one installed in your car. If you prefer using your phone's GPS, we recommend using a phone mount such as the best we've tested, the iOttie Easy One Touch 5. We love the Easy One Touch 5 because it's sturdy, adjustable and secure.\n\nAudible\n\nLooking for a break from the monotonous hum of your engine? Try Audible, which offers thousands of audiobooks for a low price. The library of available content on Audible is vast, so you’re sure to find something that you and the rest of your family can enjoy, too.\n\nA LEGO Base\n\nIf you have a child in the backseat who loves building with LEGOs, they'll love this carrying case that doubles as a base for brick building. No matter how long your commute or trip is now that I-95 is down, your passenger will surely be entertained for hours building to their heart's content.\n\nA movie player\n\nThere’s nothing like a movie marathon to keep passengers entertained for the duration of the ride (or the duration of a video device’s battery; whichever comes first). With DBPOWER's top-rated DVD player, your passengers will enjoy five hours of movies and shows without needing a recharge. Prefer streaming? Then you can opt to get a tablet to download and stream the perfect movies for your passengers. Plus, you can play games on tablet! A little goes a long way on a car ride, so a our pick for the best compact tablet, the Apple iPad Mini, should serve you well. We love this tablet thanks to portability and performance.\n\nThe product experts atReviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

But in looking at the positive side of things, it is a significant decrease from yesterday, when almost 250,000 were without power,” Captain said.\n\nOut-of-state utility crews have been mobilized in the efforts to restore power in the area.\n\n'Over 600 calls'\n\nVolusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood encouraged residents to reflect on the “historic” and “catastrophic event we faced here.”\n\n“We lost three lives during this event,” he said. “And we have untold numbers who have had catastrophic loses of their properties – not to mention what is going on with our friends and neighbors in the southwest part of the state.”\n\nChitwood said New Smyrna Beach saw 15.5 inches of rain from the storm yesterday – 13 in DeLand, 11.5 in Edgewater, 11 in Lake Helen and Debary, and more than 10 inches in Daytona Beach.\n\n“When you factor that in, plus the over 600 calls to our dispatch center for people to be evacuated, I could not be prouder to be part of the team we have here,” he said.\n\nChitwood said the county received state assistance with five high-water vehicles used in the rescue operations yesterday. There are currently no calls pending for flooding evacuations, Chitwood added.\n\nDaytona Beach-area shelters\n\nShelters in the county have housed more than 400 people as of Friday morning.

There are many beach walkovers, sea walls and sea dunes that have been damaged by the storm. Please stay off of these.”\n\nCaptain closed with news that an Edgewater animal shelter received help from the county’s animal services division and other local partners to rescue 90 animals (cats and dogs) during Thursday's storm.\n\n“It’s going to take a lot of people to restore our beautiful community,” Captain said.\n\n― Brenno Carillo\n\n4:40 p.m. | Chuck E. Cheese roof among damage in Port Orange\n\nTropical Storm Ian claimed the Chuck E. Cheese restaurant at The Pavilion at Port Orange as one of its casualties on Thursday.\n\nThe rest of the shopping center at 5501 S. Williamson Blvd. in Port Orange, however, remained relatively intact.\n\n\"The Pavilion is mostly fine,\" confirmed Kristina Circelli, a spokeswoman for both the Port Orange shopping center as well as for Volusia Mall in Daytona Beach, on Friday. \"Chuck E.

Cheese restaurant in Port Orange for comment.\n\nDorothy Hopper, the general manager and co-owner of the Copperline Coffee, also said she didn't notice the damage to the nearby restaurant when she drove in to work Friday morning. She said the damage is noticeable on the side of the building facing Williamson, but not so much on the side that faces her coffeehouse.\n\n\"Oh my god, poor Chuck E. Cheese over there,\" she said when contacted by phone on Friday afternoon.\n\nAs for the Port Orange Copperline location, Hopper said, \"We have no damage, thank goodness. We never lost power either.

The National Weather Service forecast calls for the river to exceed 11.6 feet near Lake Harney in southern Volusia County. That's 6 inches above the record at a gauge where records have been kept since the 1940s. In Astor, on the north end of the county, the river is forecast to break a record set in 1933. ― Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY\n\n3:11 p.m. | Crabby Joe's Deck & Grill damaged\n\nTropical Storm Ian took down a huge chunk of the Sunglow Pier including a portion of the iconic Crabby Joe's Deck & Grill on Thursday.\n\n\"The restaurant itself is pretty much intact, but there has been extensive damage both to the front as well as to the pier behind the restaurant including the gift shop, maintenance room and fishing pier,\" said General Manager Nicole Devane.\n\n\"The rear portion of the pier became detached and is now somewhere in the ocean,\" she said in a phone interview Friday afternoon.\n\nDevane said Crabby Joe's owner Ray Barshay, who also owns Sunglow Pier, plans to rebuild the portion of the pier damaged in this latest tropical storm/hurricane with the goal of reopening the restaurant as soon as it is safe.\n\n\"The pier is definitely repairable,\" she said as she assessed the damage in person. \"Time will tell how fast we can get it rebuilt.\"\n\nDevane said the inside dining room, kitchen and bar all appear to be intact, but acknowledged, \"the main dining room in back is questionable. The main priority right now is to try to secure as much as we can and try to reopen as soon as possible once we know it's safe.\"\n\nDevane said the restaurant was closed and no employees were present when the damage occurred, which was likely sometime either late Wednesday night or early morning Thursday. Crabby Joe's employs 119 workers.\n\n\"We probably lost a good 200 feet of the pier,\" she said. The restaurant itself is \"300 feet from the parking lot to the front door.\"\n\nThe City of Daytona Beach Shores' Department of Public Safety posted a photo of the damaged pier on Facebook. \"We have lost part of our iconic Sunglow Pier. Please do not come to the beach to sightsee — It is too dangerous to be out on the roads and especially at the beach.\"\n\nJohn Luke Zona, who goes by \"Luke,\" is the former longtime general manager of Crabby Joe's who oversaw its operations for 29 years until he retired in May of last year. Reached by phone late Thursday, he said he could immediately tell by looking at a photo of the damage what was lost in the storm.\n\n\"It's repairable,\" he said, adding that this is not the first time Sunglow Pier has been extensively damaged by a hurricane or tropical storm. \"When (Hurricane) Matthew hit (in 2016), we lost 180 feet. I was also there when (Hurricane) Floyd took out 85 feet (in 1999). It used to be 1,000 feet long.\"\n\n\"It's a really sad day,\" said Zona who grew up across the street from Sunglow Pier and began working at Crabby Joe's as a teenager. \"It's heartbreaking.\"\n\nBarshay responded briefly via text message to an inquiry from The News-Journal stating, \"Scrambling with 3 places down and assessing things. Can try you later.\"\n\nBarshay also owns the Funky Pelican seafood restaurant on the Flagler Beach Pier, which was also damaged during Tropical Storm Ian, as well as the RiverGrille on the Tomoka restaurant at 950 U.S. 1 in Ormond Beach. He confirmed in a follow-up text that all three restaurants suffered damage, but did not specify to what extent. ― Clayton Park\n\n3:06 p.m. | NSB debris pickup efforts begin, mayor urges residents to stay home if safe until water recedes\n\nNew Smyrna Beach is now implementing a first push to clear debris left in the wake of Tropical Storm Ian, the city announced in a press release Friday afternoon.\n\n“A citywide storm debris assessment is currently underway as a surge of additional collection trucks are slated to work over the weekend clearing city roads before moving on to curbside pickup this Monday,” the release said.\n\nThe make-up days for solid waste collection will be Monday, Oct. 3 for “items normally put out on Thursdays and Tuesday, Oct. 4 for items normally put out on Fridays.\n\nTips for debris placement include:\n\nSeparate tree limbs, branches, and other vegetative debris from demolition waste into separate piles without blocking the road, sidewalk, or storm drains.\n\nDo not place debris near or on trees, poles, fire hydrants, meters, or other structures.\n\nDo not place debris directly under power lines to allow collection truck boom arms room to maneuver.\n\nIf you do not have a sidewalk, ditch, or utility line in front of your home, place debris at the edge of your property line before the curb.\n\n170 out-of-town utilities crews from six states have been based at the New Smyrna Beach Municipal Airport to assist with recovery efforts on Friday.\n\nThe storm’s maximum gust of 95 mph and sustained winds toppled several trees, disrupting power throughout the city.\n\n“Our city is experiencing unprecedented flooding across every area,” said New Smyrna Beach Mayor Russ Owen. “Many streets are impassable and there are hidden underwater dangers in previously safe areas.

Mack\n\njustin.mack@Indystar.com\n\nA malfunctioning car crusher that slammed into a bridge during rush hour Tuesday morning has led to the partial closure of two major thoroughfares on Indianapolis' west side.\n\nShortly after 8 a.m. Tuesday, officials from multiple police and fire agencies responded to the scene of a crash in the northbound lanes of I-465 at Rockville Road. Upon arrival, first responders were greeted by the sight of a crumbling overpass, a half dozen damaged cars and an injured woman.\n\nAccording to a news release from the Indiana State Police, a Twins Trucking semi was carrying equipment used to compact cars northbound on I-465 when the car crusher experienced a mechanical issue.\n\nFor reasons that remain under investigation, the hydraulic piston of the mobile car crusher extended upward while the semi was in motion, police said.\n\nAs the semi approached the Rockville Road overpass, the extended car crusher hit the bridge. The impact separated the tractor from the trailer and damaged at least four beams from the bridge. The eastbound lanes of Rockville Road were also badly damaged.\n\n\"Hundreds of pieces of concrete, from baseball to basketball size and larger, fell from the damaged support beams onto northbound traffic that was traveling under the bridge at the time of the crash,\" said a statement from the ISP. \"This resulted in five other vehicles being struck and damaged from the falling debris.\"\n\nA 28-year-old Indianapolis woman was taken to Eskenazi Hospital in good condition after debris from the bridge fell through the windshield of her car. The driver of the semi was not hurt, and there were no other reported injuries.\n\nWayne Township Fire officials said in addition to debris and vehicle cleanup, crews had to contain a large fuel spill.\n\nThe car crusher was owned by OmniSource, a Fort Wayne-based processor and distributor of scrap metal. OmniSource issued a statement late Tuesday night, explaining that the machinery was in control of the third-party company that had leased it.\n\n“A piece of OmniSource equipment that was leased to an operated by a third-party company was involved in an auto accident today in Indianapolis, Ind. This same third party was also operating the truck hauling that equipment. As the equipment was not in the control of OmniSource at the time of the accident, we currently have no further information at this time.”\n\nIn response to the incident, the office of Gov.

Northbound I-465 will be closed for several days, while the southbound lanes of I-465 remained open.\n\nBy Tuesday night, the south side of the Rockville Road bridge remained closed; however, the north side of the bridge was re-opened, allowing for one lane of traffic in each direction, according to INDOT spokesman Nathan Riggs.\n\nReopening the south side of the bridge for all lanes of traffic could take months, Riggs said, since the damaged girders would need to be removed before the bridge could be essentially rebuilt on that side.\n\n\"It's not going to be a short-term proposition,\" Riggs said.\n\nFour of about 14 load-bearing girders over I-465 northbound will be removed by crews in the coming days.\n\nAfter damaged portions are separated from the bridge, crews will work to open limited access across the north side of the bridge. Northbound I-465 will need to remain closed during this process.\n\n\"Replacing these beams will require longer-term repairs similar to construction of a new bridge deck,\" said a statement from INDOT. \"INDOT continues to assess the replacement and will provide more precise timelines in the near future as work to remove the damaged bridge beams gets underway.\"\n\nAlso closed because of the crash were the northbound on-ramps from Washington Street and the northbound on-ramp to I-465 from Rockville Road. Police said it took more than three hours to clear traffic off I-465 between I-70 and the scene of the crash.\n\nCommute interrupted?\n\nDue to road closures, motorists will have to travel alternate routes until repairs can be made.

That intersection was also “uncontrolled,” meaning there were no lights or mechanized arms, according to preliminary reports.\n\nIn a statement, Amtrak noted that trespassing on railroad rights-of-way is the leading cause of rail-related deaths.\n\n“These incidents can affect everyone involved — those who are injured or die and their families, our train crews, and our passengers,” the company said. “They also serve as critical reminders about the importance of obeying the law and of exercising extreme caution around railroad tracks and crossings.”", "authors": ["Stella Chan Eric Levenson", "Stella Chan", "Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/02/09/did-train-wrecks-spill-hazardous-chemicals-near-your-home-look-data/11197948002/", "title": "How often do train wrecks spill hazardous chemicals into ...", "text": "Despite the images of flames and public evacuations after train cars derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, late Friday, railway incidents requiring nearby residents to flee possible explosions or potentially toxic fumes are rare, a USA TODAY analysis of federal government data found.\n\nTechnological improvements to the railcars crisscrossing the nation's tracks to ensure better crashworthiness and temperature regulation, retiring old cars, and a decline in crude oil transport since their peak in 2015 have made railcars less likely to leak or spill hazardous materials, experts told USA TODAY.\n\nYet when wrecks do occur, they may serve as difficult reality checks for the many Americans who live near railroad tracks moving massive amounts of freight, including potentially toxic chemicals, each year. In East Palestine, residents were only allowed to return home after days of evacuation, sometimes under threat of arrest, due to safety concerns around toxic chemical release.\n\nUSA TODAY found that although catastrophic events involving trains and chemicals may be uncommon, hazmat cargo violations caught during inspections of rail shippers and operators appear to be climbing. Over the last five years, federal inspectors have flagged 36% more hazmat violations compared with the five years prior – and fines for those are up 16%.\n\nOne reason for the increase, however, may simply be improved accountability by agency inspectors. A 2016 audit by the Department of Transportation's Inspector General's Office found that inspectors were issuing lax penalties for violators of hazmat cargo regulations and failing to refer bad actors for possible criminal prosecution despite agency requirements.\n\nIn Ohio, 20 railcars out of the 100-car train operated by Norfolk Southern Railway were carrying cargo labeled as hazardous materials when it derailed near the Pennsylvania state line and burst into flames. As many as 2,000 people – a significant swath of the 5,000-person rural town along the northeastern Ohio and Pennsylvania border – evacuated from their homes for days after worries that unstable vinyl chloride in five derailed cars could explode, disbursing toxic fumes and shrapnel as far as a mile away.\n\nEnvironmental officials deployed air and water quality monitors to ensure those chemicals – associated with an increased risk of cancer – weren't being released into the community's air.\n\nPreliminary indications are that a mechanical problem with a rail car axle may have caused the crash, but the investigation is ongoing, National Transportation Safety Board officials said.\n\nWhat is vinyl chloride? Toxic gases connected to Ohio train derailment cause concern\n\nEast Palestine residents and a business owner filed a federal class-action lawsuit Tuesday, alleging the derailment was caused by the railway company's negligence in operating the train, defects in their track system or in one or more of their cars – resulting in the exposure of hundreds of people to \"toxic chemicals, fumes, and carcinogens\" and evacuation orders, court records show.\n\nNorfolk Southern declined to comment on pending litigation.\n\nNot only was Friday's incident relatively rare, so too are deaths from incidents involving hazmat cargo rail cars. The last reported death from a hazardous material on a train was in 2011. A railcar loader in Kentucky was \"splashed with 95% sulfuric acid while finishing the final stages of the pressure check before releasing the tank car into transport,\" according to an incident report filed with the Transportation Department.\n\nBut the consequences may still be widespread due to the sheer amount of cargo involved. Hazardous materials have leaked into waterways or caused other kinds of environmental damage. Clean-up often requires specialized training and can be costly.\n\nAuthorities said environmental agencies monitoring air and water quality in East Palestine have not detected anything concerning. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice sounded an alarm about water safety in the Ohio River, though the water ultimately tested safe.\n\nWhy ensuring hazmat train safety can be especially difficult\n\nThe United States has about 140,000 miles of railroad for freight cars, which are owned and maintained by private organizations. Each year, nearly a billion tons of hazardous materials are shipped by rail, according to the American Chemistry Council.\n\nHazardous materials, or \"hazmat,\" are defined by the federal government as \"substances or chemicals that pose a health hazard, a physical hazard, or harm to the environment,\" such as unrefined oil, liquid natural gas and industrial manufacturing chemicals.\n\nThese hazmat railcars are are required to meet additional safety regulations to ensure they can carry chemicals across the country without incident.\n\nThe rules for transporting materials depend on each substance and how dangerous it is. The Federal Railroad Administration describes railroads as \"the safest method\" for moving large amounts of chemicals long distances, yet most hazardous materials are transported by trucks on U.S. highways.\n\nThe Association of American Railroads, an industry trade group, noted in an emailed statement to USA TODAY that 99.9% of all hazmat shipments reach their destination without incident and that the hazmat accident rate has declined 55% since 2012.\n\nHow frequently do trains leak or spill hazardous materials? Not very.\n\nIn the last decade, hazardous materials have spilled or leaked from trains more than 5,000 times in the United States, according to a USA TODAY analysis of federal incident reports. However, other forms of transit notched far more spills. For every rail leak reported last year, there were two involving planes and 67 on highways. The federal reports show the number of incidents involving trains has been declining.\n\nStill, in 2022 alone, rail operators reported 337 hazardous material leaks or spills, only 32 of which were classified as \"serious.\" Only six were reported to have caused an injury.\n\nCrashes are less common than leaks but can have more serious consequences. Railroad derailments counted for 1 in 10 hazmat wrecks in the last decade – and 1 in 4 of those incidents last year, USA TODAY found.\n\nIn the Ohio derailment, the cars carrying the chemical were pressurized and had thermal protection, according to an email from the U.S. Department of Transportation. Such additions are safety measures that provide hazmat cargo with extra protection from flames in case of an accident.\n\nMore:Residents question next steps after train derailment\n\nTrains derail rarely, but can be very costly and dangerous\n\nThe most common reasons trains spill hazmat cargo are equipment failure, like broken valves, or human error such as improperly preparing cargo. Hazardous materials were released in 172 train derailments over the last decade, or roughly 17 each year. But when derailments involve hazardous cargo, the sheer size and amount of materials being transported can make wrecks dangerous and costly.\n\nLast year's 18 derailments involving hazmat cargo resulted in more than 20 times as much financial damage, or $41.6 million, compared with the $2.1 million total cost in damage caused by roughly 300 leaks of hazardous materials from other causes such as loose valves, USA TODAY found. The cost includes the value of cargo lost, damages to the train, tracks and nearby property, and the cost of emergency and clean-up response.\n\nDespite the plumes of black smoke overhead East Palestine, nearby residents and businesses are typically unaffected by hazmat incidents even when there is a serious wreck. Over the last decade, homes or businesses near a hazmat derailment were evacuated at least 24 times, or only once every seven wrecks, USA TODAY found.\n\nHave trains carrying hazmat leaked or spilled near you?\n\nUSA TODAY used federal data from incident reports since 2013 to build this searchable table readers can use to look up how often trains near them have leaked or spilled hazmat cargo.\n\nIf you don't see a search window below, you can find it here.\n\nAgency inspectors dinged for past hazmat cargo accountability\n\nA 2016 audit by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Inspector General found that the agency's inspectors lightly fined shippers and operators for violating hazmat cargo safety regulations and failed to refer cases for criminal prosecution despite agency requirements.\n\nBut an administration spokesman, Warren Flatau, told USA TODAY that the report's recommendations were \"satisfactorily closed\" by the agency and it had since taken steps to remedy all the issues identified. In an emailed statement, the Inspector General's Office confirmed that the Federal Railroad Administration took \"sufficient action to address each of the recommendations we made in our report and we therefore consider those recommendations closed.\"\n\nUSA TODAY's analysis of available public data bears this out to some degree. It found that agency inspectors flagged more violations and on average fined higher amounts annually in the years after the audit.\n\nUSA TODAY found that federal regulators collected an average of $16.5 million in civil penalties annually from railroad shippers and operators, including about $4.5 million for violating hazmat rules, since 2017. In the five years prior, they collected an average of $12.1 million in penalties annually, including $3.9 million for hazmat violations.\n\nThe Inspector General's Office noted that the closed actions included a recommendation that the agency amend its policy and procedures to require all staff to report any \"suspected criminal violations and instances of fraud, waste, and abuse\" to it directly.\n\nAn Inspector General's Office representative declined to provide details on the number of criminal referrals forwarded to it, urging USA TODAY to ask the Federal Railroad Administration for such details. Flatau said the agency doesn't track such referrals because of the change in policy having all staff reach out directly to the Inspector General's Office directly. But he said the agency does not have the ability to arrest or prosecute anyone.\n\nDevorah Ancel, a senior attorney with the Sierra Club Environmental Law Program, noted that the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration adopted new safety rules for hazmat transport by rail several years ago.\n\nThe revised regulations included measures like improved railcar design, which were \"far better from the arcane regulations that had been on the books for decades that did not contemplate movement of highly flammable and explosive materials that are in transit on our rail lines today,\" Ancel said in an email.\n\nShe added: \"Those regulations, however, left some improvements on the table. For example, the agency, in its final rule, chose not to adopt the most stringent of the brake design mechanisms that were proposed at that time.\"\n\nYour life in data: See crucial databases that can help you make everyday decisions", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/04/flagpole-feat-death-row-kidney-donor-civil-rights-medals-news-around-states/50450533/", "title": "Flagpole feat, death row kidney donor: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State officials said Thursday that they will move forward with plans to build two supersize prisons despite a bond sale falling more than $200 million short amid a volatile market and pressure from activists. The Alabama Corrections Institution Finance Authority hoped to sell $725 million in bonds for the construction project but was only able to sell $509 million. The bond issue is a key funding piece for the $1.2 billion construction price tag. State Finance Director Bill Poole told reporters that the state had hoped to “sell a little bit more,” but officials were pleased with the result. He said the outcome would not affect the construction, and the state still anticipates opening the prisons in 2026. He said the state will look at options for the remainder of the money, including seeking additional funding from the Legislature or conducting another bond issue when conditions are more favorable. Gov. Kay Ivey called the bond sale a “significant and positive step forward in our prison construction process.” While state officials blamed a volatile market, a group of activists and impact investors had urged buyers to stay away from the the bond offering. “They didn’t just fall short. They fell well, well, well short,” said Eric Glass, an adviser to Justice Capital, an investment fund that joined the call for a boycott.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Dozens of people experiencing homelessness will now camp at a city-owned site where bears recently tumbled through belongings, as a major local shelter closes. The Sullivan Arena, which provided shelter for hundreds of people nightly for more than two years, closed Thursday. The use of Anchorage’s Centennial Campground as a place for people to stay is seen as a stopgap measure, with indoor shelters full and Mayor Dave Bronson’s administration clearing illegal campsites, citing fire danger, the Anchorage Daily News reports. On Wednesday, the sound of an air horn blasted through the campground as a black bear and two cubs sauntered into the site. Individuals who were camping there and local health department workers tried to scare the bears off with the horn, shouts and claps. Jimmie Hartley said he planned to string cans filled with gravel on a fishing line around his site to warn him of approaching bears. Many of those who were arriving at the campground from Sullivan Arena had minimal gear. One major question is determining how many people the campground can safely accommodate, along with site rules, local Parks and Recreation Director Mike Braniff said. “Right now, we’re not allowing any fires here,” he said. “Food safety and bear safety is at the top of our list.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The elected county recorder and the elections director in Yavapai County are resigning after more than a year and a half of threats and heated criticism from backers of ex-President Donald Trump who accept his lie that he lost the 2020 election because of fraud. County Recorder Leslie Hoffman said Friday that she is fed up with the “nastiness” and has accepted a job outside the county. Her last day will be July 22. She said longtime elections director Lynn Constabile is leaving for the same reason, and Friday is her last day. “A lot of it is the nastiness that we have dealt with,” Hoffman said. “I’m a Republican recorder living in a Republican county where the candidate that they wanted to win won by 2-to-1 in this county and still getting grief, and so is my staff. ... I’m not sure what they think that we did wrong. And they’re very nasty. The accusations and the threats are nasty.” Constabile was busy Friday doing a required pre-election “logic and accuracy test” for the upcoming primary and unavailable for comment. Arizona’s 15 county recorders are responsible for voter registration and ensuring mail ballots are properly sent to the more than 80% of voters who vote by mail. They earn just $63,800 a year, a salary set by the Legislature that has not risen in the decade Hoffman has been in office.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The market for industrial hemp has not grown as fast as the plants in Arkansas, despite a promising climate for the crop touted a few years ago as a moneymaker and a new source for clothes, textiles, building materials, fuel and food. Although hemp plants with 0.3% THC became legal on the federal level when the 2018 farm bill passed, the market has not been as exciting, said Jim Correll, a University of Arkansas professor of plant pathology who has been studying hemp in the state. “There was a lot of excitement about the crop and how to make money. It has waned,” said Correll, who is studying diseases and other conditions that affect the quality of hemp and the yield. “The number of growers has dropped substantially.” There are about 20 industrial hemp growers currently in Arkansas, said Bill Morgan, a hemp research farmer who farms west of Fayetteville. Some farmers’ hemp has tested too high in THC, meaning the crop had to be destroyed. There were just 49 licensed hemp growers in Arkansas in 2021 – 78 fewer than when the program opened in 2019. The total number this year is expected to drop again. In 2020 there were 121 growers, and the first growing season for legalized hemp in 2019 started with 125 growers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday signed a new state law that will stop police from arresting people for loitering for prostitution, an issue that divided sex workers and advocates during a rare nine-month delay since legislators passed the bill last year. “To be clear, this bill does not legalize prostitution,” Newsom said in a signing message. “It simply revokes provisions of the law that have led to disproportionate harassment of women” and transgender adults, he said, nothing that Black and Latino women are particularly affected. The bill will bar police in California from arresting anyone for loitering with the intent to engage in prostitution. State Sen. Scott Wiener and other supporters said such arrest decisions often rely on an officer’s perception. While Newsom said he agreed with the intent of the repeal, “we must be cautious about its implementation.” He said his administration will track crime and prosecution trends “for any possible unintended consequences” and, if found, work to correct them. “For far too long, California law has been used to profile, harass and arrest transgender and gender-nonconforming people simply for existing in public spaces,” Tony Hoang, executive director of the LGTBQ rights group Equality California, said in praising the repeal. The measure also will allow those who were previously convicted to ask a court to dismiss and seal the record of the conviction.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Life expectancy in the state dropped for the second straight year in 2021. Driven by the pandemic, it’s the kind of decline not seen in decades, data from the state health department shows. The average life expectancy for Colorado residents fell to 78 years last year. That’s slightly lower than 2020, the first year of the pandemic, when it was 78.4 years, but the slide represents a persistent and significant drop of nearly three years compared to 2019. “The last time life expectancy dropped like this was in 1943, which was the most fatal year of World War II, for the nation,” said Dr. Eric France, the state’s chief medical officer. “It is tragic that we see life expectancy drop. Death rates increased by 20%.” Key drivers for the decline were COVID-19 and overdose deaths. The data vary by demographic group. COVID-19 was the leading cause of death among Hispanics, as well as non-Hispanic Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders and American Indians or Native Alaskans, the data shows. Dr. Lilia Cervantes, an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said she wasn’t surprised by the new numbers. “The Latino community makes up the majority of the essential workforce,” said Cervantes, a member of the Colorado Vaccine Equity Taskforce.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont signed an executive order Friday creating a new commission charged with planning the state’s multiyear celebration and commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence signing. The Connecticut Semiquincentennial Commission will be a state-level group, similar to the United States Semiquincentennial Commission recently established by Congress. The executive order requires the panel of volunteers to be wide-ranging, including not just representatives from historical organizations and state officials but also designees from the state’s two federally recognized tribes. The 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and subsequent formation of the U.S. will occur July 4, 2026. Former Secretary of the State Denise Merrill, who officially resigned from her post Thursday to spend time with her ailing husband, noted that Connecticut requires all high school students to take a civics class before they graduate. “This is a chance for all of us to have that lesson and to have everyone included and to have a chance to review the incredible history here in Connecticut of the founding of this country,” she said during a ceremony at the Old State House. “And this time, we can retell it. We can include everyone.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The jury in the corruption trial of State Auditor Kathy McGuiness acquitted her Friday of felony charges of theft and witness intimidation but found her guilty on three misdemeanor counts. Jurors deliberated for about four hours over two days before finding McGuiness, a Democrat elected in 2018, guilty of conflict of interest, official misconduct, and structuring a contract with a consulting firm to avoid compliance with state procurement rules. It marks the first time in Delaware history that a sitting statewide elected official has been convicted on criminal charges. Even though fellow Democrats quickly called on her to resign, the misdemeanor convictions don’t prevent McGuiness from holding public office, and she said she still plans to seek reelection in November. The conflict of interest charge involved the May 2020 hiring of McGuiness’ daughter, Elizabeth “Saylar” McGuiness, who still works for the auditor’s office. Prosecutors alleged Saylar McGuiness, 20, was hired even as other part-time workers in the auditor’s office left because of a lack of work in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said McGuiness then allowed her daughter special privileges, including access to a state vehicle and permission to work remotely while away at college in South Carolina, that were not available to other “casual-seasonal” workers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A truck hit a bicyclist and careened into a fireworks stand Saturday evening at an intersection in northeast Washington, killing the bicyclist and a man working in the stand, police said. No other injuries were reported. The accident at the corner of Minnesota Avenue and Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue NE occurred about 5:30 p.m., the Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement. The adult male victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Assistant Police Chief Wilfredo Manlapaz said the driver of the truck apparently was suffering a medical emergency when the accident occurred and was being treated at a local hospital. The bicyclist was in the crosswalk when he was struck, Manlapaz said. A photograph posted online by the MPD showed a demolished stand amid scattered debris.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: A person using a flamethrower set fire Saturday to a Pan-African flag flying on a pole outside the headquarters of the Uhuru Movement, a Black international socialist group based in Florida. Security video released by the group shows the driver of a white Honda sedan pulling up outside the group’s St. Petersburg headquarters, removing a flamethrower from the trunk and shooting a tower of fire at the flag flying about 30 feet above the ground. The group says the man stopped when a worker inside the building yelled at him. The video shows him putting the flamethrower back in the trunk and then driving away. A photo supplied by the group shows the flag with a large hole. St. Petersburg police said they were investigating the fire and working to identify a suspect. The Uhuru Movement is part of the African People’s Socialist Party, which says it is “uniting African people as one people for liberation, social justice, self-reliance and economic development.” Akile Anai, the group’s director of agitation and propaganda, said the attack is in the same vein as the May killing of 10 Black people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket. Police say the arrested suspect in the Buffalo massacre is a white nationalist. Akai said such attacks are caused by the decline of a “social system and facade of normalcy based on oppression, colonialism and exploitation.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A group of students want U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ name scrubbed from a building at the Savannah College of Art and Design. At the dedication of the building in 2010, Thomas praised his hometown’s hospitality. “You always long to go back to a place of comfort. The roots are here, and the roots are very, very deep here,” he said. The Clarence Thomas Center for Historic Preservation is located in the former convent where Thomas spent his early years attending school. The university has removed the sign from the building but did not respond to emails asking for the reason. An online petition that had garnered more than 1,800 signatures by Sunday cites Thomas’ comments on the Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling, in which the court repealed the constitutional right to abortion. Thomas indicated he would like to see a repeal of protections for gay marriage, access to contraception and privacy in the bedroom, calling the initial rulings that granted those rights “erroneous decisions.” He also has been accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill, who testified against him during his 1991 confirmation hearings, and, more recently in 2016, by Alaska lawyer Moira Smith, who alleged that Thomas groped her in 1999.\n\nHawaii\n\nPearl Harbor: A Navy investigation released Thursday revealed that shoddy management and human error caused fuel to leak into Pearl Harbor’s tap water last year, poisoning thousands of people and forcing military families to evacuate their homes for hotels. The investigation is the first detailed account of how jet fuel from the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, a massive World War II-era military-run tank farm in the hills above Pearl Harbor, leaked into a well that supplied water to housing and offices in and around the sprawling base. Some 6,000 people suffered nausea, headaches, rashes and other symptoms. After months of resistance, the military in April agreed to an order from the state of Hawaii to drain the tanks and close the Red Hill facility. A separate report the Defense Department provided to the state Department of Health on Thursday said December 2024 was the earliest it could defuel the tanks safely. The investigation report listed a cascading series of mistakes starting May 6, 2021, when operator error caused a pipe to rupture and 21,000 gallons of fuel to spill when fuel was being transferred between tanks. Most of that fuel spilled into a fire suppression line and sat there for six months, causing the line to sag. A cart rammed into this sagging line Nov. 20, releasing 20,000 gallons of fuel. The area where the cart hit the line isn’t supposed to have fuel, so the officials who responded to the spill didn’t have the right equipment to capture the liquid.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: It’s not clear whether a pair of laws from the early 1970s making it a felony to “knowingly aid” in an abortion or to publish information about how to induce one will be enforced alongside the state’s newer, near-total ban. In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, lawyers in Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden’s office are going through all the state’s abortion statutes with a fine-toothed comb, said Wasden spokesman Scott Graf. When the Legislature passed a trigger law in 2020 that would automatically prohibit nearly all abortions 30 days after the fall of Roe, lawmakers took some steps to avoid conflicts by making it clear that the law would supersede other bans. Lawmakers put similar language in another ban passed earlier this year. But they may have overlooked a few clauses in the decades-old statutes. The 2020 trigger law says the person seeking the abortion can’t be charged with a crime, instead focusing prosecution efforts on the provider. That would seem to override a 1973 law that makes it a felony for a person to undergo an abortion, but it’s not clear if another portion of the older law making it a felony to knowingly aid in an abortion could still be enforceable. It will be up to individual county prosecutors, at first, to decide how to proceed, said Twin Falls County prosecutor Grant Loebs, who is also president of the Idaho Prosecuting Attorneys Association. From there, judges will figure it out. Ultimately, he expects legislators will have a lot of fine-tuning to do in the years ahead.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A yearlong suspension of the state’s sales tax on groceries began Friday. Illinois’ tax relief program will also postpone a gas tax increase until January and cut school supply taxes from 6.25% to 1.25% from Aug. 5 to 14. “Starting tomorrow, every Illinoisan will get tax relief on essentials: groceries, gas, your home, and back-to-school supplies, with even more tax relief going into effect next year,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said in a news release Thursday. The measures are part of a $1.8 billion state tax-break deal signed by Pritzker in April. GOP leaders derided the measures as a campaign tool for Pritzker and other Democrats in an election year. The plan also provides automatic $50 income tax rebates for individuals who made less than $200,000 in 2021, $100 for couples filing jointly who made less than $400,000, and $100 per dependent claimed in 2021, up to three. Additionally, the Illinois state earned income credit will increase from 18% to 20% of the federal credit, and eligible homeowners will receive property tax rebates equal to their 2021 property tax credit, up to $300. Illinois’ 1% sales tax on groceries will be suspended through June 30, 2023, which will net $400 million in consumer savings, the governor’s release said.\n\nIndiana\n\nJeffersonville: Police are investigating after more than 30 bodies, some decomposing, were found inside a southern Indiana funeral home. Police in the Louisville, Kentucky, suburb of Jeffersonville responded to Lankford Funeral Home and Family Center on Friday evening and found 31 bodies, including some “in the advanced stages of decomposition,” Maj. Isaac Parker said. He said the county coroner’s office had reported a strong odor emanating from the building. Inside, officers wearing hazmat gear found bodies “in different places around the building.” Some of the bodies had been at the funeral home since March, Parker said. Police also found the cremated remains of 16 people. “It was a very unpleasant scene,” Parker said. “The conditions were not good.” The owner of the funeral home has been speaking with police since Friday, Parker said, and an investigation is ongoing. The owner did not immediately respond to an email from the Associated Press seeking comment Sunday. The remains were taken to the Clark County Coroner’s Office for identification, and police asked anyone who may have information to contact the coroner’s office.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Supreme Court on Thursday reversed a long-standing precedent that allowed landowners to sue for damages when a neighboring hog farm causes water pollution or odor problems that affect quality of life. The court concluded, 4-3, that a 2004 decision was wrong. The earlier ruling established that a portion of Iowa’s law providing immunity to livestock farms from neighbors’ nuisance lawsuits violated the inalienable rights clause of the Iowa Constitution. It also found neighbors could sue if they had lived in the area long before the farm began operating, had sustained significant hardship, and did not benefit from the nuisance immunity granted to the livestock farm. Justice Thomas Waterman wrote in the Thursday decision that “protecting and promoting livestock production is a legitimate state interest, and granting partial immunity from nuisance suits is a proper means to that end.” Iowa is the nation’s leading pork producer with 23 million pigs, most kept in large confinement buildings that collect nitrogen-rich manure from the animals and use it to fertilize fields. The court said judges must use a rational basis to review future court challenges – a standard that will be difficult to overcome because it presumes state laws are passed for the benefit of the public.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A local government has agreed to pay $12.5 million to a man and his mother after he spent 23 years in prison for a double murder he did not commit. The Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City approved the settlement Thursday and said in a statement Friday that it admits no guilt in the wrongful conviction of and two life sentences given to Lamonte McIntyre in the mid-1990s. McIntyre was 17 in 1994 when he was arrested in Kansas City for the shooting deaths of 21-year-old Doniel Quinn and 34-year-old Donald Ewing. McIntyre was freed in 2017 after a local prosecutor asked the court to vacate his convictions and drop all charges, calling his case an example of “manifest injustice.” Prosecutors presented no physical evidence tying McIntyre to the killings, and their case largely hinged on testimony that was allegedly coerced. The following year, McIntyre and his mother sued the unified government and former Kansas City police Detective Roger Golubski, whom they have accused, along with other police, of framing McIntyre for the killings. Their lawsuit sought up to $123 million in damages. McIntyre and his mother have said Golubski coerced her into sex and then framed her teenage son for the double homicide because she rejected the detective’s later sexual advances. They also allege that he abused dozens of Black women for years and that many officers were aware of his conduct. Federal authorities are investigating Golubski.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Court of Appeals rejected Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s effort to stop abortions in the state just two days after a court order allowed them to resume. Cameron is now asking the state Supreme Court to consider his case. In an order issued Saturday, appeals court Judge Glenn Acree denied Cameron’s appeal of a temporary restraining order issued Thursday by Jefferson Circuit Judge Mitch Perry. That means abortions may continue for now while a legal challenge to a state law banning almost all abortions in Kentucky continues before Perry. Cameron had argued that Perry erred in allowing abortions to resume in Kentucky and sought to have the restraining order blocked by the appeals court. Lawyers for Kentucky’s two abortion providers filed a response Friday, arguing procedural rules and case law bar lifting Perry’s restraining order. Cameron said in a brief statement Saturday he was “disappointed” with the decision, and on Sunday, he announced he had filed his request with the high court, saying his office is “exhausting every possible avenue.” Meanwhile, Perry has scheduled a hearing Wednesday on whether to grant an injunction, which would continue to block the law while the case proceeds.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMonroe: A former north Louisiana police officer pleaded guilty Friday to kicking a man in the face as he lay on the ground with his hands behind his back during an arrest in 2020, federal prosecutors said. Jared Desadier, 44, of Monroe, entered the plea before U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Foote to a charge of deprivation of rights under color of law, U.S. Attorney Brandon B. Brown’s office said in a news release. At the time, Desadier was an officer with the Monroe Police Department. Authorities said he and other officers detained a man for questioning and found he was carrying drug paraphernalia. The man ran, and officers pursued him. Another officer caught up with the man and ordered him to the ground. The man complied, and as the officer prepared to handcuff him, Desadier ran up on them and kicked the man in the face, authorities said. Desadier admitted in court that his assault was without justification, as the man did not present a threat to any officer or other person on the scene, Brown’s office said. Desadier also admitted he knew his actions were unjustified and unreasonable under the circumstances. Desadier faces up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentencing is set for Nov. 21.\n\nMaine\n\nKittery: Children from 47 families using the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard’s child care center are being removed from the program due to a U.S. Department of Defense order. Shipyard families were notified June 17 that the Navy is reimplementing a priority child care program access policy, which puts children of active military members ahead of children of the Navy’s civilian employees. The policy was scheduled to take effect two years ago but was delayed by COVID-19. “In accordance with the Policy Change Concerning Priorities for Department of Defense Child Care Programs Memorandum, your child has been identified for supplanting to accommodate a higher priority family,” the families were told in a letter. Given 45 days to find alternative child care services, the last day will be Aug. 1 for children from the affected families using the shipyard’s Child Development Center. “Child care is a workforce issue that directly impacts the efficiency, readiness and retention of the total force,” said Jeremy Lambert, spokesperson for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. He said the “supplanting” policy prioritizes single and dual active military member households, active-duty service members with a spouse working full time, combat-related wounded warriors, and children of staff at the Child Development Center.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: New restrictions on crabbing in the Chesapeake Bay will take effect this year after the blue crab count plummeted to its lowest level since surveys began in 1990. Tighter harvest limits are being issued as officials and industry leaders try to protect the iconic species and boost reproduction in the nation’s largest estuary. The Baltimore Sun reports Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources is issuing the first-ever limits on how many bushels of male blue crabs can be hauled in each day. Limits typically regulate the harvesting of female crabs to ensure that enough of them spawn. The new rules starting this month for Maryland limit the number of bushels that can be hauled in each day. The cuts will translate to about 15% to 25% of daily commercial harvest limits compared to the 2021 crabbing season, depending on the license. It’s unclear how much of an effect the new restrictions will have because watermen don’t hit their limits every day. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an independent conservation group, said the harvest limits are an encouraging step, but more needs to be done to address the likely causes behind the low crab count. Those include “poor water quality, loss of key habitat such as underwater grasses, and the proliferation of blue catfish and other invasive predators,” said Allison Colden, the foundation’s Maryland senior fisheries scientist.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Republican former state senator who’s running for Congress has been charged after allegedly stealing a gun from an elderly constituent and misleading investigators about what happened, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said Friday. Investigators said Dean Tran, 46, of Fitchburg, used his position as a public official to intimidate the constituent into parting with her late husband’s firearms, making her sign a pre-prepared contract and giving her $1,500 in cash for at least eight guns while visiting her in June 2019. When asked to return them the next day, Tran complied. But a day after he gave the guns back, he returned to the woman’s home, forced his way in and demanded a key to the gun safe, according to investigators. He then stole a Colt .45 while the constituent hid in her bedroom, investigators said. That gun was also later returned to the woman. Tran issued a statement Friday evening, calling the allegations “untrue and categorically false.” His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Investigators say Tran allegedly gave conflicting stories and reasons for taking the guns when interviewed by police, including denying any type of firearm sale, later producing a sales contract for the weapons, and disparaging the constituent’s mental capacity before demanding a written apology from her. Investigators also allege Tran made false statements on his May 2019 license-to-carry renewal application.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Elevated levels of arsenic have been found at seven sites where buildings were demolished in 2017-18 and filled with soil, The Detroit News reports. The results followed concerns raised by federal inspectors that 200 sites may have been filled with risky dirt. Tests show unsafe levels of arsenic at seven sites so far, and an eighth “did not fully meet quality standards,” the city said Thursday. Detroit ordered a contractor to replace soil at seven sites and test or replace soil at another 127 sites, according to the newspaper. “Whenever we become aware of a breach of contract instance, we require the contractor to address the situation at their own cost,” said Raymond Scott of the buildings department. Arsenic is a natural element found in water, air and soil. Chronic exposure can cause health problems. “Scientists, pediatricians, and public health professionals are concerned about subtle and long-range health effects of low-level exposures to arsenic in people,” according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Detroit said temporary fences would be installed around the sites.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: More households in the state are qualifying for a federal program that provides assistance with food at a time when inflation has caused grocery prices to rise. The Legislature, during its last session, increased the income limit for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from 165% of the federal poverty level to 200%. That means households of three making $3,600 a month or less are now able to receive food stamp benefits. Peter Woitock, a government relations specialist with Hunger Solutions, advocated for the change and said about 1,400 additional households in Minnesota will be eligible. He said many people were above the income level to qualify for SNAP, but they were still struggling to put food on the table. “We saw during the early part of the (coronavirus) pandemic a lot of policies that were put into place to help put food on the table for those who are struggling. But many of those policies and waivers were temporary,” Woitock said. Food shelf operators say visits to their pantries have risen 39% since January 2022, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Woitock said SNAP also contributes to the local economy. “I think in 2020, it served over 412,000 individuals, so that was about $780 million of federal funds that came into the state,” he said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A look at how African Americans traveled during the Jim Crow era is on display at the Two Mississippi Museums. The Negro Motorist Green Book, a Smithsonian traveling exhibition, opened Saturday at the downtown venue, which is part of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, a Smithsonian affiliate. It includes artifacts from business signs and postcards to historic footage, images and firsthand accounts to convey not only the apprehension felt by Black travelers but also the resilience, innovation and elegance of people choosing to live a full American existence, officials said. Mississippi artifacts include items from the historic Riverside Hotel in Clarksdale and Hotel E.F. Young Jr. in Meridian. Two Mississippi Museums director Pamela D.C. Junior said she was ecstatic to have the exhibit housed at the venue. “During the Great Migration, families moved across the U.S.; thus, the necessity to travel and visit relatives was born,” Junior said. “Postal worker Victor Green innovatively responded to this need with a roadmap of havens to eat, rest and visit. This safety net was a key guide for people of color throughout the Jim Crow South and other parts of America.” The exhibition will run through Sept. 25 in the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Exhibition Hall at the Two Mississippi Museums.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: A legislator has resigned her seat after being convicted of falsely claiming she was giving patients stem cell treatments for COVID-19. State Rep. Tricia Derges, R-Nixa, sent her resignation letter to Missouri House Speaker Rob Vescovo on Friday. She was convicted in June on 22 counts including wire fraud, illegal distribution of controlled substances and making false statements to investigators. Federal prosecutors argued she claimed nearly $900,000 in federal funding for COVID-19 treatments that weren’t performed or had already been performed. They also alleged she promoted amniotic fluid as a COVID-19 treatment and other diseases by falsely claiming it contained stem cells. Her narcotics license was placed on probation for three years in January. At the time, she refused to resign her House seat but was stripped of her committee assignments and barred from party caucus meetings. The state GOP prohibited her from running for reelection as a Republican this fall. Her sentencing on the federal charges will be determined in the coming months, and the jury voted to allow the government to keep $300,000 in CARES Act money she received for her clinic’s COVID-19 testing that had already been reimbursed. Derges pushed in the Legislature to allow assistant physicians like herself a path to licensing.\n\nMontana\n\nBrowning: A Blackfeet researcher has received a $75,000 federal grant to run a yearlong study to train dogs to sniff out chronic wasting disease and toxic waste that might otherwise be ingested by people who hunt wild game and gather traditional plants. The project aims to protect tribal members’ health by letting them know where the disease has been detected and where toxic waste has been found to preserve safe spaces to conduct traditional practices, Kaiser Health News reports. Chronic wasting disease has been detected in just one white-tailed deer on the Blackfeet reservation, but once it’s present, it’s impossible to eradicate, according to wildlife managers. The disease is already forcing tribal members to alter or abandon some traditional practices, said Souta Calling Last, executive director of the nonprofit cultural and educational organization Indigenous Vision. And some families depend on meat from the deer, elk or moose they can hunt several months out of the year. That’s where the dogs come in for Calling Last’s study. Standing near a wetland full of cattails, she said the dogs trained by the nonprofit organization Working Dogs for Conservation will detect chronic wasting disease in deer and elk scat at such sites that serve as watering holes for herds. The dogs also will sniff out mink and otter scat so it can be tested for chemicals and contaminants in illegal dumpsites of old cars, furniture and appliances.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A special election that was the tightest race in decades in a GOP-dominated U.S. House district is boosting confidence among Democrats hoping to energize voters by tapping into public outrage over the U.S. Supreme Court’s abortion ruling. Republicans still won the open seat as expected last week, but the margin surprised even some Democrats who have grown accustomed to lopsided, morale-crushing defeats. Republican Mike Flood beat Democrat Patty Pansing Brooks with 53.2% of the vote in last Tuesday’s special election, according to unofficial results. Pansing Brooks received 46.8%, with less than 7,200 total votes separating the candidates. The win was the narrowest in decades in the Republican-heavy, mostly rural 1st Congressional District, which hasn’t elected a Democrat to the House since 1964. The two were competing to replace disgraced former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican who routinely claimed at least 60% of the vote in his district before he was convicted in March on charges that he lied to FBI agents about an illegal campaign donation. He resigned shortly after a jury found him guilty and was sentenced to probation Tuesday in a federal court in Los Angeles. He began the process of filing an appeal Wednesday. Flood and Pansing Brooks will face each other again in November to determine who will serve a full term starting in January 2023.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A sunken boat dating to World War II is the latest object to emerge from a shrinking reservoir that straddles Nevada and Arizona. The Higgins landing craft that has long been 185 feet below the surface is now nearly halfway out of the water at Lake Mead. The boat lies less than a mile from Lake Mead Marina and Hemenway Harbor. It was used to survey the Colorado River decades ago, sold to the marina and then sunk, according to dive tours company Las Vegas Scuba. Higgins Industries in New Orleans built several thousand landing craft between 1942 and 1945, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. About 1,500 “Higgins boats” were deployed at Normandy on June 6, 1944, known as D-Day. The boat is just the latest in a series of objects unearthed by declining water levels in Lake Mead, the largest human-made reservoir in the U.S., held back by the Hoover Dam. In May, two sets of human remains were found in the span of a week. Experts say climate change and drought have led to the lake dropping to its lowest level since it was full about 20 years ago. As both Lake Mead and Lake Powell drop, states in the West increasingly face cuts to their supply from the Colorado River. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Touton said last month that the agency would take action to protect the system if the seven states in the Colorado River basin don’t quickly come up with a way to cut the use of up to 4 million acre-feet of water – more than Arizona and Nevada’s shares combined.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLittleton: Graffiti that was spray-painted on an anti-abortion pregnancy center is being investigated as a potential hate crime, police said. Someone spray-painted the words “fund abortion abort God” on the side of the Pathways Pregnancy Care Center last Tuesday, Littleton police said. The act happened days after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and gave full leeway to ban abortion back to the states. Pathways is a Christian ministry founded in 1996 that offers programs and information about alternatives to abortion. Police said the people who work and volunteer at Pathways are concerned for their safety and are taking internal steps to increase their security.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The city’s largest casino employer said Friday that a new contract it reached with a key union provides for “historic” raises. And the parent company of the city’s top-performing casino said the pact is “a good agreement for everyone.” Caesars Entertainment owns a third of Atlantic City’s nine casinos: Caesars, Harrah’s and Tropicana. It reached an agreement late Thursday night with Local 54 of the Unite Here union on a tentative deal to avoid a strike that had been threatened for the July Fourth weekend, traditionally one of the busiest times of the year for the casinos. The Borgata also reached a deal earlier Thursday. In a statement issued Friday, Caesars Entertainment said it has operated in Atlantic City for over 40 years “with an unwavering commitment to the community and its residents.” MGM Resorts International, which owns the Borgata, also praised the deal it reached with the union. Terms of the deal were not immediately released. But union President Bob McDevitt said Thursday night that the deal is “the best contract we’ve ever had.” The union said it was seeking “significant” wage increases in a new contract to help workers keep pace with rapidly rising prices for gasoline, food, rent and other expenses, as well as to compensate them for helping the casinos get through the worst of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Renewed efforts are underway to investigate and possibly discipline two attorneys who helped the Donald Trump campaign challenge New Mexico’s 2020 presidential election results in the weeks prior to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. A group including former Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez on Thursday asked the state Supreme Court to intervene and ensure an investigation in public view of the two attorneys who represented the Trump campaign for possible violations of standards of professional conduct. The complaint cites possible violations of conduct rules by New Mexico-based attorney Mark J. Caruso and another attorney, Michael Smith, who lists a Texas address and a Washington law license. The state’s chief disciplinary counsel and disciplinary board chairman previously determined in confidential proceedings that there was no violation of rules against frivolous litigation by Caruso and Smith. Caruso said by email that he was confident the Supreme Court would stand behind the previous finds, describing the accusations as “political claims by N.M. Democrat attorneys.” President Joe Biden won the 2020 vote in New Mexico by about 11 percentage points, or nearly 100,000 ballots. But the Trump campaign still filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court in Albuquerque that sought to invalidate absentee ballots cast at drop boxes and halt the certification of New Mexico’s presidential electors.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Legislators approved a sweeping overhaul Friday of the state’s handgun licensing rules, seeking to preserve some limits on firearms after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that most people have a right to carry a handgun for personal protection. The measure, signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul after passing both chambers by wide margins, is almost sure to draw more legal challenges from gun rights advocates who say the state is still putting too many restrictions on who can get guns and where they can carry them. Hochul, a Democrat, called the Democrat-controlled Legislature back to Albany to work on the law after last week’s high court ruling overturning the state’s long-standing licensing restrictions. Backers said the law, which takes effect Sept. 1, strikes the right balance between complying with the Supreme Court’s ruling and keeping weapons out of the hands of people likely to use them recklessly or with criminal intent. But some Republican lawmakers, opposed to tighter restrictions, argued the law violated the constitutional right to bear arms and predicted it too would end up being overturned. Among other things, the state’s new rules will require people applying for a handgun license to turn over a list of their social media accounts so officials could verify their “character and conduct.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The General Assembly wrapped up its chief work session for the year Friday by finalizing proposed state budget adjustments for the new fiscal year, crossing off other must-do legislation but leaving some big policy matters unresolved or thwarted. The Republican-penned spending measure, which alters the second year of a two-year budget plan enacted last November, received strong bipartisan support again, as it did while securing initial House and Senate approval on Thursday. The bill would spend $27.9 billion for the new year that began Friday while setting aside several billion additional dollars in reserves and construction projects. It also contains additional pay increases for teachers and state employees, although they’re not as large as those sought by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who was reviewing the measure, a spokesperson said. He’ll have 10 days to decide whether to sign the bill into law, veto it or let it become law without his signature. With more than 30 legislative Democrats voting for the measure, Cooper appears hard-pressed to have any veto he issues stick should GOP leaders attempt an override later this month. The House voted 82-25 and the Senate 36-8 for the measure with little debate Friday, approving it after Thursday’s more robust discussion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The state’s attorney general has found the sale of more than 2,000 acres of prime farmland to a group tied to Bill Gates complies with a Depression-era law meant to protect family farms because the land is being leased back to farmers. Republican Attorney General Drew Wrigley had inquired into the land sale and on Wednesday issued a letter saying the transaction complied with the archaic anti-corporate farming law. The law prohibits corporations or limited liability companies from owning farmland or ranchland, but it allows individual trusts to own the land if it is leased to farmers. The purchase of the land had raised legal questions, as well as concerns that ultra-rich landowners do not share the state’s values. Gates is considered the largest private owner of farmland in the country, with some 269,000 acres across dozens of states, Gates’ firm, Red River Trust, purchased $13.5 million worth of land in two counties from wealthy northeastern North Dakota potato growers Campbell Farms. In a curious move, the Campbell family in February filed a partnership name certificate with the North Dakota secretary of state naming their farming operation the Red River Trust – the same name as Gates’ firm. But an attorney for Gates’ firm wrote to the attorney general’s office that the Campbells registered the name without his knowledge.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A new law taking effect this fall will establish uniform rules for carrying knives across Ohio to prevent municipalities from enforcing local regulations, proponents say. The bill’s main sponsor, state Sen. Kristina Roegner, R-Hudson, said varying regulations create a confusing patchwork of laws that are tough to follow and enforce. Her legislation restricts local regulations on knife-carrying but doesn’t change the types of knives the state allows people to carry. In committee hearings, Democrats questioned the need for the mostly Republican-backed bill. Rep. Tavia Galonski, D-Akron, asked whether a change in law was necessary if no data exists to show the patchwork of knife regulations is a problem in Ohio. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed the bill in June. It takes effect in mid-September. Similar legislation was passed in Arizona in 2010 and has since been passed in at least 10 states, Roegner said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Court of Criminal Appeals on Friday set execution dates for six death row inmates, just hours before an attorney filed a motion for a rehearing in one case. Execution dates for James Coddington, Richard Glossip, Benjamin Cole, Richard Fairchild, John Hanson and Scott Eizember were scheduled, starting Aug. 25 with Coddington and followed on Sept. 22 with Glossip. Glossip, whose first conviction and death sentence were overturned, was hours from being executed in September 2015 following a second conviction and death sentence when prison officials realized they had received the wrong lethal drug. It was later learned the same wrong drug had been used previously to execute an inmate, and executions in the state were put on hold. Executions in Oklahoma resumed in October with John Grant, who convulsed on the gurney and vomited before being declared dead. Glossip’s attorney, Don Knight, later Friday filed for a new hearing based on an investigation by a Houston law firm that contends Glossip is innocent. The report by the law firm Reed Smith alleges that evidence was lost or destroyed and that a detective improperly asked leading questions to co-defendant Justin Sneed to implicate Glossip in the slaying of Barry Van Treese, the owner of the motel where Glossip worked.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Fender’s blue butterflies are only found in the Willamette Valley, living in prairie meadows among the Kinkaid’s lupine. But their numbers have shrunk as their habitat has disappeared. Environmentalists and federal officials are trying to change that. One of the largest known populations of the butterfly exists in the Baskett Slough National Wildlife Refuge, in Polk County west of Salem. In 2020, the Trust for Public Land secured 183 acres adjacent to the refuge to protect the habitat for the butterfly. Now, a secluded area of woods and prairie southeast of Brownsville is being targeted for a habitat restoration project by the Bureau of Land Management, which could include cutting down conifers in a commercial timber sale to protect its Fender’s blue butterfly population. BLM is seeking the public’s input on the tentative project through July 13. Over the years, conifer trees have encroached on the prairie meadows of the Oak Basin Prairies, reducing them by at least 20% since 1875. BLM now is stepping in with the goal of protecting both the butterflies and their host plant, Kincaid’s lupine, which is federally threatened. Cutting down the trees would in turn expand meadows for butterflies and reduce competition for oak trees.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A state court on Thursday permanently blocked Gov. Tom Wolf’s plan to toll as many as nine major bridges on interstates in Pennsylvania, siding with three Pittsburgh-area municipalities that argued his administration had violated procedures in getting to the advanced stage of considering the idea. A panel of Commonwealth Court judges granted the municipalities’ request to effectively declare the plan dead because Wolf’s Department of Transportation had not followed the law. One key element on which the court agreed with the municipalities is the claim that PennDOT was required to propose specific bridges to toll when it asked the Public-Private Transportation Partnership Board in 2020 for permission to move forward with a bridge-tolling plan. PennDOT did not, however, identify specific bridges it wanted to toll until months after the board approved a bridge-tolling plan. As a result, parties potentially affected by a tolling project, such as municipalities, had no opportunity to meaningfully give input to the process before the board’s decision, the court said. Republican lawmakers hailed the decision, while Wolf’s administration would not immediately say whether it would appeal it to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The loss for Wolf’s administration was the second in a row: A Commonwealth Court judge in a separate case in May had imposed a temporary injunction on the tolling projects.\n\nRhode Island\n\nJohnston: In a town where politics is often a family affair, the Democratic primary for state House District 42 could wind up looking more like a family feud. Dennis Cardillo Jr. has filed to run against his uncle Edward T. Cardillo Jr., who currently holds the seat. A second challenger, Kelsey Coletta, is the daughter of another lawmaker from the opposite side of the state, Rep. John “Jay” Edwards, D-Tiverton. The younger Cardillo, who oversees the night shift at a Pepsi-Cola plant, said he’s more educated than his uncle and wasn’t expecting him to seek reelection. The elder Cardillo, a former mechanic, did not respond to interview requests. Coletta – a social worker who said she’d be a more active representative than the incumbent – has her own unique family dynamic. She’s advocated at the State House for liberal causes such as reproductive rights and a less punitive approach to addiction, while her father tends to be slightly more conservative. Over time, she’s been able to inform his views on some issues, she said. Dennis Cardillo Jr. didn’t cite any specific disagreements with his father’s brother, who has typically been aligned with the conservative faction of the Rhode Island Democratic Party. “I don’t believe in talking badly about someone, but there is a difference in education level,” said the younger Cardillo, who has a bachelor’s in business administration from the University of Rhode Island. “I believe his highest level is just a high school diploma.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A cache of civil rights-era items with a local provenance has finally returned to the city, part of the holdings of the College of Charleston’s Avery Research Center thanks to a donation from the Merrill C. Berman Collection. Avery staff plan to mount an exhibition in 2023 contextualizing and interpreting the materials for public consumption, The Post and Courier reports. The collection includes the original tape of a Martin Luther King Jr. speech delivered July 30, 1967, at Charleston County Hall, as well as a recording surreptitiously made of a Ku Klux Klan rally the night before King’s appearance. It also contains audio of Ralph Abernathy’s lengthy speech of April 1, 1969, delivered during the Charleston Hospital Workers Strike. The items had belonged to Columbia-based journalist Eugene Sloan, who covered the events and made the recordings when he worked for The State newspaper. Avery Director Tamara Butler said the collection will help her team update a narrative that has long portrayed Charleston as a relatively mild-mannered place that saw far less confrontation and violence than cities such as Birmingham or Montgomery in Alabama. There’s a reason King came to Charleston in 1967, she said, with groundwork laid by local activists over many years in one of the freedom movement’s essential hubs. Butler wants to use the new gift and the history it represents as a tool to find related testimonies of racial resistance and rebellion.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Friday said she has applied for permission to hold a fireworks show at Mount Rushmore to celebrate Independence Day 2023, persisting even though the National Park Service has denied her requests for the past two years. In 2020, a fireworks display, featuring a fiery speech from then-President Donald Trump, was held at the monument after a decadelong hiatus. The Park Service has cited environmental concerns and objections from Native American tribes in denying subsequent permit applications. A federal judge last year rebuffed the Republican governor’s lawsuit that sought to force the Park Service to allow her to shoot fireworks over the granite monument. Noem has appealed that decision. “As Americans all across our great country make preparations to celebrate their Independence Day, we have once again been denied the opportunity to celebrate at our nation’s enduring symbol of freedom, Mount Rushmore National Memorial,” the governor said in a statement last week. The Department of Interior declined to comment on Noem’s application. Noem is running for reelection and is widely considered to be a potential Republican contender for the 2024 White House ticket. She often cites 2020’s fireworks celebration, when she shared the stage with Trump, as a highlight of her first term.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Nashville civil rights veteran Diane Nash, who led sit-ins, coordinated freedom rides and was jailed while pregnant for teaching minors nonviolent protest tactics, will be honored with a Presidential Medal of Freedom. The White House press office announced that Nash, and 16 others will receive the prestigious award Thursday. Famed Alabama civil rights lawyer Fred Gray, who attended school in Nashville and later led some of the most pivotal legal cases of the civil rights movement, will also receive the honor. The Medal of Freedom is the nation’s highest civilian honor, reserved for those who have made significant contributions to the “prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors,” the White House said. Nash, born in Chicago, moved to Nashville when she transferred to Fisk University in 1959. Incensed by the overt racism she saw, Nash joined the Rev. James Lawson’s nonviolence workshops, where participants role-played as demonstrators and attackers to ready themselves for all possibilities. Nash was elected chairperson of the Nashville movement, and she and the Student Central Committee staged sit-ins at lunch counters across the city. The city’s lunch counters were the first in the South to desegregate.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: An inmate who is set to be put to death in less than two weeks asked that his execution be delayed so he can donate a kidney. Ramiro Gonzales is scheduled to receive a lethal injection July 13 for fatally shooting 18-year-old Bridget Townsend, a southwest Texas woman whose remains were found nearly two years after she vanished in 2001. In a letter sent Wednesday, Gonzales’ lawyers, Thea Posel and Raoul Schonemann, asked Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to grant a 30-day reprieve so the inmate can be considered a living donor “to someone who is in urgent need of a kidney transplant.” They included a letter from Cantor Michael Zoosman, an ordained Jewish clergyman from Maryland who has been corresponding with Gonzales. “There has been no doubt in my mind that Ramiro’s desire to be an altruistic kidney donor is not motivated by a last-minute attempt to stop or delay his execution. I will go to my grave believing in my heart that this is something that Ramiro wants to do to help make his soul right with his God,” Zoosman wrote. Gonzales’ attorneys say he’s been determined an “excellent candidate” for donation after being evaluated by the transplant team at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. His rare blood type means his donation could benefit someone who might have difficulty finding a match.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Managers of the Switchpoint Community Resource Center held a ribbon-cutting and hosted tours Thursday to celebrate the first harvest of the center’s new RISE Garden, a grant-funded venture that endeavors to grow fresh food in a water-efficient way for southern Utah residents. Not only does the RISE Garden provide for those using Switchpoint services, but 80% of the harvest also goes toward the Southern Utah community each week, according to Linda Stay, Switchpoint’s development director. St. George Mayor Michele Randall and City Councilwoman Danielle Larkin made appearances at the ceremony and were among the first to purchase greens and goods from RISE Garden. “Switchpoint is the model for the entire state of Utah – and I think the country – and we are mentioned all the time, over and over and over again, for the great things we’re doing,” Randall said. Switchpoint uses towers that reuse water in order to take a more water-conservative approach to gardening. Subscriptions will be made available for those who want to make weekly pickups. According to the Switchpoint website, the garden uses aeroponic or vertical farming, and the RISE Garden saves 95% more space and water with no pesticides or genetically modified seeds.\n\nVermont\n\nPlymouth: The community of Plymouth Notch – birthplace of Calvin Coolidge, the only U.S. president born on the Fourth of July – commemorated his 150th birthday this holiday weekend. The President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site in Plymouth Notch hosted the celebration of Coolidge’s 150th birthday Monday, with a Vermont National Guard delegation leading a march to the Plymouth Notch Cemetery, where a birthday wreath from the White House was placed at Coolidge’s gravesite. “Calvin Coolidge preferred understated events, but the celebration of what would have been his 150th birthday, on the 246th birthday of our great nation, deserves some pomp and circumstance,” Vermont State Historic Preservation Officer Laura Trieschmann said in a news release. The Coolidge Cup, a national invitational speech and debate tournament sponsored by the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Foundation, also brought competitors to town for the weekend to compete for more than $15,000 in scholarship money. Coolidge served as the 30th president of the United States from 1923 to 1929, elevated from the vice presidency after Warren Harding died unexpectedly from a heart attack. Coolidge, a Republican, then won the 1924 election. The President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site includes his boyhood home, the homes of relatives and family friends, his family’s cheese factory, and his father’s store, which was used as the Summer White House in 1924.\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: As American citizens celebrated freedom and liberty in their nation on Independence Day in 1961, a government founded on notions of the inalienable human rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness took action at a local level to deny those rights to their fellow citizens whose skin was not white. This little-taught chapter of local history is being brought to life in an original play, “Buried Deep,” produced through Endstation Theatre Company, affiliated with Randolph College. On that sweltering July day in Lynchburg, as many residents sought the relief offered by public pools, the city closed those pools down because some Black residents went to swim in the whites-only pools at Miller and Riverside parks. They were exercising their civil rights and making intentional strides toward integration and equality when many people were content to drag their feet despite a federal court’s recent ruling that mandated desegregation nationwide. Today, if one visits Riverside Park, an indentation in the ground where a pool once stood remains as a permanent scar of racial tensions in the not-so-distant past. “Buried Deep” is part of Endstation’s New Works initiative, a program that supports playwrights who create a script based on some aspect of Lynchburg-area history.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: A nonprofit land trust has made its largest purchase ever to conserve 175 acres of forest and 3,500 feet of nearly pristine shoreline. Staff at the Whidbey Camano Land Trust said they knew they had to act quickly when a 226-acre beachfront property south of Coupeville came on the market last December. From the water, boaters may have seen the red house, old windmill, and cattle grazing atop the bluffs. The property near Keystone is home to one of the oldest farms on Whidbey Island. It also features a large forest and long stretch of beach. The site was at risk of being sold and developed into 22 high-end homes, according to the land trust. In late April, the land trust bought the property for $9.1 million, the most expensive purchase in the nonprofit’s nearly four-decade history. “We don’t get many opportunities to protect a chunk of habitat that size,” conservation director Ryan Elting told the Everett Herald. With the new property, called the Keystone Preserve, the trust will focus on habitat improvement and marine restoration. There are also plans to open public beach access as soon as 2024, as well as a trail network. The land trust has partnered with the Organic Farm School to manage the site. The nonprofit school on Whidbey Island will oversee the 50 acres of prairie and farm.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Hershel W. “Woody” Williams, the last remaining Medal of Honor recipient from World War II, will lie in honor at the U.S. Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday. “Woody Williams embodied the best of America: living a life of duty, honor and courage,” Pelosi said in a joint statement. Schumer called Williams “an American hero who embodied the best of our country and the greatest generation.” Williams, who died Wednesday at 98, was a legend in his home state for his heroics under fire over several crucial hours at the battle for Iwo Jima. As a young Marine corporal, Williams went ahead of his unit in February 1945 and eliminated a series of Japanese machine gun positions. Facing small-arms fire, Williams fought for four hours, repeatedly returning to prepare demolition charges and obtain flamethrowers. Later that year, the 22-year-old Williams received the Medal of Honor from President Harry Truman. The Medal of Honor is the nation’s highest award for military valor. In remarks at a memorial Sunday in Charleston, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin said Williams “never quit giving back.” That included raising money for gold star families – immediate family members of fallen service members – with an annual motorcycle ride. “It’s raised hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Manchin said. He joked that “it’s not going to be stopping, because Woody would come after me in a heartbeat.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nSheboygan: In four years, the city will lose its claim to having the world’s tallest free-flying American flag. The Acuity Insurance flagpole – the “World’s Tallest Symbol of Freedom” – stands 400 feet high. On July 4, 2026, the Flagpole of Freedom Park near Maine’s southeast coast is proposing to erect a flagpole larger than the Empire State Building. As the site is on a hill 315 feet tall, the 1,461-foot-high flagpole will reach 1,776 feet above sea level, which Flagpole of Freedom Park spokesperson Sarah Martin said pays homage to the year the United States declared independence. Although the Wisconsin flagpole will lose its distinction in the coming years, Acuity Communications Manager Paul Miller said it will still be a landmark. “The flagpole is one of the most visible landmarks on the Interstate 43 corridor and welcomes people to the Sheboygan community,” he said. “Many people stop to visit the flagpole, which is seen by drivers and passengers in over 50,000 vehicles that pass by our headquarters every day.” In addition to the flagpole, Acuity has a veterans memorial. There are 766 pavers with names of Sheboygan County residents who passed away serving in the line of duty in conflicts dating back to the Civil War. Miller said Acuity has no plans to increase the height of its flagpole because notching a record wasn’t the goal for building it.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The U.S. Capitol insurrection dominated Thursday’s debate among U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney and her four Republican primary challengers, with Cheney pressing her Donald Trump-backed opponent on whether she agreed with the ex-president’s claim that widespread fraud cost him reelection. Harriet Hageman said there were “serious concerns” about the 2020 election but stopped short of repeating Trump’s false claim that drove thousands of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Even so, Hageman was dismissive of the U.S. House commission vice-chaired by Cheney that has been investigating the insurrection and events leading up to it. “They’re focusing on something that happened 18 months ago. They’re not focused on things that are important to the people of Wyoming,” said Hageman, a Cheyenne ranching and natural resources attorney. Republicans, she said, were being punished for “exercising their First Amendment rights” – a remark on which Cheney pounced as suggesting the insurrection was justified. Cheney’s role as one of just two Republicans on the Jan. 6 panel has stirred a backlash in deep-red Wyoming. The state GOP last year censured Cheney and voted to no longer recognize her as a Republican. “I will not violate my oath of office, and if you’re looking for someone who will, you need to vote for someone else on this stage,” she said during Thursday’s debate.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/12/29/2020-coronavirus-impacted-everything-volusia-flagler/4056031001/", "title": "In 2020, coronavirus impacted everything in Volusia-Flagler", "text": "Pat Rice, Editor\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic started in China, quickly spread across the globe, and by March we knew that 2020 would be a year like no other.\n\nCOVID-19 impacted how we look. (Who thought the most ubiquitous clothing accessory of 2020 would be masks to cover our noses and mouths?)\n\nIt impacted how we greet each other, and how we say goodbye. (Would you like to fist bump or elbow bump?)\n\nIt financially impacted restaurants and retail stores and hotels and hair salons as people stopped traveling, dining out, and turned increasing to online shopping.\n\nIt impacted communication. Like many businesses, The News-Journal newsroom has been working remotely for months. Interaction between reporters and editors has been almost entirely via Zoom calls, cell phones, emails and texts.\n\nAbove all, COVID-19 impacted health. In Volusia and Flagler counties, the virus has claimed nearly 500 lives, and sickened thousands. Vaccines are finally arriving, but it will be months into 2021 before many of us can get a shot.\n\nThroughout it all, The News-Journal's reporters and photographers have worked harder than ever to deliver the news, much of it tragic but some of it triumphant. Here are some of our reporters' takes on 2020, and how the coronavirus impacted the news.\n\nJim Abbott, Tourism\n\nFor Volusia County’s tourism industry, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic hit like a nuclear blast, from record-setting declines in hotel occupancy and bed-tax collections in April to lingering aftershocks that will continue into 2021.\n\nIn March, as public health officials advised people to avoid large gatherings that could spread the virus, the pandemic derailed two of the area’s marquee special events, Bike Week and spring break.\n\nDuring Bike Week, Daytona Beach Mayor Derrick Henry ordered vendor permits pulled for the event’s final day in an effort to curb the virus’ spread. He took the unprecedented step of urged spring breakers not to come to the city amid the pandemic.\n\nA month later, as the worldwide travel industry slowed to a pandemic-induced standstill, Volusia County tourism bed tax collections fell by a staggering 79.1% in April, by far the biggest decline on record. Average hotel occupancy for the month was down by 81% compared with 2019.\n\nMore:Volusia hotel occupancy, bed taxes plummet 80%\n\nBy summer, however, consistent weekend business powered by day-trippers seeking socially distanced beach getaways helped hoteliers rebound at a faster pace than other tourism-reliant counties in Central Florida.\n\nIn October, powered by a scaled-down edition of Biketoberfest, tourism bed-tax collections were down by about 5% year-over-year. That compared with a 23.9% year-over-year decline for the month in Brevard County and a whopping 69% drop in October collections in Orange County.\n\nYet there are still obstacles ahead in the coming year.\n\nConvention and group travel business has yet to return, according to hoteliers, and the crucial influx of Canadian snowbirds has evaporated in the wake of COVID-related travel restrictions at the border.\n\nAttendance will be limited at key events such as the Daytona 500 and the Rolex 24 At Daytona, and it’s unclear what effect the pandemic will have on Bike Week’s return in March.\n\nWith a vaccine on the way, there’s reason for optimism, said Bob Davis, president and CEO of the Lodging & Hospitality Association of Volusia County. Yet there are still challenges ahead, he said.\n\n“We’re still coping with the virus, no doubt about it,” Davis said. “We’re praying that next year brings us some solace; that people will get their shots and tourism will come back. We’re working hard. We haven’t let up.”\n\nCassidy Alexander, Education\n\nYou don’t need me to tell you that 2020 has been a chaotic, dramatic, difficult and — there's really no other word for it — unprecedented year in education.\n\nIn February I wrote a series of stories about a group of high schoolers putting on a high school play. It was about the drama of the typical teenage experience. How could we have known that by the next month, the coronavirus pandemic would have stolen that typical experience and replaced it with an uncertain future?\n\nMore:Volusia parents bristle at graduation ceremony limits\n\nI spent the rest of the year covering the temporary end of in-person learning, drive-thru graduations, a summer of waiting games with state leadership, the struggle to access information, the question of keeping everyone safe in schools that used to be considered havens, and the obvious disruption to the learning process.\n\nIt’s been hard for anyone — parents, students, teachers, administrators — to get a strong foothold, to get in front of things.\n\nBut I’ve been galvanized by another aspect of life this year that we may not have talked about enough: resilience. The feeling of walking into a classroom and finding that it is, in fact, still a classroom where students can learn. The sight of educators putting in the time to make things work for their students and families in less-than-ideal circumstances. The inexhaustible shared belief that we can do better.\n\nSo yes. It’s been a chaotic, dramatic, difficult, unprecedented year. That won’t stop when the calendars change to 2021. But it’s also been a year in which learning continued, against all the odds. And that’s something.\n\nAbigail Brashear, Environment\n\nThis was an interesting year for a fledgling reporter like myself, who started her first full-time job at The News-Journal just before the pandemic hit.\n\nAs an environment, data and cities reporter, I cover everything from Ormond Beach’s City Commission meetings to septic tank pollution and beach erosion. In the first few months of the pandemic, I also spend time crunching coronavirus data.\n\nThe pandemic has dominated my coverage this year. I’ve covered how social distancing has affected beachgoers and protesting, and how only allowing essential workers to do their jobs changed air quality and manatee research.\n\nThe pandemic taught me the need for compassion in reporting. I wrote stories about DeLand families, already struggling from the pandemic whose homes were damaged when a tornado tore through the city. I covered a pride protest and spoke to people who were stuck at home with families who didn’t accept them. Giving a voice to the voiceless is part of our job, and it’s a job that I love.\n\nThe pandemic encouraged me to be more persistent as a reporter. Working from home threw everyone off for a while, but it forced me to expand the number of people I speak to regularly. I developed relationships based on the idea that the more people knew about the coronavirus, the better.\n\nThe pandemic also showed me the need to be a watchdog for our community. Once, I spent all night combing through and cleaning medical examiner data for a story about coronavirus deaths in of Florida.\n\nMore:Database: Florida's COVID-19 deaths\n\nI’m tired. It’s been a long, long year. But covering endangered right whales, manatees and sea turtles always makes me smile. I love talking to the people who live in this community.\n\nEven during a pandemic, Volusia and Flagler counties are passionate about the environment.\n\nFrank Fernandez, Courts and Palm Coast\n\nCovering courts in the time of coronavirus saw the drama of the courtroom diced up into boxes on a computer screen.\n\nYou “Zoomed” into and out of hearings. You watched as defendants sometimes appeared in court. But often the accused would appear in their own little box on a computer screen while they themselves sat in the larger box that was the Volusia County jail.\n\nIf they weren’t in jail, defendants appeared from wherever they happened to be: an apartment, a workplace or from their cars, sometimes driving around to find a sweet spot for cellphone reception.\n\nGoing to a courthouse meant getting your temperature taken as you walked in the door and answering the now-familiar virus-related questions.\n\nI also spent some of 2020 covering Palm Coast, where City Hall and elections provided plenty of controversy.\n\nPalm Coast Mayor Milissa Holland was the subject of an ethics complaint by the city’s former compliance manager, Jay Maher, who said Holland violated the city charter to benefit her employer, Coastal Cloud. The complaint is pending, and Holland has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nMore:Complaints detail accusations against Palm Coast mayor\n\nMaher retired but that didn’t stop the city from firing him retroactively in September. That meant Maher had both resigned and been fired, making him unique among a list of high-level employees who were either fired or resigned since the arrival of City Manager Matt Morton in 2019.\n\nHolland, with the help of out-of-town money, beat back a challenge from Alan Lowe to win a second term.\n\nMark Harper, Politics\n\nEarly in 2020, before the pandemic, it was obvious we were heading into a maelstrom of an election year. President Donald Trump was being impeached — remember that? — the Democratic field of presidential candidates remained wide open and people on all sides, it seemed, were angry.\n\nIn January, I rang up some life coaches. One suggested revisiting The Serenity Prayer on a regular basis: “Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.”\n\nI can only wish serenity, courage and wisdom weren’t in such short supply in 2020.\n\nThe pandemic exposed our fractures and gave rise to another virus: misinformation and disinformation. Intentional or not, it is clear a large portion of the electorate seems either incapable of or unwilling to distinguish fact from fiction. And many so-called leaders fully capable of grasping facts are embedding themselves into the fiction for their own self-interest.\n\nMore:Politics stressing you out? Here’s how to cope in 2020\n\nDepending on where you sit, the presidential election is now either six weeks over or not yet done. Where I sit, in reality, the election is over. Joe Biden won. Donald Trump lost. This is not a matter of opinion but a matter of fact. Biden won more votes. He won the Electoral College.\n\nBold claims about widespread voter fraud were sizzle without steak.\n\nAnd case by case, death by death, the pandemic has proven itself a true tragedy.\n\nLord, grant me the serenity …\n\nEileen Zaffiro-Kean, Daytona Beach\n\nOne of Daytona Beach's biggest stories of 2020 was unquestionably the explosion of development taking place between the Halifax River and Ridgewood Avenue.\n\nThe new $65 million, 11-story Brown & Brown headquarters building overlooking the river is about to start welcoming new employees. Riverfront Park is in the middle of a $23 million reinvention hoped to be complete late next year.\n\nA Tampa-based developer is moving forward with plans to build 200 new apartments and a 500-space parking garage on a vacant property at the corner of International Speedway Boulevard and Ridgewood Avenue.\n\nMore:Downtown Daytona Beach getting new apartments, parking garage\n\nThe city just completed a $4 million reconfiguration and revitalization of Beach Street between Orange Avenue and Bay Street. And Burgoyne Properties is hoping to get final approval from city commissioners in early next 2021 to move forward with plans to build multi-family housing, a parking garage, hotel, office space, shops and restaurants on its property fronting Beach Street between International Speedway Boulevard and Bay Street.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic made covering city of Daytona Beach stories more of a challenge. But I was always able to figure out a way to get the information I needed. Google, websites, social media, Zoom, live streaming, emails, texts and cell phones are wonderful tools for pandemic-era reporters.\n\nThe best way to get the most detail and information for most stories is to see and hear things in person. But looking back, I don't think much of what I normally do was compromised. I was able to watch most meetings either online or on a government TV channel. I did most interviews over the phone, and I don't think that hampered the vast majority of conversations. And I still drove to places I wrote about, and talked to people in relatively safe outdoor situations.\n\nClayton Park, Business\n\nMy top story of 2020: How the coronavirus pandemic sped up rather than slowed growth on Daytona’s LPGA corridor\n\nWhen the coronavirus pandemic caused the local economy to lurch to an abrupt halt in March, I thought Daytona Beach’s LPGA Boulevard would wind up stuck with a bunch of stalled half-built projects.\n\nWrong.\n\nThe east-west corridor had been the region’s epicenter for growth and development in recent years. The LPGA’s area’s new developments include the Latitude Margaritaville 55-and-older community, thee ICI Homes all-ages Mosaic communities, the side-by-side Tanger Outlets and Tomoka Town Center shopping centers, and a slew of new luxury apartments.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis only served to speed up that area’s growth.\n\nLatitude Margaritaville community saw the completion of more than 400 homes in both 2018 and 2019. That number is expected to hit or come close to reaching 500 in 2020, according to developer Bill Bullock of Minto Communities.\n\nThe reason: an increase in newcomers leaving more densely populated urban areas in the Northeast and upper Midwest.\n\nMore:Margaritaville is biggest beneficiary of Daytona's building permit fee waiver\n\nBut Minto was far from being the only one to accelerate construction activity in the LPGA area this year.\n\nNorth American Development Group, the developer of Tomoka Town Center, completed two new retail buildings and is proceeding with plans to further develop the shopping center in 2021.\n\nAnother developer, Orlando-based Unicorp began constructing a new shopping center across the street called Shoppes at Williamson Crossing that is expected to welcome several new restaurants and shops in the new year.\n\nAnd an Ohio developer recently won a federal contract to begin building a new Veteran’s Affairs outpatient center next to Daytona State College’s Advanced Technology College.\n\nMeanwhile, Orlando developer Beat Kahli is proceeding with plans to break ground in 2021 on a mixed-use development called Avalon Park Daytona Beach that could bring as many as 10,000 new homes and 1 million square feet of retail and office space. The project will cover 3,000 acres stretching from Latitude Margaritaville north to State Road 40/West Granada Boulevard.\n\nAnd set to open in the first quarter of 2021, along the northeast side of the Interstate 95/LPGA interchange, will be a supersized Buc-ee’s that will become the largest gas station in Florida with 120 fuel pumps.\n\nAll this growth is increasing concerns about traffic congestion along LPGA and other roads in the area. A new group called the LPGA Coalition has been formed to study possible solutions and how to fund them.\n\nDevelopers have stepped up construction activity because they are betting that the demand will be stronger than ever for new homes, shops and restaurants in the LPGA area when the pandemic finally comes to an end.\n\nNikki Ross, Health\n\nAt the start of 2020, I thought I was going to complete large projects on the impact of Florida’s Baker Act on children, and the frequency of hospital transfers in Volusia and Flagler counties.\n\nInstead, I was thrust into daily, round the clock coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. It has been an onslaught of stories about death, hospitalizations and rising cases.\n\nI write The News-Journal's daily coronavirus update. I also keep up with ever-evolving information about the virus, it’s spread and the COVID-19 vaccine. Seemingly every story I write now has some element of the virus, including stories about Flagler County Government, which I also cover.\n\nOne of the most memorable stories I wrote was back in March, about an Ormond Beach resident hospitalized with coronavirus. She told me that the country was not prepared for what the virus would do to people. She was right.\n\nMore:Coronavirus-positive Volusia resident: ‘This country is not prepared’\n\nThat woman was the first person with coronavirus I ever interviewed, but not the last. I still think about her and her journey today. Thankfully, she recovered.\n\nAnother story that sticks out in my mind is that of 26-year-old Emily Murkerson, who died at Halifax Health after she was hit by a car in Daytona Beach. Because of coronavirus, her family wasn’t allowed to see her while she was hospitalized and after her death, her parents blamed the hospital for not letting them sit with her. That was in April, when hospital restrictions were the norm nationwide.\n\nIn a normal year, a girl being hit by a car and dying in a local hospital wouldn’t have been major news. It might have been written up as a brief, if that. But because of the coronavirus pandemic, and the circumstances surrounding her stay at the hospital, it became national news.\n\nThe virus isn’t going away any time soon. My hope for 2021 is that the stories will become positive with the introduction of the vaccine and as health experts understand the nature of the virus.\n\nVictoria Villavueva-Marquez, Social Services\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic worsened problems for many of those who had already fallen on hard times.\n\nSome faced heightened levels of anxiety and depression. Others lost their lives to addiction. But while the pandemic caused tragedy, there were many heroic efforts to answer the call for help.\n\nFor a mother of four whose newborn arrived on Easter, fear set in moments after the infant took his first breaths. Jessica Johnson, 33, wondered whether the nurses who entered her room at Halifax Health Medical Center in Daytona Beach had come in contact with someone who had contracted the coronavirus. She worried that she would not be able to protect her newborn son from potential infection.\n\nMore:Amid coronavirus, new mothers fear for their babies\n\nThe good news was that her baby was fine. But COVID-19 caused immense stress for pregnant women and new mothers, which posed a serious threat to their health. One expert told me that anxiety releases a hormone called cortisol that can contribute to pre-term labor.\n\nAs Volusia County sank deeper into the pandemic, it became evident that the crisis had taken a serious toll on the mental health of many across the area. One mental health organization that has been around for more than 10 years provided a record number of therapy sessions in October.\n\nDrug abuse also increased in Volusia and Flagler counties. The area's drug crisis existed long before coronavirus, but with it came a corresponding increase in drug deaths and nonfatal overdoses.\n\nIn September, the Volusia Recovery Alliance led law enforcement leaders and addiction advocates in a Zoom call, where the meeting participants came up with ideas to decrease drug overdoses.\n\nThe Alliance to put out a call for volunteers with lived experience who could respond to the scenes of drug overdoses with Volusia County sheriff’s deputies. The organization also started passing out the overdose-reversal medication naloxone and other harm reduction supplies to drug users across the county.\n\nAnd as the pandemic put thousands of people in the region out of work, there was an unparalleled demand for food.\n\nThe Council on Aging of Volusia County was among several organizations that delivered meals to the doorsteps of older adults who were confined to their homes.\n\nIn July, the number of clients who received meals through the Meals on Wheels program climbed from 326 to more than 600. Meanwhile, the number of volunteers who delivered those meals dropped from 220 to 150. But the smaller number of volunteers made sure everyone was fed.\n\nNumerous other groups also stepped up too provide food and other essentials to those in need. Even nine months into the ongoing crisis, help remains available.\n\nKen Willis, Sports\n\nThinking back to the pandemic’s effects on the local sports scene, I think about our biggest and oldest franchises — NASCAR and the Daytona Tortugas — as well as some rare industries that didn’t just survive the shutdowns and slowdowns, but sometimes thrived.\n\n• The 2020 Daytona 500 was run roughly a month before the world shut down, but when recalling the usual scene from that day — particularly the throngs of humanity milling about during pre-race festivities — it seems like decades ago.\n\nMore:Ryan Newman’s Daytona 500 wreck reminds us of racing’s danger | KEN WILLIS\n\nAs March turned into April, a lot of plans were worked and reworked inside the glass building on Speedway Boulevard, and eventually NASCAR found a way to crank the engines and bring back live competition to televisions across the land.\n\nThe revamped schedule included two gap-filling events at Daytona International Speedway — a sports-car race in July and the debut of the Speedway’s road course for NASCAR, in August.\n\n• The Tortugas were prepared for a year-long celebration of the 100th anniversary of professional baseball on City Island. But it was going to be cloaked in dread, since the Tortugas were rumored to be among the teams on the chopping block as Major League Baseball planned to reduce the minor leagues by about 25% of its teams.\n\nBad news: There would be no 100th anniversary season because the minor leagues were shut down. Good news: There would be a 101st anniversary season, because in the end, the Tortugas made the cut.\n\n• When golf was deemed a safe activity, with certain restrictions, most local courses were able to continue paying the bills. Some even saw an uptick in summertime numbers during a time of year when local play usually slows down dramatically.\n\n• Did you see the boat ramps and fishing piers over the summer and early fall? It seems a lot of locals came to realize just how much water we have around here. The result was a run on live bait and the emptying of inventory at area boat dealerships.\n\nAnd you probably know what that means. Assuming things return to normal sometime in 2021, expect to see a lot of \"slightly used\" boats for sale by summer.\n\nZach Dean, Sports\n\nNormally, the sports world never takes time off. There’s always a game on.\n\nBut then the coronavirus brought the country to its knees back in March, and the dominos started to fall.\n\nFirst it was the NBA. Then March Madness. Then spring training. Then NASCAR.\n\nFor years, all I’d done was write about sports. The pandemic changed that.\n\nI remember calling Bethune-Cookman head basketball coach Ryan Ridder the day after the Wildcats’ MEAC tournament was canceled. Before starting the interview, he said “Wait. Zach. What exactly are you going to do now?”\n\nI had no clue. Nine months later (how is that possible?!), I’m still not sure how I got through those few months, but I’m glad I went through it.\n\nI helped, a lot, on the news-side, writing stories about toilet paper shortages (yep), beach openings, and closings, and reopenings, COVID survivors, and outdoor churches. Did I love it? No. Did I miss sports? You have no idea. But I think I grew as a writer because of it.\n\nMore:After 8 weeks, Ormond coronavirus survivor returns home with “second chance” at life\n\nMore:Coronavirus: Volusia shoppers endure long lines, morning mayhem\n\nSports eventually returned. First it was NASCAR, then golf, then MLB, NBA, NHL, college football and the NFL. We had football back Thursday-thru-Monday every week this past fall, and it was glorious. I want to thank everyone who made it possible.\n\nI learned a lot about myself when the sports world stopped. I’m glad I did. Now please, don’t ever, ever do that again.\n\nChris Boyle, Sports\n\nRarely this year — this seemingly endless, occasionally hopeless year — have I felt uplifted. But two instances come to mind — a pair of stories I wrote in the last couple weeks of October.\n\n\"Overcoming adversity\" is an oft-used cliche in high school sports, the beat I have covered since 2013. But two teenagers — Flagler Palm Coast junior football player Jayden Wilkinson and Seabreeze cheerleader/basketball player Julia Bosset — truly experienced adversity, head-on.\n\nMore:FPC junior lineman Jayden Wilkinson upbeat in battle with rare form of leukemia\n\nIn the weeks leading up to fall football season, after getting the green light to play in spite of the ongoing pandemic, Wilkinson became sick and later learned he had acute myeloid leukemia. He's undergone three rounds of chemotherapy along and four lumbar punctures, and he's due for a bone marrow transplant in the opening week of 2021. Julie Diaz, Wilkinson's mother, told me just before Thanksgiving her son is \"kicking butt.\"\n\nMore:FOR JULIA: Matt Bosset, Seabreeze dedicate football win to his sister after cardiac arrest\n\nBosset, meanwhile, collapsed onto the court during her team's first conditioning session and went into cardiac arrest. School resource officer Iriabeth Lee, administered CPR, which proved pivotal in saving her life. A week later, Julia returned home to celebrate her brother Matt's 18th birthday with her parents and the family's beloved dog, Bosston. She cheered Matt and the rest of the Sandcrabs' football players on from the sidelines when they squared off with rival Mainland on Oct. 30.\n\nIt warms my heart to pen a happy ending. Boy, did we need a few of them in 2020.\n\nPatricio Balona, Justice\n\nThe pandemic, unfortunately, did not curtail crime in Volusia and Flagler counties in 2020.\n\n“The (reporting party) is saying a female was stabbed in the face inside the City Island Library,” dispatchers relayed to police over the scanner on the morning of Sept. 15.\n\nAs a longtime Crimes/Public Safety reporter, it is not unusual to hear people being hurt. But the story of a 63-year-old library assistant attacked by a homeless man with a pair of scissors at the Daytona Beach Regional Library at City Island, stands out as the most memorable crime story of the year.\n\nMore:Police: Employee attacked with scissors inside Daytona Beach library; suspect is in custody\n\nPolice and first responders rushed to the scene of the scissors attack and reported finding the victim, Kaia Simonson, bleeding heavily from the face and in and out of consciousness. Former Police Chief Craig Capri would later say Simonson suffered a broken nose and stab wounds to one of her eyes. The attack led to the immediate closure of the library, prompted increased police patrols in the area and Volusia County officials added a second security guard at the building.\n\nSince the coronavirus pandemic, I have mostly been working from home. That places me an hour away from Daytona Beach, so I rely on scanner traffic and sources who have come to trust me as a reporter to keep up with breaking news.\n\nI quickly Tweeted the breaking news of the scissors attack and filed a short story. Shortly after, I got a call from then Deputy Chief Jakari Young, who is now the Daytona Beach police Chief. He confirmed all the information I had gathered including the nature of the attack, the name of the suspect and that Simonson was taken to Halifax Health Medical Center.\n\nCrime, of course, never stops.\n\nIn November, a wave of shootings rocked Daytona Beach in a six-day period. Four people were killed and five others were wounded by gunfire between Nov. 23 and Nov. 30. Three of the fatal shootings involved men quarreling over women. A fourth case was a killing during a game of cards, according to Daytona Beach police.\n\nKatie Kustura, West Volusia\n\nIt’s been nearly a year since Jane Shang resigned as city manager of Deltona, and the city is still lacking a permanent manager.\n\nMotions to terminate Shang, who served as the manager for four and a half years, had been made at a few different points during her last couple of years with the city. The one that nearly led to her ousting was made by Mayor Heidi Herzberg. The City Commission 4--3 vote on Jan. 21, 2020, wasn’t enough to fire Shang, as a super majority is required.\n\nBut the commission followed up with a 4-3 vote of no confidence. Shang resigned soon thereafter. The commission voted unanimously the following week to accept Shang’s resignation and to move Marc-Antonie Cooper from deputy city manager to interim city manager.\n\nMore:Jane Shang resigns as Deltona's city manager\n\nSeverance pay and accrued leave for Shang carried a price tag of $286,881.\n\nCooper held the helm until Nov. 19 when the commission voted 4-3 to have him return to the role of deputy city manager and then voted 6-1 to offer John Peters III, who was serving as the public works director, the role of interim manager.\n\nOne noticeable change since Peters was promoted: Plexiglass dividers between the commissioners on the dais, and additional socially-distanced seating for residents on the floor of the commission’s chambers.\n\nOther cities in West Volusia have taken similar measures due to the coronavirus pandemic. DeBary, DeLand, Lake Helen and Orange City also set up socially-distanced seating for meeting attendees. DeLand and Orange City’s representatives passed mandates requiring face coverings indoors, and DeBary, Deltona and Lake Helen approved resolutions encouraging the wearing of masks to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\n\nErica Van Buren, Flagler County\n\nThe year that was 2020 brought on a number of challenges.\n\nThe “Flagler Beach dune project could be in jeopardy”, reads the headline of the first story published in June that led me to become the self-proclaimed “Dune Queen.”\n\nI had no idea that six stories later the dune project would still be underway. The Flagler Beach community shared mixed feelings about the $17 million project, which is fully funded with federal and state dollars.\n\nThe purpose of the 2.6-mile project requires property owners with parcels east of State Road A1A from South 6th Street to South 28th Street, to grant easements to the federal, state and local agencies involved so they can add sand and natural vegetation to dunes that protect the road from the Atlantic Ocean. A1A has washed out during two recent hurricanes.\n\nHowever, a number of residents refuse to sign the easement, which has caused the project to be delayed a number of times.\n\nMore:Flagler County commissioners approve eminent domain for dune restoration project\n\nIn August, a resident started a crowdfunding campaign to rally everyone together. The purpose was to convince the homeowners holding out to get on board with the project. As of Dec. 22 the GoFundMe page has raised $49,000. The money raised is designated for the homeowners currently holding out.\n\nTackling such a story in the midst of a pandemic has made connecting with city officials and other potential sources a bit challenging. Pre-pandemic, it was easy to catch a council member or commissioner after a meeting to get answers to follow up questions. But speaking with city officials was especially difficult when meetings were held virtually.\n\nNow that the meetings are hybrid, virtual and in person connecting is a bit easier. Still, taking the proper precautions to guard against catching the coronavirus is still a reality. Wearing facial coverings, making sure to keep a safe distance, fighting the urge to reach out and shake someone’s hand at the beginning of an introduction, adds an additional layer of challenges.\n\nAs a journalist, my job is to give a voice to the voiceless during these unprecedented times. I must remain unbiased, even though the loss we’ve experienced as a nation affected me personally. I lost my mother to the coronavirus earlier this year.\n\nThat adds another challenge. How can I speak for the voiceless when my own voice is muffled?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/14/world/gallery/ukraine-russia-crisis/index.html", "title": "Photos: Russia invades Ukraine | CNN", "text": "Cars burn after a Russian military strike in central Kyiv, Ukraine, on October 10. At least 19 people were killed and more than 100 injured in Russian missile strikes on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities on Monday as Moscow targeted critical energy infrastructure.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship, Russia launched an unprecedented assault on Ukraine in late February.\n\nExplosions rang through a number of Ukrainian cities, including the capital Kyiv, in a broad invasion that began before dawn on February 24.\n\nBut 100 days later, the invasion has not been the military success Moscow hoped.

That's not to mention Rihanna's halftime show or the pregame performances from Chris Stapleton, Babyface and Sheryl Lee Ralph.\n\nHere's a recap of celebrity sightings, fan events, autograph signings, concerts, parties — all the biggest moments before, and during, the big game.\n\nSuper Bowl in Arizona 2023: Updates on traffic, weather, restrictions\n\nTravis Kelce is ready to party after the trophy ceremony\n\nWell done, whoever plays music over the public-address system at State Farm Stadium.\n\nLiterally.\n\nDuring the trophy ceremony immediately following the thrilling game, in which the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35 with a field goal in the final seconds, Travis Kelce did what he does from the on-field stage: Screamed, \"You gotta fight! For your right!\"\n\nAnd then he let the Chiefs fans finish, \"TO PARRRRRRTTTTY!\"\n\nWhich they did, screaming with delight. And immediately the stadium speakers blasted \"Fight for Your Right\" by the Beastie Boys.\n\nRock on.\n\nSuper Bowl 57 comes to a dramatic end\n\nThe tension inside State Farm Stadium was incredible — as was the noise.\n\nNo surprise, since these are two of the loudest fan bases in the NFL. They went back and forth through the second half till Kansas City kicked a field goal with 11 seconds left to go up 38-35.\n\nIt was a wild end to a wild day. Which made it kind of perfect.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nPregnant and stunning in red: Rihanna crushed the Super Bowl 2023 halftime show\n\nAfter party: 7 Westgate restaurant and bars offer late hours on Super Bowl Sunday\n\nWhether you celebrating your team's win or looking for a pick-me-up if they didn't, you won't need to go far for a post-game drink.\n\nSeven restaurants and bars near the stadium at Westgate Entertainment District are staying open late after the game. Karaoke, check; food, check; drinks, check; pool, check.\n\nHere are seven restaurants and bars with extended hours on game day.\n\n— Bahar Anooshahr\n\nAfter a powerhouse Super Bowl performance, everyone wants to know: Is Rihanna pregnant again?\n\nAt around 6:28 p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 12, the yearslong Rihanna drought came to an end.\n\nAmid the excitement surrounding hearing her perform classics like \"Umbrella,” there was rampant speculation on social media about whether Rihanna is pregnant again nine months after giving birth to her first son. Some posts were more tactful than others.\n\nThe NFL shared footage of A$AP Rocky enjoying Rihanna’s performance and some millennials drew parallels between Rihanna’s backup dancers’ outfits and the 2008 Disney film ‘Minutemen.’\n\nA representative for Rihanna confirmed that she is indeed expecting her next child, making her Super Bowl performance possibly the biggest pregnancy reveal ever.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nRihanna reasserts her pop music dominance at her halftime show\n\nWe’ve all been wondering who Rihanna might bring out to join her in the spotlight when she took the world’s biggest stage at State Farm Stadium for the Super Bowl 2023 halftime show and … surprise.\n\nShe got along just fine without a single cameo.\n\nRihanna made her entrance on a floating platform high above the field, rocking a stylish red jumpsuit and matching latex bustier singing “Bitch Better Have My Money,” seamlessly working her way through a dizzying celebration of her catalog that put the focus squarely on her most iconic hits, from “Umbrella” to “Work.”\n\nShe hasn’t toured since late 2016 and this halftime show more than lived up to the promise of a world-class performer reasserting her place in the pop music stratosphere.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nRihanna's Super Bowl 2023 playlist: Here's every song from her halftime show performance\n\nOne fan paid over $30K for her seat. Was it worth it?\n\nLiz Foster had the best seat in the house for Super Bowl 57, between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAnd she’s a Cincinnati Bengals fan. She and her husband Bill bought the tickets before the AFC Championship, in which the Chiefs beat Cincinnati.\n\n“We were just hoping the Bengals would be here so we planned ahead,” Foster said. “We were putting out good vibes.”\n\nThey were also putting out good money — Foster wouldn’t come clean on exactly how much they spent, but she hinted at it — “30-ish,” she said.\n\nAs in $30,000?\n\n“Plus some.”\n\nPlus how much? Foster wasn’t saying. But even without her favorite team playing in the game, she said a backup plan:\n\n“I’m here for Rihanna.”\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nFan zone:The best seat at Super Bowl 2023 cost her $30,000 (plus some). And she's a Bengals fan\n\nFans at the Hance Park watch party aren't just blown away by Rihanna\n\nIt's getting a bit rough in downtown Phoenix for us mere mortals who didn't make it inside State Farm Stadium in Glendale.\n\nThe winds are whipping around Margaret T. Hance Park, where the official NFL watch party is underway at the Super Bowl Experience. According to the National Weather Service, the wind is blowing west at more than 20 mph, kicking up dead grass and the few leaves left on the trees.\n\nThat hasn't tamped down the excitement at the park, where it's been difficult — if at all possible — to navigate from one side to the other because the crowd in front of the stage is just that dense.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nAre you ready for Rihanna?\n\nThe Super Bowl has rarely had a more anticipated halftime show.\n\nRihanna, one of the most successful pop sensations of the century, is making her return to live performance for the first time since 2018, when she did the Grammys. It's been even longer since she’s toured.\n\nWe spoke to several members of the team that helped her put this show together and they promised us \"It's nothing like you've ever seen before.” Her music director added, “Trust me, this is my fourth Super Bowl halftime. And I must say, Rihanna has pushed the bar.\"\n\nThe singer herself is promising a “jam-packed ... celebration of my catalog in the best way that we could have put it together.\"\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nAdele at State Farm Stadium for the Super Bowl: 'I'm going just for Rihanna'\n\nAdele is cheering for Team Rihanna at Super Bowl 2023 in Glendale, just like she promised.\n\nThe British singer — who can always be counted on for a good reaction meme — was spotted in a box at State Farm Stadium on Sunday. Just over a week earlier, she told the crowd at one of her Las Vegas residency shows that she's \"going just for Rihanna.\"\n\nHopefully there will be some cameras pointed her way during the halftime show performance.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nChris Stapleton spared us the all-too-common national anthem showboating\n\nIs Chris Stapleton “only the best voice in the world,” as Babyface suggested at a press conference in downtown Phoenix Thursday morning?\n\nTo be fair, few singers could hope to live up to that level of hype. But Stapleton does have a wonderful voice, as anyone at all familiar with the Grammy-winning country singer’s catalog would surely testify.\n\nAnd he used it to brilliant effect at State Farm Stadium without making it feel like he was out there to impress us with a show of vocal pyrotechnics.\n\nIt was more about the song itself, which as Stapleton said, can go horribly wrong. But this one didn’t.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nReview:Chris Stapleton's deeply soulful Super Bowl national anthem, plus Sheryl Lee Ralph, Babyface\n\nSheryl Lee Ralph delivers a monumental ‘Lift Every Voice and Sing’\n\nSheryl Lee Ralph, the Emmy-winning star of “Abbott Elementary,” got the pregame entertainment off to a breathtaking start with her version of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the Black national anthem, looking powerful in a flowing, off-the-shoulder red gown and matching gloves.\n\nAt Thursday’s pregame press conference in Phoenix, Ralph said her goal was “to make sure we could have a version for people to understand the great lyrics of this song and what it means.”\n\nAnd that’s exactly how it went, a life-affirming testament to the deep meaning of the lyrics, well served by Ralph’s Broadway experience. If you didn’t understand those lyrics, you weren’t listening. — Ed Masley\n\nHere's what to expect in 2023:How long does the Super Bowl national anthem take?\n\nHow to watch Chris Stapleton sing the national anthem at Super Bowl 2023\n\nCountry superstar Chris Stapleton will sing the national anthem just before Super Bowl 2023 kicks off at 4:30 p.m. Sunday at State Farm Stadium.\n\nHe’ll be joined in the pregame ceremonies by Babyface, who will sing “America the Beautiful,” and Sheryl Lee Ralph, of “Abbot Elementary,” who will sing “Lift Every Voice and Sing.”\n\nEach song will be performed in American Sign Language as well, by Arizona native Troy Kotsur, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for “Coda”; Colin Denny, a member of the Navajo Nation in Arizona; and Justina Miles.\n\nHere’s everything to know about today’s national anthem, including how long it might last.\n\n— Jill Cassidy\n\nSuper Bowl pregame: Sheryl Crow soaks up the sun, suggests new footwear for Patrick Mahomes\n\nSheryl Crow was midway through a hit-filled concert at the On Location tailgate party outside State Farm Stadium when she took a moment to reflect on her footwear — spectacular studded black open-toed clogs with heels that had to be at least 4 inches high.\n\n“All I’m saying,” she said, “is I think Patrick Mahomes should have to run in these shoes.”\n\nThat would definitely be a game changer.\n\nCrow and her band took the stage to a raucous recording of the Rolling Stones’ “Start Me Up” — a bold move, to be sure, and a handy frame of reference for the brand of rock ‘n’ roll that has underscored her finest hours from the start.\n\nAfter setting the tone with “If It Makes You Happy,” Crow proceeded through such classics as “A Change Will Do You Good,” the decidedly Stonesy “My Favorite Mistake” (which always makes me think of “Goats Head Soup”), her stellar cover of Cat Stevens’ “The First Cut Is the Deepest,” “Soak Up the Sun,” her breakthrough single “All I Wanna Do” and “Every Day Is a Winding Road.”\n\n“Can you believe this weather?!” she asked. “It’s supposed to be snowing in Nashville today. I’m just really happy to be here, if nothing else to give myself a killer suntan.”\n\nShe also took a moment to note another cause to celebrate this weekend.\n\n“Yesterday was my birthday,” she said. “I’m 38 again.”\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nThe downtown Phoenix Super Bowl action has moved to Hance Park\n\nThe Super Bowl Experience at Phoenix Convention Center is officially over, and the NFL fans who have swarmed downtown Phoenix for the past week moved north to Margaret T. Hance Park for the free Super Bowl Experience fan event.\n\nThat’s where the NFL’s first ever official Super Bowl watch party is taking place on what officials claimed were the largest LED screens in Arizona. An hour and a half before kickoff, the bar scene near the Convention Center was subdued, with a smattering of patrons at venues such as Majerle’s Sports Grill and Barrel and Bushel.\n\nThe real fans — sorry, not sorry — were at Hance Park, biding their time by completing the QB obstacle course, playing corn hole and enjoying local food and drinks.\n\nThe lines for the bars, craft beer and portable toilets were manageable with an hour to go before kickoff. Visitors were eager to get their hands on some food; lines for the vendors on the north side of Hance Park far surpassed the shorter ones on the south side.\n\nBut the majority of fans were staked out in front of the screens, braving the full sun exposure (my weather app showed it was 76 degrees) as they sat on blankets and folding chairs.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nHance Park dining guide:What to eat and drink at the 2023 Super Bowl Experience\n\nWhat channel is the Super Bowl on?

Then she reportedly removed all her photos with MGK and unfollowed everyone except Harry Styles, Timothée Chalamet and Eminem.\n\nShe has since appeared to have deactivated her Instagram.\n\nOnly time will tell what this development actually means.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nRihanna, Dave Grohl, Paris Hilton:Celebrities spotted in Phoenix for Super Bowl 2023\n\nSibling rivalry at Super Bowl 57\n\nCornell and Darlene Brooks are siblings who may agree on some things, but football isn't one of them. Though the pair are attending Super Bowl 57 at State Farm Stadium together.\n\nCornell, from Chicago, wore a Kansas City Chiefs jersey. Darlene, from coastal Mississippi, wore a Philadelphia Eagles jersey.\n\n“She doesn’t know what she’s doing,” Cornell said of his sister. “She’s starting to get on my nerves.”\n\nFor her part, Darlene responded with an eye roll. Nothing like sibling rivalry.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nA peek inside the swag bags for premium seat ticketholders\n\nAs if great seats weren’t enough, fans sitting in the best seats in State Farm Stadium had a cooler full of snacks waiting for them.\n\nZachary Ginsberg of Scottsdale was one such fan. He was sitting with his father, who got the tickets.\n\n“I’m a plus-one,” Zachary said.\n\nInside the collapsible cooler was a Twix candy bar, almonds, Skittles, Doritos and … condiments.\n\nWhy condiments?\n\n“You can never have enough mustard and ketchup,” Zachary said. Fair enough.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nSuper Bowl announcers walk the field at State Farm Stadium\n\nThe NFL on Fox crew set up on the field just outside the Kansas City Chiefs endzone. Meanwhile, announcers Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen walked the field, chatting with players and surveying the scene.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nDon't let Tom Brady make it his last:Greg Olsen is about to call his first Super Bowl\n\nSuper Bowl 57 is all about sponsorships\n\nEverything is sponsored at Super Bowl 57. Even the pop-up store in State Farm Stadium. It’s open for Arizona Cardinals games all season long, but Sunday its stock was limited to Frito Lay and Anheuser-Busch. So if you wanted Lay's potato chips or Bud Light, this is the place for you.\n\nOn the other hand, what else do you really need?\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nOh, it’s on: Puppy Bowl is happening now.

By 12:30 p.m., hundreds of people were trudging down the street in a line toward the stadium.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nPlan ahead: Super Bowl travelers should allow extra time when returning rental cars to Sky Harbor Airport\n\nAt least 180,000 passengers were expected at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on the Monday after the Super Bowl. That's about 60,000 more people than an average day.\n\nThousands of those people will be returning cars to the Rental Car Center. If you’re one of them, allow yourself ample time to drop off your car and ride the PHX Sky Train to your terminal. Airport staff recommends Super Bowl travelers allow at least four hours before departure to return car rentals.\n\nThe Rental Car Center is at 1805 E. Sky Harbor Circle South, south of Buckeye Road. It's accessible via exit 149 off Interstate 10. It’s roughly 2 miles from Terminal 3 and Terminal 4.\n\nHere are more tips on how to navigate Sky Harbor Airport after the Super Bowl.\n\n— Michael Salerno\n\nWhat to expect from Rihanna's halftime show, in her own words\n\nIn the event that you’re wondering what to expect from Rihanna when she hits the stage at State Farm Stadium, she shed some light on that in downtown Phoenix on Thursday, promising “a jam-packed show.” Her biggest challenge was \"trying to cram 17 years of work into 13 minutes,\" she said.\n\n\"That was the hardest, hardest part, deciding how to maximize 13 minutes, but also celebrate.

We’ll see how it compares to the set Rihanna’s team came up with for her show on Super Bowl Sunday. They told us it took 52 versions to get there.\n\nEither way, we’re expecting a “jam-packed” show — mainly because that’s what Rihanna told us to expect.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nKansas City Chiefs CEO, Disney star having fun at the 16th hole\n\nRound 3 of the Phoenix Open is well underway and one golf spectator who’s enjoying himself is actor David Henrie, best known to millennials as a former Disney star from “Wizards of Waverly Place.”\n\nHe posted a photo of himself and some friends posing at the 16th hole on Saturday afternoon and captioned the post with “Great time at the @WMPhoenixOpen!

An Arizona State University student tweeted a video tour of various poles around the Valley and their suitability for climbing.\n\nNow CamSoda, an adult entertainment company, is sending a truck filled with 55-gallon drums of lubricant to Philadelphia, according to a press release — lubricant mixed with Cheez Whiz, the only acceptable dairy ingredient of a Philly cheesesteak sandwich.\n\n“Lube proves more difficult to scale than Crisco,” Daryn Parker, CamSoda’s vice president, said in a statement. “And the smell of wiz is just … yum.”\n\nNot the word we would have used, but OK.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nOn the ground at the WM Phoenix Open, literally\n\nThe crowds ran into the WM Phoenix Open golf tournament at TPC Scottsdale at 7 a.m. Saturday, and it didn’t take long for the chanting and booing to ensue at the 16th hole ahead of the 9 a.m. tee time for Round 3.\n\nIt also didn’t take long for the waste to pile up.

(The game rotates among networks who broadcast NFL games every year).\n\nThis year, Fox is carrying the Super Bowl. A potential Joe Biden interview with Fox News' Bret Baier or Martha MacCallum could be, if not great journalism, at least compelling TV.\n\nAfter the White House press secretary announced Friday that plans for a President Joe Biden interview with a Fox News streaming platform had fallen through, Fox Corp. announced that it was back on again. As of Friday, it's unclear whether the president will go through with the interview.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nPepsi Fan Fest pops off with 3-day party at Arizona Center\n\nHere’s one more party for the fans in downtown Phoenix.

From his perch at friendly South Philly dive bar The Friendly Lounge — home to game-day potlucks featuring Italian meatballs or Vietnamese pho — Jersey-born Ryan Schamp said the idea Eagles fans are uniquely intense is an “undeserved narrative.”\n\n“Eagles fans have done a few dumb things over the years,” Schamp conceded. But that’s not really how they are. Here’s the real story of Philadelphia Eagles fans booing Santa.\n\n— Matthew Korfhage\n\nMore:If the Eagles win Super Bowl 57, fans will climb Phoenix light poles. But why?\n\nWhy Indigenous activists will be at State Farm Stadium\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs will be met with fans on Super Bowl Sunday, but they’ll also face Native activists asking them to change their name and in-game traditions. The team name “Chiefs” is in honor of a non-Native mayor from the 1960s. Fans still show up to games in feathered headdresses and war paint, though Arrowhead Stadium said they've banned it.\n\nThis week on Valley 101, producer Amanda Luberto spoke with Indigenous affairs reporter Debra Krol on the history of these traditions and why Arizonans are joining the Kansas City Indian Center to protest outside State Farm Stadium.\n\n— Amanda Luberto\n\n'Appalled':Scottsdale art gallery owner faces charges after racist tirade against Native performers\n\nRoosevelt Row is ready for Super Bowl 2023 fans\n\nIn celebration of Super Bowl 57, Tostitos has opened a pop-up restaurant in downtown Phoenix called Tost by Tostitos.

Hance Park as the first of two local legends on tap at Thursday’s Super Bowl Experience, launching their set with a spirited “Follow You Down.”\n\nThe song was greeted with a singalong that couldn’t have felt more enthusiastic, after which lead singer Robin Wilson took a moment to reflect on what a cool event this was.\n\n“It’s great to be home,” he said. “And it is such a pleasure to be sharing the stage with Jimmy Eat World.”\n\nBut first he shared his favorite movie quote, on loan from “Rowdy” Roddy Piper, about how they were here to kick ass and chew bubblegum and they’re all out of bubblegum.

If you didn't make it to opening day, or even if you did, it's worth checking out the Old West-themed party where roaming cowboys sing and spin lassos in the street, live music plays and restaurants serve food and drinks from stands on Main Street.

The officer with the Hoover Police Department is expected to survive. Hoover is just south of Birmingham. Hoover police Lt. Daniel Lowe said a driver reported that someone fired multiple shots at his vehicle on Interstate 459 Sunday morning. No one was injured. Officers had information about the vehicle used in the shooting and located a possible suspect at an apartment complex in Hoover. As they attempted to make contact with the person, he produced a weapon and opened fire, Lowe said in a news release. One officer was struck multiple times, but his injuries were not believed to be life-threatening. Hoover police returned fire, though it wasn’t clear whether the suspect was hit, Lowe said. Police evacuated some apartments and advised other residents to stay inside on the belief that the suspect was still at the complex. The department announced later on its Twitter page that the suspect was in custody.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Elders and Youth Conference is underway in Anchorage this week, KNBA-Anchorage reports.

The Arizona Game and Fish Department said the bobcat was found fatally shot on Sept. 28. Officials said the research project, which is partially funded by a state Game and Fish grant, is studying how bobcats use the wildlife-urban interface on the west side of Tucson.

The Arizona Game and Fish Department manages managing more than 800 native wildlife species.\n\nArkansas\n\nDecatur: A 71-year-old man was fatally shot by a northwest Arkansas sheriff’s deputy who found him driving a tractor and displaying a handgun, authorities said. Nelson Amos was fatally shot Saturday by a Benton County sheriff’s deputy, according to Arkansas State Police. State police said Sunday that they were investigating the shooting. State police said that sheriff’s deputies had been called after someone reported hearing gunfire on Amos’ property. State police said that when a deputy later encountered Amos driving a tractor on a local road and brandishing a handgun, the deputy fired his rife, killing Amos. State police said their investigation will be submitted to the Benton County prosecutor, who will determine whether the use of deadly force by the sheriff’s deputy was consistent with the law.\n\nCalifornia\n\nWhittier: A person suspected of being under the influence while riding a horse through city streets was arrested after leading police on a pursuit in Southern California, authorities said.

The Pueblo D60 board directors voted unanimously Thursday to apply for a Safe Routes to School grant to add sidewalks, Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant ramps, bike lanes and road markings at various places along Monument Avenue where Park View Elementary and the Risley International Academy of Innovation are located. The total project area spans from East Second Street to East 12th Street along Monument Avenue. During a Pueblo D60 board work session Thursday, Pueblo Area Council of Governments (PACOG) Transportation Director Eva Cosyleon explained the need for creating a “pedestrian and bicycle safe corridor” in the project area. “We have broken sidewalks, we have missing sidewalks at driveways and alleys, and also missing ADA curb ramps – which poses a huge issue for people with a handicap,” Cosyleon said. “They need to have accessibility for wheelchairs or even mothers who have strollers and are trying to take their kids to school.” Cosyleon also presented traffic-crash data from the past five years to board directors. From 2017 to 2022, there have been 280 accidents within a two-mile radius of the Monument Avenue corridor and two people have been killed. Among those crashes, seven involved pedestrians, two involved school-aged children, two involved bicyclists and one involved an individual in a wheelchair.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMorris: A 250-pound black bear mauled a 10-year-old boy playing in his grandparents’ backyard in Connecticut and tried to drag him away before the animal was fatally shot by police, authorities said. The child was attacked about 11 a.m. Sunday in the town of Morris, the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said. He was taken to a hospital for treatment of injuries that were not life-threatening. Officers from the state police and DEEP’s environmental conservation force responded and shot the bear, authorities said. The boy’s grandfather described the harrowing attack to the Republican-American of Waterbury. James Butler said his grandson was playing near a trampoline when the bear emerged from thick woods behind the house. “I heard him yell ‘bear’ and when I looked up, I saw his leg in the bear’s mouth and the bear trying to drag him across the lawn,” Butler said. Butler, who uses a wheelchair, wheeled his chair toward the bear and threw a metal bar at its head, he told the newspaper. The bear released the boy but then grabbed the child a second time and used its claws to try to roll the boy onto his back, the grandfather said. A neighbor alerted by the boy’s screams raced over and scared the bear off by brandishing a pipe and yelling, Butler said. The bear was fatally shot by police a short time later. Butler, and his wife, Christina Anderson, who was inside the house when the bear attacked, said the boy suffered a puncture wound to one thigh, bite marks on a foot and ankle and claw marks on his back. State biologist Jenny Dixon said the risk of negative bear-human interactions is increasing as the state’s expanding bear population becomes acclimated to humans and develops a taste for their food.\n\nDelaware\n\nMiddletown: One person is dead and two others were seriously injured in a crash involving two trucks early Saturday morning in Middletown, according to Delaware State Police. State police said at approximately 4:23 a.m., a 2005 Dodge Ram 1500 driven by an unidentified 24-year-old was traveling south on Route 13/South Dupont Highway. At about the same time, a 2018 Ford F-150 had entered the left lane of Route 13 from Hyetts Corner Road headed north. A police investigation determined that, at some point north of the Route 1 overpass, for an unknown reason, the Dodge left the southbound lanes, crossed the grass median and entered the northbound left lane of Route 13, where it collided with the Ford. Police found that neither the 24-year-old driver of the Dodge nor a 26-year-old front-seat passenger were wearing their seat belts. They were both seriously injured and taken to an area hospital. The 67-year-old driver of the Ford, who was wearing his seat belt, was pronounced deceased at the scene of the collision, police said Sunday. His identity was being withheld pending notification of next of kin. Route 13 was closed for almost four hours while the crash was investigated and the roadway was cleared.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A man was reunited with his 5-month-old puppy after police say he was robbed and shot at last Wednesday in Northeast D.C., WUSA-TV reports. “Thank you to everyone who submitted tips to help find this furry friend,” D.C. police tweeted out Monday. D.C. police worked with the Humane Rescue Alliance and received community tips to safely locate the puppy that had been missing since Oct. 12 when the dog’s owner was allegedly robbed at gunpoint in the 4500 block of Polk Street, Northeast D.C. According to the police report, the robber got away with the dog and shot at the owner as he ran away. The dog owner was not injured. The case is still being investigated, according to the news outlet.\n\nFlorida\n\nFernandina Beach: Two men face attempted murder charges for allegedly firing into each other’s vehicles on a busy highway and wounding each other’s daughters, who were passengers in their back seats. William Hale, of Douglasville, Georgia, and Frank Allison, of Callahan, Florida, were charged last week with attempted second-degree murder in the Oct. 8 confrontation on U.S. Highway 1 in Nassau County. A witness told Nassau County sheriff’s deputies that both vehicles were being driven so erratically and engaging in a “cat and mouse” chase that he called the authorities out of concern, according to an incident report. Hale, driving a truck with relatives as passengers, told deputies that he and Allison were “brake checking,” or braking in front of each other repeatedly, during the confrontation. He said at some point, he heard a “pow” at his back door, so he grabbed a gun he kept in his center console and fired out of the driver’s window, according to the incident report. “It was an instant reaction,” Hale said, noting that he fired “everything that was in the clip,” deputies reported. Allison told deputies that he fired his gun at the truck’s bed or tire after a water bottle was thrown into his car. Before the water bottle was thrown, his wife had been “flicking them off,” he said. “Mr. Allison said his goal of firing the shot was to ‘get out of the whole situation,’ ” the deputies reported. Hale’s daughter suffered a wound to her upper calf, while Allison’s daughter suffered a collapsed lung, according to the report. There was no attorney listed for Hale in an online docket. An attorney for Allison didn’t immediately respond to an emailed inquiry on Monday.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Four people were hurt, including three students, in a shooting during Clark Atlanta University’s homecoming outside a campus library early Sunday, authorities said. A large group of people were listening to a DJ near Atlanta University Center’s Robert W. Woodruff Library around 12:30 a.m. when officers on patrol in the area heard gunshots, Atlanta police said. A preliminary investigation found three students and another person were injured when shots were fired from a vehicle, Clark Atlanta University said. Atlanta police said multiple people were shot. One of the victims was grazed and refused medical attention. Three others were taken to a hospital, though they were conscious and alert. Clark Atlanta is part of Atlanta University Center’s consortium of historically Black colleges.\n\nHawaii\n\nMaui: Maui County’s race for mayor is turning into the most contentious in the state, HawaiiNewsNow reports.

Supporters of pet CBD say it eases their animals’ anxiety and pain.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The second and final Illinois gubernatorial debate is set for Tuesday, potentially the last time that Democrat Gov. JB Pritzker and Republican challenger Darren Bailey will share a televised stage at the same time. Recent polls indicate Pritzker has a sizable lead over Bailey, a Xenia state senator, with a possibility to win in November by similar margins to his 2018 victory over former Gov. Bruce Rauner. Public Policy Polling conducted a poll on the behalf of the Chicago Sun-Times/WBEZ, which found the Democrat with a 49% to 34% lead over his opponent. In 2018, Pritzker received 54.5% of the vote compared to 38.8% going to Rauner, the Republican incumbent. With election day now a little more than three weeks away, University of Illinois-Springfield political science professor emeritus Kent Redfield says the upcoming debate provides both candidates with an opportunity to gain, maintain or lose support.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: Firefighters were battling a large fire Monday in southwestern Indiana that’s left an Evansville warehouse and neighboring buildings in ruins and produced a smoke plume visible for miles around. Evansville Fire Department spokesman Mike Larson said about “every truck in the city” as well as one fire unit from Henderson, Kentucky, was called to the scene of the warehouse fire along Morton Avenue. He said the fire was contained as of 9:15 a.m. CDT and no longer a threat to spread, but fires were still burning inside the warehouse and neighboring buildings. Dozens of firefighters would likely remain at the scene for hours, Larson told the Evansville Courier & Press. Larson said there were no reported injuries, and there was no word yet on a possible cause of the fire in the city about 170 miles southwest of Indianapolis. The fire, which was reported about 4:40 a.m., produced a smoke plume so thick it was clearly visible on weather radar in the city. Video footage of the scene showed that flames were still rising by mid-morning from multiple collapsed buildings across a large area and producing smoke plumes. Authorities closed the Lloyd Expressway near the Evansville’s Division Street and U.S. 41 exits and asked motorists to avoid the area.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: U.S. Rep.

Hinson is running for reelection to Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District seat and is being challenged by Democrat Liz Mathis, state senator.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Kansas will begin winding down a COVID-19-era rental assistance program, a move that was expected but still has housing advocates worried about whether renters and the nonprofits that help support them will be prepared. The Kansas Emergency Rental Assistance program was created in March 2021 as the latest iteration in a series of efforts to provide aid to renters affected by the adverse economic conditions created by the pandemic. Backed by $200 million in federal funds and run by the Kansas Housing Resources Corporation, the program’s launch was rocky at first due to limited staffing and high demand, though things eventually stabilized. State officials announced Wednesday the program was entering a “hold phase,” where the agency has received enough applications to exhaust its funding. All current applications under review will be put on pause unless more money becomes available. “We may not have the funds to ultimately be able to review or fund those applications,” Ryan Vincent, executive director of the KHRC, told KMUW. “We’ll have them ready, and if we end up receiving any additional funding … we can go back and fund some of those applications in the second hold phase.” The prospect of obtaining additional federal funds is uncertain. Congress could ultimately choose to appropriate more funds for the program, though such a move seems unlikely. The U.S. Treasury Department has also reallocated money from states that have been slower to spend their funds or declined to participate in the program.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A county’s court operations that have been closed since historic flooding in July will resume this month. The Knott County Office of Circuit Court Clerk will reopen Oct. 31 in the county Judicial Center. Circuit and district court proceedings will be conducted remotely due to ongoing repairs to the center. Proceedings may be heard in person in another county if all parties agree, according to the Administrative Office of the Courts in Frankfort. The Supreme Court issued an administrative order amending the emergency order that suspended court operations after the flooding. The order clarifies that the clerk’s office was legally closed from July 28 to Oct. 30 for time computation purposes and allows the presiding judge to grant additional time extensions. Gov. Andy Beshear said last week that 43 people from six counties died in the flooding that hit parts of eastern Kentucky in late July. He said one person remains missing.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: Republican Tim Temple, a wealthy insurance executive from Baton Rouge, will run against incumbent GOP Louisiana Insurance Commissioner Jim Donelon in 2023 with the state mired in a homeowners insurance crisis. Temple posed a strong challenge to Donelon in 2019 by spending $2 million of his own money, but Donelon pulled out another win with 53% of the statewide vote. Donelon first won the office in 2006. “Over the last 17 years, Louisiana auto rates have soared to the most expensive in the country, while recently we’ve seen an explosion of homeowner rate increases and an expansion of attorneys promising quick claim settlements and loosely regulated public adjusters,” Temple said in a news release. “Just last week, the current commissioner approved a 63% homeowner’s insurance rate increase,” Temple said. “Continuing to recycle old plans ignores the actual problems and shortcomings altogether, and these issues are too serious to ignore. More than ever Louisiana needs an insurance commissioner with experience in the insurance industry, that will be honest, transparent, accountable, and put the people of this state ahead of insurance companies.” While it’s true Donelon approved a 63% rate hike for customers in the state’s quasi-government safety net insurance company Citizens, he had little choice. By law, Citizens’ prices must be 10% above the highest market rate in each parish or the actuarial rate, whichever is higher. Citizens provides insurance to homeowners who can’t secure protection in the private market.\n\nMaine\n\nKittery: Town leaders have taken steps to ensure a diverse range of reading materials stay on shelves of the historic Rice Public Library as book-banning efforts have surged nationally. A formal “Freedom to Read” policy was adopted by the Town Council at its Oct. 12 meeting. “The freedom to read is essential to our democracy,” the policy states in part. “The Town of Kittery is devoted to reading and wishes to assert the public interest in the preservation of the freedom to read,” it reads. “We trust our Kittery residents to recognize propaganda and misinformation and to make their own decisions about what they read and believe. The freedom to read is guaranteed by the Constitution.” Approved by the Town Council in tandem with the policy was a step-by-step book challenge process, which outlines how Kittery’s Library Advisory Committee receives and evaluates contested reading materials. Only Kittery residents are permitted to initiate a challenge. “The library considers material objectionable only if the material taken as a whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value,” the challenged materials policy reads. Lee Perkins, the town library director since 2010, noted Rice Public Library previously followed the American Library Association’s “Freedom to Read” statement. Because the library officially became a town department in 2019, however, the Town Council had to approve the town’s own “Freedom to Read” library policy “to carry forward this commitment,” according to a report to the council from Town Manager Kendra Amaral.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration has launched a survey to receive public input on preliminary improvement concepts and highway needs for the expansion of Route 90 (Ocean City Expressway). The survey, which was announced in an Oct. 12 news release, is available to the public through 11:59 p.m. Nov. 10. Results will be used to form preliminary improvement concepts. The survey is part of the MD 90 Planning and Environmental Linkages (PEL) Study. Expansion of the entire 12-mile corridor between Coastal Highway and Route 50 is a part of the state’s long-term “Reach the Beach” plan. Improvements include general road safety, traffic congestion relief, and allowing first responders such as police, firefighters and EMTs to respond to emergencies swiftly. As stated by the Maryland Department of Transportation’s State Highway Administration, the western end of Route 90 at Route 50 carries roughly 33,000 vehicles per day throughout the summer season. By 2045, the highway’s average daily traffic volume is expected to increase by 10%.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSwampscott: Police came to the rescue of a person who was out walking their dog over the weekend when they were surrounded by a pack of coyotes. Police in Swampscott received a call at about 9:30 p.m. Saturday from the dog walker who said they were surrounded and the coyotes were “not backing down,” police said in a Facebook post. Responding officers counted at least nine coyotes. They were apparently scared off by the arrival of the cruisers with their lights flashing. Police escorted the dog walker and their pet to their home with no additional danger. The dog walker’s name was not made public. Police also posted a series of tips from the Humane Society for how to deal with bold coyotes, urging residents to be aware of their surroundings when walking their dogs, especially during evening hours when coyotes are most active. Police also recommended that people bring noisemakers, squirt guns or pepper spray with them to scare coyotes away.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Michigan students, and particularly those experiencing homelessness, continue to attend school at a lower rate than they did before the COVID-19 pandemic. The statewide school attendance rate for the 2021-22 school year fell to 88%, down 4.1 percentage points from the previous school year, when attendance hovered at 92.9%. The decline marked a 4.3-percentage-point drop from 2019-20’s attendance rate of 93.1%, according to state data released in September. It is the first time in at least five years that the statewide attendance rate has dipped below 90%. Economically disadvantaged students attended school at a rate of 88% last school year, down from 90.7% in 2020-21. Students experiencing homelessness attended school at a rate of 79.8% in 2021-22, a decline of 5.4 percentage points from the prior year’s rate of 85.2%. State attendance rates are calculated by dividing the total days students could attend school by the total days students actually attend. “There has to be a recommitment to intentionally addressing chronic absenteeism here in this great state of Michigan,” said Delsa Chapman, deputy superintendent at the Michigan Department of Education.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Mayor Dave Kleis announced Friday the city was awarded $1.09million in state grant funds for the installation of green hydrogen and renewable natural gas demonstration projects. Funding came from the Minnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund as recommended by the Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources. These technologies will reduce operating costs, keep user rates low, provide additional revenue opportunities, provide economic growth opportunities for the community, reduce dependence on natural gas and high carbon fuel sources, reduce carbon dioxide emissions and increase energy resiliency, according to a press release from the city.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: A pickup truck struck two University of Mississippi students in a parking lot in downtown Oxford, killing one of them and injuring the other, police said. Two suspects, both from Collierville, Tennessee, were arrested by Monday in the crash, which occurred early Sunday, authorities said. Tristan Holland was taken into custody Sunday in Shelby County, Tennessee, on accessory after the fact. He will face extradition to Oxford, according to the Oxford Police Department. Seth Rokitka was taken into custody Monday after investigators found his wrecked truck in Marshall County, Mississippi, between Oxford and Collierville. The Oxford Police Department said it would provide more information after Rokitka is charged. It was not immediately clear whether either Holland or Rokitka had an attorney who could comment on their behalf. Oxford police said the department received an emergency call after 1 a.m. Sunday from passersby who saw two people injured in the parking lot behind City Hall. Mayor Robyn Tannehill said the student who died was 21-year-old Walker Fielder of Madison, Mississippi. Fielder was a 2020 graduate of Jackson Academy in Jackson, Mississippi. The injured student was transferred to a hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Oxford police told WRAL-TV that she is 20-year-old Blanche Williamson of Raleigh, North Carolina. Williamson graduated from Episcopal High School, a boarding school in Virginia.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Two teenagers were killed Saturday evening when the vehicle they were in traveled off Farm Road 170 near Republic and struck a tree. Two other teenagers were taken by ambulance to CoxHealth Hospital in Springfield. According to the Missouri State Highway Patrol, a total of four teenagers – ages 15 and 16 – were riding in the 2005 Honda Accord. At 6:15 p.m. Saturday, the vehicle was traveling east on Farm Road 170, just east of Republic, lost control, traveled off the left side of the roadway, and struck a tree, the patrol reported. The Republic district provided some details to teachers, staff and parents late Sunday. The two students killed were a 16-year-old male from Republic and a 15-year-old male from Billings.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A police officer shot an armed man at the Billings Clinic Emergency Department on Sunday, the Billings Gazette reports. When officers responded to a report of an armed man at the hospital, the man fired one round. An officer fired one round, hitting the suspect, who was then taken into custody, according to a social media post from police. Police said no hospital staff or patients were injured in the incident, according to the news outlet.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Record-low temperatures are expected Tuesday in Omaha, Lincoln and Norfolk, the Omaha World-Herald reports. “A cold front dropping down from Canada will be sitting right over the top of (eastern Nebraska) Tuesday morning,” Taylor Nicolaisen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Valley, said Sunday. “The records for Omaha, Lincoln and Norfolk could be in trouble, especially Lincoln.” The low temperatures for all three cities were set in 1972 – Omaha recorded 20 degrees, Lincoln 21 and Norfolk 18. But the cold won’t last. Highs in eastern Nebraska expected to rebound into the 50s to low 60s on Wednesday, according to the news outlet.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Nevada reported far fewer coronavirus cases in the week ending Sunday, adding 1,130 new cases. That’s down 11.9% from the previous week’s tally of 1,283 new cases of the virus that causes COVID-19. Nevada ranked 46th among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: New Hampshire public health officials say they see a dangerous combination ahead: a winter rise in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, and low interest in coronavirus booster shots, especially the new bivalent dose targeted at omicron. Approximately half of Granite Staters eligible for the first booster have gotten one and far fewer, about 35%, have received a second, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency has not reported state-level uptakes of the new bivalent booster but has put the national rate at just 4%. “It’s one thing to have the vaccine,” said Dr. Sally Kraft, vice president of population health at Dartmouth Health, in a briefing on the bivalent booster Tuesday. “It’s another to get that vaccine in people’s arms.” On Friday, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services asked lawmakers for approval to use $8.9 million in federal pandemic aid to expand access to vaccines and antiviral medications.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Democrats in competitive Garden State congressional races vastly outraised and outspent their Republican challengers in the three summer months after the state’s primary. In the 7th Congressional District, Rep. Tom Malinowski – who faces a tough reelection effort after redistricting added more Republican-leaning towns to the district – raised more than anyone else in the state, at over $1.8 million, and spent $3.3 million, according to the latest Federal Election Commission filings, due Saturday, which cover campaign activity from July through September. He collected more than twice as much in donations as his challenger, Thomas Kean Jr., who raised $866,000, and spent three times the $1 million that Kean paid vendors. Rep. Mikie Sherrill of the 11th District spent more than any other congressional contender over the summer, $3.7 million, more than 21 times what her Republican opponent, Paul DeGroot, managed with $175,000. She raised $970,000 to DeGroot’s $171,000. Rep. Josh Gottheimer of the 5th District continued to stockpile an eye-popping amount of money, with more than $14 million in the bank after raising another $1.1 million and spending $1 million in the third quarter.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRoswell: Roswell officials say the city’s UFO Festival had an economic impact of more than $2 million. The Roswell Daily Record reports the Roswell City Council’s finance committee looked earlier this month at an economic report for the event. It indicated more than 40,000 visitors came to the four-day festival, which ran June 30-July 3. The cost for the city to mount it was more than $200,000. Officials applauded the results as a “10 to 1 return on your money.” Staff who put together the report reviewed gross receipts taxes, occupancy or lodgers’ tax, ticket sales and other factors. They also analyzed data from trash collection to estimate the number of visitors. This year’s festival marked the 75th anniversary of the alleged Roswell Incident. Something crashed at what was then the J.B. Foster ranch in 1947, with the U.S. Army announcing it had recovered a “flying disc” but later saying the debris was merely the remnants of a high-altitude weather balloon. Speculation about extraterrestrials and government cover-ups has existed ever since, inspiring books, movies and TV shows. The milestone anniversary brought various businesses and groups together to organize 34 events for the UFO Festival.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Are your New York state license plates peeling or falling apart? The New York state Department of Motor Vehicles will replace them for free. “We are encouraging New Yorkers who have peeling license plates to get new ones, without any charge, to avoid the risk of being ticketed and having to pay a fine,” DMV Commissioner Mark J.F. Schroeder said. A driver can be ticketed if their plate number is no longer clearly readable. Customers who want the next available standard plate number for free can email the DMV at dmv.sm.peelingplates@dmv.ny.gov.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSalisbury: Two people were shot and others were injured as they fled gunfire that broke out at a North Carolina college homecoming concert on Saturday night, officials said. Officers called to the campus of Livingstone College in Salisbury around 11 p.m. found two people shot and others who were hurt as attendees fled the gunfire, city officials said in a statement. Officials didn’t release details of their conditions. There was a fight during the concert and one person, who isn’t a Livingstone student, fired one or more shots, police and school officials said in a joint statement. The school’s priority is to ensure students’ mental health and evaluate public safety measures to create a safe environment, Livingstone President Dr. Anthony J. Davis said in a statement. The college is cooperating with police as they investigate, he said. “I am saddened because our students, alumni, family and friends were exposed to this senseless act of violence,” Davis said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Republican Congressman Kelly Armstrong has raised nearly $2 million for his reelection bid for North Dakota’s lone U.S. House seat, the Bismarck Tribune reports, outraising his independent challenger, former Miss America 2018 Cara Mund. Recent campaign finance reports indicate Armstrong has more than $1.8 million to Mund’s $77,790. This is the first official comparison of the two candidates’ fundraising efforts, according to the media outlet.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Democratic Rep. Jeff Crossman says he would drop an appeal of the state’s six-week abortion ban if elected attorney general over Republican Dave Yost. Crossman said he would refuse to defend Ohio’s law, which bans doctors from performing abortions after cardiac activity is detected, in court. As a state lawmaker, he voted against the six-week abortion ban, but it passed the GOP-controlled Legislature anyway. Gov. Mike DeWine signed the bill in 2019. But Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge Christian Jenkins recently blocked that law indefinitely. Yost filed an appeal Wednesday with the Ohio 1st District Court of Appeals in Cincinnati. Crossman said he would drop that appeal. “I intend to end this crusade against women and protect their constitutional rights,” Crossman said. “I will end the appeal immediately and I will honor the court’s decision.” Yost campaign spokeswoman Amy Natoce slammed Crossman for not defending Ohio’s law. “He literally just promised to cancel democracy because he doesn’t like a law passed by the General Assembly. Doesn’t that bother you?” she asked. “The attorney general has a sworn duty to defend laws passed by the people’s elected legislators regardless of his personal opinions – something Jeff Crossman is too inexperienced and morally bankrupt to understand.” Practically speaking, that might not end the appeal. In 2014, then-Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway, a Democrat, refused to defend the state’s ban on same-sex marriage, so outside attorneys handled the case instead.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOkmulgee: Authorities are trying to determine if four bodies found in an Oklahoma river are those of four men who were reported missing several days ago after leaving a home together. Police in Okmulgee, about 40 miles south of Tulsa, said Friday that the bodies of four males had been found in the Deep Fork River. They have been sent for autopsies. Police said they’ve been searching for four friends – Mark Chastain, 32, Billy Chastain, 30, Mike Sparks, 32, and Alex Stevens, 29 – who were believed to have left a house in Okmulgee on bicycles on the evening of Oct. 9. Mark Chastain’s wife reported that he, Billy Chastain and Mike Sparks were missing, police said Tuesday. A few hours later, Alex Stevens’ mother reported him missing, police said. The bodies were discovered after a passerby saw something suspicious in the river near a bridge, police Chief Joe Prentice said. The bicycles have not been found, Prentice said. Police did not immediately respond to a message left Sunday. The men were all from Okmulgee, which has a population of around 11,000.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: Twenty-five Oregon mayors joined together for the common goal of creating a strategy to address the statewide homeless crisis using funding and construction investments, submitting the plan to state officials Friday. A subcommittee on the Oregon Mayors Association put together the request calling for a partnership between the cities and the state to fund a response to local homelessness and preventative programs – totaling about $123 million annually. In addition to the annual funding for those programs, the plan also calls for construction investments for shelters and transitional housing projects. The letter to legislators highlighted the crisis, stating the municipal leaders “cannot be left to solve this statewide crisis” on their own. “The No. 1 issue throughout Oregon – in both rural and urban communities, large and small – is homelessness. We know this humanitarian crisis is impacting both the individuals directly experiencing homelessness as well as communities at large,” stated the OMA letter. Although many cities have individual or regional programs to address local issues, the statewide crisis has exceeded their “individual capacity.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state and national Republican parties are suing anew in the state in an effort to block some mail-in ballots – those lacking the voter’s handwritten date on the outside envelope – from being counted in November, when voters will elect a new governor and U.S. senator. The GOP’s filing late Sunday went straight to the state Supreme Court, with barely three weeks left before Election Day. The court does not have to take up the lawsuit. “The time for the Court to act is now,” lawyers for the Republican Party told the justices in the lawsuit. The effort by Republicans to ensure that improperly dated or undated ballot envelopes are thrown out could help their candidates in tight contests around the state. As of Friday, nearly 1.2 million voters had applied for a main-in ballot, with applications from registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans by an almost 4-to-1 ratio. Throwing out undated ballots would theoretically ensure that more Democratic ballots are tossed out, helping Republican candidates. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration last week told counties that they are expected to include ballots with undated or improperly dated envelopes in their official returns for the Nov. 8 election.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A jury has convicted a former corrections officer at the Adult Correctional Institutions of having sexual relations with two female inmates over the course of a year. Collins Umoh, 44, of Warwick, on Thursday was found guilty of three counts of criminal sexual conduct with an inmate under his direct custodial supervision between 2017 and 2018 after a five-day trial before Superior Court Judge Joseph A. Montalbano, according to an announcement by Attorney General Peter F. Neronha’s office. The state was unable to proceed with four additional counts that were subsequently dismissed, said Brian Hodge, spokesman for the office. He declined further comment. Umoh had been a corrections officer for 11 years at the time of his arrest in May 2019. Authorities at the time accused him of having sex with three women housed in the Gloria McDonald Correctional Facility between July 2017 and August 2018. “This agency has no higher priority than running safe, secure and constitutional facilities, and the protection of ACI inmates from sexual misconduct is something we take particularly seriously,” Patricia A. Coyne-Fague, director of the state Department of Corrections, said in an email at the time of his arrest. “Anyone involved in sexual misconduct will face significant consequences.” Assistant Attorney General Daniel Carr Guglielmo prosecuted the case, with State Police Detective Herb Tilson leading the investigation with the assistance of the Department of Corrections Office of Inspections. Umoh is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 15. The charges are punishable by up to five years in prison and/or a fine of $10,000. Umoh’s lawyer, Stefanie Murphy, could not be reached immediately for comment.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg: Hundreds of incorrect absentee ballots were mailed to Spartanburg County voters due to an error by the vendor who prints them, county officials said Wednesday. “This is an unfortunate situation, but thankfully there is time to correct it,” Elections Director Adam Hammons said in a statement. “My office is working hard to ensure every affected voter receives the correct ballot as soon as possible, giving the voters ample time to return them before 7 p.m. on Election Day.” Hammons said after sending to the vendor the file of voters’ names to be sent a ballot, his office identified one voter that had applied for an absentee ballot but later moved out of the county. He said his office asked the vendor to remove the voter from the file prior to printing and mailing the ballots. “During that process, the data shifted, unbeknownst to the vendor, causing the error,” Hammons stated. County spokeswoman Scottie Kay Blackwell said the county elections office is immediately mailing a new, correct ballot to all 699 voters who received the incorrect ballot. The office is also reaching out to voters directly, telling them the correct ballots will arrive in an envelope with a yellow stripe, she said. “The issuing and return of the new, correct ballots will be tracked by the elections office, ensuring that only one ballot is counted for each voter,” Blackwell stated. She said voters who are unsure if they’ve been impacted by the error can visit scvotes.gov and click on “Get My Sample Ballot.” If the sample ballot matches the one they received in the mail, they will know they received the correct ballot.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nYankton: Authorities say an inmate who tried to escape from a hospital where he was receiving treatment was caught within 10 minutes. The 26-year-old man who was housed at the Yankton County Jail had been taken to Avera Sacred Heart Hospital for a medical issue Thursday evening when he ran away from a correctional officer, the Yankton Press and Dakotan reported. The suspect was apprehended less than two blocks away, according to the Yankton County Sheriff’s Office. He was charged with first-degree escape, which carries a maximum charge of two years in prison.\n\nTennessee\n\nGatlinburg: A campground at Great Smoky Mountains National Park that has been closed for nine years has been reopened, park officials said. Look Rock Campground is a 68-site facility that provides camping along one of the park’s most scenic drive, according to Superintendent Cassius Cash. The campground opened Saturday and remains available through Nov. 13. “We are grateful for the voices who supported us in our efforts to secure the needed funding for repairs, including the Friends of the Smokies and their donors,” Cash said in a news release. Look Rock Campground and Picnic Area were closed in 2013 after the water utility systems failed. The picnic area reopened with limited services after the park received funds in 2019 to install an accessible vault toilet. The water system has now been completely replaced, with access to flush toilets and potable water. Campground sites were rehabilitated. Ten sites were renovated to accommodate larger recreational vehicles and offer the first electric and water hookups in a park campground, the park said. The park received $4.7 million for the work from campground fees, donations and federal funds. Campground reservations must be made through Recreation.Gov.\n\nTexas\n\nFort Worth: A Fort Worth police said an officer fatally shot a 29-year-old man who pointed a handgun at him after police responded to a call from the man’s mother, who said he was damaging her home with a hammer. The Tarrant County medical examiner’s office has identified the man killed early Sunday as Taylor Grimes. Fort Worth police said that during the mother’s 911 call late Saturday, the man could be heard saying he would hurt his mother if any officers responded. Police said that when officers arrived, Grimes came to the door holding a handgun, closed the door and then refused to leave the house. The SWAT unit and hostage negotiators then arrived and tried to convince Grimes to surrender and to allow his mother to leave the house, police said. When his mother eventually left the house, Grimes was seen standing in the doorway, pointing a handgun at an officer, police said. Police said that the officer fired his weapon, striking the man. The medical examiner’s office said Grimes died in the living room of the home.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Provo has a new acting chief of police after the sudden resignation of police chief Fred Ross, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Ross didn’t cite specific reasons for his resignation, other than saying that the job had “been determined to not be sustainable.” He was appointed to the role in November 2021. “After discussing this with my family,” Ross continued in a statement, “I’ve determined it is in my best interest personally and professionally to resign my position as chief of police, effective immediately. I thank you sincerely for the honor of serving you, the department, and the people of Provo.” Mayor Michelle Kaufusi appointed Capt. Troy Beebe, a 24-year veteran of the Provo Police Department, as the acting chief in an early Monday announcement, according to the news outlet.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Students will be taking a different standardized test this spring. Students will no longer take the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) and the Vermont Science Assessment (VTSA) tests that they have since 2015. The new test, Cognia, encompasses the subjects of English language arts, math and science and will first be administered in the spring of 2023. The Agency of Education chose Cognia after the former testing provider’s contract was up, noting Cognia’s focus on equity. “Cognia’s approach to diversity, equity and inclusion in the development and implementation of assessments aligns with Vermont’s values, and the accessibility and user experience of their testing resources will make working with the assessments easier for students, families and educators,” said Dan French, Vermont’s secretary of education.\n\nVirginia\n\nHarrisonburg: A man has been charged in a shooting at an outdoor gathering over the weekend that sent eight people to hospitals, police said. Harrisonburg police arrested Tyreaf Isaiah Fleming, 20, of Harrisonburg, on Sunday afternoon, the department said in a statement. Fleming is charged with attempted murder, aggravated malicious wounding and firearms offenses, police said. Online court records do not list an attorney who could speak on Fleming’s behalf. Witnesses said shots were fired into the crowd at an outdoor gathering on Devon Lane in Harrisonburg around 2:20 a.m. Sunday, police said in a statement. Statements from witnesses and security camera video helped investigators identify Fleming as a suspect. Eight people ranging in age from 18 to 27 were taken to hospitals with injuries that were not considered life-threatening, police said. Police said they are investigating whether anyone else was involved in this incident.\n\nWashington\n\nKitsap: The Navy has scrapped a plan to lease local base space to a developer to build a power plant that could feed Kitsap’s electricity grid when outages occur. “The project was determined to not be financially feasible,” said James “Ken” Johnson, a Navy spokesman. The Navy had offered up to 95 acres at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor of mostly forested lands and up to 10 acres of what are mostly surface parking lots at Naval Base Kitsap-Bremerton for lease. Johnson said the Navy had entertained multiple proposals that led to a potential leasee, but that leasee decided to drop out of contention earlier this year. Running power plants and facilities is nothing new for the Navy in Kitsap, a place where 13 nuclear-powered submarines are homeported along with two aircraft carriers powered by twin nuclear reactors. Naval Base Kitsap-Bremerton is also home to a steam plant that generates heat for buildings at the base and the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard using natural gas. But coinciding with the Navy’s initial proposal in 2020, Puget Sound Energy – owners of most of Kitsap County’s electricity grid – had made its own request for proposals to help make the grid more resilient. Among them is a plan to build a biodiesel-fueled power plant at a former rock quarry at Ueland Tree Farm, and several proposals for battery-fed energy storage in both the West Hills of Bremerton and in Suquamish. The Navy would not comment on any of those specific proposals. But Johnson said Navy officials are “focused on meeting the Navy’s goals for energy efficiency, reliability, and resiliency.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The deadline has arrived to register to vote in the Nov. 8 General Election. A voter registration form must be in the county clerk’s possession by Tuesday for people who register in person, Secretary of State Mac Warner’s office said. Registration may also be completed by mail, and that must be received or postmarked by Tuesday. Voters may also register online by the close of business of their county clerk’s office. Voters can download a mail-in form, register online or find the county clerk’s contact information at GoVoteWV.com. Warner says anyone who has moved, changed their name since the last election or wants to change party affiliation may update their registration by Tuesday. Warner’s office and county clerks around the state held more than 100 voter registration drives during the month of September. A total of 5,326 people in the state registered last month, Warner said. Absentee voting began Sept. 23. Early in-person voting starts Oct. 26 and continues through Nov. 5.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay: A nationwide study ranked Wisconsin No. 1 in mental health. Despite a shortage of therapists and wait times for mental health providers that can stretch up to and beyond six months, the study, conducted by Mental Health America, found the Badger State still had enough high points to top other states when it comes to tackling its residents’ mental health needs. Compared to other states, fewer Wisconsin adults are reporting that their mental health needs are going unmet, more adults are seeking treatment and fewer students are being reported for emotional disturbances with their individual education program. Another possible reason for its elevated status is the fact Wisconsin has invested in the mental health needs of its residents, industry professionals say. The report, published Thursday, covers a range of measures, including adults with any mental illness, youth with major depressive disorder, and those struggling with mental health conditions who couldn’t receive treatment due to workforce shortages or a lack of insurance coverage.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Teton County Emergency Management will be testing its alarms Tuesday, Jackson Hole Daily reports. The county is testing its outdoor warning sirens to ensure they work for emergencies, such as inclement weather, incidents with hazardous materials and wildfire evacuations. “Most people associate outdoor warning sirens with tornadoes,” said Rich Ochs, coordinator for Teton County Emergency Management, in a press release. “Hearing a three-minute siren wail means that you should tune into local radio, All-Hazards Weather Radio, trusted online local media, or your phone for an alert.” According to the news outlet, the test will sound like a few short siren bursts and will go for no longer than one minute at a time, at siren locations in Teton Village, Teton Pines, downtown Jackson, Gregory Lane, Adams Canyon and Hoback Junction. Residents indoors will likely not be able to hear much, as the sirens are not designed to sound inside of buildings.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}]}

Experts warn ...", "text": "A former NFL Super Bowl champion says he lost more than 100 pounds during a 40-day fast, during which he only drank water.\n\nRussell Okung, an alum of the Seattle Seahawks 2014 Super Bowl team, spent most of his professional football career weighing more than 300 pounds. Now, he says his experience was \"so rich and rewarding\" that he's going to do it again, and has found \"a new me, a new chapter.\"\n\nBut there's more to the story. Experts warn water fasts can be dangerous. Here's what you need to know about water fasting.\n\nWhat is a water fast?\n\nIt's exactly what it sounds like: refraining from eating all food and drinking anything other than water.\n\nUnlike intermittent fasting, a reduced-calorie diet, water fasting eliminates all calories so that a person is surviving off fat stores and the protein in their muscles, according to Krista Varady, a nutrition professor at the University of Illinois Chicago.\n\nDid Russell Okung really fast for 40 days?\n\nOkung says he had \"no food, only water\" for 40 days. Water fasting for that long is technically possible, medical experts say. But Varady suspects Okung was, at the very least, still consuming vitamins or protein powder to avoid malnutrition and loss of his muscle, which is evident in his \"after\" photos. He did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\n\"(40 days) does seem a little bit dangerous,\" she adds, noting the major studies that have been conducted on water fasting took place over the course of 5 to 20 days − and those studies were done under medical supervision.\n\nPlus the problem with crash diets is \"you tend to feel lousy and all you think about is food,\" Bryant Stamford, a professor of kinesiology and integrative physiology at Hanover College, previously explained. As a result, crash diets tend to fail.\n\nIs fasting a good way to lose weight?\n\nTo medical experts who study weight loss and fasting, a spike in interest in water fasting seems like a natural evolution from the intermittent fasting craze a few years ago. Water fasting produces more dramatic results in a shorter period of time, but they caution that water fasts aren't the get-thin-quick scheme that before and after photos may suggest.\n\nWhy? Once you start eating food again, the weight typically comes back and the benefits go away. Plus fasting for long periods can also slow metabolism, which can make it \"harder to keep the weight off or to lose weight later,\" according to Johns Hopkins.\n\n\"It seems like a lot of work and is probably pretty painful to not eat anything for a month or so,\" Varady says. \"And what's the point of it if most people, when they go back to their regular diet, gain it all back?\"\n\nEven intermittent fasting, which operates on a reduced-calorie diet, for long periods of time is often difficult for people to achieve, Dr. Guy L. Mintz, director of cardiovascular health and lipidology at Sandra Atlas Bass Heart Hospital in New York, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nIn his social media posts about the fast, Okung said, \"Fasting isn’t for everyone, I get that. But for me, it was a life-changer. The benefits are profound. Clearer skin, better digestion, improved mental focus, even my joint pain has decreased.\"\n\nWhile studies haven't backed up most of Okung's claims, joint pain decreasing is a common product of major weight-loss, experts say. Water fasting-induced weight loss has been shown to help decrease cholesterol and blood pressure and improve blood sugar levels and regulation, according to an upcoming study Varady co-authored for medical journal Nutrition Reviews, but the costs outweigh the benefits.\n\nDon't try this at home\n\nExperts agree long-term fasting should be done under medical supervision or only after consulting a doctor.\n\nUnsupervised, long-term fasting can cause issues including headaches, insomnia, and in extreme cases, it can cause heart failure, Varady adds.\n\nThe more body fat a person has, the longer they can live without eating, Varady says. Which is why Okung might have been able to last 40 days, beginning at 330 pounds, but a person considered a \"normal\" weight would not survive as long.\n\nUltimately, Okung's 40-day water fast shouldn't be attempted by the average person, Varady says. And those who are above age 65 or under 22, are pregnant, have eating disorders or diabetes should avoid fasting altogether.\n\n\"It's scary when people (with large platforms) share this stuff and then everyone's like, 'I'm going to do it,'\" she says. \"Anything over five days, don't do this on your own and definitely not if you have any kind of medical condition.\"\n\nContributing: Kristin Lam\n\nDiplo says he ran a marathon on LSD.Experts say he's tripping.\n\nThe Rock takes a cold shower every day.Should you?

Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN —\n\nA weekly dose of a medication recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat type 2 diabetes may help adults without diabetes lose weight as well, a new study found.\n\nTirzepatide, which is sold under the brand name Mounjaro, was studied in people without diabetes in three dosages: 5, 10 and 15 milligrams. Participants with obesity or who were overweight and took the 5-milligram dose lost an average of 35 pounds (16 killograms), those on the 10-milligram dose lost an average of 49 pounds (22 kilograms), and participants on the 15-milligram dose lost an average of 52 pounds (23.6 kilograms).\n\n“Almost 40% of individuals lost a quarter of their body weight,” said coauthor Dr. Ania Jastreboff, codirector of the Yale Center for Weight Management in a briefing for the media.\n\n“The data was quite impressive,” said Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer of the American Diabetes Association, who spoke to CNN from the ADA’s 82nd Scientific Sessions in New Orleans, where the study results were presented.\n\n“The weight loss that they got in this study was even greater than what had been seen in the previous studies of people with diabetes,” Gabbay, who was not involved with the study, said.\n\n“The middle range of weight loss for people in this new study was 49 pounds – 49 pounds is a lot,” he said. “It’s the range of weight loss that we typically think only possible through surgery.”\n\nAll in all, people without diabetes lost an average of 15% to 20.9% of their starting body weight over the course of the 72-week double-blinded, randomized clinical trial, which was published Saturday in The New England Journal of Medicine. Participants who got a placebo lost between 2.4% and 3.1% of their body weight, on average.\n\nIn comparison, studies on people with diabetes who used tirzepatide found they lost an average of 15% of their starting body weight, Gabbay said.\n\nHere's why you can't stop eating pizza, ice cream and chocolate chip cookies 01:42 - Source: CNN\n\n“This is a not uncommon observation,” he said. “The impact of previous weight loss medications are less effective in people with diabetes, and we honestly don’t know exactly why.”\n\nHowever, the impact of tirzepatide on people with diabetes is still “profound,” Gabbay said, “providing much more than other tools that we’ve had.”\n\nSelf-injected dose\n\nFor the new study, weekly injections of tirzepatide were tested in more than 2,500 people without diabetes who had a body mass index (BMI) over 30 or who were over 27 BMI and had at least one weight-related health condition such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or cardiovascular disease. A measure of a person’s height-to-weight ratio, a BMI of 25 or higher is considered overweight in adults.\n\nAt the start of the study, the participants had an average weight of 231 pounds (104.8 kilograms) and average BMI of 38.\n\nAdults in the study injected themselves with tirzepatide or a placebo once a week, using “a small penlike device with a tiny, tiny needle,” Gabbay said. “The prick from that needle is less painful than, for example, people that prick their fingers to measure blood glucose.”\n\nPeople in the study also received counseling sessions to help them stay on a healthy diet with a daily 500-calorie deficit, as well as at least 150 minutes of physical activity each week. While that certainly helped, it does not explain the magnitude of the weight loss seen in the study, Gabbay said.\n\nVIDEO: If you do just one exercise every day, try this one 02:32 - Source: CNN\n\n“The kind of weight loss that we see when people exercise and change their calorie intake is somewhere in the order of 5% to 7%,” he said. “This study showed a profoundly greater weight loss, far above what we would imagine with lifestyle changes.”\n\nThe most common side effects reported were nausea, diarrhea and constipation. Between 2.6% and 7.1% of the participants discontinued treatment due to adverse events.\n\nMounjaro carries a boxed warning about thyroid tumors and should not be used by people with a family history of certain thyroid conditions.\n\n“Obesity should be treated like any other chronic disease – with effective and safe approaches that target underlying (causes of) disease … and these results underscore that tirzepatide may be doing just that,” Jastreboff of the Yale Center for Weight Management said in an American Diabetes Association news release.\n\n“These results are an important step forward in potentially expanding effective therapeutic options for people with obesity.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte Virginia Langmaid", "Sandee Lamotte", "Virginia Langmaid"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/10/health/steps-for-weight-loss-wellness/index.html", "title": "How many steps a day should you take to lose weight | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide up will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.\n\nCNN —\n\nPut on your walking shoes and don’t forget your step counter: You can reduce your risk for cancer, heart disease and early death by getting up to 10,000 steps a day, but any amount of walking helps, according to a new study.\n\nStudies show the average person gains between 1 and 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilograms) each year from young adulthood through middle age, slowly leading to an unhealthy weight and even obesity over time.\n\n“People really can reduce their risk of obesity by walking more,” said study author Dr. Evan Brittain, associate professor in the division of cardiovascular medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.\n\nThe study also found key benefits for chronic diseases and conditions: “Diabetes, sleep apnea, hypertension, diabetes, depression, and GERD showed benefit with higher steps,” said Brittain via email.\n\n“The relationship with hypertension and diabetes plateaued after about 8,000 to 9,000 steps but the others were linear, meaning higher steps continued to reduce risk,” he said. “I would say that the take home messages are that more steps are better.”\n\nIt’s yet another study illustrating the powerful impact that walking and other forms of exercise have on our health. In fact, if you get up and move for 21.43 minutes each day of the week, you cut your risk of dying from all causes by one-third, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAn increase in steps can help with chronic conditions such as diabetes and depression, the study says. SeventyFour/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nCurrent physical activity recommendations for adults are 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, dancing, bicycling, doubles tennis and water aerobics, and two days of muscle-strengthening activity each week.\n\n“Physical activity is just absolutely magnificent,” Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver, told CNN in an earlier interview.\n\n“And when if you blend that with eating a more plant-based diet, de-stressing, sleeping enough and connecting with others — that’s your magic recipe,” Freeman said. “It’s the fountain of youth, if you will.”\n\nLower obesity risk with more steps\n\nActivity trackers allow researchers to get more accurate data that can be compared with health records. ricka_kinamoto/Adobe Stock\n\nThe study analyzed an average of four years of activity and health data from more than 6,000 participants in the National Institutes of Health’s All of Us Research Program, dedicated to research on ways to develop individualized health care.\n\nParticipants in the study, published on October 10, 2022, in the journal Nature Medicine, wore activity trackers at least 10 hours a day and allowed researchers access to their electronic health records over multiple years.\n\n“Our study had an average of 4 years of continuous activity monitoring. So, we were able to account for the totality of activity between when monitoring started and when a disease was diagnosed, which is a major advantage because we didn’t have to make assumptions about activity over time, unlike all prior studies,” Brittain said.\n\nPeople in the study ranged in age from 41 to 67 and had body mass index levels from 24.3, which is considered in the healthy weight range, to 32.9, which is considered obese.\n\nResearchers found that people who walked 4 miles a day — about 8,200 steps — were less likely to become obese or suffer from sleep apnea, acid reflux and major depressive disorder. Sleep apnea and acid reflux respond well to weight loss, which can reduce pressure on the throat and stomach, while exercise is a cornerstone treatment for depression.\n\nThe study also found that overweight participants (those with BMIs ranging from 25 to 29) cut their risk of becoming obese by half if they increased their steps to 11,000 steps a day. In fact, “this increase in step counts resulted in a 50% reduction in cumulative incidence of obesity at 5 years,” the study found.\n\nApplying the data to a specific example, the authors said individuals with BMIs of 28 could lower their risk of obesity 64% by increasing steps from about 6,000 to 11,000 steps per day.\n\nWhat about the benefits of 10,000 steps?\n\nHealth benefits rose with every step, the study found, but peaked at 10,000 steps – after that the effects faded. Counting steps may be especially important for people who do unstructured, unplanned physical activity such as house work, gardening and dog walks.\n\n“Notably, we detected an association between incidental steps (steps taken to go about daily life) and a lower risk of both cancer and heart disease,” noted study coauthor Borja del Pozo Cruz, an adjunct associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, Denmark, and senior researcher in health sciences for the University of Cadiz in Spain.\n\nDel Pozo Cruz and his team recently published a similar study that found walking 10,000 steps a day lowered risk for dementia by 50%. Risk decreased by 25% with as few as 3,800 steps a day, according to the previous study.\n\nHowever, if walking occurred at a brisk pace of 112 steps a minute for 30 minutes, it maximized risk reduction, leading to a 62% reduction in dementia risk. The 30 minutes of fast-paced walking didn’t have to occur all at once, either – it could be spread out over the day.\n\nResearchers found the association between peak 30-minute steps and risk reduction to be dependent on the disease studied.\n\nThe study also found an association between step intensity and health benefits as well, “although the relationships were less consistent than with step counts,” researchers said.\n\n“But the truth is, the same goal has always applied: Challenge yourself at whatever fitness level you’re at. Obviously check with your doctor first, but your goal is to become breathless for 30 minutes each day.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/09/20/indiana-boy-17-died-smoking-weed-chs-blame-what-chs/2387571001/", "title": "He loved weed. Then the vomiting began. Months later, he died", "text": "The doctors told Regina Denney and her son Brian Smith Jr. what was causing his severe vomiting and abdominal pain.\n\nNeither the teenager nor his mother believed what they said: smoking weed.\n\nSmoking marijuana, the two knew, was recommended to cancer patients to spur the appetite. How could it lead to Brian's condition?\n\nAs the months went by and the pounds slipped off Brian’s once healthy frame, it was clear that whatever was causing his stomach troubles had just the opposite effect.\n\nBrian kept smoking. The symptoms continued on and off.\n\nLast October, after another severe bout of vomiting, the teenager died. He was 17 years old.\n\nFive months later, as Denney pored over a coroner’s report for answers, she finally accepted that marijuana played a pivotal role in her son’s death. The autopsy report, which Denney received in March, attributed her son's death to dehydration due to cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.\n\n\"We had never heard about this, had never heard about marijuana causing any vomiting. He and I were like, 'Yeah, I think it’s something else,' ” Denney said. “Brian did not believe that was what it was because of everything we had ever been told about marijuana. … It didn’t make any sense.”\n\nCannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, also known as CHS, can arise in response to long-term cannabis use. The syndrome consists of vomiting, nausea and abdominal pain, which can often be alleviated by taking hot showers.\n\nDoctors say CHS is on the rise, but they are not certain why. Marijuana is more available than in years past, and it is more potent.\n\nRarely does CHS result in death.\n\n'Basically, they smoked weed'\n\nDenney didn’t like the fact that her teen son started smoking at 13, but she figured the situation could be worse. Brian and she had a strong relationship, and he always had been honest with her about his use of marijuana.\n\nFor the most part, Brian was a good kid who had a tightknit group of friends who called themselves the GBS, Gimber Block Savages, after the south side street where many of them lived. Although they called themselves a gang, Denney said, they never caused any trouble.\n\n“Basically, they smoked weed,” she said.\n\nAbout two years after Brian started smoking, he began using a lot more, perhaps to help deal with depression, Denney said. He dropped out of school after ninth grade and started working full-time with an uncle who had a tree-trimming business. Brian helped clear brush.\n\nThe job provided enough money to support his marijuana habit, another reason Denney felt there was no reason for her to intervene. After all, many of Brian’s peers were using heroin or methamphetamine.\n\n“I thought, 'OK, if that’s all he’s doing, smoking marijuana, pick and choose your battles,' ” she said. “If this is the worst thing he’s doing, I’m OK. He’s not in any trouble legally. He’s not playing with guns, robbing people and stealing things. He’s supporting his own habit. I thought, 'OK, this is what it is.' ”\n\nDenney had no reason to be concerned about cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. She, like many others, had never heard of it.\n\n'A totally underdiagnosed entity'\n\nA few years ago, many doctors had no idea this condition existed. First described 15 years ago, CHS symptoms follow heavy cannabis use and include intense stomach pain, bouts of vomiting and debilitating nausea.\n\nA study published last year in the journal Basic & Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology surveyed urban emergency room patients who smoked marijuana 20 or more days a month. Of the 155 who said yes, almost a third experienced CHS symptoms.\n\n“A lot of papers prior to mine would say it’s very rare,” said Joseph Habboushe, one of the study’s authors and a clinical associate professor of emergency medicine at NYU Langone Health in New York City, who saw his first case five or six years ago. “Emergency room doctors on the front-line lines, we know that it’s a totally underdiagnosed entity.”\n\nOn the other side of the country, Dr. Jeff Lapoint and his colleagues saw an influx of patients with CHS symptoms about six years ago. Lapoint is the director of the division of medical toxicology at Kaiser Permanente Southern California and practices in San Diego, which he said is home to both craft beer and craft marijuana.\n\nMany of Lapoint's patients returned time after time when the next bout hit, seeking relief from their stomach woes.\n\n“We would see lots of it. We would see an alarming amount of it,” Lapoint said. “People were coming in all the time, and physicians didn’t know what to do with them.”\n\nOp-ed:Vaping deaths and booming black market: Pot experiment will fail without better oversight\n\nLapoint said he and his colleagues have seen fewer such cases lately.\n\nHabboushe concluded in his study that as many as 2.75 million regular cannabis users may suffer from symptoms of CHS, though many of them may be mild. Mild symptoms can serve as a warning to discontinue cannabis use to avoid more severe distress down the line, Habboushe said.\n\nA study this year in the Journal of Forensic Science described two people in Canada who died from CHS and a third for whom the condition contributed to death.\n\n'It makes no sense'\n\nBrian was Denney’s baby, her boy after two girls. From the time he was a child, he suffered from acid reflux and often took medicine to ease the symptoms.\n\nBrian, who loved sports and the movie “Twilight,” was close to his family and called himself his mother’s “snuggle bunny.” He was beloved uncle BubBub to his toddler nephew, Zayden. He was a loyal friend, once giving up his bed so a buddy who was homeless had a place to sleep. As a teen, he split time between Denney’s home and that of his father.\n\nIn April 2018, Brian felt ill. At first everyone, including his pediatrician, thought his acid reflux was acting up. He lost 40 pounds and frequently complained of nausea that led him to avoid food.\n\nA few days into the illness, he called his mother and told her he couldn’t stop vomiting. Denney drove to his father’s house to take him to the hospital. On the way to Franciscan St. Francis Health, Denney had to stop multiple times for Brian to vomit.\n\nThe 1st tied to a weed shop:Another death is linked to vaping. This time, it's in Oregon\n\nBrian complained of tingling in his face. When they got to the hospital, half his face was numb, the muscles in his hands and legs constricted and froze, and he projectile vomited.\n\nDenney assumed he was having a stroke.\n\nWithin a few minutes, he was hooked up to oxygen and a heart monitor. Medical staff placed IVs in each arm. Tests revealed his kidneys were failing, and many of his other lab values were abnormal. No one could tell what was behind the attack, though they knew the frequent vomiting left him dehydrated.\n\nAnother emergency room doctor poked her head in the door and asked two questions: Do you smoke marijuana often? Do you take frequent hot showers?\n\nYes, Brian said. Yes.\n\nYou have CHS, the doctor said.\n\nThe following day, Brian was discharged with an appointment to follow up with a gastroenterologist in July.\n\nAlthough neither Denney nor Brian accepted the diagnosis completely, she urged him to consider not smoking as a process of elimination. He agreed, but he struggled with nausea and was too sick to work.\n\nThe GI doctor took a tube of blood, did no further testing and confirmed the earlier diagnosis: CHS.\n\nDenney remained unconvinced, thinking the specialist was too quick to accept the emergency room doctor’s diagnosis without doing any confirmatory testing.\n\n“Going to the GI doctor, I thought we’re going to finally get an answer. We’re going to finally know what we need to do to make him better,” she said. “Then when they didn’t run any other tests, it was like, 'OK, so why are we not doing them?' It makes no sense.”\n\nAfter that visit, Brian returned to his dad – and started smoking again.\n\nHe told Denney he had symptoms the whole time he wasn’t smoking, so what was the point of quitting?\n\n'The dose makes the poison'\n\nExperts aren’t 100% sure what’s behind the relatively sudden advent of this condition. They suspect that more potent cannabis may be to blame, along with several states’ decision to legalize the drug for medicinal purposes or altogether.\n\nIn the 1970s, THC concentration in most marijuana would be about 7%, Lapoint said. The mean concentration has risen to 15% to 30%, and it’s possible to make extracts with 99% THC.\n\n“Marijuana was the joke of the toxicology world when it was 7%,” Lapoint said. “People never got sick. … But now if you make the concentration 99%, it’s just like if a 17-year-old kid goes to a frat party and has a beer. That’s a lot different than drinking shots of Everclear 151. Just like anything, the dose makes the poison.”\n\nVaping lung illness::What we know about the recent spate of cases and deaths\n\nThe best treatment for CHS is to stop using cannabis entirely, Habboushe said.\n\nOnce a person develops the condition, he or she has probably done something permanent. Further exposure to cannabis highly increases risk of recurrence. Persuading patients to accept this can be difficult, Habboushe said.\n\n“There’s a lot of denial,” he said. “A lot of patients are really heavy marijuana smokers, and they really don’t want to believe that it’s related to cannabis and hard for them to believe because they have been using cannabis forever.”\n\n'Don't give up'\n\nIn July Brian moved back in with Denney. She knew he was not going to give up smoking, but she thought being around his nephew would encourage him to smoke less.\n\nA few months passed. Brian did not put back the weight, but he seemed to be a bit better.\n\nThen came Oct. 7. Brian started feeling ill again. Denney and her daughters had concert tickets, so she went to buy him Gatorade and popsicles to stem the nausea and asked his father to come and stay with him.\n\nWhen they returned from the concert, he started vomiting nonstop. They rushed to the St. Francis emergency room, where doctors transferred him to Riley Hospital for Children. Once more, Brian was rehydrated.\n\nDenney said her son cut back on smoking, but a few weeks later, he went to visit his cousins. “I know they smoked,” Denney said. “That’s just what he did.”\n\nWhen she picked him up Oct. 21, he felt a little nauseated but had not been vomiting.\n\nThree days later, Denney woke up around 5 a.m. to find her son sitting in the living room and clutching his stomach.\n\nHe told her it was his acid reflux but he was fine. Then he started vomiting again.\n\n“He was throwing up so much,” Denney said. “I was taking the bucket in there and holding it for him because he didn’t have the energy to hold it.”\n\nFor the first time, Brian told her he was going to quit smoking.\n\nHe grabbed his lower back, saying it hurt bad.\n\nRemembering his kidneys had suffered in his previous attacks, Denney called 911.\n\nBefore the paramedics arrived, she found her son lying on his side.\n\nShe rolled him over. He was not breathing.\n\nDenney screamed. She started doing chest compressions. Her daughter’s boyfriend ran across the street to get their neighbor, a Navy veteran.\n\n“I kept telling him, 'Fight, B, fight. I need you. Don’t give up.' I begged God to take me instead,\" Denney said.\n\nThe paramedics arrived and worked on Brian for about 45 minutes to no avail. On Oct. 24, Brian died.\n\nBecause he died at home, detectives had to investigate, and the coroner prepared a report. It took five months for Denney to receive a copy. It arrived on her birthday in early March.\n\nSoon after Brian’s death, Denney found edibles in his backpack.\n\nShe asked herself again and again what she should have done. Should she have forced him to go to rehab?\n\nDenney devoted herself to helping raise awareness about CHS. She started a Facebook group in Brian’s name. She talks about Brian and CHS every chance she gets. She keeps Brian close to her, wherever she is.\n\nPhotos of her son hang on the walls in her bedroom. On her dresser sits a dark urn emblazoned with a gold marijuana leaf that contain's Brian's ashes. His sister chose it. She knew her brother would have liked it.\n\nFollow Shari Rudavsky on Twitter: @srudavsky", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/14/making-weight/25741977/", "title": "Health is more than absence of illness", "text": "Daniel P.

It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight. Take a listen to the conversation below:\n\nMAKING WEIGHT EVENT\n\nJoin Register columnist Daniel Finney for a talk about a year in his effort to lose weight and regain his health. Meet some of the people who've helped him along the way, including trainer Nate Yoho, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk, dietitian Jacque Schwartz, physician Dr. Shauna Basener and psychiatrist Dr. Eric Barlow. The talk, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines, 501 Grand Ave. To register, visit: https://tickets.desmoinesregister.com/e/making-weight-one-mans-journey-from-fat-to-fit/tickets.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 5, 2016\n\nFat jokes\n\nCriticism comes with being a columnist. It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled read", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/daniel-finney/2016/05/25/making-weight-year-2-daniel-finney/84895382/", "title": "Making Weight: Embrace exercise zeal", "text": "Daniel P. Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 16, 2016\n\nEmbracing the zeal\n\nA friend made an offhanded joke about CrossFit members being a cult while we were hanging out a while back.\n\nI know he doesn’t read my paragraphs, so I decided to let him talk.\n\nHe complained about the fact that CrossFit athletes tend to talk about their accomplishments a lot and seem boastful about their fitness.\n\nFinally, I told my friend that I went to CrossFit Merle Hay. The workouts have helped me lose more than 120 pounds, get stronger, more flexible and more mobile than I have been in years.\n\nMy friend shrugged and said I didn’t seem like a narcissist. I let the conversation thread die out.\n\nIt strikes me as ironic to be judged harshly for both being morbidly obese and for trying to fight it at a gym.\n\nI should say this for the record: I don’t endorse CrossFit. This is the gym and workout plan I chose, mostly because of my close friendship with CrossFit Merle Hay owner Nate Yoho.\n\nI generally support any course of action that involves eating less and moving more, especially in a society as sedentary as ours, whether it be long walks or a regimented program of diet and exercise.\n\nCrossFit seems to have some kind of reputation as a place where people get hurt. I don’t understand this, in part because I went to CrossFit while I was hurting.\n\nMy knees hurt so bad it was hard to step off curbs or get in and out of cars. I could easily hurt my back carrying in groceries or getting out of bed.\n\nAt CrossFit, I’ve only gotten stronger, faster and leaner.\n\nAm I a picture of fitness? Absolutely not.\n\nThe things I see the elite athletes do at CrossFit boggle my mind. The feats seem truly superhuman.\n\nBut we all had different goals. My goal is losing weight and having the physical strength and endurance to live my life without limitations as long as possible.\n\nIt’s true that CrossFit athletes do talk about their activities. I spent a good five minutes talking to Nate about my technique on the rowing machine in a recent session.\n\nNate encouraged me to lean back farther, pull harder with my arms to get the most out of my strong legs. The first workout I tried his tips in resulted in much higher rotations per minute during my rows.\n\nA year ago, I never thought I would ever have a conversation with anyone about technique on a rowing machine.\n\nThat CrossFit athletes talk about what they do isn’t so unusual. How many times have you been stuck next to someone who is very into gardening, shopping of fantasy football?\n\nI don’t write these paragraphs to pick on my friend. He’s as good and loyal a man as I know.\n\nWhat I am emphasizing, however, is that we could all do a better job of being more tolerant of different ideas and different ways.\n\nThe truth is, I probably held much the same view of CrossFit as my buddy before I started it. I thought of CrossFit athletes as zealots.\n\nBut if this zealously is helping improve and extend my life. Count me all the way in.\n\nWEDNESDAY, DEC. 7, 2016\n\nEmpathy is winning\n\n“Someone @DMRegister must think @newsmanone story is compelling but it’s getting old, repetitive & a waste of space. Not good writer either,” wrote a Twitter user who identifies as Susan Thorne and uses the handle @SueIowaGal.\n\nI don’t know this person, or at least I don’t think I do. But the tweet tweaked all the proper insecurities.\n\nMaking Weight is “getting old, repetitive & a waste of space.” Yeah, I’ve thought that, too. It worries me a great deal. Part of the reason the story is so slow moving is because weight loss and wellness are very incremental with successes and failures.\n\nOnly the gross fiction of game shows such as “The Biggest Loser” produce weight loss results in quick bursts.\n\nIn fact, a study of 14 contestants who participated in the 30-week competition regained most of their weight if not more and suffered slower metabolism, which means they were burning fewer calories than they were before they participated in the show.\n\nBut the audience, in this case, readers of this news organization, have come to believe the arc of carefully crafted fiction can be replicated in life. I assure you, it cannot. And that’s why my effort to lose more than 300 pounds began as a marathon rather than a sprint.\n\nStill, I worry that readers, who are easily distracted and often bored, will lose touch with the underlying themes of continuing to fight for wellness despite setbacks and the judgment of others who really don’t understand how hard it is making life-altering choices.\n\nSo that stung. It’s a criticism for which I have no answer other than this: This is non-fiction and I am a work in progress. I can’t and won’t alter course to make the story more entertaining. I’m working for wellness, not “likes” on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe second half — “not a good writer either” — hurt a little, too. It hurt because I am insecure. Most people are. Few of us talk about it. We bluster or hide. In these paragraphs, though, I am as stripped down and raw as I can be.\n\nThis is a difficult path because I am more vulnerable to the cruelties of social media hecklers.\n\nYes, criticism comes with this job. I understand that and even welcome it. But the tone of the internet is overwhelmingly angry. My friend Bill McClellan, a semi-retired columnist for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, calls the trend “compulsive outrage disorder.”\n\nI am old enough to remember the beginning of the modern internet. When I was a student at Drake University in the early 1990s, we had something called a VAX system.\n\nIt had primitive email and text-only web searching. If you wanted to download a single photograph from the web, you needed some fairly sophisticated computer science skills to do it.\n\nBut even then there were bulletin board systems, the precursor to the chat rooms, which I suppose are an early ancestor of social media. And the bulletin board systems on that old VAX system where overwhelmingly angry.\n\nThe most popular posts were by people who said the meanest things about others on campus, particularly those in public services like the student government or campus newspaper editor.\n\nI’ve got a lot of experience dealing with mean things said about me by people I don’t know on the internet. And I am no better at it today than I was more than 25 years ago.\n\nI harbor great insecurity that I have my job not because I earned it through merit but simply because I survived through attrition after job cuts. My bosses tell me this isn’t true and this is a manifestation of my negative self-talk.\n\nMaybe they’re right. But there are plenty of former Register employees on Facebook who gleefully jump on any of my or my colleagues’ foibles to make withering remarks that I hope at least make them feel good about themselves.\n\nWhenever I write about these kinds of worries, someone drags out the cliché: “Just grow a thicker skin.”\n\nI reject this premise. That simply gives a permission to people who are being mean for the sake of being mean. I’m a sensitive person and sometimes things said of me hurt.\n\nI recognize, too, that I say things, either in an attempt at humor, through sarcasm or simply because of my perspective, that hurt other people’s feelings. I’m truly sorry when it does. That’s never the goal.\n\nJust the other day, I got into an argument with my boss over what was ultimately a trivial matter. I lost my temper in a fit of anxiety and said things I regretted. I later apologized. She accepted. We moved forward.\n\nI write about the effect of this tweet on me not to induce sympathy from readers. Rather, I note it because mental health is as critical to wellness as physical health.\n\nI’ve noted my struggles with anxiety and depression in these columns many times. Again, this isn’t a plea for sympathy but an earnest effort to broaden understanding and engage empathy.\n\nI’m just one person who is trying to lose weight, better control my mood disorders and generally get healthy. But, in a way, I represent roughly a million Iowans considered obese and about 750,000 Iowans who live with a mental health issue.\n\nI write about my struggles for all those people who don’t have the benefit of advocacy or representation in the media. And if that means I have to take hits on social media or the comment section, so be it.\n\nBut I think empathy may be winning.\n\nI finished my second full year as a columnist for The Register in November. Since I started the job, I’ve made it a practice of saving positive emails in a folder and counting them on or near my anniversary.\n\nReaders sent 1,309 positive emails over the last year. And thank you to every single person who took the time to sit down and write their kind thoughts, well wishes and other uplifting messages. It means a lot.\n\nAs for the Twitter critic, I responded with my usual form tweet:\n\n“Gosh, it’s nice to meet you, too. Where would you like your autographed photo sent?”\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 1, 2016\n\nThe long and short of it\n\nI’m learning that you need both a long and short memory when it comes to intense exercise.\n\nFor example, in a recent workout, my coach and friend, Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay, put me through a metabolic conditioning that involved a deadlift, shoulder press and burpees.\n\nThe plan was to decrease in reps by round, starting at 10 and ending with one. The workout was capped at 20 minutes. The added twist was three burpees every two minutes.\n\nThe first round went well. I attacked the 10 deadlifts and shoulder presses with relative ease. I hit the floor for burpees with as much grace as my 440-pound frame can manage.\n\nThe round of nine went OK, but I tired quickly.\n\nBy the round of seven, I was gasping for air, a little dizzy and needed to take a seat between reps. The 20 minutes expired and I stalled after the round of seven.\n\nNate encouraged me to get a drink and focus on lowering my heart rate with slow, deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth.\n\nI was annoyed that I didn’t do better. Nate told me we would retest on the workout in a couple months. He figured I would pass all 10 rounds by then.\n\nI lacked his confidence in me, but this is where the memory question comes in.\n\nIn the short-term, I need to forget that workout results. I did the best I could. I didn’t get as far as I wanted to, but I still worked out at a strong pace for 20 minutes. There will be more weights to lift, more burpees to, um, burp, and so on.\n\nThe point is to get in as many quality repetitions in as possible even if it falls short of the goal of the planned workout. Each rep builds muscle, burns fat and increases endurance.\n\nSure, I still wish I could rip through the workout at top speed right now.\n\n“If you did,” Nate said, “what would we have to strive for?”\n\nI smirked.\n\n“I’m sure you can find a way to make it harder,” I said.\n\nThis is where a long-view is necessary. It was not that long ago that I got winded walking to the mailbox and hesitated to step off curbs because my knees would hurt too much from the girth crashing down onto the fragile, arthritic joints.\n\nA week or so back, I realized I could lift my lower leg off the floor and catch the ankle with my hand to stretch out the quads. I haven’t been able to do that since high school. We’re talking more than 23 years ago.\n\nWhen I started at CrossFit with Nate, I had to awkwardly lift my leg onto a box and lean back to stretch that quad. Now I’m much more flexible and leaner than I was eight months ago.\n\nI still get disgusted with myself when I catch a glimpse of myself in the bathroom mirror coming out of the shower or see pictures of my bulbous belly.\n\nBut I have to remember that in a relatively short period, I have come a long way. And it’s valuable to measure those gains.\n\nNo, I wasn’t able to finish the workout Nate laid out before me. That’s fine. I will make it one day. The victory is making enough progress to even safely attempt such an exertion.\n\nForget short-term foibles. Celebrate long-term accomplishments. And remember every rep counts.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 22, 2016\n\nScaling back\n\nThe holidays provide a difficult challenge for anyone trying to lose weight.\n\nLast year, still early in my efforts to recover from morbid obesity, I decided to forego a traditional Thanksgiving meal at my uncle’s house. My parents and I celebrated together quietly on another evening with a menu friendlier to my diet.\n\nI’m following the same plan this year, but with an added twist. I’ve decided not to check my weight until after the first of the year.\n\nThis is not giving myself permission to blow my daily calorie goals for the entirety of the holiday season. Rather, it’s been a stressful couple of months with public tragedies and personal struggles.\n\nWeighing in, even when I expect good results, is an anxiety-riddled experience. All of the health professionals in my life repeat the same mantra: Weight is not the only, nor the best measure of health.\n\nStill, I know that more than 440 pounds is not a health weight nor sustainable if I would like to live comfortably over the next few decades.\n\nSo when the scale creeps up, I am terribly disappointed in myself because it feels like I’m doing the same work twice rather than gaining ground.\n\nThe science of this thinking is poor. Weight fluctuates daily based on a myriad of factors, including water intake and the kinds of foods you recently ate.\n\nFor example, my weight numbers tend to be goofy if I step on the scale after having taken a protein shake or within two hours of an intense workout.\n\nFurther, every time I write about my weigh-ins, particularly those after which I’ve gained weight, the internet trolls really pounce.\n\nI would love to tell you that after two years of doing this job and nearly as long chronicling my health efforts, that I have found a good way to cope with the cruel things people say to me about this or any other topic.\n\nBut I haven’t.\n\nPeople say I need to get a thicker skin. The thickness of human skin is about a tenth of an inch. Mine is no different. I just don’t like to be insulted.\n\nWhy, then, would I actively seek a career that puts me before the public eye and requires me to comment on issues that are controversial? Well, that’s a long story, but at least one reason is that stacking paragraphs is what I’m best at and fear is only a powerful force in your life if you let it limit your possibilities.\n\nStill, I’ve been on edge for a long time. Now is not the time to test my maximum endurance, which, while it is quite high, has been pushed enough for one fall.\n\nThe truth is, I’ve probably gained a few pounds in the last few weeks. I do two things when I’m anxious: spend money and eat.\n\nI’ve dug out some bags of french fries from the back of the freezer. I stabbed more than a few tator tots with my fork. One or two Marie Callender’s frozen meals, heavy with fats and carbs, landed in my microwave.\n\nThese incidents would usually lead me to a lengthy series of self-loathing. But this is a long game and, frankly, I’m tired of hating myself. I wrote last week about how anxiety has twisted my brain for several weeks and for much of the fall.\n\nI’ll go back to the scale in January. I’m not afraid of it. I just don’t need to do things that add to acute stress right now. This is my choice to make and I’m comfortable with it.\n\nI’m still going to the gym and getting stronger, more flexible and agile working with my friend and trainer, Nate Yoho, of CrossFit Merle Hay. I enjoy these sessions very much and come to view them as much as mental health therapy as physical fitness.\n\nI plan to keep my workout schedule through the holidays. We’ll get back on the scale after the first of the year. For now, I want to focus on fellowship of friends and family, calming thoughts and activities and making the best food choices available during a challenging season.\n\nTHURSDAY, NOV. 17, 2016\n\nSetting it aside\n\nThe new day’s sunlight filtered through the vertical blinds in my living room when I finally realized I had been up all night.\n\nI looked at the bright red digits on the clock on my TV stand. The time was shortly after 7 a.m. on a Sunday.\n\nI was wide awake and had been for nearly 20 hours. Normally, this kind of insomnia is associated with the panic attacks symptomatic of my acute anxiety disorder.\n\nBut I did not feel anxious. I did not feel anything.\n\nI just kept flitting between small projects for no good reason.\n\nIt started with finishing a page in my “Doctor Who” adult coloring book, an activity specifically designed to be calming.\n\nUsually, that works. This time, though, I became hyper-focused on finishing the page before I went to bed.\n\nI remember going into the bedroom at about 2 a.m. That’s late for bedtime, but not terrible for a former night police reporter who enjoys the quiet solitude of what Frank Sinatra described as the “wee, small hours of the morning.”\n\nI grimaced at the stack of comic books, magazines, half-read paperbacks, computer cords and other clutter gathered by my bedside.\n\nI decided it must be organized. This resulted in an hours-long reorganization of bookshelves and some furniture in my bedroom.\n\nIn the sorting, I discovered a small stack of 50-cent comics I bought at Black Medicine Comics. They were well-worn books from my childhood, “reader copies” as the collectors say.\n\nSome years ago, I bought an old-fashioned spindle rack similar to the one I bought comics off of at Montross Pharmacy in Winterset when I was a boy.\n\nI keep the rack in a corner of the living room. I thought I would put the comics on the rack and go to bed.\n\nThen I realized I didn’t like the fact the comic rack was in the corner and I couldn’t really see the books I’d just put on it.\n\nAnother hours-long reorganization of furniture began.\n\nA text from my girlfriend appeared on my phone at 10 a.m. I was still up. I told her I’d been up all night. I didn’t really know why.\n\nShe asked me if I’d taken my depression and anxiety medication on time. Sometimes I wait to take my medication so I can finish writing a stack of paragraphs or some other activity. But I took them at their appointed time, 10 p.m.\n\nWe exchanged a few texts. She urged me to get some rest. I showered and went to bed, but did not feel tired. I eventually fell asleep.\n\nI don’t remember what time I woke up Sunday afternoon. I talked with a few friends by phone. I napped through some dull NFL games on TV.\n\nThe reminder chirped on my smartphone. It was time to take my medication. I did. I went into the bedroom to read and get ready for a new week.\n\nThen I looked at the stack of books I reorganized just a day before. Wouldn’t they look better if I stacked them in a completely different way?\n\nFinally, just after midnight on Monday morning, I called my therapist’s after-hours service. He called back right away.\n\nI explained the patterns of behavior over the past two days. I couldn’t figure it out. I wasn’t manic, at least I didn’t feel that way.\n\nMy therapist talked me back through recent events. I helped cover the ambush killing of two Des Moines-metro police officers. Though I am not a police officer, I have a great affinity for the men and women who do the job.\n\nThen I wrote about my childhood friend Liz fighting terminal cancer. I recently learned another friend, Steve, who used to have the desk next to me at the Register, was “in the home stretch,” as he put it, with pancreatic cancer.\n\nAnd then there was the election. Sure, the popular thing to do is call people upset at the presidential results “crybabies.” But good friends of mine were terribly sad and angry. I could feel it. And it hurt.\n\n“That’s a lot of stuff you’ve got going on in a short amount of time,” my therapist said.\n\n“So why am I playing Tetris with my furniture?” I asked.\n\n“It’s just something to keep your mind off the things you don’t want to talk about,” my therapist said. “Your mind engages in these projects so it doesn’t have to think about what hurts.”\n\nThat made sense. It had been a rough few weeks. Too many carbs slipped into my diet. My motivation to hit the gym practically evaporated despite the supportive atmosphere. I felt wild and out of control.\n\n“I talk to a lot of people who are feeling the same way,” my therapist said. “Do you know what I tell them? Set it aside. There’s nothing you can do about it right now. You have to live your life.”\n\nThis seemingly simple advice helped me unlock “sleep mode.”\n\nI’m still very anxious, maybe as bad as I have been in a very anxious year. But I’m doing my best to handle it, keep commenting on the passing parade and telling stories.\n\nIt isn't easy, but, then, nobody ever promised us easy.\n\nWEDNESDAY, NOV. 9, 2016\n\nClearing the mechanism\n\nI thought I was processing the grief that came with the killings of two Des Moines-metro police officers as well as could be expected until I drove to the gym last week.\n\nIn the strip mall home of CrossFit Merle Hay, a vendor put up fencing and signage for a Christmas tree lot. I thought of Des Moines Police Sgt. Tony Beminio and Urbandale Police Officer Justin Martin.\n\nTheir families were weeks away from experiencing their first Thanksgiving and Christmas without their loved ones. Beminio was the father of three. I thought about my first Christmas without my dad nearly 28 years ago.\n\nI pulled into the parking lot and parked a few rows away from the gym. I composed myself and walked in.\n\nMy trainer and friend, Nate Yoho, seems to inherently read moods. After stretches, we started a deadlift. Deadlifting is my favorite weightlifting exercise. I can’t say why. I just like it.\n\nI pressed my mind into thinking about my form as I yanked 272 pounds from the floor for five sets of three repetitions. We did another round of three sets of three reps at 250 pounds.\n\nOn good days at the gym, my mind locks into the exercise and all noise both internally and externally fades away.\n\nIt’s a wonderful mindset. Your body strains, yet you ignore the exhaustion in favor of one more rep. You don’t even hear the music blasting on the gym speakers.\n\nThe best representation I can think of for this comes from the mediocre 1999 baseball movie “For Love of the Game.” Kevin Costner plays an aging pitcher throwing a perfect game on the last day of his career. Early in the movie, the camera pans across the jeering Yankees fans and the cacophony of noise inside Yankee Stadium. He looks in at the catcher and thinks to himself, “Clear the mechanism.” With that, the noise around him fades away and it is just pitcher, catcher and batter.\n\nThis level of engagement is rare for me. Often the exhaustion breaks my concentration.\n\nBut the elite athletes at the gym, like Nate, are practiced enough at the mental game that they can lock in more frequently and it is a marvelous thing to witness.\n\nI could not “clear the mechanism” last week, at least not in terms of getting into a zone where I was attacking the exercises without awareness of how tired I was.\n\nYet as I worked through 20 minutes of metabolic conditioning that involved rounds of carrying 53-pound kettle bells in both hands, rowing and sit-ups, my mind at least temporarily pushed out the grief.\n\nMy session ended as they usually do, with me panting on the floor in a pool of sweat, feeling an odd mixture of accomplishment and annoyance that I could not do more.\n\nAs I drank my protein shake, Nate and I talked about the fallen officers. I told him about the Christmas tree lot. Nate and I became friends after I wrote a story about the loss of his wife, Laura, to cancer three years ago.\n\nWe both paused to consider that in the beginning, everyone tries to help you cope with grief. But eventually, the ham sandwiches are all gone, people go home to their lives and you are left with a great emptiness that remains for the rest of your life.\n\nNate still feels the loss of his wife. I still miss my dad.\n\nMost days, both of us are able to “clear the mechanism,” as it were, and live our lives.\n\nBut some days, the hurt feels raw and fresh. And you are left with only one solution: Keep moving forward.\n\nTHURSDAY, NOV. 3, 2016\n\nStrange sensation\n\nI visited my doctor, Shauna Basener, while I was on vacation last month.\n\nThe appointment was our first since she moved from a clinic in West Des Moines to the McFarland Clinic in Ames.\n\nI decided to follow her despite the extra travel time because I feel a strong sense of trust, rapport and open communication with Shauna as a doctor and a person.\n\nThis relationship is critical while dealing with chronic health issues. In my case, those issues are morbid obesity, high blood pressure and arthritis in my knees and lower back.\n\nIn one of our first visits, Shauna won my trust when she told me to stop taking an iron supplement because my blood tests showed it was unnecessary.\n\n“The best medicine is no medicine,” she said.\n\nThis is a philosophy I wholly support. This is not to say I oppose medication or regular preventative care.\n\nThe idea is to help the body function properly without the assistance of medications or supplements. I still take two medications for blood pressure, three medications for mental health issues, a daily vitamin and a fish oil supplement.\n\nBut in the time I’ve worked with Shauna, I’ve changed my physical well-being enough to stop taking medication for type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.\n\nMy blood pressure reading was good enough that Shauna considered lowering the dosage of my blood pressure medication or dropping it altogether.\n\nThis idea astounded me. I thought once a person went on blood pressure medication, it became a permanent part of the routine.\n\nBut the weight loss and increase in physical activity over the last 19 months improved my health enough that some of the chronic conditions have eased.\n\nMy blood tests during this visit showed similar promise.\n\nMy A1C test, which gives doctors a picture of my average blood sugar level for about three months, was the second-lowest (that’s good) since I began recovery.\n\nMy cholesterol levels were within acceptable ranges and improving.\n\nAnd my weight was 444.6 pounds – a loss of 118.6 pounds since I began the journey nearly 600 days ago and also my lowest mark to date.\n\nI gained 13 pounds between August and September and the thought distressed me so I feel into a deep funk complete with the usual round of negative self-talk.\n\nBetween September and my October physical, I lost those 13 pounds and three more.\n\nThis inspired an unusual emotion: hope.\n\nGetting healthier means, barring accident or catastrophe, I likely will live longer.\n\nMost of my life, I’ve thought about the end of my life.\n\nMy dad died when I was 13. My mom died when I was 14. My dad was sickly for the last several years of his life.\n\nI used to write my will and testament on wide-ruled notebook paper that I kept in my desk because I thought that was something I needed to do.\n\nOne of my favorite teachers in fourth grade died of leukemia. I remember staying home from school the day after she died and trying to will myself to die because I didn’t want to face school without her kind face and gentle manner.\n\nThroughout all my struggles – health, financial, psychological or vocational – in my 41 years, I have always thought about how my life would end.\n\nI assumed it would end badly, with lots of pain and suffering or, as I have often admitted, by my own hand.\n\nNow, though, there is a good chance that isn’t going to happen anytime soon. This represents a dramatic shift in perspective.\n\nIf I’m going to live, what am I to make of my life? I need to reshape my outlook.\n\nIt’s daunting, but it beats planning your own funeral.\n\nTHURSDAY, OCT. 13, 2016\n\nA path forward\n\nThe pain lanced through my lower back like an electric shock.\n\nThe time was about 3 a.m. I tried to sit up in bed, but my lower back hurt so much I actually cried out.\n\nI tested the boundaries of movement. Articulation at the waist hurt the most. With some painful effort, I threw my legs over the side of the bed and pulled myself up to a standing position.\n\nI equated the harshness of the pain to the back injury that started this journey to recover from morbid obesity 19 months ago.\n\nI gingerly shuffled to the closet and fished out a prescription muscle relaxant I keep in case of emergencies. I swallowed one with some water and slowly walked into the living room.\n\nI tried to think of what might have caused this flare up. My workout at CrossFit Merle Hay earlier in the day went fine. I was tired but felt no pain or stiffness.\n\nTrainer Nate Yoho wanted to try a new movement, something called a sumo deadlift. I stood on two boxes a foot tall. I squatted and reached past my feet to grab a 35-pound kettlebell from the floor. Then I stood.\n\nThe challenge was almost like pulling 35 pounds out of a hole in the ground.\n\nAt the time we did the exercise, I felt the usual strains associated with a workout, but nothing spectacular.\n\nWe finished with a metabolic conditioning cycle that involved kettlebell swings and the rowing machine. I walked – and partially ran – a mile.\n\nI drank a protein shake and a recovery drink. I sat around for a while to watch the most experienced athletes prepare for an upcoming competition.\n\nI returned to my home office to stack paragraphs and knocked off for the day in the early evening.\n\nI recalled no incidents that would have set off this tight, aching back.\n\nYet there I sat in my living room, waiting for the pain killer to kick in propped up by some extra pillows in the small of my back and barely able to move.\n\nI worried the injury would stop the progress I’ve made at the gym in recent weeks. Since a recent setback in weight loss, I’ve shifted focus from the scale to what I can do with my body.\n\nI’ll return to the scale soon enough, but confidence comes quicker and more practically through training than it does in those few anxious seconds before I step on a scale.\n\nThe pain, combined with the sluggishness that comes with muscle relaxers, sidelined me from the gym later that day.\n\nI hate to miss sessions, which is in itself something of a victory. I never thought I would enjoy training as much as I do and in such a variety of ways, from the physical exertion and strength gains to camaraderie of the trainers and athletes.\n\nI also hate to miss sessions because even though I know recovery is just as important as exercise, my brain – twisted by anxiety – always believes a missed session means my body begins to atrophy and I’ll lose all the strength and mobility I’ve gained.\n\nIt’s an irrational worry, as most of mine are, but it’s something I wrestle with in these situations.\n\nOn the day I took off and during my regular off day, I tried to stretch as often as I could. I bent over and put my palms on the floor. I cycled through the exercises I learned in physical therapy when I originally hurt my back.\n\nThe pain lingered at varying intensities, but by the end of the second day off I started to feel better. My back still hurt – especially after long periods sitting or lying down.\n\nBut I found myself texting Nate, pledging to be at our next session. I wasn’t fully recovered, but Nate is used to working around injuries.\n\nHe recently had a client with a torn bicep who came in and managed to work out. My injury was far less severe than that.\n\nI took several lessons from this frightening recurrence of back pain. First, I am in better shape and stronger than I was 19 months ago. That means my body recovers faster even when it really hurts.\n\nAnd secondly, while I might worry that every pitfall will be catastrophic, I’m slowly beginning to understand that not everything is going to end in disaster.\n\nThis is something my mental health therapist has been working on with me for years, as have my family, friends and loved ones.\n\nBut it took working out at CrossFit with Nate to finally realize there is always a path forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, OCT. 5, 2016\n\nCast of characters\n\nSometimes I watch them, the other athletes and trainers, as I sit on the wooden bench at the front of CrossFit Merle Hay, dabbing the sweat from my bald head and recovering my breath.\n\nIt still feels like an exaggeration to refer to myself as an “athlete” in this gym filled with men and women who look like Greek marble statues come to life.\n\nBut Nate Yoho, the gym’s owner, insists upon it. Once you heft the first weight, pull the first row and walk the first step, to Nate, you are an athlete – his athlete.\n\nWhen my workouts end, I drink a protein shake and suck water from an aluminum bottle.\n\nThey truly come in all shapes and sizes, both athletes and trainers.\n\nThere is 72-year-old Denny Joe, survivor of three open-heart surgeries. A doctor told him he would never run again. He runs nearly every day on a high school track near his home.\n\nHe works with Nate, who helps him with flexibility, strength and stamina. On a recent day, I watched Denny Joe prop himself up on his forearms and rest his ankles on a box. He held a ridged position with his abs tightened for 2 minutes. They call the exercise planking. I call it amazing.\n\nOn the days when my arthritic knees bark and I want to stay in my comfortable oversized office chair, I think of Denny Joe, the septuagenarian superman who still runs when they told him he could not.\n\nVan Marshall works alongside Nate as a trainer. He hurt his hamstring recently and then hurt it again. This stops normal people from intense workout. It turned Van into a carpenter.\n\nHe assembled workout equipment that allowed him to exercise without straining his injured muscle a third time.\n\nMy favorite: He wound a thick rope around a sled and stacked heavy weight plates atop it. With another athlete, they took turns pulling the heavy sled across the floor. While one pulled, the other did pushups.\n\nWhen I gasp for air and think I have no more to give, I think of Van and push just a little harder.\n\nMichelle is another trainer at CrossFit. She works with a young, overweight middle school girl. She pours her heart into inspiring the girl to embrace fitness the way she embraces reading and academic achievement.\n\nMichelle starts each session by walking beside the girl. I don’t know what they talk about and it’s none of my business.\n\nBut in those dark moments when I want to quit because it feels hopeless or the chemical malfunctions in my brain turn my thoughts against me, I think of Michelle and the culture of this gym. I know I never walk alone.\n\nI watch Nate as he works with other athletes. He greets everyone with a smile. He encourages, corrects, directs and pushes.\n\nHe is in top physical condition, stronger and faster than he has ever been in his 33 years. He recently set a series of personal records in competition-style workouts. Had they been in a competition, he would have finished 17th in the region and in the top 100 in the world.\n\nNate relates the accomplishments with the giddiness of a small boy. Yet I witness him reflect that same enthusiasm and joy for the gains of his athletes.\n\nWords fail to accurately reflect how much I respect this man, how honored I am by his friendship. He played minor league baseball but never cracked the big leagues, the kind of disappointment that turns many people into round-bellied storytellers at the end of the bar, loudly reliving their glory days to anyone within earshot.\n\nBut Nate rebuilt. He came home to Des Moines, became a trainer, met the love of his life, got married and opened his own gym.\n\nThen Nate lost his wife to cancer a few months before his daughter was born by surrogate. That’s the kind of twist of fate that could crack a man.\n\nNate rebuilt again. His world rotates around daughter Caralyn, who turns 3 in November. Nate plans to move into a larger site to accommodate the growth at his gym.\n\nSometimes I look at myself in the mirror and grimace at what I see. I think withering thoughts about my lumpy body, saggy skin and all the mistakes and overindulgence that led to that point.\n\nThen I think of Nate, who never judged me not on my first wheezing day when I could barely lift a 45-pound bar without pain lancing through my back and not on my most recent workout, when I tossed a tire, cradled a kettlebell under my chin while squatting and pulled ring rows for 22 minutes in a row.\n\nI think of this man who helps me three times a week push harder, get stronger and be better. And I know he does it because he cares. He wants me to succeed, sustain and achieve.\n\nSelf-discipline is a wonderful concept and not to be underestimated, but neither is teamwork. With my bent mindset, I give up on myself often.\n\nYet with this cast of characters working so hard to help themselves and each other, I shrug off the anxiety and doubt despite internal misgivings.\n\nI need only look at the faces of my teammates to find the faith to keep moving forward.\n\nTUESDAY, SEPT. 27, 2016\n\nA better kind of scale\n\nI needed a win.\n\nThe weigh-in that showed a gain of 13 pounds over the previous month brought my spirits low. I felt as if the work I had done in increasingly intense workouts over recent months was in vain.\n\nI had the vague, unrealistic fear that I was creeping back to the nearly 600 pounds I was before I began this journey.\n\nNate Yoho, my friend and trainer at CrossFit Merle Hay, seemed to sense this when I arrived at the gym.\n\nWe started with a deadlift, my favorite weightlifting exercise. It’s the one that reminds me I once couldn’t carry a few bags of groceries without hurting myself.\n\nNow I can pull hundreds of pounds off the floor without a problem.\n\nI can’t see the muscles in my back, but my girlfriend says they are firmer, and I feel stronger.\n\nNate and I started, as always, with 10 reps of just the 45-pound bar. We started to warm up, increasing weight and decreasing repetitions.\n\nThe plates started stacking thick on both sides of the bar.\n\n“I see we're going with the no-messing-around weight today,” I said to Nate. I may have used a different word than “messing.”\n\n“We’re going for it,” Nate said.\n\nBy “it,” Nate meant a personal record. I set one several months ago at 331 pounds.\n\nAt the time, Nate said I probably could have done more, but I began to lose my form — which can lead to injury — on my final reps, so we stopped.\n\nThis time, with form locked in, I pulled from the ground to my knees, keeping my back straight, my chest up and leading with my shoulders.\n\nNate kept sliding on more plates. Finally, we reached 352 pounds, which would best the previous record by 21 pounds.\n\nI squatted into position, set my heels and yanked that bar to my waist. I held it for a second before I let the bar drop and slam to the floor.\n\nNate and I bumped fists. That felt damned good.\n\nWe dropped the weight down to 225 pounds for five sets of five reps. I focused on the form that sometimes fails as I try to set records.\n\nI squeezed my shoulder blades together and led with my upper body as I stood. I worked the rounds.\n\nWith each round completed, Nate fist-pumped on the side. He bubbled with jubilation.\n\n“This is what I do this for,” he said. “This is about you getting your life back. You’re no longer a prisoner in your own body or your own home. You don’t have to worry about hurting yourself doing everyday things.”\n\nHe reminded me I pulled 352 pounds off the floor and was closing in on a full body-weight deadlift — a major accomplishment in weightlifting, especially for a man of my girth.\n\nThen he pointed out I finished 25 reps of 225 pounds. No amount of groceries I bought was going to weigh that. That strength was mine now, to nurture and build upon.\n\nAnd that felt even better than the personal record.\n\nFor our metabolic conditioning, Nate retested me on a workout I completed twice during our time together.\n\nThe set involved declining reps on three separate exercises for time, beginning at 10 and decreasing by one until the last round was one rep.\n\nThe three exercises were rowing on the machine, push-ups and pulling a 20-pound medicine ball from the floor and throwing it down.\n\nMy first time was 18 minutes — 18 seconds. The second time I ran the gauntlet, my time went up — in part because I fiddled with the straps on the rowing machine too much.\n\nThis time, though, I felt a burning sense of purpose, a desire to rip this thing to shreds.\n\nI don’t remember much about the metabolic conditioning series other than when I felt even the slightest sense of fatigue, I screamed to myself in my head, “Next time, you do one less than this time.”\n\nWhen I pounded the medicine ball on the floor for a final time, I fell to my knees and rolled over on my back. Sweat rolled back off my bald head and pooled on the gym floor.\n\nI could barely breathe.\n\n“Time,” I wheezed to Nate.\n\n“12:29,” he said. “You just beat your old best time by almost 6 minutes. You went to a different mental place to do that.”\n\nNate shook my hand. I stayed on the floor.\n\nMy chest heaved. My heart rate slowed. I smiled.\n\nI’ll take this measure of fitness over the scale every single time.\n\nTUESDAY, SEPT. 20, 2016\n\nSetbacks and commitments\n\nMy shirt hung heavy on my sweaty frame.\n\nThe day’s workout at CrossFit Merle Hay felt good. Coach Nate Yoho put me through a timed metabolic conditioning circuit.\n\nIt involved a row, followed by a bike ride followed by a 200 meter walk with a 50-pound barbell in each hand.\n\nThe thing took 20 minutes, 10 seconds. We both wanted to finish in less than 20 minutes, but the strength of my grip faded on the back half of the 200-meter. I need to stop one more time before the finish. It cost me a few seconds.\n\nStill, I felt good. I thought of all the things I could do now that I wasn’t able to do when I when I started at the gym about nine months ago.\n\nI probably am the physically strongest I have ever been and, outside of playing basketball as a sophomore at Winterset High School, this is probably the most sustained physical activity I’ve ever done.\n\nI drank my protein shake and a recovery drink. I chatted with Nate. We talked about how my form had improved in various lifts and exercises. I am beginning to develop body awareness.\n\nI felt good and strong. I decided to drive over to Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center to check my weight.\n\nWorkouts continued to increase intensity over recent weeks. The sweat and grind must surely produce a positive result.\n\nJacque Schwartz, my regular dietician, wasn’t available. Another professional familiar with these paragraphs took the measurement.\n\nMy jaw hung agape at the results. I gained 13 pounds since Aug. 11. It was the biggest rollback since I began recovery from morbid obesity more than 18 months ago.\n\nI held back tears as I slid on my shoes and socks. I hustled out to my car and collapsed into the driver’s seat. Despondency washed over me. Boy, the jerks on social media were going to love this. I can almost see the all the creative fat jokes being crafted once this column is published.\n\nThe first thought I had was to take the car down to Iowa Highway 5 south of the airport and get it up as fast as I could go and smash it into the bridge truss at top speed.\n\nI have suicidal thoughts sometimes. It is painful and embarrassing to admit, but it is true. They come from a combination of thinking errors, adverse childhood experiences and the malfunction of brain chemistry that goes along with chronic depression and acute anxiety.\n\nThis does not mean I am actively suicidal. It means that sometimes when I struggle, my mind visits upon those thoughts, usually exceptionally briefly. I first had suicidal thoughts in fourth grade after my favorite teacher died. I think once your brain cracks the seal on that kind of thinking, it always lurks in your mind even if you aren't going to act upon it. Author Susanna Kaysen, who lives with borderline personality disorder, described the persistent, illogical nature of suicidal thinking in her autobiographical book, “Girl, Interrupted.”\n\n“Once you’ve posed that question, it won’t go away,” she wrote.\n\nThat’s how suicidal thinking is for me. I think about it, usually when I screw up or believe I have disappointed people who give me their love and put their trust in me. Through behavioral therapy, I’ve learned to manage suicidal thoughts. The first thought I have is that I don’t want to cause pain to the people I love, especially Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nThen I think of the poor cop who has to see whatever is left of me at the accident scene. Or I consider the fact I might survive the attempt but permanently and severely injured.\n\nAll these thoughts pass in a few seconds or less. Usually, the real problems – sadness and disappointment – are revealed. Sadness and disappointment are rational reactions to negative events. These I can work with, unpleasant though they may be.\n\nOne note of caution here: Always take seriously someone who talks openly about suicide. I have a lot of experience wrangling these thoughts and an excellent support structure in place, but others — especially adolescents — don't have the experience to know the pain will pass.\n\nMy boss read these paragraphs and called to check on me, as one should. We had a talk. I assured her I was OK, just going through a rough patch. Talking is always a good idea. The worst that can happen is a person tells to buzz off or that they are fine. The best that can happen is they ask for help.\n\nI called my therapist and told him I was in a spiral. He asked me what might have caused the weight gain.\n\nMy best guess was too many carbohydrates. I indulged in one too many English muffins, lasagna and pizza a few times in the previous month.\n\nMy therapist emphasized that weight is but one measure of success. I was stronger. I looked better. I found a new community at the gym. I knew that, but when overwhelmed by the disappointment, I could not see it.\n\nMy therapist asked me what my plan was. I decided to cut my daily calorie intake from 2,500 calories to 2,250. I planned to more vigorously eschew carbohydrates.\n\nI also planned to break up my total calorie intake into three or four smaller meals instead of some snacks or protein supplements and one large, high-calorie meal.\n\nBy the time I finished detailing the plan, a kind of calm settled in. My therapist always says it helps to say things out loud. The negative thoughts sound silly and the positive ones make more sense.\n\nI texted the bad news to Nate.\n\n“Life happens,” he said. “I’ve never had a client who lost more than 100 pounds that didn’t slide back. Did you think you were going to be the first?”\n\nAt first, I thought Nate unsympathetic. Then I remembered a story he told me while he was playing minor league baseball some years ago.\n\nHe went through a 0-for-40 slump. He was the fourth outfielder on the team and only played once or twice a week.\n\n“I’d go 0-for-5 and sit for four days,” Nate said. “Nobody wanted to be around me. I was in a bad mood all the time.”\n\nThe lesson, though, is that nobody bats 1.000. I made some bad decisions with food and it caught up with me. I already had a plan in place to improve.\n\nYes, the usual trolls would come in via social media or email with their scolds and finger-wagging about the fat man who got fatter.\n\nI don’t have to write about the dark places my mind goes or the pain I feel when I don’t reach a goal. I choose to do so because setbacks, mistakes and failures are a part of recovery. Pretending that they aren't is simply a lie.\n\nSuch challenges matter less than what one does about them once they’re presented.\n\nI was back at the gym Monday afternoon, lifting weights, doing push-ups, burpies, squats, dumbbell snatches and kettlebell swings.\n\nThe journey continued.\n\nTUESDAY, SEPT. 13, 2016\n\nGetting to the good stuff\n\nForty seconds remained in the 15-minute workout.\n\nAt CrossFit Merle Hay, where I continue my ongoing battle against morbid obesity, they call it “AMRAP” – as many repetitions as possible in a set time period.\n\nThe menu of exercises included five “wall balls,” which involves squatting with a 20-pound medicine ball at your chest and standing up, throwing the ball to a mark on the wall in front of you and catching it, a 10-calorie exercise bike ride and 15 sit-ups.\n\nNate changed the form on the sit-ups. In the past, when my belly was larger and my back weaker, the goal was to get my hands to my knees.\n\nThis day he wanted me to get my hands to my toes, tapping my fingertips on the 70-pound dumbbells I hooked my toes under while doing the activity.\n\nWhen he first described it, I thought I couldn’t do it. I found I was able to do it with relative ease. This, of course, changed as the workout continued and my body tired.\n\nThe workout was near complete and I’d made three full rounds and was two sit-ups away from four complete rounds. But my abdominal muscles – I promise there are some under all of the fat rolls – started to fail.\n\nI needed to hit two more sit-ups with 40 seconds. I hit one. But on the final try, my muscles just surrendered and I fell back.\n\nNate hollered for me to try again, counting down the seconds on the clock.\n\nI tried and got about two-thirds of the way there, but my gut muscles had no more left to give.\n\nI rolled over and pulled my knees to my chest. I sweated and gasped on the rubbery gym floor. Nate gave me a fist bump. The final tally marked 119 reps.\n\nThis is the good stuff, I thought, out of gas and exhausted.\n\nHow did it come to pass that such a feeling of exhaustion became “the good stuff?”\n\nIn recent weeks, this job had been getting to me. I live with acute anxiety disorder. My brain twists small problems into big problems and sometimes no problems into big problems.\n\nI was really struggling with a few work-related things: jerks on social media, worries about convincing a broad audience that it’s worth paying for the content in The Register and so on.\n\nMy bosses assured me they were pleased with my work and that they were happy with how my paragraphs connected with our audience.\n\nMy brain was misfiring and I was in a loop. And when you’re an anxiety sufferer in the middle of a downward spiral, very few things can jolt you back to clarity.\n\nI worked with my therapist. He can usually do it, but I wasn’t settling to a normal rhythm. Everything felt uncomfortable and overwhelming.\n\nI’ll talk to my girlfriend about her cats or my buddy Paul from Memphis about stupid TV shows and bad movies, which is nearly all of them.\n\nBut that nagging feeling that my life was out of control and everything was going to end badly persisted. I woke up in the morning in a nearly full panic and found myself extra surly and suspicious.\n\nIt reached a point where I wanted to write a column that poked fun at one of Iowa’s sacred subjects but I was afraid to do it because of the beating I would take on social media, through email and phone calls.\n\nThat was the moment I knew I needed to take a timeout. I took FMLA leave to clear my head and bring the anxiety symptoms back into manageable ranges.\n\nI’m an insecure person. Lots of people are, maybe most of us are. I want to be liked and loved, but I’ve picked a strange occupation to seek adulation in the age of angry discourse augmented by social media.\n\nStill, an important part of my job is challenging the audience with ideas counter to the status quo. If I’m afraid to do that, I can’t be the kind of columnist I want to be and I might as well turn in my laptop.\n\nI took 11 days off, including the Labor Day holiday and two weekends. I rested. I read. I eschewed social media. I hung out with friends. I tried to get my sleep schedule back on track.\n\nAnd I hit the gym.\n\nI played catch with Nate and Van Marshall, a trainer at the gym. I ran through the workouts despite arthritic knees aching with the barometric pressure shifts during a rainy period.\n\nAnd the days I was at the gym, I felt settled, even gruntled. There’s science behind this. Workouts produce endorphins and serotonin, which lead to better moods and less anxiety.\n\nBut the routine of it – working out to near-exhaustion, hanging out with the crew – was as important as any of the physicality involved.\n\nAbout eight days into my sabbatical, I woke up and felt fine. My gut was calm. My brain was active and eager to be at the gym.\n\n“Today is the first day in about two months that I’ve felt good,” I said to Nate.\n\n“It’s about time,” Nate said.\n\nI agreed.\n\nBack to the recent workout: I lay on the floor in a kind of sultry daze.\n\n“Did you see there is a Part C?” Nate said. He meant there was another round to the workout. My brain cursed him, but I fought my way to my feet.\n\nHe wanted me to walk or run a mile, not for time. I restrained my profanity again. I drank a protein shake. I got my wind back. I hit the bricks.\n\nMy mind worked ahead. As I navigated the bumpy, pockmarked pavement behind the gym, I already was thinking of climbing the long hill on the access road.\n\nBy the time I was at the access road, I was thinking about the turn back to the building to complete the first lap.\n\nMy mind was working at the same frenetic pace it does during anxiety attacks. But instead of shredding my psyche with worry, it was planning my attack to finish this mile in less than 20 minutes.\n\nI jogged the last 100 yards or so and finished at 18 minutes, 54 seconds. I was out of breath. I sipped a recovery drink and sweated on the bench while Nate worked with other clients.\n\nYes, I thought, this really is the good stuff.\n\nTUESDAY, AUG. 30, 2016\n\nHead games\n\nThe kettle bell with the green stripes at the base of the handle weighs 53 pounds.\n\nRust peeks through portions of its rounded base where the black paint has chipped away.\n\nChalk dust coats the ball with clean spots made by drips of sweat striking the lead weight in a series of swings to end a grueling workout.\n\nThrough the loop on the handle, you can see the obscured image of a man exhausted, splayed out on the floor with his seemingly lifeless hand laying on the soft padded floor of Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay gym.\n\nThis portly paragraph-stacker unceremoniously dropped the kettle bell to the floor after 20 swings and collapsed in to what Nate calls “the CrossFit position.”\n\nI began the workout with some trepidation. My arthritic knees ached with the recent humidity and volatile barometric pressure.\n\nRecent workouts challenged the joints’ stability with jump roping and light jogging. I warmed up slowly on the humid day.\n\nAs always, Nate asked how my body felt. I warned him my knees ached, but, as always, I was not at the gym to be comfortable.\n\nWe began with an exercise called “thrusters.” The lift involves putting weight on a bar, holding it at the tops of your shoulders in front of your body with your elbows pointed out.\n\nYou squat and then thrust up from the squat, careful to keep your heels on the floor, and then push the weight above your head as your hips swing forward.\n\nMy knees hurt, but they eventually loosened up or enough adrenaline flowed that I did not notice the ache as badly.\n\nThe cardio portion of the workout came next. Nate lined up nine activities to be completed for time. It began with a 20-calorie row, a 100-meter run (run!), and 30-calorie bike ride, followed by another row, run, ride and run.\n\nThe capstone was 20 swings of the 53-pound kettle bell.\n\nLet’s pause for a moment to consider the notion of a 447-pound man running. Brian Brown will not be recruiting me for any special events at next year’s Drake Relays.\n\nBut running is something I’ve largely avoided since maybe playing a few pickup basketball games at Bell Center when I was a Drake University student more than 20 years ago.\n\nWhen I began this recovery from morbid obesity, a 156-foot walk was enough to drench me with sweat and force me to sit down, near complete exhaustion.\n\nI was in slightly better shape when Nate invited me to his gym in late January this year. But running and jumping were far from my mind.\n\nYet in recent weeks, we’ve started running and jumping. It’s difficult and taxes my knees in particular.\n\nBut my knees are strong. A doctor took X-rays when I weighed close to 600 pounds. There was still good cartilage and space between the bones. I was simply putting a lot of pressure on the joints, which caused the arthritis.\n\nNow I’m challenging those joints again, though with a body that is much lighter. Still, they hurt. Yet I keep pushing them. Because something strange is happening to me.\n\nI want to see how hard I can really go.\n\nI am good at rowing and the stationary bike. I keep a good pace at those, even when fatigue sets in. Running is new.\n\nNate said I could walk the 100 meters if I needed to. I pledged to run all four rounds, even if it was barely a jog.\n\nI stayed on the balls of my feet and dug in when I needed to climb the hill back to the gym.\n\nI regained my breath on the bike or rower. I still went hard, but I’ve become strong enough in those exercises that I can perform at a higher level and still recoup some of my energy for activities that are more taxing.\n\nNate set no time goal for me, but mentally I wanted to finish in less than 20 minutes. On the last 100 meters, my creaky knees really ached on the downhill run alongside the gym’s building.\n\nI turned to run back to the gym and I turned it on. Now, I don’t want anyone getting visions of Usain Bolt here. It was a slow, plodding, clopping graceless run.\n\nBut for a man of my girth on this point in my journey, it was a damn Olympic sprint.\n\nThe last round was 20 kettle bell swings. My breath was shallow. I decided to break it down into four sets of five swings. I made the first five and took a break.\n\nMy gray T-shirt was heavy with sweat. My arms and legs were slick.\n\nI swung five more and thought for a moment that I did not have two rounds in me. I leaned on the stationary bike for support. I gasped for air.\n\nNate suggested I try six swings to get more than halfway home. I decided I wanted to be done.\n\nI swung the final 10 swings in the third round. The kettle bell landed on the floor. I followed, spent and gasping.\n\nThe elapsed time was 17 minutes, 3 seconds.\n\nNate shook my hand. He let me be for a few minutes while I regained my breath.\n\nI propped myself up on my elbows.\n\nNate said I’d been hitting the floor a lot after workouts recently. I said he was pushing me harder.\n\nHe corrected me.\n\n“No, you’re breaking through mentally,” Nate said. “You’re going to that place in your head that really wants to push as far as you can go.”\n\nI understood exactly what he meant. Look at all I can do now when 18 months ago, exhausted after 156 feet, I asked Stefanie Kirk, physical therapist at Mercy South Physical Therapy, if I had any hope.\n\nNow my mindset is: Just how far can I go?\n\nTUESDAY, AUG. 23, 2016\n\nJump, jump around\n\nI bought a jump rope.\n\nIf Vegas took odds on what this paragraph stacker would buy, jump rope would not have even been on the board.\n\nBut I bought one because my trainer, CrossFit Merle Hay owner Nate Yoho, said it was time to integrate jumping into my workouts.\n\nWe worked on some light jumping, just a few inches off the ground. My arthritic knees took the pounding fairly well.\n\nSo I shelled out almost $25 for a jump rope. This isn’t actually a rope. It’s a thin aluminum cable with slim handles with rubber grips.\n\nThe elegant little thing is a far cry from the nylon jump rope with wood handles I received for participating in Jump Rope for Heart in fifth grade.\n\nScores of jump ropes hang on hooks at the gym. But Nate worried that none would be long enough for my 6-foot-4 frame.\n\nSo I invested in exercise equipment. It even comes with a small nylon storage bag to keep it tightly and tidily wound inside my gym bag.\n\nI have not jumped rope since it was a unit in physical education class, likely in elementary or middle school. I recall charts on the wall with various tricks one could do.\n\nMy favorite was “side swing,” which involved swinging the rope on each side of your body and no actual jumping.\n\nBut this is a new era. CrossFit athletes do something called “double-unders,” in which they spin the rope so quickly and jump high enough that the rope clears their feet twice for every jump.\n\nThis big-and-tall man is not ready for double-unders. I am barely capable of single jumps. But once the jump rope arrived, Nate decided to incorporate it into the metabolic conditioning.\n\nThe act of getting a body that weighs 447 pounds to jump up repeatedly while spinning a rope underneath is somewhat comical if observed from the outside.\n\nYet I was surprised how easily my morbidly obese form took to the rhythm. I made six jumps unbroken the first time. Nate adjusted the length of the rope and I was able to do an unbroken stretch of 16 jumps.\n\nThis will hardly set a world record, but it almost certainly is a personal one.\n\nJumping rope reminds me of swimming. It’s something done effortlessly as a child but somehow became exceptionally exhausting as an adult.\n\nI felt my heavy body pile-driving into the gym floor with each leap, yet I kept jumping the line as quickly and often as I could.\n\nNate included jump-ropes in our metabolic conditioning for the day. The series of exercises involved a 10-calorie row, 10 push-ups and 10 rope jumps over 18 minutes.\n\nThese metabolic conditioning routines are rough. I try to get through as many rounds as possible, but I often find myself gasping for air early in the process.\n\nThe arms always go first. By the second or third round, they might as well be those flags waving wildly in those wacky inflatable tube men on display at used car lots.\n\nThe legs hold out better, to a point. But I often feel the burn in my quadriceps earlier than I like.\n\nNate would admonish me that I am much stronger than I was when we started in January. But I stay in the moment.\n\nOne pull, one jump, one push-up. There is no past or future, only now.\n\nSomehow, in the midst of that cycle, the jump rope became the easy part. I got a rhythm fairly quickly and made it through 10 jumps unbroken three or four times.\n\nAh, but there were consequences. The first time we used the jump rope, it was a Thursday workout. Nate had just returned from a trip out east.\n\nTypically, Thursday workouts are a little lighter. The body is beat up from going hard at the beginning of the week. The Thursday workout is just to get the blood flowing.\n\nBut Nate’s assistants led me through workouts earlier that week. He did not see me grind through. So he decided to bring his own grind.\n\nThe workout ended and my legs quivered.\n\nThe next day, my knees ached as they hadn’t done since the early days of physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nI invested in a large bottle of ibuprofen, which cost almost as much as the jump rope. But hopefully the 1,600 pills will last longer.\n\nThe medicine did the trick for the inflammation. A light weekend allowed the knees to recover.\n\nBut after Monday’s workout, I texted Stefanie to ask her what muscles were hurting. I described the location of the pain.\n\nShe sent me the name of the muscle and a link to a health website to learn more about it. My trouble spots were the hip flexor and something called the quadratus lumborum.\n\nSo not only am I jumping rope like I did in middle school, I’m learning physiology through aches and pains after workouts.\n\nI took physiology from a great teacher at East High School named Paul Sloan.\n\nI don’t recall how well I did in the class, but if you’re reading, Mr. Sloan, you were right. I probably should have paid more attention.\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUG. 17, 2016\n\nNew sensation\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of anything. I’ve typed that sentence before, but I find it especially true as I evaluate the changes in my life while recovering from morbid obesity.\n\nThe latest weigh-in at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center shows a loss of 116 pounds since March 2015 and a decrease of my body mass index of more than 22 percent.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, but I am headed in the right direction — and have been nearly 18 months. My diet is better, but hardly perfect.\n\nMy exercise routines at CrossFit Merle Hay continue to grow in intensity. I probably am physically stronger now than I have been at any point in my life.\n\nStill, sometimes my brain defaults to running my body as if it were still 563 pounds.\n\nFor example, one of the reasons I began this journey was because I hurt my back carrying in groceries from the car. I carried in all my groceries at once because my body wasn’t fit enough to make two trips to the car without serious exhaustion.\n\nIn a recent workout, I set a personal record of deadlifting more than 330 pounds, under coach Nate Yoho’s guidance.\n\nYet, still, whenever I get home from the grocery store with the bags in my trunk, I think, “Oh, man, am I going to hurt my back again?”\n\nI eat well, but I do not carry 330 pounds of groceries at any point. I doubt I carry in 50 pounds of groceries.\n\nAnd the other day, as part of a circuit workout, I carried a 53-pound kettlebell in each hand on a 100-meter walk as a part of a series of exercises in metabolic conditioning. It wasn’t a strain.\n\nCarrying the groceries isn’t, either. But my mind thinks I can’t, even when my body obviously can.\n\nIt’s a strange thing.\n\nWhen I weighed 563 pounds, one of the most difficult tasks I faced six days a week was walking the 150 yards or so from my apartment building to the mailboxes in the parking lot.\n\nAt my worst, I would drive my car to the mailbox, get my mail and then park as close as I could to my door.\n\nNate and I have just begun to work on running and jumping in workouts — two activities I thought my body would never be able to handle again. I even bought a jump rope.\n\nI walked a mile the other day for time. I don’t remember the time, but it wasn’t bad, and I wasn’t out of gas.\n\nWe’re going to try a jogging and walking combo the next time we test on the mile.\n\nSo, of course I can traverse 150 yards without a problem. I just think that I can’t.\n\nSo I hesitate. I think, “Oh, that is so far.”\n\nThen I walk and think, “Why was I worried about this at all?”\n\nOne of the things my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, and I worked on early in recovery was getting in and out of the car without pain.\n\nTo this day, some 116 pounds lighter and much stronger, I often pause with my door open, dreading the idea of standing up and getting out of the car.\n\nI know I can do it without needing to use my arms to pull myself up on the frame of the door and roof of the car.\n\nBut I still think about it.\n\nI suppose this will eventually pass.\n\nI felt a little milestone recently at the gym when Van Marshall, a CrossFit trainer who was pinch-hitting for Nate while he was out of town, gave me a lengthy workout.\n\nI looked at the slate he outlined for me. It was one of those scaled workouts that decreases by one rep each session, beginning at 10 and ending at one.\n\nThe circuit involved rowing, ring rows and a weightlifting exercise. The whole thing was topped off with an 800-meter walk.\n\nI looked at that workout and thought, “Yeah, I can do that.”\n\nNow that is real progress, friends.\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUG. 10, 2016\n\nLessons in mental health\n\nDear Natasha,\n\nYour therapist emailed me asking for a copy of a recent column I wrote about an incident in my childhood in which my mother briefly locked me in the basement and how that affected how I think about the world.\n\nYour therapist kept with the ethics of her profession. She did not tell me your name or anything specific about your case other than you, too, struggled with adverse childhood experiences.\n\nNatasha, as far as I know, is not your real name. I picked the name Natasha because there is a Natasha Romanov bobblehead figure on my desk as I type. Natasha is also known as the superhero Black Widow and is played by Scarlett Johansson in the “Avengers” movies.\n\nAll your therapist said was that you struggled as a child and were working toward ways to change how that affects you.\n\nThis is good. This is great. It is an important first step, maybe the most important one of your journey. I wanted to pass along a few things I have learned in my efforts to regain mental health and physical health.\n\nYou are not alone. It seems that way, especially in the darkness of night when there is no one to talk to and the anxiety and depression creeps in. But there are millions of us out there who live with mood disorders. Yes, we struggle. But through the struggle we learn about ourselves and the better we understand ourselves, the easier it becomes to accept who we are and become the person we want to be.\n\nIt’s going to hurt. There is no pain-free path through the suffering we’ve endured or our current challenges. Remembering the things that we survived, whatever they may be, hurts. Sometimes it hurts worse than the day it happened. But you can get past the pain and on the other side of that is understanding. I wish there was an easier way toward personal enlightenment, but there isn’t. I promise you, though, it’s worth it.\n\nClosure is a lie. The link between adult behavior and childhood experience is well-studied and scientifically proven. Still, the world is not made up of thinkers. People like snap judgments and simple answers. They will tell you to “just get over it already” or that you need to seek something called “closure.” Maybe you will even tell yourself these things. These are fantasies. “Closure” is brought up when people who are tired of talking to you about the things that hurt the most. There is no such thing as closure. The most painful moments in our lives, be it the death of a loved one or a hardship endured, are with us for the rest of our lives. We never “get over” them. We just reach a point of where we understand that pain is a part of our identity.\n\nA reason is not an excuse. As you continue on your wellness journey, you will begin to understand the links between your current behavioral issues and their roots in your past. Still, you must accept responsibility for the mistakes you make now and in the future. You may not have had an easy go of it so far. That’s true for lots of people. Everyone makes mistakes and will for the entirety of their lives. Through therapy, you’re investigating the causes of the thinking errors that lead to patterns of mistakes. But the only way we make progress is by accepting our faults with our strengths and owning the person we are as a whole.\n\nKeep moving forward. You will fail. You will still have bad days. There is no such thing as a perfect person and there’s no sense in shredding your sense of self-worth because you’re not perfect. Remember that no matter how hard life hits you, no matter how often our brain chemistry twists our thoughts into knives that cut us so deeply, we are still standing. Survival is no small feat. Don't take it for granted. There is a difference between surviving and living. And the key to that is accepting that you are deserving of love, dignity and respect. I work on that every day and haven't come to fully accept it. But I, like we all are, am a work in progress.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDaniel P. Finney, fellow traveler\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUG. 3, 2016\n\nThe gauntlet\n\nCrossFit Merle Hay owner Nate Yoho wrote the day’s workout plan on the black dry erase board in yellow marker.\n\nHe said it would be a challenge. I read the list. I thought it was attempted murder.\n\nStill, in nearly eight months working with Nate, I’ve yet to refuse one of his “challenges.” The tasks daunted me.\n\nThe first round consisted of 60 reps of squatting and tossing a 14-pound ball to hit a target on the wall, 50-calorie row and 40 reps of a weightlifting exercise.\n\nA five-minute break followed.\n\nThen came 40 swings of a 35-pound kettlebell, a 30-calorie bike ride and 20 pickups and tosses of a 40-pound ball.\n\nThen came a seven-minute rest.\n\nThe final round was 20 “thrusters,” a chore that involves squatting with weight on a bar across your back and then pushing the weight over your head, 10 jumps onto a platform and five burpies, a kind of torture that can barely be described without profanity.\n\nI was halfway through squatting and tossing the 14-pound ball against the wall when the I first thought I was never going to make it through this insanity.\n\nMy shoulders burned so bad somewhere through the first weightlifting exercise that I was glad to be bald for I would surely never be able to wash my hair again.\n\nI remember the first break. My legs and arms quivered. I could barely lift my water-filled University of Iowa Iowa women’s basketball tumbler, a recent gift from my dear friends Lisa Bluder, Jan Jensen and Jenni Fitzgerald.\n\nI thought for sure I was going to throw up each time I leaned over to pick up the kettlebell for a series of swings. I thought I might actually pass out in the humidity. My forearms were slick with sweat.\n\nMy shirt, one of those newfangled fabrics that’s supposed to wick moisture away from the body, was heavy with sweat. Apparently the designers had not consulted Nate Yoho when they made that wicking promise.\n\nI kind of enjoyed the second round of ball throwing. I picked up the sand-filled ball, hefted it to my shoulder and let it fall to the ground behind me. I repeated the process 20 times.\n\nI like throwing things on the floor. It feels like something you should get in trouble for. Yet in the gym, under the right circumstances, such activity is rewarded.\n\nI can’t remember the seven-minute break. I know I took it. I drank water. I’m sure I hurt everywhere and felt spent. But my psychologist says the brain doesn’t remember pain. It’s a good thing. If it did, I would never get out of bed.\n\nI recall Nate saying near the end of the break that I should walk around a bit to loosen up. The first task of the final round was thrusters. I botched the first three reps before Nate corrected me.\n\nAt this point, I only had so many reps of anything left in me. It was no time to start losing form. I recovered.\n\nThe jumps came easy. Somewhere Stefanie Kirk, my physical therapist at Mercy South Physical Therapy, is squealing. When I first came to see her about 18 months ago, I couldn’t walk 156 feet. Now I was jumping. It was only a few inches onto a soft platform, but still — jumping.\n\nThen came the burpies. No one likes burpies. The fittest person in Nate’s gym will groan at the notion of burpies. A burpie is an exercise in which you touch your thighs and chest to the ground, hop to a standing position and then jump.\n\nExperienced athletes often jump over a weight bar. My goal is to jump enough to get my feet off the floor and clap my hands above my head.\n\nI did 30 burpies to close out a workout session earlier that week. I had “burpie burns” on both knees — red scabs from where the fabric of my shorts rubbed against my knees so much it created bloody sores.\n\nI needed to complete just five burpies to end the session. I felt like a building collapsing each time I hit the floor. But I fell five times and got up five times.\n\nThe workout ended. I survived.\n\nNate showed me the timer on his phone. I had worked out for an hour straight.\n\n“How does that feel?” Nate said as he offered me a fist bump.\n\n“Awful,” I said.\n\nThat was a lie. It felt fantastic. I mean I was spent. If he had asked me to do one more thing, I definitely would have thrown up.\n\nBut consider: I weigh about 450 pounds with arthritic knees. I made it through nine different exercises with a total of 275 repetitions.\n\nIf you’d asked me before I started if I thought I could make it through all that, I would have scoffed.\n\nYet I did.\n\n“I didn’t think I had it in me,” I said to Nate.\n\n“There’s always more left than you think there is,” he said.\n\nTUESDAY, JULY 26, 2016\n\nYesterdays matter today\n\nMorbid obesity is a medical diagnosis, but I also look at it as a symptom of my complex psychological profile.\n\nI’ve written often about the close connections between mental wellness and physical wellness, in particular the relationship of obesity to adverse childhood experiences. But I rarely write about the experiences themselves.\n\nToday, I want to share one story, a milder one, from my childhood as a way of talking about how patterns of behavior formed in my brain that continue to contribute to mental and physical health problems some 26 years after my mother died.\n\nI was a small boy. I’m not sure how old.\n\nWe lived in the baby blue house on Lynner Drive off of what was then known as Harding Road in northwest Des Moines.\n\nMy father was a traveling salesman. He was often away.\n\nMy mother could be loving and caring. But her moods were volatile. She took many medications for a variety of ailments both real and imagined.\n\nSome of the medications include opiate-derivative painkillers that now are illegal because of their highly addictive nature and side effects that include severe short-term memory loss.\n\nI didn’t know any of this at the time. What I knew was that if Mom was sleeping, it was best not to interrupt that because you never knew if you were going to get Loving Mom or Other Mom.\n\nI was so afraid of Other Mom that on more than one night, when she slept through dinnertime — which happens when you are on heavy painkillers — I crawled on my hands and knees to the kitchen and poured myself a bowl of Lucky Charms and crawled back to my room.\n\nI crawled because I didn’t want to risk waking Mom. Loving Mom would have made me toast and been apologetic.\n\nOther Mom would have been apoplectic that I was out in the kitchen dirtying dishes, and she probably would have sworn she made dinner, even if she had not.\n\nOne day, Mom slept in her room. I was looking for two comic books. I wanted to trace the art on notebook paper.\n\nOne was an issue of reprints of the Invaders, a World War II superhero team that included Captain America. The other was an issue of the Avengers, now the basis of blockbuster movies.\n\nI was fairly certain the comics were in the cream-colored bag with yellow handles that had a Joe Cool Snoopy silk-screened on the side. I kept things to do in that bag, activity books, colors and so on.\n\nWhen my parents went places, rarely were there things for children to do. I was expected to be seen and not heard.\n\nThe bag was in the basement. I was not supposed to go to the basement without permission, but I decided to risk it.\n\nI went downstairs and found the bag, but the comics were not in it. Mom appeared behind me.\n\n“WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE BASEMENT?” she asked. It was Other Mom, and I was in big trouble.\n\nI stammered an explanation. She would have none of it. The argument was brief, one-sided and loud.\n\nIt concluded with Mom saying, “WELL IF YOU LIKE IT DOWN HERE SO MUCH, YOU CAN JUST STAY HERE!”\n\nShe flipped off the light, slammed the basement door and latched the hook and chain.\n\nI tried to push the door open, but she slammed it onto my arm and I withdrew. The darkness scared me.\n\nMy feet were bare and there were sometimes creepy little water bugs on the concrete tile floor.\n\nI waited until I thought she was gone. I was a husky boy, even when I was small. I opened the door as far as the chain would allow and leaned in until the chain ripped loose of the door frame.\n\nI hustled up to my room, closed the door and nothing was said of the incident again.\n\nThe next day, Loving Mom took me to the Target down the hill to buy some “Star Wars” toys.\n\nEven typing that story today, I feel a tightness in my chest, a primal kind of fear that is hard to explain.\n\nI’ve written about schema before — behavior patterns set as children as a reaction to environmental stimuli.\n\nThere were three ways I learned as a boy to cope with the potential for Other Mom: eating sugary foods, watching TV and buying toys, comics and books.\n\nAs a child, these were effective survival strategies.\n\nBut they have led to unhealthy behaviors as an adult, some of which I have finally begun to address directly through psychoactive medication and behavioral therapy.\n\nYet whenever I feel stress — whether it be a performance evaluation at work, a cruel comment from a reader or simply an unexpected change in plans — I default to these reactions.\n\nI am a spendthrift. It is a terrible habit that I’ve learned is not uncommon among people who struggle with mood disorders.\n\nHistorians, for example, say Winston Churchill, who lived with depression, was constantly in need of money after he left the prime minister’s office.\n\nI have spent myself into bankruptcy once. I continue to struggle with overspending.\n\nSome people use the cute name “shopaholic” to describe the affliction. But this isn’t enjoying sales at Von Maur.\n\nThis is me trying to buy a sense of security and safety. My apartment looks like a combination toy, book and DVD store. And still I buy more.\n\nI should pause to note I don't blame my late mother for the mistakes I make as an adult. The authorship of those errors rests only with me.\n\nBut there is a difference between a reason and an excuse. This is an examination of the root cause.\n\nIt's the simplest and most human of all: I am insecure.\n\nMost of us are insecure to a degree. Mine is both chronic and acute.\n\nIt is strange that I chose a trade in which I would put so much of myself up for public scrutiny, but that is a column for another day.\n\nSometimes it’s hard for people to understand that things that happen to us as children affect how we feel about ourselves and act as adults.\n\nIt was a long time ago, the thinking goes. Let it go.\n\nUnfortunately, that’s not the way the brain works. It takes time to build new schema and the struggle goes on.\n\nThe good news is Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who took me in after my parents died, are thrifty. They saved 4 cents of every nickel they ever earned.\n\nThey counsel me on debt management and spending. I know I frustrate them because of my struggles turning off the spending spigot. But we make progress.\n\nIt really is the same principle as working out at the gym or losing weight. One starts and moves forward.\n\nThere will be setbacks, weight gains, missed reps on the dumbbells and money spent that should have been saved.\n\nThe best I or anyone can do is get up tomorrow and try again.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JULY 20, 2016\n\nA fitting tale\n\nMy friend Yvonne sent me a gift card to a big-and-tall men’s store for my recent birthday. She suggested I get myself something to celebrate my smaller frame after losing nearly 110 pounds since last March.\n\nI drove to West Des Moines with some trepidation. Yes, I’ve lost weight and it is both visible to myself and others but also measurable in gains in physical activity and health.\n\nBut lost weight does not always translate into a trimmer frame. The body loses weight asymmetrically. Some parts shrink quickly, others seem to desperately hang onto the fat.\n\nThen there is the problem I have described before of hanging skin. I was more than 560 pounds when I began this recovery. That extra weight stretched some of the skin in my body beyond its natural elasticity.\n\nAs I have lost weight, the skin has not shrunk to fit, so to speak. So I have great folds of flesh in my midsection that were once fully filled with fat now dangling at my beltline and below like the deflated envelope of a hot air balloon.\n\nShopping for clothes was never my favorite exercise, fat or otherwise. I have an odd predilection to either loud, brightly colored Hawaiian-style shirts or navy blue golf shirts and khaki slacks.\n\nVariety may be the spice of life, but the wrong shirt will hang in my closet for years unworn – much to the frustration of Mom 2.0, who for years try to style me up only to see me favor navy blue and khaki.\n\nThis much I will say about shopping for larger sizes for the good: 20 years ago, shopping for what was called “husky” clothes was an adventure in awful fashion.\n\nIt was as if manufacturers scoured the notebooks of the D- students at fashion design schools and told their factories to make that peach and cream stripped shirt, only really big with a pocket on the left breast and an elastic waistband at the bottom.\n\nToday, I can find clothes emblazoned with logos of my favorite sports teams, comic book characters and other pop culture ephemera. Still, I trend toward the navy blue golf shirts and khaki. There are very few places where such attire isn’t considered acceptable.\n\nDespite the expanded selection, there is always a lot of emotion tied up in trying on clothes. I’ve worked hard not to make this journey about a single number – my weight.\n\nBut almost as haunting as my weight is the size of my pants. The number on the scale can be kind of abstract after a bit, but few things terrorize the psyche as much as trying to button and zip up a pair of jeans that once fit loosely.\n\nStill, I was realistic as I selected several sizes of my current brand of khakis from the rack. All the exercise at the gym, the swimming and the diet would still count even if my pant size had not changed.\n\nI tried on a pair two sizes smaller than my current pants. I knew this wouldn’t work. This was sort of a Hail Mary. My current pants are very loose, but comfortably so. I like my pants a bit on the baggy side.\n\nI was right. Two sizes down was too far to go. I couldn’t button them. I shed them and tried the next size up.\n\nThis was the real test. Where was I at? Had my circumference at the waste shrank along with the number on the scale.\n\nI slid them on. Not a bad fit, I thought. I buttoned and zipped them with ease. These are all good signs. But there is a final test that all pants must endure before I will pay money for them: How do they sit?\n\nWhen I sit, that’s when those folds of flesh at the waist bunch up into what some inelegantly describe as a “front butt.” I took a deep breath and sat. And … fail.\n\nThe otherwise nicely fitting pants pulled taut over my belly. I looked at myself in the mirror and realized I would be uncomfortable and self-conscious, especially with the pockets filled with my keys, wallet, smartphone, pens, notebooks and sundry other items.\n\nIn the past, this sort of thing would have sent me on a spiral, feeling as if all the work had been for naught.\n\nInstead, and pleasantly so, I felt only vaguely disappointed. I know I am healthier. I also the journey is still in its early phases. My current khakis are made of sturdy material. I’ll wear them a little loose for a while longer.\n\nI spent the gift card on a T-shirt with superheroes on it and a polo shirt made of that material that wicks sweat away from the body. I even broke form with the color. It’s a pleasant dark gray.\n\nMONDAY, JULY 11, 2016\n\nDon't cheat, just eat\n\nA while back a reader stopped me in Tasty Tacos. He was a follower of Making Weight and wondered if my three taco meal was a “cheat day.”\n\nThe fellow was good-natured and lacked malice. It was, I thought, an honest question.\n\nI told the man I don’t believe in cheat days. I’m allotted a specific number of calories per day – 2,500. When I reach that number, I stop eating.\n\nThis isn’t to imply I have a perfect record on that. I go over a smidgen here and there and sometimes more than a smidgen.\n\nEstimating calories can be tricky even with the help of a quality smartphone app such as MyFitnessPal, my preferred calorie counter.\n\nThe goal, of course, is to use most of those calories up on food that is high in nutrients and low in certain fats, sugars, simple carbohydrates and chemicals.\n\nSo I could eat 2,500 calories worth of Twinkies, but I’m not going to get much nutrition out of that. And it won’t do my type 2 diabetes much good, either.\n\nThat said, I don’t go in for the “cheat day” concept. We can all make better choices about what we put into our bodies, but none of us are perfect.\n\nI would fare poorly on a diet of mostly greens, a few fruits and some meat. So, yes, sometimes an English muffin or even deep dish pizza finds its way onto my plate.\n\nI mitigate these calories by planning. For example, a buddy took me out for my birthday a few weeks ago. I wanted to go the Wig & Pen in Ankeny and indulge in their glorious deep dish pizza.\n\nWe split a large. That was four slices for me. I looked it up in advance. Those four slices amounted to 1,400 calories. We ate side salads with the meal.\n\nI still had room within my calorie goal for a glass of milk and a protein bar before bed.\n\nObviously I wouldn’t want to eat deep dish pizza every day. That would be counterproductive. But once in a while is fine, especially if I’m keeping up with my exercise schedule and making regular trips to the swimming pool.\n\nThe idea of cheat days bugs me for a couple of reasons. First, I think it encourages binging, which is a behavior that one simply must avoid to lose weight and get fit.\n\nSecondly, the “cheat” part of the concept implies you should feel guilty about the food you enjoy. That kind of thinking leads to shame and hopelessness that can lead to a shattered diet plan.\n\nI’m all stocked up on guilt and shame for this lifetime. So I’m not going to feel guilty about what I eat. What I am going to do is try to make the best choices possible within prescribed limits.\n\nFor example, Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died, host an annual July 4 bash.\n\nThe buffet table is laid out with scores of delicious goodies. Hardly any of them are on those preferred food lists.\n\nSo this year, I went with a game plan. I decided in advance which foods I really wanted and which foods I could pass on.\n\nI measured out my pork and beans, grilled turkey and pulled pork, coleslaw and pickles wrapped in chipped beef and cream cheese.\n\nI left the chips and the dip behind along with the scalloped corn and cheesy potatoes.\n\nThe toughest passes were Mom 2.0’s delicious spritz and sugar cookies.\n\nOh, I could have had one, but I saved my sweet for the once-a-year treat of homemade pineapple sherbet.\n\nI ate a small meal at the end of the day of some leftover grilled turkey and a yellow tomato. I made sure I went for a swim.\n\nIt turned out I was about 150 calories under my goal for the day. My carbs were with in prescribed levels, though my fats were higher than I would want to see on most days. I blame the cream cheese.\n\nStill, I had a lovely meal with company of good friends and family. I was able to enjoy the holiday.\n\nI believe not considering it a “cheat day” prevented me from overeating and making myself miserable both physically, by overstuffing my stomach, and mentally, by feeling guilty for how much I ate.\n\nSo if you want my advice, don’t cheat, just eat within prescribed limits.\n\nTHURSDAY, JUNE 30, 2016\n\nNumbers game\n\nI haven’t written about my weight in a while, which seems odd given these paragraphs are about my ongoing efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nWhen I started this journey, that was the only number that mattered to me.\n\nHow I felt about myself and the entire journey rested on the number that flashed on the scale.\n\nIf I lost weight, I was good. If I gained, I was bad. My mood swung violently with each pound. Anxiety rattled me in advance of weigh-ins.\n\nBut I’ve been at this a while now. I’ve come to the realization my recovery and health is not measured by the scale.\n\nThis isn’t to say I’ve gained a bunch of weight. I don’t know. I haven’t been to Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center, where I weigh in, since May.\n\nI’m not avoiding it. I’m just not that interested in the results.\n\nNo, I’m not giving up on the journey. I’m just measuring progress differently.\n\nInstead of body weight or even body composition, I’m looking at the things I can see with my own eyes.\n\nMy pants are baggy to the point of being clownish. Clothes in my closet that haven’t fit for years are comfortable again.\n\nI can even see the changes to my body. Oh, I’m still plenty lumpy. Yet skin sags where it was once filled with fat.\n\nI can feel muscles in my arms, legs, shoulders and chest.\n\nAnd there are plenty of other numbers.\n\nI can carry 35-pound kettle bells for 400 meters. A year ago, I whined when Stefanie Kirk, my physical therapist, handed me 2-pound weights.\n\nI can press 120 pounds over my shoulders.\n\nA back that once couldn’t carry in groceries without injury can now withstand deadlifts of 230 pounds for four repetitions in six sets.\n\nI can row on a machine for 500 meters in less than two minutes.\n\nI can squat to my heels without losing my balance and I can do that with 125 pounds on my back.\n\nNate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay and my fitness coach, posts my progress on a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and my doctor, Shauna Basener, can see.\n\nI can see the differences in my body, from the thickness of my belly to my balance in the videos and pictures he posts.\n\nWhen I took to the pool this spring, I started doing the exercises Stefanie gave me last year. But they were too easy.\n\nSo I just decided to swim. I swim uninterrupted for 40 minutes. I get faster and stronger each week.\n\nMy muscle mass is increasing. I know this not because of a readout on a computer, but because it is easier for me to sink to the bottom of the pool.\n\nLast year, I couldn’t dive down to touch the bottom of the pool the entire season.\n\nThis year, I do it on every dive. I try to do a handstand on the pool.\n\nI’m getting ever closer to being able to do pushups off the floor.\n\nThe other day at the gym, I fell down. I lost my balance while trying to do front squats, an exercise where I hold a weight bar at my neck and bend into a catcher’s squat.\n\nI’ve seen it happen to the other athletes at Nate’s gym. They front squat a lot more weight than me. But everybody falls down.\n\nHere’s the difference for me: I got back up again and finished the rep.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, a fall might have sidelined me for the day.\n\nI used to get calf injuries with big knots on the muscle. Nate would roll them out with a special tool.\n\nI haven’t had that problem in a long time.\n\nI feel better. I am stronger.\n\nAm I done? Heavens no.\n\nThere is so much more to do.\n\nBut I am getting better about not letting the journey be about one number.\n\nMONDAY, JUNE 20, 2016\n\nJust one of the guys\n\nI looked at the red numbers on the dusty, old clock radio by my bedside. Monday morning had arrived. The workweek loomed.\n\nMy brain stalled. The chemicals that cause anxiety churned somewhere in the folded pink-gray mass inside my skull and a froth of panic bubbled.\n\nI tried to process the intense fight-or-flight response with intellect. I knew this was a chemical malfunction. There was no real reason to be this horrified by the new day.\n\nAll I needed was to swallow one of the greenish yellow pills. Fifteen minutes would pass. My heart rate would drop. I would be fine.\n\nBut I resisted. In retrospect, of course, I feel the fool. A close friend struggles with anxiety, too. She also takes prescription medication to control it.\n\nWhen the first pangs of an anxiety attack echo in her mind, I tell her to take a pill. Sometimes, she pauses. I remind her the medicine cannot work if you just think about taking it.\n\nOh, were I only so good at taking the advice I so smugly give.\n\nTime passed. I checked emails. I looked at the spate of paragraphs that needed stacking for the week. Yet the tightness in my chest remained. Anxiety gripped my heart in a clenched fist.\n\nAll I wanted in this world was to get back into bed and pull the sheets over my head. Today was too much. We’ll try again tomorrow.\n\nWhy didn’t I take the pill? I can’t explain that. Sometimes I believe I can out-think my anxiety. If I know what causes it, I can deactivate it.\n\nThis is a little bit like thinking you can disarm a bomb that’s already gone off.\n\nStill, I stubbornly hunkered down and tried to grit it out. As I said, it was foolhardy.\n\nI made breakfast, a piece of steak with some grilled tomatoes. Protein fills me up and gives me the energy I need for workouts with coach Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nI watched the clock. The time to go to the gym approached. My thinking cycled. My brain almost screamed at me: “Don’t go. Just stay home. You can’t handle this today.”\n\nThis line of thinking mixed with the usual self-deprecating thoughts that I’m a bad person, that I’m not smart enough for this job and soon the bosses will figure this out and fire me, and that I am simply unworthy of love.\n\nStill, I did not take the pill. I always think the anxiety will pass through my mind like a scattered thunderstorm. It never passes. It’s always a severe thunderstorm and sometimes it’s an EF5 tornado.\n\nI thought of Nate and the guys at the gym. I like them. I like being there the same way I liked being on sports teams as a boy. I’m there to lose weight and get fit, sure. But I have no illusions about being a competitive athlete.\n\n(Nate would argue with me on that point, but the difference of opinion really doesn’t matter. He’s helping me help myself get healthier. That’s the goal.)\n\nThe clock read 1 p.m. I was dressed for the gym. I was ready to go. But I did not want to go. The flesh was willing, but the spirit was weak.\n\nI cannot say with precision what made me decide to go instead of stay. I worry about disappointing Nate. I worry about backsliding on my physical progress. I worry about letting worry control me.\n\nMaybe I went to the gym simply because of reflex action.\n\nAgain, it doesn’t really matter. I went. There is a small victory in that.\n\nI loosened up, but anxiety still swirled in my mind. Nate laid out the goals for the day. We did some squats without weight to loosen my quads.\n\nHe told me what the workout plan was. I was breathing hard. My heart hammered. It wasn’t the workout. It was the anxiety.\n\nNate told me to take a couple minutes before we went through the combination of metabolic conditioning and strength training.\n\nI went over and sat on a box in a dark corner of the gym. My hands shook.\n\nNate spotted me. He asked if I was dizzy or just getting mentally prepared for the workout. I confessed it was a bad day for anxiety.\n\nHe asked if the workouts helped. They do. Anticipation is the worst part of anything: workouts, getting together with my girlfriend, friends or family, or practically going anywhere or doing anything.\n\nMy workout started at the same time as another client doing something far more intense. I was working out for 16 minutes. The set was three burpees — an exercise that sounds like something cute you do with babies but is far less pleasant — with two weightlifting challenges and a walk.\n\nI made it through the first round and was about halfway into the second when I realized I couldn’t control my heart rate anymore.\n\nYes, the workout was getting my heart rate up. The problem was, it was already pounding from the anxiety. I stopped. I finally took the damn pill.\n\nI went back to the workout. I did the best I could. It wasn’t a wonderful performance. But I made almost four complete cycles in the allotted time.\n\nI was disappointed. Nate thought I was upset with the workout. I wasn’t. I was angry at myself for not taking the pill hours before instead of bullheadedly enduring this anxiety.\n\nI finished with a cool-down exercise on the rowing machine. By then, the medicine mixed with the endorphins released from the workout.\n\nCalm settled in, even a bit of whimsy. Nate and a couple of his other trainers had a break before their next client.\n\nWe went out in the parking lot and played catch beside the building. We talked about absolutely nothing important. It was wonderful.\n\nAnd there I was, just one of the guys.\n\nMONDAY, JUNE 13, 2016\n\nHard rider\n\nCoach Nate Yoho divides my workouts at CrossFit Merle Hay into two segments.\n\nWe begin with a weightlifting exercise. Then we transition into met-con, or metabolic condition. This phase of the workout includes three or four activities, at least one of which is a cardio challenge mixed with more weightlifting reps.\n\nNate recently added five exercise bikes to his equipment inventory. I hate exercise bikes. They are uncomfortable for my big butt and often don’t adjust properly for someone my height.\n\nBut Nate’s new machines adjusted fine. I would rather work on the rowing machine, but Nate wanted a trio ", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/05/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/health/affordable-housing-shortage-health-concerns-khn-partner/index.html", "title": "'Living in despair and hopelessness': A lack of affordable housing ...", "text": "KHN —\n\nWhen Louana Joseph’s son had a seizure because of an upper respiratory infection in July, she abandoned the apartment her family had called home for nearly three years.\n\nShe suspected the gray and brown splotches spreading through the apartment were mold and had caused her son’s illness. Mold can trigger and exacerbate lung diseases such as asthma and has been linked to upper respiratory tract conditions.\n\nBut leaving the two-bedroom Atlanta apartment meant giving up a home that rented for less than $1,000 a month, a price that is increasingly hard to find even in the nation’s poorest neighborhoods.\n\n“I am looking everywhere,” said Joseph, who is 33. “Right now, I can’t afford it.”\n\nSince then, Joseph, her 3-year-old son, and infant daughter have teetered on the edge of homelessness. They have shuffled between sleeping in an extended-stay motel and staying with relatives, unsure when they might find a permanent place to live.\n\nA nationwide affordable housing crisis has wreaked havoc on the lives of low-income families, like Joseph’s, who are close to the brink. Their struggle to stay a step ahead of homelessness is often invisible.\n\nLouana Joseph and her daughter, Marlie, moved out of their apartment because she suspects the gray and brown splotches that were spreading through the unit were mold. Andy Miller/KHN\n\nRents soared during the pandemic, exacerbating an already-severe shortage of available housing in most U.S. cities. The result will be growing numbers of people stuck in substandard housing, often with environmental hazards that put them at higher risk for asthma, lead poisoning, and other medical conditions, according to academic researchers and advocates for people with low incomes. These residents’ stress levels are heightened by the difficulties they face paying rent.\n\n“People are living in despair and hopelessness,” said Ma’ta Crawford, a member of the Human Relations Commission in Greenville County, South Carolina, who works with families living in extended-stay motels.\n\nHousing instability — such as having trouble paying rent, living in crowded conditions, or moving frequently — can have negative consequences on health, according to the federal Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.\n\nIn addition to potentially facing environmental risks, people who struggle with housing insecurity put off doctor visits, can’t afford food, and have trouble managing chronic conditions.\n\nLosing a home can also trigger a mental health crisis. The suicide rate doubled from 2005 to 2010, when foreclosures, including those on rental properties, were historically high, according to a 2014 analysis, published in the American Journal of Public Health, that looked at 16 states.\n\nRents jumped 18% nationally from the first three months of 2021 to early 2022. And there is no county in the country where a minimum-wage worker could afford a two-bedroom rental home, according to an August report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Nationwide, only 36 affordable housing units are available for every 100 people in need, forcing many families to cobble together temporary shelter.\n\n“It’s a vicious cycle,” Crawford said. “Every motel here has a school bus stop.”\n\nIn the Southeast, evictions are more common than anywhere else in the nation, says an analysis published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nGeorgia has 19 evictions for every 100 renter households, according to data from the Eviction Lab at Princeton University. There are 23 evictions for every 100 renter households in South Carolina, and Virginia has 15 evictions per 100 renter households. The national rate is about eight evictions per 100.\n\nDespite President Joe Biden’s promises to address the affordable housing shortage, researchers and activists say inflation — and Democratic deal-making — is only worsening the health threat.\n\nLast year, the Biden administration included billions of dollars in the “Build Back Better” bill to increase the number of Housing Choice vouchers — a difficult-to-get benefit that helps people with low incomes pay rent. Under the voucher program, also known as Section 8, recipients put 30% of their income toward rent, and the federal government pays the remainder. Currently only 1 in 4 people who qualify receive the vouchers because of limited funding.\n\nBut lawmakers stripped out the provision that raised the number of vouchers, a compromise to pass the bill that became known as the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nAbout 2.3 million households rely on the program to help pay rent. Joseph applied years ago but has yet to receive any benefits.\n\nThe day before her son was born in September 2019, Joseph moved into an apartment complex in southwestern Atlanta, one of the poorest sections of the city. A year later, she upgraded to a two-bedroom unit in the same complex that cost $861 a month, far less than the typical apartment in metro Atlanta.\n\nRecently, Joseph returned to the two-bedroom apartment to show KHN its condition. What appeared to be mold surfaced after a pipe burst and the air conditioning broke, but the complex owners did little to fix the situation, Joseph said.\n\nThe gray and brown splotches were on her mattress, sofa, and other plastic-wrapped belongings. They covered boxes of diapers stacked on dressers, an Elmo doll lying facedown, a child’s sneaker, and pink onesies.\n\nAfter a pipe burst and the air conditioning broke in Louana Joseph's apartment, gray and black splotches covered a ventilation grille. Andy Miller/KHN\n\nA property manager at Seven Courts Apartments, where Joseph lived, declined to comment when reached by phone. The management company did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nA few months after leaving the apartment, Joseph and her two children moved in with her sister in Orlando, Florida, with their remaining possessions — a car and some clothes.\n\nA lack of affordable housing can force families with low incomes, like Joseph’s, to endure health risks such as mold, vermin, and water leaks, said Alex Schwartz, a housing expert at the New School in New York City. And the trauma of evictions, foreclosures, and homelessness can undermine physical and mental well-being, Schwartz said.\n\nFor five years, Nancy Painter lived in an apartment in Greenville, South Carolina, that had mold and cracks in the walls, ceiling, and floor. Sometimes, Painter said, she carried a can of bug killer in both hands to fend off roaches.\n\nAn autoimmune disease makes her extremely susceptible to colds and other respiratory illnesses, and arthritis causes her crippling pain. But she stayed in the apartment until last year because the rent was $325 a month. Painter moved out only after the landlord made plans to renovate the unit and raise the rent.\n\nPainter, 64, now lives on about $1,100 in Social Security disability benefits. Her poor health left her unable to keep working in a fast-food job. She pays more than 70% of her income for a room in a house she shares with other adults who can’t find affordable housing.\n\nSuch renters should put no more than 30% of their income toward housing so they have enough left over for other basic needs, according to federal government formulas. “My options are so slim,” Painter said. “All I want is a small place where I can have a garden.”\n\nIn August, Louana Joseph's son, M.J., developed an upper respiratory infection that his mother suspects was caused by mold that was spreading in their apartment. Andy Miller/KHN\n\nThe problems are especially acute among Black people and other groups that have been denied good jobs, mortgages, and opportunities long beyond the Jim Crow era, said Dr. Steven Woolf, a professor of population health and health equity at Virginia Commonwealth University. Life expectancy can vary by 15 to 20 years between different neighborhoods in the same city, he said.\n\nFederal lawmakers routinely fail to prioritize the nearly 50-year-old housing voucher program, said Kirk McClure, a professor emeritus of urban planning at the University of Kansas. The U.S. offers less help with housing than do other rich countries, like the United Kingdom and Australia, where voucher programs allow everyone who meets income requirements to get help, McClure said.\n\n“In the wealthiest society in the world, we could give every poor person a voucher,” McClure said. “This doesn’t require anything magical.”\n\nOfficials from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees the voucher program, did not respond when asked whether the administration planned to push for more housing vouchers.\n\nJoseph’s prospects of finding another home remain dim as rents skyrocket.\n\nThe fair-market rent — which is determined annually by the federal government based on a rental home’s size, type, and location — for a two-bedroom home in the U.S. reached $1,194 a month, on average, in 2019, according to a 2020 report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition. A family of four living on poverty-level income could afford $644 a month, the report said. In the city of Atlanta, the median rent for apartments of all sizes is $2,200, up nearly 30% since January 2021, according to the real estate website Zillow.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nA lack of child care has kept Joseph from pursuing full-time jobs. But she can’t qualify for one state child care assistance program since she doesn’t have full-time employment, and another state program she sought out won’t have openings until next year.\n\nShe sued the Seven Courts Apartments’ owner in small claims court in June for $5,219 to compensate her for the ruined belongings and rent she has already paid. A settlement could allow her to move into a new home.\n\n“I am stuck because I have nowhere else to go,” Joseph said.", "authors": ["Renuka Rayasam Fred Clasen-Kelly", "Renuka Rayasam", "Fred Clasen-Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/08/health/gun-violence-human-body-damage-gupta/index.html", "title": "Dr. Sanjay Gupta: The damage to the human body caused by ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOne of the most memorable lectures during my first year of medical school at the University of Michigan was delivered by Dr. Julian “Buz” Hoff. He was the chair of neurosurgery and a master at teaching the natural history of brain diseases. We learned about brain tumors, vascular diseases and trauma.\n\nHoff had a way of explaining things that made them really stick, and that was particularly clear in his lecture called “GSW.” Anyone who works in a hospital probably knows that the acronym GSW stands for “gunshot wound,” and the way Hoff wanted us to learn the topic was for us see the impact firsthand.\n\nSo on the last day of his class, we went to an outdoor gun range in Ann Arbor for our GSW lecture. There were handguns there, as well as rifles. In the distance, I saw several watermelons on top of old barrels that would serve as targets. After putting in his ear plugs and donning safety glasses, Hoff shot a watermelon with a handgun. I saw the bullet hit the watermelon but wasn’t confident I saw the bullet exit. The watermelon was then brought to us for inspection.\n\nFirst thing to notice, he told us: There was an obvious entrance and exit “wound,” and they were around the same size. We could see the green skin folding in on itself around the entrance wound and the outward beveled tissue around the exit. After we chopped the watermelon open, he pointed out that the bullet seemed to have traveled in a fairly predictable trajectory, a linear bullet-sized line through the body of the watermelon.\n\nNext came the same demonstration with a rifle. This time, I saw the watermelon shudder as it was struck and then immediately saw a significant amount of red tissue fly out the backside. Upon inspection, the first thing I noticed was how much bigger the exit wound was, compared with the entrance. And after opening the watermelon, the purpose of the demonstration became clear: Instead of a predictable linear track, the watermelon looked like it had been cored out and what was left was shredded. He explained that this was a phenomenon known as cavitation, which is just what it sounds like: The bullet doesn’t simply travel through the body, it creates a big cavity inside it.\n\nThe message was clear: I want you to imagine that had been a human body.\n\nMuch in the way pictures of black lungs had left an indelible impression of smoking on all medical students, Hoff had done the same with me for GSWs.\n\nI was reflecting on that demonstration recently when I operated on a patient with a GSW to the head. It was a handgun injury, and we were able to quickly control the bleeding and relieve the pressure on the brain. The patient spent one day in the ICU for observation and was discharged a few days later. Had it been a rifle injury, there was hardly any chance he would’ve survived.\n\nWith guns front and center yet again with the recent shooting in Nashville, I wanted to share what I have learned over the years about what bullets do to the human body and the challenge it is for surgeons to repair the damage.\n\nMore damage\n\nNearly 30 years after my med school gun range demonstration, Dr. Ernest E. Moore, trauma surgeon and director of trauma research at the Shock Trauma Center named after him at Denver Health, is also using the watermelon example to draw a comparison between different firearms.\n\n“I often use the analogy that the injury to the liver [with a semi-automatic rifle] would be similar to just taking a watermelon and dropping it on the cement. It’s incredible the amount of energy delivered. … By comparison, the 9 millimeter would drill a hole through the liver. So you’d have a sizable hole, but if you didn’t hit a major blood vessel, it’s a pretty tolerable injury. In fact, we in civilian trauma will often manage a 9-millimeter liver injury without an operation, whereas a patient with an assault rifle would be dead within 20 minutes if you didn’t operate,” he said.\n\nOther human tissue in the body reacts differently. “If you struck a bone with an AR-15, like your femur in your leg, it would literally shatter into multiple fragments that would sort of serve as secondary missiles. Whereas … we’ve seen 9 millimeters that will actually drill a hole right to the femur,” he said. (An AR-15 is a lightweight semi-automatic – that is, self-loading – rifle manufactured by Colt; other gunmakers make rifles in a similar style.)\n\nMoore also brings up cavitation as a way of visualizing what is happening in the body. He describes cavitation “as the result of a rapid expansion of the tissues surrounding the path of the bullet. … In essence, instead of a virtual drill hole with a 9 millimeter, your path of injury in tissue with an AR-15 will be 6 inches wide. And the path beyond that is even wider, but the tissue recoils back into it,” said Moore, noting that inelastic tissue – like the liver, heart and brain – are the most vulnerable to this type of energy.\n\nA brief history of the AR-15-style weapon\n\nAlthough the Department of Justice noted last year that 77.2% of mass shootings – which it counts as four or more deaths, excluding the shooter – involve handguns, many of the highest-profile incidents involved assault-style rifles: the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut; Orlando’s Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016; the 2017 shooting at a music festival in Las Vegas; and the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida; the 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, and the shooting at Covenant School in Nashville, just to name a few.\n\nThis kind of rifle unleashes a lot of power, said Moore, who, in addition to being a trauma surgeon since 1976 (who operated on some of the Columbine survivors), co-edited a major textbook on trauma surgery, authored more than 1,700 scientific articles and was the longtime editor of the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery.\n\n“The capacity for tissue injury is reflected in the so-called kinetic energy. And the kinetic energy, simplistically, is the mass or weight of the bullet times the velocity squared. So the velocity – the speed of the bullet exiting the gun – is really its primary effectiveness,” he said.\n\nMoore said a 9-millimeter handgun has a muzzle energy – the kinetic energy of a bullet as it leaves the gun’s muzzle – of roughly 400 foot-pounds of force. For a rifle like the AR-15, that number is 1,300. “So you have a huge increase in the amount of energy imparted from the gun,” he explained.\n\nHe said the size of the bullet has less to do with the damage it causes.\n\n“I think there are some misconceptions with … rifles. A lot of people say, ‘Oh, they’re big bullets.’ Actually, they’re small bullets – interestingly, they’re even smaller than many handguns. So the actual bullet that’s discharged from an AR-15, for example, is a half the size of the bullet from a 9 millimeter. The difference is the … velocity,” he said.\n\nAnd, if that rifle is a semi-automatic weapon, the weapon can be fired repeatedly, without manually reloading, simply by pulling the trigger. In Uvalde, hundreds of rounds were fired into classrooms in the first four minutes, according to Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steven McCraw.\n\nMoore, who grew up in a hunting family, owns firearms and is an avid hunter, has been outspoken in his opposition to civilians owning AR-15-style semi-automatic weapons and does not own one himself.\n\n“The rifle that our military uses to fight our enemies is the same rifle that we allow civilians access to and can create these mass shootings,” he said.\n\nAn Emmett Till moment\n\nDuring my neurosurgery training and the first several years of my career, I didn’t encounter these sorts of injuries. That’s because between 1994 and 2004, certain semi-automatic firearms were banned. In fact, it was in 2003, while I was covering the war in Iraq, that I first saw the damage these weapons cause on the human body, not just a watermelon.\n\nI was embedded with the Devil Docs, the Navy medical team that provides front-line medical care for the Marines. There are things that my cameraman Mark Biello and I saw on the battlefield that we still have a hard time talking about. They are still hard to even write about. Limbs blown clean off the body and wounds so horrific, I thought for sure they must’ve been caused by a bomb or IED.\n\nI never imagined that just a couple of years later, I would see the same sorts of injuries in US cities, including my own, Atlanta. Those are the days when I come home from the hospital simply unable to talk, let alone describe what I had just witnessed.\n\nStill, as you may have read after the tragedy in Uvalde last year, some folks raised whether we should have an “Emmett Till moment.”\n\nEmmett Till was a 14-year-old Black teen who was abducted and violently murdered in 1955 by white racists in Mississippi after a white woman accused him of whistling at her. Till’s mother took the unusual step of holding an open-casket funeral and allowing a photographer from Jet magazine to photograph her son’s disfigured, unrecognizable face to show the country the result of racial violence. Many consider that moment a turning point in the country’s collective support for the civil rights movement.\n\nMany of my colleagues have urged me to further describe the horrific injuries I have seen over the last nearly 20 years as a neurotrauma surgeon.\n\nThe truth is, I’m not sure America is ready to see that. More important, it isn’t a decision anybody can make unless it’s their loss and their story to tell – like Emmett Till’s mother.\n\nPublic health emergency\n\nLouis Klarevas, research professor at Columbia University and author of the 2016 book “Rampage Nation,” credits the 10-year federal assault weapons ban between 1994 and 2004 with significantly reducing the number of mass shooting incidents and deaths (which he defined as injuring or killing six or more people) before rebounding to even higher levels after the ban expired. In 2020, there were an estimated 20 million AR-15 style weapons in circulation in the United States, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation.\n\nBetween 1990 and 1999, during the decade in which I traveled to that gun range with Hoff, mass shootings claimed an average of 21 lives per year; from 2012 to 2021, that average had gone up to 51, according to the Violence Project. It defines a mass shooting as four or more people in a public place being killed with firearms, without any underlying criminal activity, excluding the shooter. (CNN defines mass shootings as those in which four or more people other than the shooter are injured or killed by gunfire during one event.)\n\nFederal data on the overall impact of gun violence is lacking. Even obtaining the basic numbers can be a challenge, as I learned writing this article. While the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dashboards for Covid-19 and mpox, gun violence is still an enigma for the public health community. That’s in large part due to the Dickey amendment, which, in 1996, made it challenging and potentially financially punitive for the CDC to conduct or fund research on gun violence if it were to be used in any way to promote gun control.\n\nEven today, it is organizations like the Gun Violence Archive – an independent data collection and research group that collects information on gun violence from more than 7,500 sources daily – and not the CDC that provide some of the most up-to-date statistics on gun violence and deaths on a daily basis.\n\nThe rise of gun violence is something Dr. Bellal Joseph has seen firsthand. He is the chief of the Division of Trauma, Surgical Critical Care, Burns, and Acute Care Surgery at the Banner University Medical Center at the University of Arizona and a professor in the Department of Surgery in the University of Arizona College of Medicine - Tucson.\n\n“I can tell you from our own data, but also from a national perspective, there’s no doubt that … every trauma center in the country is seeing unprecedented numbers of trauma,” he said referring to “violent trauma: more shootings, more victims.”\n\n“Mass shootings are more prevalent at trauma centers than people actually think,” said Joseph. “Oftentimes, it takes a high [profile] school shooting to activate the media, but it actually happens a lot more than we think, unfortunately.”\n\nJoseph, who back in 2011 helped treat nine of the survivors of the mass shooting that targeted US Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, like every other surgeon we spoke to, wanted to emphasize that injuries from AR-15-style semi-automatic firearms are not like other injuries.\n\n“When you see … victims from AR-type assaults, what you’re seeing is a violent crime against others,” he said.\n\nStalemate in the face of mounting violence\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the US ranks first in firearm homicides per capita among high-income countries of more than 10 million – that’s an age-adjusted rate 13 times greater than France’s and 23 times greater than Australia’s.\n\n\n\nIn 2021, for the second year in a row, firearms were the leading cause of death among children and adolescents, according to a CNN analysis of data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That year, 4,733 children and adolescents ages 1 to 19 died from firearms, a 9% increase from 2020 and a 42% jump from 2018. About a tenth of all firearm-related deaths in the United States were among children and adolescents in 2021.\n\nAbout four hundred more children and adolescents died from firearms than car crashes, the second leading cause of death.\n\nThe gun deaths are only a small fraction of those affected. The lives of people who are injured, the victims’ families, friends and the community at large are forever ripped apart.\n\nAnd if you need a reason to look beyond the human cost of gun violence, there is also the cost to society: According to a February 2021 report by Everytown Research and Policy, it comes out to an estimated $280 billion a year, which includes medical, criminal justice and other expenses.\n\nThe American College of Surgeons, the professional organization that represents the people who see this type of injury all too often, has been calling for tighter control of weapons and more common-sense rules. In 2018, the ACS’s Firearms Strategy Task Force released 13 recommendations that includes items like regulating heavy-duty firearms, more safety training, and increasing recognition of mental health issues.\n\nAfter this week’s shooting, President Joe Biden reiterated his call to Congress to pass a ban on assault weapons.\n\n“We have to do more to stop gun violence. It’s ripping our communities apart, ripping the soul of this nation,” Biden said. “We have to do more to protect our schools, so they aren’t turned into prisons.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“There has to be some vetting, training,” said Joseph, especially when it comes to weapons like AR-15-style semi-automatic rifles. He noted that to be allowed to drive, a person needs many hours of coaching and practice in order to pass an exam and get a license – “no one is getting into a car and just driving.”\n\nAs for objections that “the government can’t tell us what to do,” Moore says, yes, citizens have rights, but they are not limitless.\n\n“We don’t drive tanks through the street. We don’t throw a grenade into the parks. … We need to have some rational thinking,” he said.\n\nThe same sort of rational thinking Hoff impressed on us so many years ago on a gun range in Ann Arbor, Michigan.", "authors": ["Dr. Sanjay Gupta"], "publish_date": "2022/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2019/11/25/amazon-fulfillment-centers-worker-safety-investigation/4283245002/", "title": "Amazon Prime delivery comes at a cost for workers, Reveal says", "text": "Will Evans\n\nReveal for The Center for Investigative Reporting\n\nCorrections and Clarifications: Reveal for The Center for Investigative Reporting has updated the circumstances surrounding Indiana safety inspector John Stallone’s departure from his job.

Inside the sprawling four-story building in Southern California’s Inland Empire, hundreds of squat orange robots whizzed across the floor, carrying tall yellow racks.\n\nAs a stower, her job was to stand in a spot on the floor, like hundreds of others in that million-square-foot warehouse, and fill an unending parade of merchandise racks. Another worker, known as a “water spider,” would bring her boxes upon boxes of goods – jars of protein powder, inflatable unicorn pool floats, laptops, makeup, Himalayan sea salt, vibrators and plastic toy cars. She’d grab each item out of a box, scan it, lift it onto the rack and scan its new location. She’d use a stepladder to put things on the top of the rack. For heavy items – she remembers the cases of pet food in particular – she’d have to squat down to hoist them in, then pop back up to grab the next item. As soon as she’d filled a rack, she’d press a button and one robot would zip it away while another robot would bring a new one to fill.\n\nThe moment an Amazon customer clicked “place your order,” a robot would haul one of those racks to a picker, who would grab the right item for the order and send it on a series of long conveyors to a packer, who would stuff it in one of those familiar, smiling cardboard boxes.\n\nThe clock was always ticking on Amazon’s promised delivery time. Dixon had to scan a new item every 11 seconds to hit her quota, she said, and Amazon always knew when she didn’t.\n\nDixon’s scan rate – more than 300 items an hour, thousands of individual products a day – was being tracked constantly, the data flowing to managers in real time, then crunched by a proprietary software system called ADAPT. She knew, like the thousands of other workers there, that if she didn’t hit her target speed, she would be written up and, if she didn’t improve, she eventually would be fired.\n\nReveal investigation:Indiana manipulated death report to lure HQ2\n\nAmazon’s cutting-edge technology, unrelenting surveillance and constant disciplinary write-ups pushed the Eastvale workers so hard that in the last holiday season, they hit a coveted target: They got a million packages out the door in 24 hours. Amazon handed out T-shirts celebrating their induction into the “Million Unit Club.”\n\nBut Dixon, 54, wasn’t around for that. She started the job in April 2018, and within two months, or nearly 100,000 items, the lifting had destroyed her back. An Amazon-approved doctor said she had bulging discs and diagnosed her with a back sprain, joint inflammation and chronic pain, determining that her injuries were 100% due to her job. She could no longer work at Amazon. Today, she can barely climb stairs. Walking her dog, doing the dishes, getting out of her chair – everything is painful. According to her medical records, her condition is unlikely to improve.\n\nSo this holiday shopping season, as Amazon’s ferocious speed is on full display, Dixon is at a standstill. She told Reveal in mid-October that her workers’ compensation settlement was about to run out. She was struggling to land a new job and worried she’d lose her home.\n\n“I’m still too young to feel like I’m 90 years old,” Dixon said, sitting in the living room of her Corona, California, home, which was decorated with inspirational sayings (“You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have”). “I don’t even know how I’m going to make it in a couple of months.”\n\nAmazon's famous speed and technological innovation have driven the company’s massive global expansion and a valuation well over $800 billion. It’s also helped make Amazon the nation’s second-largest private employer behind Walmart and its CEO, Jeff Bezos, one of the richest humans on Earth. Now, an investigation by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting has found that the company’s obsession with speed has turned its warehouses into injury mills.\n\nReveal amassed internal injury records from 23 of the company’s 110 fulfillment centers nationwide. Taken together, the rate of serious injuries for those facilities was more than double the national average for the warehousing industry: 9.6 serious injuries per 100 full-time workers in 2018, compared with an industry average that year of 4.\n\nWhile a handful of centers were at or below the industry average, Reveal found that some centers, such as the Eastvale warehouse, were especially dangerous. Dixon’s was one of 422 injuries recorded there last year. Its rate of serious injuries – those requiring job restrictions or days off work – was more than four times the industry average.\n\n“According to Amazon’s own records, the risk of work injuries at fulfillment centers is alarmingly, unacceptably high,” said David Michaels, former head of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, now a professor at George Washington University’s public health school. “Amazon needs to take a hard look at the facilities where so many workers are being hurt and either redesign the work processes, replace the top managers or both, because serious injury rates this high should not be acceptable to any employer.”\n\nAmazon officials declined repeated interview requests. Instead, company spokesperson Ashley Robinson provided a written response to some of Reveal’s questions. Robinson said Amazon’s injury rates are high because it’s aggressive about recording worker injuries and cautious about allowing injured workers to return to work before they’re ready.\n\n“We know that by making a conservative choice to not place an injured associate back into a job, we are elevating restricted and lost time rates as a company, but with the intent to benefit the associate,” Robinson wrote.\n\nMany workers said that was not their experience. They spoke with outrage about having been cast aside as damaged goods or sent back to jobs that injured them further. Dixon said she had doctor’s orders not to pull or lift heavy objects and to alternate sitting and standing, but she wasn’t given a chair and heavy boxes kept coming her way.\n\n“For Amazon,” said Dixon, “all they care about is getting the job done and getting it out fast and not realizing how it’s affecting us and our own bodies.”\n\nThe company does instruct workers on the safe way to move their bodies and handle equipment. But several former workers said they had to break the safety rules to keep up. They would jump or stretch to reach a top rack instead of using a stepladder. They would twist and bend over to grab boxes instead of taking time to squat and lift with their legs. They would hoist extra-heavy items alone to avoid wasting time getting help. They had to, they said, or they would lose their jobs. So they took the risk.\n\nThen, if they got hurt, they would lose their jobs anyway. Even some workers who loved the pace, camaraderie and compensation at Amazon’s fulfillment centers told Reveal that they were quickly replaced as soon as their bodies broke down.\n\nThe problems Reveal uncovered go far beyond common sprains, strains and repetitive stress injuries. When a gas leak inundated the Eastvale warehouse where Dixon used to work, managers wouldn’t slow down, several workers said, even though they were dizzy and vomiting. They were told that they’d have to use personal time off if they wanted to leave.\n\nAnd when disaster struck at one Indiana warehouse, Amazon’s economic might may have helped the company evade accountability. When a maintenance worker was crushed to death by a forklift there, state officials in Indiana, which then was jockeying for Amazon’s second headquarters, sided with the company over their own investigator.\n\n“When you order something from Amazon and you’ve worked inside Amazon, you wonder, ‘Hey, is ordering my package going to be the demise of somebody?’ ” said one former safety manager, who had worked at multiple Amazon facilities.\n\nInside Amazon’s safety records\n\nThe root of Amazon’s success appears to be at the root of its injury problem, too: the blistering pace of delivering packages to its customers.\n\nAmazon’s busiest season, which the company calls “peak,” begins with the runup to Black Friday. Amazon said it shipped Prime members more than a billion items last holiday season. This year, Amazon has a new promise: free one-day delivery for Prime members.\n\nIt’s also crunch time for the human body. Employees face the exhaustion of mandatory 12-hour shifts, and warehouses are crammed with seasonal workers unaccustomed to the grind. The company’s 2018 logs show weekly injury counts spiked at two distinct moments when Amazon offers special deals: Cyber Monday and Prime Day.\n\nRobinson, the Amazon spokesperson, said total injuries do go up during those peak times, but that’s only because the company brings on more workers then. Robinson said the rate of injuries historically has stayed steady, or even decreased, at peak times. Amazon declined to provide data to back up that claim.\n\nAs ever-increasing production targets flow down from corporate, regional managers lean on warehouse directors, who put pressure on the supervisors who oversee all those water spiders, stowers, pickers and packers. And the key to advancement is great production numbers.\n\n“It incentivizes you to be a heartless son of a bitch,” said a former senior operations manager who had leadership roles at multiple facilities.\n\nThe former senior operations manager described going from the omniscient ADAPT system to an Amazon competitor, where he had to search occasionally updated Excel spreadsheets to find productivity numbers.\n\nMarc Wulfraat, president of the supply chain and logistics consulting firm MWPVL International, described Amazon as more aggressive than any other industry player in what the company expects from workers. “And they will not waste time hanging on to people who can’t perform,” he said.\n\nThe Amazon tenure of Parker Knight, a disabled veteran who worked at the Troutdale, Oregon, warehouse this year, shows the ruthless precision of Amazon’s system. Knight had been allowed to work shorter shifts after he sustained back and ankle injuries at the warehouse, but ADAPT didn’t spare him. Knight was written up three times in May for missing his quota.\n\nThe expectations were precise. He had to pick 385 small items or 350 medium items each hour. One week, he was hitting 98.45% of his expected rate, but that wasn’t good enough. That 1.55% speed shortfall earned him his final written warning – the last one before termination.\n\n“You are expected to meet 100% of the productivity performance expectation,” the warning reads. Days later, the company informed him he was being fired because of an earlier confrontation over workers’ compensation paperwork.\n\nRobinson said Amazon has performance expectations “like most companies.”\n\n“We measure actual performance against those expectations,” she said. “Associate performance is measured and evaluated over a long period of time – at least six weeks – as we know a variety of things could impact the ability to meet expectations in any given day or hour.”\n\nThe company’s aggressive production demands have overwhelmed its safety teams’ efforts to protect workers, according to five former Amazon safety managers, who oversaw safety at fulfillment centers around the country and spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation.\n\nOne of them, a former senior safety manager, said it’s well known internally that the injury rates are too high, but there’s no way Amazon will slow down. “It’s not a conversation that can be had,” the former manager said. “We’re never going to fix safety at Amazon because we’re never going to fix what the real issue is.”\n\nAmazon is fond of showing off its industry-changing innovation: The fleets of robots, it claims, not only speed up production, they also make employees’ jobs easier and safer. Instead of having to walk miles of warehouse floor every day, pickers stand in one spot as robots come to them.\n\nBut injury records and interviews with three of the former Amazon safety managers suggest the introduction of the robots led to even more injuries. Of the records Reveal obtained, most of the warehouses with the highest rates of injury deployed robots. One robotic facility in Kent, Washington – which a senior operations manager boasted was “the flagship of fulfillment,” as one of the few centers in 2016 to ship a million packages in a day – logged 292 serious injuries last year, for a rate of about 13 serious injuries per 100 workers.\n\nAfter Amazon debuted the robots in Tracy, California, five years ago, the serious injury rate there nearly quadrupled, going from 2.9 per 100 workers in 2015 to 11.3 in 2018, records show.\n\nJonathan Meador watched the transition from his position loading boxes into big rig trailers. The robots at the Tracy warehouse were so efficient that humans could barely keep up. Suddenly, the pickers and packers were expected to move more products every minute, and more boxes shot down the conveyor belt toward Meador.\n\n“Before robots, it was still tough, but it was manageable,” he said. Afterward, “we were in a fight that we just can’t win.”\n\nThe Oregon facility where Knight worked opened with robotics in August 2018 and had the highest serious injury rate Reveal found: nearly 26 per 100 employees, more than six times the industry average.\n\nNew warehouses sometimes are rushed to open before they’re ready, said two of the former safety managers, leading management to skimp on training and start operations without full safety teams in place.\n\nRobinson declined to comment on the elevated injury rates at robotic warehouses. But she said Amazon doesn’t launch new buildings until they are “ready and safe for employees.”\n\nInjury records are supposed to be one way of holding companies accountable for their safety culture. The U.S. Department of Labor under the Obama administration proposed posting them online, but under President Donald Trump, the agency has reversed course and also has fought public records requests. And Amazon has resisted making its own safety records public.\n\nReveal filed multiple requests to OSHA for injury records from Amazon facilities in more than a dozen states, many of which were released with critical information redacted; Reveal has filed suit to challenge those redactions.\n\nStill, by law, employers must provide complete injury records to any current or former employee who requests them. Reveal reached out to Amazon warehouse workers past and present and explained how to request records for their worksite, ultimately receiving 2018 records for 23 fulfillment centers in 14 states. Two of the injury logs came from a collaboration of worker advocacy groups, including New York Communities for Change and Make the Road New York.\n\nReveal now is seeking to compile the remaining injury logs. (If you’ve worked for Amazon, here’s how you can get the records and share them with Reveal.)\n\nIn at least a dozen cases, Amazon either ignored these employee requests or provided only partial records, in apparent violation of federal regulations. Amazon told some workers that they were entitled only to the records for the time period they worked there; OSHA spokesperson Kimberly Darby said that’s incorrect. And when Amazon did provide records, warehouse managers used identical language to call them confidential and request they be kept secret. Yet OSHA guidance says, and Darby confirmed, that employers are not allowed to restrict workers from sharing the records. Some workers said they felt intimidated by the notice, fearing they might get sued by Amazon for sharing the records with a news organization.\n\nSeveral years ago, according to three of the former safety managers, Amazon had a policy for systematically hiding injuries. A former safety specialist in a warehouse confirmed their account. He said higher-ups instructed him to come up with justifications for not recording injuries that should have been counted by law.\n\nInteractive:What injuries are like at the Amazon warehouse that handled your package\n\nAfter OSHA cited Amazon for failing to record dozens of injuries at a New Jersey warehouse in 2015, Amazon changed the practice, and the former safety managers said the company became more diligent about counting injuries. (OSHA requires companies to record work-related injuries on official logs only when they result in days away from work, job restrictions or medical treatment beyond first aid.)\n\nRobinson said that Amazon never had a policy for underreporting injuries but that in 2016, it implemented a policy change after recognizing the challenge of ensuring “consistency and accuracy.”\n\n“Amazon took the decision to shift to a fully transparent reporting model as we would rather over-report and lead in this space for our associates’ safety than optimize for optics,” she said.\n\nThe former senior safety manager said some warehouse managers still found ways to avoid directing workers to the on-site health clinic – such as sending them to the break room instead – so their injuries wouldn’t get recorded. A few workers said supervisors would get upset if they reported injuries or sought medical treatment.\n\nThe logs Reveal obtained are scattered with lacerations and concussions and fractures, but most of the injuries are labeled as sprains and strains. The pain from these injuries can be debilitating. About a third of the injured workers had to take off more than a month to recover.\n\nA handful of the injuries were far worse.\n\nThe politics of a dead worker\n\nIn September 2017, Amazon announced a search for a second headquarters, saying it would invest more than $5 billion and bring as many as 50,000 jobs to whichever city won the sweepstakes.\n\nIndiana Gov. Eric Holcomb got the news while on a trip to Japan. He returned home on a Friday night and spent the weekend in deliberations. On Monday, he announced his state would join the bidding war. He put the Indiana Economic Development Corporation in charge of putting together a package of local and state incentives.\n\n“We are doing what Amazon has asked us to do: coordinating efforts with all interested regions of the state to put our best bid forward,” he said in the statement.\n\nHe had tough competition. Arlington, Virginia, offered $550 million in cash and a helipad. Atlanta dreamed up an exclusive airport lounge with free parking for Amazon executives. Maryland’s Montgomery County dangled $6.5 billion in tax incentives.\n\nThe efforts of Indiana state officials to vie for Amazon’s interest were about to intersect with the life of one local Amazon employee, 59-year-old Phillip Lee Terry.\n\nTerry had been at Amazon for about two years. He started as a picker in a Plainfield fulfillment center, then moved to the maintenance department. He had a background in an unrelated field – marketing – but quickly took on the task of handling complicated industrial equipment.\n\nTerry made a surprisingly strong impact on his co-workers, even at a big, busy warehouse. He’d chat them up and make them laugh whenever he could, said Jennie Miller, who worked picking orders with Terry.\n\n“There’s only kind of a few people that you ever meet in your life that have those kinds of sparkling personalities,” she said.\n\nOn Sept. 24, just a few days after he’d been eating ice cream and watching college football with his grandkids, Terry showed up for work and was sent to do maintenance on a forklift. He walked under the machine’s forks and metal platform to work on it with a wrench. Suddenly, the 1,200-pound piece of equipment dropped down and crushed him.\n\nHis body lay there nearly two hours before a co-worker noticed the pool of blood.\n\nThe next day, a safety inspector with Indiana OSHA headed to Amazon to investigate.\n\nSafety was the family business for John Stallone. His father had worked his way up to become director of enforcement for the Alaska state branch of OSHA. Years ago, when Stallone joined the U.S. Air Force and served in Afghanistan, his father told him that wherever his career took him, to always get involved in safety work. And so he did, volunteering on safety committees in the military, then working in industrial safety in oil and gas fields. On a shelf near his front door, he keeps a collection of hard hats from his safety work around the globe.\n\nAs he surveyed the site of the accident, Stallone quickly figured out the problem: A tall pole, lying just feet away, should have been used to prop up the forklift during maintenance. In a recording he made of his inspection, Stallone asked an Amazon manager whether there was any written documentation of Terry being trained on that.\n\n“No, sir,” the supervisor says on the recording. He told Stallone that Terry had been informally trained by a co-worker.\n\nStallone interviewed a co-worker of Terry’s, who put the blame on Amazon’s safety culture coming in second to production demands.\n\n“The safety issues I’ve brought up have been dismissed and not dealt with,” the worker said in a signed statement. “I want to see the safety culture in Amazon change and ensure the maintenance workers have the appropriate amount of training. There’s no training, there’s no safety, it’s ‘Get ’er done.’ ”\n\nStallone repeatedly pressed Amazon to provide records showing Terry had been trained on that piece of equipment. In the end, he found that Amazon failed to provide adequate training, exposing Terry to a fatal hazard.\n\nIndiana OSHA issued four serious safety citations, for a total fine of $28,000. Stallone sought more, but he was getting pushback. On Nov. 20, 2017, Stallone joined his boss, Indiana OSHA Director Julie Alexander, as she called Amazon officials. He secretly recorded the conversation, which is legal in the state, and shared the recording with Reveal.\n\nDuring the call, Alexander told the Amazon officials what she’d need from them in order to shift the blame from the company to “employee misconduct,” according to the recording.\n\nAnd she walked them through how to negotiate down the fines. “We sometimes like to consider grouping citations to lower the penalty amounts,” she said.\n\nShe suggested Amazon could partner with her agency as a “leader in safety” to kick off a program promoting best practices in the logistics industry.\n\nAfter hanging up with Amazon, Alexander said: “They’re wanting to probably take this offer and go back and look and say, ‘Hey, we’re partnering with Indiana. We’re going to be the leader.’ ”\n\nShe told Stallone, “I hope you don’t take it personally if we have to manipulate your citations.”\n\nAmazon had said it would appeal the citations and had further information that it would share in confidential settlement negotiations. Alexander wondered what it could be. Then she speculated out loud that the information might be about Terry himself, saying, “I’m guessing the guy was probably on drugs or something.”\n\nBy this point, a coroner had found nothing in his blood except nicotine and caffeine.\n\nStallone said he was disgusted. But the pressure to placate Amazon didn’t stop there.\n\nSome days after the conference call with Amazon officials, Stallone said Indiana Labor Commissioner Rick Ruble pulled him into his office. The governor was there, too, standing by the commissioner’s desk, according to Stallone.\n\nHe recalled that Holcomb told him how much it would mean to Indiana if the state won the Amazon headquarters deal. Then, Stallone said, the commissioner told him to back off on the Amazon case – or resign.\n\nStallone said he quit soon afterward. Stallone said he resigned after being told by his supervisors that he was going to be terminated for job performance issues, and maintains to Reveal that those issues were baseless and in retribution for his stance on the Amazon investigation. Personnel records subsequently released by the state of Indiana say Stallone’s employment was terminated for failing to “successfully complete probationary period.”\n\nOn Dec. 6, 2017, Stallone sounded the alarm to a federal OSHA official. In an email he shared with Reveal, Stallone told the federal official that “someone higher than Director Alexander” wanted the Amazon case to go away “in the hopes it would keep Indianapolis in the running for their new HQ location.”\n\nThe governor’s office denied the meeting with Stallone and the labor commissioner took place, with press secretary Rachel Hoffmeyer writing, “The Governor never gets involved in Department of Labor cases.”\n\nThe same day Stallone sent his whistleblower email, Amazon’s corporate offices in Seattle gave a $1,000 campaign contribution to Indiana’s governor. It was years before Holcomb would next face reelection, and Amazon hasn’t donated to him before or since.\n\nA year after Terry’s death, Indiana officials quietly signed an agreement with Amazon to delete all the safety citations and fines. The agreement said Amazon had met the requirements of an “unpreventable employee misconduct defense.” The official record now essentially blames Terry for his own death.\n\nAt that point, Indianapolis was one of 20 finalists for the Amazon headquarters deal. Three and a half weeks after the citations were deleted, Amazon held a small-business roundtable event in Indianapolis. Holcomb was there, sitting next to a company representative.\n\n“Our tax and regulatory climates are very – not just attractive, but enticing,” he told a local TV reporter at the event. “And we want to grow together.”\n\nUltimately, Indiana didn’t win the big sweepstakes, as Amazon chose Arlington for its second headquarters. Federal OSHA declined to investigate Stallone’s complaint.\n\nThe governor’s office and Indiana labor officials declined interviews.\n\nThe governor's response:Holcomb disputes interference allegations in Reveal story\n\nThe Indiana Labor Department, which oversees the state OSHA, responded to questions about Stallone’s account of the meeting and Alexander’s statements by email, writing that, “The allegations are nothing short of bizarre and fantastical – in addition to being absolutely false.”\n\nIn a later statement, the department said it couldn’t prove Amazon should have known Terry wouldn’t properly prop up the forklift.\n\nLabor Department spokesperson Stephanie McFarland said Amazon produced proof that Terry was properly trained, including a video of Terry handling the equipment the right way another time. But the agency did not provide any documentation of Amazon’s evidence or any records that would corroborate the department’s account.\n\nTwo of the former Amazon safety managers who were aware of Terry’s death at the time faulted Amazon for failing to use formally trained maintenance professionals. One of them, the former senior safety manager, said Amazon had a systemic problem, vividly recalling a report from another warehouse in which a maintenance worker also had failed to properly brace a forklift while working on it, months after Terry’s death.\n\n“If there was any misconduct there, it’s putting a person that has little to no experience and working on this piece of equipment,” said the other former safety manager, who has worked at multiple facilities. “Whoever allowed that to happen – that’s the misconduct.”\n\nAshley Robinson, the Amazon spokesperson, would not comment on the circumstances surrounding Terry’s death, citing privacy concerns.\n\nStallone was so troubled by the incident that he attended Terry’s funeral.\n\n“Someone died on the job because they don’t have a good safety culture,” Stallone said. “I think Amazon was given a pass, and they were able to walk away from this fatality incident with no blood on them.”\n\nMore than two years later, Terry’s son, Zach, still thinks about his dad each day.\n\n“I have a lot of anger built up because of everything that’s happened,” he said. “He wasn’t an accident. He was the patriarch of our family.”\n\nA gas leak in Eastvale\n\nCandice Dixon remembers her excitement when the Amazon warehouse opened in Eastvale in March 2018. The new fulfillment center would help make Amazon the Inland Empire’s largest private employer, offering a decent wage and health benefits – with no experience necessary. That fall, Amazon executive Dave Clark chose the Eastvale warehouse to make the announcement that Amazon’s new minimum wage would be $15 per hour. The hundreds of workers crowded around him broke into cheers and applause.\n\nBut the jobs, Dixon soon found, came with a brutal work pace. She and other Eastvale workers said nothing was allowed to stand in the way of Amazon’s delivery targets.\n\nOn New Year’s Day 2019, the smell of gas wafted through the giant warehouse and workers started to fall ill.\n\nA call came in to the local 911 dispatcher just after midnight Jan. 2, five and a half hours into the night shift.\n\n“There’s a lot of people sick,” an Amazon worker said.\n\nThe person on the line, Christina Van Vorce, a robotics floor monitor, had been smelling gas since the start of her shift. Some workers had been moved to another part of the building, and others were sent briefly to a break room, but the warehouse had not been evacuated, according to accounts by Van Vorce and four others at work that night. After seeing pickers throwing up into trash cans, Van Vorce clocked out to dial 911. She told the dispatcher she didn’t want Amazon to know she had called.\n\n“Where I was at on my floor, pretty much everyone on that side felt sick,” she can be heard saying in the recording. “Two associates that I know for sure that were vomiting. One girl almost completely passed out. She had to be taken by a wheelchair. And then everyone else has got, like, headaches and the burning in the chest and the nose.\"\n\nThe dispatcher said everyone should evacuate the building. Robinson told Reveal that Amazon shut down the site for about an hour and a half while a maintenance team repaired the leak. But Van Vorce tells the dispatcher that management wouldn’t stop operations.\n\n“They’re trying to tell us we have to use our personal time if we want to leave,” she says in the 911 recording.\n\nHelp Reveal's investigation:Share your Amazon warehouse injury records\n\nAnother worker called 911 with a similar report, saying she and her co-workers smelled gas and she had clocked out with a headache, but management wouldn’t evacuate. The fire department arrived and found that wind had damaged a gas line, funneling gas into the building.\n\nOne current Eastvale worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation, said a friend drove her to a hospital in Upland, where she spent several hours on oxygen, an account the friend confirmed. The friend said she herself ended up out of work for weeks with dizziness and headaches. Amazon’s injury logs did record one worker’s “respiratory irritation” that day.\n\nRobinson said that before firefighters arrived, gas was shut off to the building and its safety team “assessed we had fresh air entering the building and there was no risk” to workers. She insisted that no one was hospitalized.\n\nVan Vorce and other workers said Amazon docked their personal time off for leaving work during the leak, though Robinson told Reveal that was against company policy. She confirmed that anyone docked time off got it reversed if they complained.\n\n“It was all about numbers,” Van Vorce said in an interview. “They didn’t want to stop production.”\n\nIf Amazon’s Eastvale leadership wouldn’t pause production for a gas leak, they certainly didn’t pause for something as mundane as a trip to the bathroom.\n\nBathroom visits are tracked carefully at Amazon fulfillment centers, according to multiple current and former workers and managers, with each gap in scanning labeled as “time off task.” Too much time off task can trigger a write-up, and workers describe being caught between wanting to stay hydrated and trying to avoid long treks across a giant warehouse to the bathroom.\n\nRobinson said Amazon ensures every worker has access to a restroom a “short walk” away “whenever needed.” But she did not address whether workers are docked for such trips as time off task. It was that threat that sparked some workers to devise workarounds.\n\nAdam Kester, who worked as a picker at a fulfillment center in Phoenix until last year, said he and other workers would bring customers’ orders into the bathroom with them to scan midway through. “It sounds disgusting,” he acknowledged.\n\nKristi Shrum, who worked as a stower until 2018 at another Amazon warehouse in Southern California, said she sometimes would have friends scan items for her while she went to the bathroom to make it look as though she was working. Still, she said she got multiple urinary tract infections.\n\n“You have to hold your pee or not make your rate. Which one you want to do?” Shrum said. “I had to make my rate.”\n\nFaith Gerdon of Anaheim said she developed urinary tract infections while working as a stower at the Eastvale warehouse last year. At one point, she got so upset that she told her supervisor, “I’m happy to bring puppy pads and pee here on the floor.”\n\nAs Eastvale – a member of last year’s Million Unit Club – again gears up for the frantic holiday season, Gerdon won’t have a chance to earn all that overtime.\n\nLast December, injuries to both of her thumbs and wrists put her off work, according to Amazon’s logs. She hasn’t worked since.\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos, meanwhile, is focused relentlessly on his customers.\n\n“We are ramping up to make our 25th holiday season the best ever for Prime customers – with millions of products available for free one-day delivery,” he said in an Oct. 24 press release about Amazon’s most recent earnings report. “Customers love the transition of Prime from two days to one day – they’ve already ordered billions of items with free one-day delivery this year.\"\n\nProducer Rachel de Leon, engagement reporter Byard Duncan, data reporter Melissa Lewis, senior reporter Katharine Mieszkowski and director of audience Hannah Young contributed to this story.

Progressive human rights ideas also emerged and changed the world as women, blacks, and the LGBT community demanded, and often won, equal rights. Technology evolved, modifying and innovating our lives in ways never dreamed of.\n\nThe world certainly has progressed, but wars have raged on, and climate change has picked up speed, endangering the ecosystems of our planet.\n\nTo put this in perspective, 24/7 Wall St. has compiled a list of the most important event in each of the past 100 years. We drew on research material and news reports to determine what event had the biggest impact in a particular year.\n\n1919: National booze ban\n\n• Date: Oct. 28\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nCongress passes the 18th Amendment that bans the production, transport or sale of alcoholic beverages in the United States. The legislation opens the way for Prohibition, which lasts from 1920 to 1933. The public flouts the law, which succeeds in enriching gangsters and contributing to the rise of organized crime.\n\n1920: Women's suffrage\n\n• Date: Aug. 26\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nThough the United States was founded under democratic principles, only a minority of its population (starting with white landowning males over the age of 21) could actually vote. But after the 19th Amendment of the Constitution is passed, women finally gain a voice and the right to cast their ballots.\n\nSports gambling:Why sports betting hasn't gone nationwide yet after Supreme Court ruling\n\n1921: Chinese Communists rise\n\n• Date: July 1\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nIn a prequel to the rise of Mao Zedong and Red China, the Chinese Communist Party is founded, and three weeks later it convenes its first National Congress that is attended by Mao. It would take another 28 years before the Republic of China becomes the People's Republic of China.\n\n1922: British Empire shrinks\n\n• Date: Feb. 28\n\n• Location: London\n\nThe British Empire was at its peak toward the end of World War I, commanding a global population estimated to be as many as 570 million people, or about a fourth of the world's population at the time. The empire's size began to shrink in 1920, when Britain declared limited independence for Egypt, which leads to full independence two years later.\n\n1923: Great Kanto earthquake\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Tokyo, Yokohama, Japan\n\nThe Great Kanto earthquake, also known as the Tokyo-Yokohama earthquake, strikes the Japanese mainland at noon on Sept. 1, 1923, with a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale. The death toll is estimated at 140,000 people. The force of the temblor destroys hundreds of thousands of homes that either collapse or are engulfed in fire. The quake sets off a tsunami that reaches a height of almost 40 feet at Atami in the Sagami Gulf, killing 60 people there. The most significant outcome of the catastrophe is the rebuilt Tokyo that would become a modern metropolis.\n\n1924: From Lenin to Stalin\n\n• Date: Jan. 21\n\n• Location: Moscow\n\nFollowing the death of Vladimir Lenin on Jan. 21, the new leader of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, immediately begins a purge of political rivals. Some are simply moved to different positions, while others, like Leon Trotsky, the presumed successor to Lenin, are exiled. Stalin's paranoia grows as he takes control of the nation, and with it the level of violence and killing of anyone perceived to be a threat to his power and control.\n\n1925: Scopes monkey trial\n\n• Date: July 10\n\n• Location: Dayton, Tennessee\n\nAfter teaching the theory of evolution in a Tennessee high school, the state prosecutes science teacher John Thomas Scopes because state law prohibits such teaching as it runs counter to Biblical beliefs. The trial pits well-known Christian fundamentalist William Jennings Bryan against renowned attorney Clarence Darrow. The jury rules against Scopes, forcing him to pay a fine of $100 (about $1,460 in 2017 dollars). It would take another 43 years before the U.S. Supreme Court rules that laws punishing people for teaching evolution violate the First Amendment.\n\n1926: U.S. starts numbered highway system\n\n• Date: Nov. 11\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nIn a precursor to the modern interstate highway system, the federal government introduces a national highway numbering system in an effort to standardize roadways, especially local roads and trails with names unfamiliar to outsiders. The U.S. Numbered Highway System makes it easier for the growing number of car owners to figure out how to get from one city or town to the next and opens the way for the great American road-trip tradition.\n\n1927: Lindbergh nonstop to Paris\n\n• Date: May 21\n\n• Location: New York to Paris\n\nWhen the monoplane The Spirit of St. Louis touches down at Le Bourget Field in Paris on the evening of May 21, Charles Lindbergh becomes the person to fly over the Atlantic Ocean nonstop. Lindbergh would become one of the heroes of the age. His feat fires the imagination of aspiring aviators about the commercial possibilities of flight. Lindbergh would stay in the news, but for regrettable reasons. A strong advocate for American isolationism in the 1930s, he is criticized for his admiration of Nazi Germany's aircraft industry. Also, his son would be killed during a bungled kidnapping attempt in 1932.\n\n1928: Earhart crosses Atlantic\n\n• Date: June 17-18\n\n• Location: Wales\n\nAmelia Earhart becomes the first woman to pilot a plane across the Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Wales, making her an American national heroine and feminist icon who would go on to set numerous aviation records. She would later set another record as the first person – man or woman – to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland. Earhart and her co-pilot Fred Noonan would vanish over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 during Earhart's attempt to circumnavigate the globe.

This was the first LSD trip, a quarter-century before the counterculture endorses the hallucinogenic compound. Hoffman describes the \"not unpleasant\" experience as \"uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors.\" Hoffman takes a second dose and writes a paper about his discovery. The U.S. Army tests the drug on soldiers numerous times from 1955 to 1967, briefly toying with the idea of using LSD as a weapon to disorient enemy soldiers during combat.\n\n1944: D-Day\n\n• Date: June 6\n\n• Location: Normandy France\n\nThe plan for the biggest one-day military campaign in history, the invasion of Normandy by Allied forces to push the Nazis out of France, is hatched in extreme secrecy a year earlier.

It attempts to do the same in Western Europe, which is still recovering from the massive destruction of World War II. To respond to the Soviet threat, U.S. and Western European allies form the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Fundamentally, NATO simply states that an attack on any NATO member would be considered an attack on all NATO members.

The drop is worse than the crash in 1929. It is also worse than the market plunge after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis. Among the reasons cited for the drop are rising tensions in the Persian Gulf, concern over higher interest rates and the belief that the bull market is ending. Computerized trading, relatively new at the time, accelerates trade orders, which speeds up the market drop. As a result of the collapse, exchanges put in place so-called circuit breakers intended to halt trading when stocks fall too fast. This measure is designed to provide investors a cooling off period and avoid a panic.\n\nThe 50 hottest cities in America:Phoenix tops the list\n\n1988: When the U.S. armed Iran\n\n• Date: March 16\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nLt.

Hurricane Maria inflicts immense damage to the U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which was already struggling from economic insolvency.\n\nDetailed findings & methodology\n\nThere is little doubt that in the last 100 years, mankind has progressed dramatically. People live longer, eat better, have greater access to improved medical care and are freer to express their opinions and associate with whomever they want.\n\nThat optimism can be seen in population growth. Despite the two most devastating wars in human history, the world population has nearly tripled, from 1.9 billion to 7.5 billion, since 1917.\n\nOne hundred years is an eye blink in history, yet 100 years ago, women did not have the right to vote in the United States. African-Americans were prevented from voting in the American South. Labor unions were in their infancy and were weak, and laws reforming child labor had yet to be passed by Congress. All that changed because of women’s suffrage, the inexorable march of civil rights and the strengthening labor unions.\n\nOne hundred years ago, a person anywhere in the world was more likely than not to be illiterate. And there was a good chance he or she was the subject of colonial rulers in South America, Africa and Asia. Two world wars would spell the end of imperial houses in Austria-Hungary, Germany and Russia, and weaken the grip of another, Great Britain. Independence movements sprouted in Europe, Africa and Asia, yearning for freedom and expressing national pride.\n\nNationalism had its dark side, though, with fascist governments ruling Italy and Germany. It would take a world war to remove their scourge. Another form of totalitarianism, communism, would dominate the USSR and Eastern Europe for several generations, as well as China and other countries in Asia, before the West would triumph over the Soviet Union and its allies in the Cold War.\n\nSpeaking of the Cold War, that conflict launched the space race and accelerated technological progress, hastening the use of personal computers and cell phones. These inventions have fundamentally changed our lives – from the way we communicate to the way we shop and socialize – and made billions of dollars for the companies that make them and their founders. These products and innovations are a major part of the culture today.\n\nTo determine the most important event the year you were born, 24/7 Wall St. drew on research materials and media sources to compile its list. Deciding the most important event in a given year by its nature is a subjective exercise. In reaching our decisions, we chose the event that had the most far-reaching impact and was not necessarily the most famous event in a given year.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

These stories range from massive conflicts or catastrophes that leave thousands dead or stranded to technological developments and supreme court decisions that completely change our daily lives.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed the biggest news stories in each year since 1950. The event we chose for a given year wasn’t always the most talked-about story when it occurred, but each one in retrospect proved to have the biggest impact on history.\n\nMajor milestones in civil rights, wars and conflicts, and breakthroughs in science and medicine stand out in news coverage over this time period. As technology evolved, modifying and innovating our lives in ways never dreamed of, progressive ideas also found footing and changed the world. Women, African Americans, and the LGBTQ community demanded, and often won, equal rights – from the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the legalization of same-sex marriage. Here are the most important human rights milestones since 2000.\n\nIncreasingly, major news events in recent years include severe weather events and other catastrophes tied to global climate change. Devastating changes to our climate now endanger the ecosystems of our planet. In the coming years, natural disasters will have an increasingly large role on the course of history. Here are 26 disaster scenarios caused by climate change.\n\nDangerous states:Which states have the highest rates of violent crime and most murders?\n\nStock market:Investors could still be in for a bumpy ride in 2020\n\n1950: Korean War starts\n\n• Date: June 25\n\n• Location: Korea\n\nThe North Korean People’s Army crosses the 38th parallel into South Korea, eliciting an almost immediate response from U.S. President Harry Truman and marking the beginning of the Korean War – a proxy battle between the United States and the People’s Republic of China.

The uneasy relations between North Korea and South Korea last to this day.\n\n1951: Rosenbergs sentenced\n\n• Date: March 29\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nHusband and wife Julius and Ethel Rosenberg are convicted of espionage for their part in passing along atomic secrets to the Soviet Union during and after World War II. They are executed two years later. Not everyone is convinced of their involvement in the scheme. Supporters claim they are scapegoats swept up in the Cold War hysteria of the time. Documents would reveal decades later the extent of Julius Rosenberg’s involvement in the spy ring, though Ethel’s participation in the scheme remains inconclusive.\n\n1952: First hydrogen bomb test\n\n• Date: Nov. 1\n\n• Location: Marshall Islands\n\nThe United States successfully detonates its first hydrogen bomb, a second-generation thermonuclear device.

Board of Education\n\n• Date: May 17\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nIn a landmark case involving Linda Brown of Topeka, Kansas, who had to cross a railroad track to reach an all-black elementary school even though an all-white school was closer, the U.S. Supreme Court rules that the segregated school system is unconstitutional on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. The clause would be used again by the courts to reverse state-level racial segregation practices and ordinances.\n\n1955: Parks starts a movement\n\n• Date: Dec. 1\n\n• Location: Montgomery, Alabama\n\nRosa Parks makes history by refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery bus. Her arrest for insisting to remain seated leads to the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the ascent of a young pastor named Martin Luther King, Jr., as a local activist leader working to advance the civil rights cause. A successful federal lawsuit by the NAACP against the city leads to the desegregation of the Montgomery bus system on Dec. 21 of the following year.\n\n1956: Hungary suppressed\n\n• Date: Nov. 4\n\n• Location: Budapest\n\nNine years after the start of the Cold War, Hungarians take to the streets, demanding democratic reforms.

Castro quickly consolidates power in Cuba, establishing a communist government in the Caribbean’s largest country.\n\n1960: Lunch counter sit-in\n\n• Date: Feb. 1\n\n• Location: Greensboro, North Carolina\n\nWhen four African American college students – Ezell A. Blair, Franklin E. McCain, Joseph A. McNeil, and David L. Richmond – sit down at a Woolworth’s lunch counter and ask for service, they are denied. The young men refuse to give up their seats, their sit-in leading to a larger six-month protest that results in the desegregation of the lunch counter by that summer and many other restaurants across the south.\n\n1961: Berlin Wall built\n\n• Date: Aug. 13\n\n• Location: Berlin, East and West Germany\n\nBy the late summer of 1961, the loss of skilled workers such as teachers, engineers, and doctors to the West reaches crisis levels in East Germany. On Aug. 12, 2,400 East Germans cross into West Berlin, the most in a single day. The next day, with the approval of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, East Germany begins building a wall that would extend 27 miles through Berlin, dividing families and friends for the next 28 years.

The standoff is widely considered to be the closest the two nuclear superpowers come to direct military confrontation. Cooler heads prevail. The Soviet Union offers to remove the missiles in exchange for a guarantee that the United States will not invade Cuba. In secret, the administration also agrees to withdraw U.S. missiles from Turkey.\n\n1963: JFK assassinated\n\n• Date: Nov. 22\n\n• Location: Dallas\n\nAs John F.

Johnson struggles to shift focus away from the Vietnam War and on his stated goals of reducing poverty, ending segregation, and establishing the social programs that many Americans rely on to this day, including the immensely popular Medicare program. During his “War on Poverty” State of the Union Address of Jan. 8, 1964, LBJ outlines the need for the country to reduce poverty, end racial discrimination, attend to the health needs of the elderly, and other progressive goals. LBJ later ushers in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Social Security Amendments of 1965.\n\n1965: Selma to Montgomery march\n\n• Date: March 7\n\n• Location: Selma, Alabama\n\nThe fatal shooting of protester Jimmy Lee Jackson by an Alabama state trooper sparks a march in the state from Selma to Montgomery.

After three days of travel, Armstrong and Aldrin land the Eagle module on the lunar surface as Collins remains in lunar orbit to pilot the module. Upon their return to Earth, the three astronauts are put in 21-day quarantine to ensure they did not bring back any lunar contagions.\n\n1970: Vietnam War turns to Cambodia\n\n• Date: April 29\n\n• Location: Eastern Cambodia\n\nAlthough the United States should be scaling back U.S. troop presence in Vietnam, President Richard Nixon approves an operation with the South Vietnamese to invade Cambodia to oust Northern Vietnamese forces there. The Cambodian incursion inflames anti-war protests in the United States as it is perceived to be an escalation of U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia.\n\n1971: Pentagon Papers\n\n• Date: Feb. 8\n\n• Location: Laos\n\nThe Pentagon Papers, a study by the U.S. Department of Defense about the country's involvement in the Vietnam war, are released and published first in The New York Times, then other newspapers. The documents expose several missteps and how several administrations have misled the American public about how involved the military was and about plans to escalate the war in 1964. They also reveal an expanded campaign in Cambodia and Laos, especially clandestine bombing in Laos, which today is considered the heaviest bombardment in history.\n\n1972: Nixon goes to China\n\n• Date: Feb. 21\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nNixon, a virulent anti-communist earlier in his political career, surprises the American public by traveling to Beijing for a week of talks in a historic first step towards normalizing relations between the United States and the People’s Republic of China. Until this trip, the United States and communist China were de facto enemies, fighting proxy wars in the Korean Peninsula in the 1950s and South Vietnam at the time of Nixon’s visit.\n\n1973: Roe v. Wade\n\n• Date: Jan. 22\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nIn a landmark 7-2 decision that will be known as Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court rules that under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, abortion is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. The court adds that as the pregnancy develops the state can balance a woman’s right to privacy with its interest in preserving the “potentiality of human life.” As a result, states can ban abortion in the third trimester except in cases where a pregnancy affects a woman’s health.\n\n1974: Nixon resigns\n\n• Date: Aug. 8\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon announces his resignation amid impeachment proceedings stemming from the Watergate scandal and the administration’s attempt resist a congressional investigation. The scandal exposes abuses of power by the White House after five burglars were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C. Nixon becomes the only president in U.S. history to resign.\n\n1975: Saigon falls\n\n• Date: April 30\n\n• Location: South Vietnam\n\nTwo years after the last American troops left Vietnam, communist troops from North Vietnam capture Saigon, ending nearly two decades of relentless war in the rice paddies and jungles of that Southeast Asian nation. The total number of fatal casualties for the United States is 58,220.\n\n1976: The Concorde changes air travel\n\n• Date: Jan. 21\n\n• Location: London and Paris\n\nTwo supersonic Concorde jets take off simultaneously – one from London to Bahrain, operated by British Airways, and the other from Paris to Rio de Janeiro via Dakar in Senegal, operated by Air France – marking the first time paying passengers enjoy commercial travel at faster than the speed of sound. Though travel by one of the 16 Concordes ever put into service could slash travel time from New York to London in half, the high cost of maintenance, soaring ticket prices, as well as a fatal accident in 2000, would seal the fate of the narrow, slope-nosed aircraft.\n\n1977: Rise of the personal computer\n\n• Date: January\n\n• Location: Chicago\n\nPersonal home computers began to emerge in the 1970s, but many of the earliest versions resembled calculators that would plug into televisions sets. By 1977, however, the desktop home computer begins to resemble the more modern versions – with an accompanying, attached or separate, computer screen and a magnetic tape or floppy disk storage device. The Commodore PET is unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago that year, while the first Apple II and Radio Shack’s TRS-80 also go on sale.\n\n1978: Cult's mass suicide\n\n• Date: Nov. 18\n\n• Location: Jonestown, Guyana\n\nMore than 900 people die in one of worst recorded acts of cult-related mass murder-suicide as nearly all the victims and perpetrators drink a powdered drink mix laced with cyanide. Most of the victims are Americans, devotees of Peoples Temple cult leader Jim Jones, a former Methodist-trained preacher who built a following and led the flock to Guyana. Among the dead are 276 children. A small number of cult defectors are killed by Peoples Temple gunmen who also slay Leo Ryan, California Congressman who had gone to Guyana to investigate Jonestown.\n\n1979: Islamic Republic born in Iran\n\n• Date: Feb. 11\n\n• Location: Tehran\n\nWorsening economic conditions, increasing discontent with the government, and wide support for religious leader in exile Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini end the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. The shah and his family flee Iran in January 1979. On Feb. 11, the monarchy is dissolved, and on April 1, Khomeini declares Iran an Islamic republic. With support among the nation’s clergy and their many followers, he begins rebuilding Iranian society based on conservative Shiite religious principles. In November, a mob raids the U.S. embassy, taking more than 60 Americans hostage. The crisis would be influential in the following year's presidential election and would not fully resolve until January 1981.\n\n1980: Reagan elected\n\n• Date: Nov. 4\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nWith the United States in an economic malaise and the Iranian hostage crisis hobbling the presidency of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan is elected the 40th president in a landslide. Reagan, who would serve two terms, was the oldest man elected president at the time. Reagan’s election changes the trajectory of American politics, ushering in an era of conservative leadership. During his tenure, he takes a more aggressive approach to the Soviet Union and increases defense spending. Reagan convinces Congress to cut taxes, a move that many economists credit with triggering an economic boom in the 1980s.\n\n1981: AIDS impacts America\n\n• Date: June 5\n\n• Location: Los Angeles\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publishes a report about five gay men who had been diagnosed by local physicians with a rare form of pneumonia – the first reported U.S. cases of what would later become known as HIV/AIDS. The infectious autoimmune disease spreads so fast that by the end of the 1982, 500 Americans would die from what the CDC later calls acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. The death toll would rise to 5,000 by 1985.\n\n1982: Mexico triggers regional debt crisis\n\n• Date: Aug 12\n\n• Location: Mexico City\n\nGlobal economic stagnation in the 1970s and early 1980s as well as excessive borrowing among Latin America’s biggest economies boils over when Mexico’s Finance Minister Jesús Silva-Herzog tells the U.S. Federal Reserve his country can no longer service its debt of $80 billion. After the announcement, lenders realize virtually every country in Latin America, led by Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, is not able to pay back loans. The crisis would lead to years of eroding wages, weak to negative economic growth, sky-high unemployment, severe austerity measures, and political instability – known as the “lost decade” in Latin America.\n\n1983: The internet is born\n\n• Date: Jan. 1\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nThe internet as we know it today – a seemingly endless collection of websites hosted on servers scattered across the globe – is still more than a decade away. At the beginning of 1983, however, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) – a small network for academics and researchers – transitions to the standard TCP/IP protocol of the World Wide Web. The protocol would become the internet's cornerstone and technical foundation as it allows expanded available address space. The protocol also decentralizes the network, thus also expanding accessibility.\n\n1984: Chemicals kill thousands in India\n\n• Date: Dec. 2\n\n• Location: Bhopal, India\n\nThe chemical disaster in Bhopal is still considered history’s worst industrial disaster. About 30 tons of methyl isocyanate, an industrial gas used to make pesticide, are released at a Union Carbide Corp. plant. About 600,000 poor residents of nearby shanty towns are exposed to a highly toxic compound that kills about 15,000 people and countless farm animals, according to Indian government estimates. The calamity leads to a generation of birth defects. To this day, locals claim the now-abandoned site is riddled with toxic materials left behind by Union Carbide, which was acquired by Dow Chemical in 2001.\n\n1985: Reagan, Gorbachev meet\n\n• Date: Nov. 19\n\n• Location: Geneva\n\nDespite his often bellicose criticisms of the Soviet Union, Reagan agrees to meet with his counterpart, Mikhail Gorbachev, in Geneva in the first meeting between leaders of the two Cold War foes in nearly a decade. Though the meeting yields little of substance, it initiates a closer relationship between the two men, who both seem committed to scaling back the nuclear arms race between the two nuclear superpowers.\n\n1986: Chernobyl disaster\n\n• Date: Apr. 26\n\n• Location: Prypyat, Soviet Union\n\nA combination of poor design and human error leads to a power surge in a reactor in the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. This leads to a massive explosion that puts highly radioactive material into the air. Soviet officials try to cover up the incident, but Swedish scientists notice the increased levels of radioactivity. It takes a little over a week for the radioactive emissions to be contained, but by then radioactive particles had already spread thousands of miles by wind currents to countries as far away as France. A 1,600 square mile area around the plant known as the “exclusion zone” is deemed unsafe, and more than 220,000 people have to be resettled. The radiation causes deformities in nearby livestock and cancer in many people near the blast. Though exact figures are hard to come by, the UN reports years later there were over 20,000 cases of thyroid cancer in children who were in the affected areas. The Chernobyl disaster is still considered the worst nuclear power failure in history.\n\n1987: Stock market tanks\n\n• Date: Oct. 19\n\n• Location: Worldwide\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average plunges 508 points, or more than 22%, on Oct. 19, 1987, later referred to as Black Monday. The drop, in percentage terms, is worse than the crash in 1929. It is also worse than the market plunge after the 9-11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis. Among the reasons cited for the drop are rising tensions in the Persian Gulf, concern over higher interest rates, and the belief that the bull market is ending. Computerized trading, relatively new at the time, accelerates trade orders, which speeds up the market drop. As a result of the collapse, exchanges put in place so-called circuit breakers intended to halt trading when stocks fall too fast. This measure is designed to provide investors a cooling off period and avoid a panic.\n\n1988: End of fighting in Iran-Iraq war\n\n• Date: July 20\n\n• Location: Iraq-Iran border\n\nFrom 1980 to 1988, neighboring Middle East countries Iran and Iraq are engaged in a protracted war. It begins when Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein launches an attack on Iran in 1980, sensing an opportunity in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Iraqi forces initially make incursions into Iranian land, but they lose the area gained in 1982 after Iran is able to mobilize its military and repel the Iraqi forces. Hussein seeks a peace deal that year, but Iranian leader Ruhollah Khomeini refuses. From 1982 to 1988, the fighting is characterized by sporadic missile launches, attacks on each others’ oil tankers, and the use of chemical weapons, mostly by the Iraqis. By 1988, Iran’s economy is in dire straits, forcing Iran to agree to a UN-brokered ceasefire. The two countries signed an official peace treaty in 1990. Anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million troops were killed in the war and up to 100,000 Kurds.\n\n1989: The Berlin Wall falls\n\n• Date: Nov. 9\n\n• Location: Berlin, East and West Germany\n\nCracks in the monolithic Soviet bloc are starting to appear in the 1980s, and the very symbol of communist repression comes crashing down in November, when the Berlin Wall is breached, ending a 28-year division of the city. During the day on Nov. 9, a spokesman for East Berlin’s Communist Party says that starting at midnight that day, citizens of East Germany would be free to cross the country’s borders. Almost immediately Berliners start slamming the wall with axes and sledgehammers. By nightfall, the celebration turns into what one observer calls “the greatest street party in the history of the world,” and the city is reunited. East and West Germany would reunite one year later.\n\n1990: Democracy in Poland\n\n• Date: Jan. 28\n\n• Location: Poland\n\nWith the hold of the Soviet Union and communism on East Europe loosening, Poland's ruling communist party votes to dissolve and become more moderate. In the following elections, Lech Wałęsa, leader of the Solidarity Movement and the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, wins the election and becomes president.\n\n1991: American goes to war in Middle East\n\n• Date: Jan. 17\n\n• Location: Saudi Arabia and Kuwait\n\nAfter Saddam Hussein’s Iraq invades and occupies Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990, the United States sends forces to defend neighboring Saudi Arabia from being overrun and to protect its vital oil assets there, calling it Operation Desert Shield. With Saudi Arabia secured, the United States implements Operation Desert Storm to push Iraqi forces back across the border with Kuwait in a military operation that lasts until a ceasefire takes effect in April.\n\n1992: Cold War ends\n\n• Date: Feb. 1\n\n• Location: Camp David, Maryland\n\nJust weeks after the dissolution of the Soviet Union on Dec. 26, 1991, U.S. President George H.W. Bush and his Russian counterpart, Boris Yeltsin, meet at Camp David to formally declare the end of the Cold War that began shortly after the end of World War II. The meeting comes days after both countries announce they would stop aiming nuclear missiles at each other. Russia declares its 11 former communist satellite republics – from Armenia to Uzbekistan – independent.\n\n1993: The EU becomes reality\n\n• Date: Nov. 1\n\n• Location: Brussels\n\nThe Treaty of the European Union, also known as the Maastricht Treaty, goes into effect in November, after a rough series of political wrangling. Among other concessions, the treaty allows the U.K. and Denmark to opt out of the common euro currency. The treaty opens the way to removing border controls among member states and invites new members to join the union.\n\n1994: Rwandan genocide\n\n• Date: April-July\n\n• Location: Rwanda\n\nFor decades, Rwanda has been embroiled in a conflict between the country's two major ethnic groups – the Hutu and the Tutsi. Over 100 days, an estimated 800,000 people are killed, mostly Tutsis, but some moderate Hutus as well. When Tutsi militant group eventually gains control of the country, some two million Rwandans flee to nearby African nations. In 2008, three former Rwandan officials are convicted by an international court of organizing the genocide.\n\n1995: Domestic terror strikes Oklahoma\n\n• Date: April 19\n\n• Location: Oklahoma City\n\nIn the deadliest domestic terrorist attack in U.S. history, anti-government radicals Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. They time the truck-bomb attack for a weekday morning in order to maximize casualties. For the murder of at least 168 people, including 19 children who were in a child-care center in the building, and the injury of hundreds of others, an unremorseful McVeigh is executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001. Nichols is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n\n'You can do better':Jeff Bezos ripped for $690K Australian wildfire relief donation\n\nCutting the cord:As prices go up, here's how you can still save money streaming\n\n1996: The dawn of cloning\n\n• Date: July 5\n\n• Location: Midlothian, Scotland, U.K.\n\nDolly the Sheep enters the annals of bioengineering when scientists at Scotland’s Roslin Institute become the first to not only successfully clone a mammal, but also the first to do so using an adult cell rather than an embryonic one. After 277 cell fusions that developed 29 embryos, the team manages to turn an udder cell into a virtually identical biological carbon copy of the sheep from which it came.\n\n1997: Machine tops chess champ\n\n• Date: May 11\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning notch a significant victory in 1997, when IBM’s Deep Blue machine defeats a world chess champion. The refrigerator-sized computer loses to grandmaster Garry Kasparov in the first match but proceeds to beat him twice and tie him three times in the next five games.\n\n1998: The age of Google begins\n\n• Date: Sept. 4\n\n• Location: Menlo Park, California\n\nWith seed money from Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos among others, Stanford University Ph.D. students Larry Page and Sergey Brin launch the search engine Google. The digital advertising behemoth Google Inc., now Alphabet Inc., is an $863 billion company with several subsidiaries, including YouTube, autonomous-car development company Waymo, and X, the company’s research and development division.\n\n1999: NATO's first independent strike\n\n• Date: March 24\n\n• Location: Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n\nIn order to get Yugoslav forces out of Kosovo during the Kosovo War, NATO forces initiate their first-ever military campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (now Montenegro and Serbia) without U.N. Security Council authorization as Russia and China oppose the attack. The NATO air strikes are aimed at stopping an onslaught against ethnic Albanians by the government of Slobodan Milošević. The NATO attacks last nearly three months, culminating in the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo.\n\n2000: International Space Station opens\n\n• Date: Nov. 2\n\n• Location: Low earth orbit\n\nCommanders Bill Shepherd from the United States and Yuri Gidzenko of Russia, along with Russian flight engineer Sergei Krikalev, become the first temporary residents of the International Space Station two years after the first component of the research center was put into low-Earth orbit about 250 miles above sea level. Since that first crew, there have been 229 other visitors to the ISS, some of them multiple times, led by 146 from the United States and 47 from Russia.\n\n2001: 9/11\n\n• Date: Sept. 11\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nIn the worst attack on U.S. soil since the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, 19 hijackers inspired by Islamist extremism kill nearly 3,000 people after crashing three passenger-laden commercial aircraft into the World Trade Center towers in lower Manhattan and the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. A fourth plane, United Airlines 93, crashes in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, after passengers and crew attempt to regain control of the plane headed to Washington D.C.\n\n2002: Homeland Security Act\n\n• Date: Nov. 25\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nFollowing the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the U.S. Congress and President George W. Bush enact the Homeland Security Act, the biggest government reorganization of national security efforts since the Department of Defense was created in 1947. The sweeping legislation creates the massive Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for everything from protecting infrastructure from cyber attacks to managing the new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.\n\n2003: US invades Iraq\n\n• Date: March 19\n\n• Location: Iraq\n\nWith the help of British and other allied forces, the United States begins its invasion of Iraq with a rapid bombing called Shock and Awe with the intention of destroying Iraq’s alleged weapons of mass destruction; the weapons are never found. Coalition forces manage to quickly topple the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein but have to fight insurgent forces for years afterward.\n\n2004: Facebook founded\n\n• Date: Feb. 4\n\n• Location: Cambridge, Massachusetts\n\nMark Zuckerberg, a 23-year-old Harvard University student, creates The Facebook, a local social networking site named after the orientation materials that profiles students and faculty and given to incoming college freshmen. Within 15 years, Facebook would become a $512 billion digital advertising behemoth so integral to many people’s lives that it is criticized for helping foreign powers and propagandists influence the U.S. political system.\n\n2005: Katrina overwhelms New Orleans\n\n• Date: Aug. 29\n\n• Location: U.S. Gulf Coast\n\nAfter spending four days in the Gulf of Mexico bulking up to a category 5 hurricane, Katrina slams into New Orleans, inundating the city and creating a humanitarian crisis that lasts for weeks. The catastrophe underscores the precarious situation not only in the Big Easy, but also the surrounding area of the Gulf Coast. At least 1,833 people in the storm’s path are killed, and the storm inflicts $161 billion in damages to the region, the costliest storm in U.S. history.\n\n2006: Hussein executed\n\n• Date: Dec. 30\n\n• Location: Baghdad\n\nThree years after U.S. soldiers pulled him from a hole in the ground where he had been hiding, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein is hanged.

Since the first generation phone that Jobs introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show that year, there have been 24 versions of the mobile device, and more than 2.2 billion units have been sold globally through 2018, when Apple stopped reporting iPhone sales. Only Samsung’s Galaxy smartphone comes close to that volume.\n\n2008: Dow plunges\n\n• Date: Sept. 29\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average records the largest-ever intraday drop in points, 777.68, after Congress rejects a massive $700 billion bailout of U.S. banks. The bill would pass days later. The market reacts also to months of global market turmoil amid the 2008 global financial crisis spurred by the U.S. subprime mortgage market crash. The Dow falls by more than half during the 2007-2009 Great Recession, tumbling from 14,164 on Oct. 9, 2007 to 6,594 on March 5, 2009.\n\n2009: America's first African-American president\n\n• Date: Jan. 20\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nAfter winning in a landslide against Republican Sen.

The catastrophe costs the lives of 88 people, and the fire consumes 18,500 homes and businesses. State and federal officials estimate that it would cost $3 billion to clean up debris. Climate change activists say the conflagrations are evidence that global warming is no longer a distant concern and that it is occurring now.\n\n2019: Trump impeached\n\n• Date: Dec. 18\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nOn Dec. 18, 2019, Donald Trump becomes just the third U.S. president to be impeached. A whistleblower reveals that in July Trump had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, as well as cybersecurity company Crowdstrike. These requests were made just after Zelensky said Ukraine wanted to buy weapons from the United States. After the call comes to light, Democratic leaders file two articles of impeachment – for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. They say Trump abused his power by using the office of the president to target a political opponent. The obstruction of Congress charge stems from accusations that Trump Administration officials tried to cover up the whistleblower’s report. Trump calls the investigation a “witch hunt” and denies any wrongdoing. The House passes both articles in a vote that goes almost entirely along party lines, moving the impeachment proceedings along to the Senate.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

We've got your guide to hiking in and around Reno. Here are five must-go hikes to take:\n\nHunter Creek Trail\n\nThe main trail at Hunter Creek is 5.2 miles long with an elevation gain of 1784 feet that starts in the high desert overlooking downtown Reno and leads up into the trees where you end at a pristine waterfall as a final reward. The trail is also open to dogs and horses. It's a great hike, but if you're not somewhat experienced, it may be a little much. That's OK, though, because at the base of the trail, instead of following the main Hunter Creek Trail straight up the mountain, you can cut off to the North and follow the Steamboat Ditch trail which winds lazily along the side of the foothills of Reno with a much more shallow climb (with incredible views of the valley below). Click here for more info.\n\nLower Galena Creek Trail\n\nThis hike is considered moderate by most standards, starting out in the sagebrush and climbing to an elevation change of nearly 700 feet in 4 miles. Sagebrush quickly turns into Jeffrey Pine forest as you meander through upscale Montreux Golf and Country Club (quiet, please). Past Montreux, the trail becomes a bit more rugged as you hike under bigger pine trees and brush that chokes the banks of the tumbling Galena Creek. This hike provides ample shade, so you're not too exposed to the sun on a bright day (which we have a lot of here). Pack a lunch and reward yourself by chowing down in Callahan Park at the end of your hike. Click here for more info.\n\nHidden Valley County Park Trail\n\nDon't let this trail fool you. Even though it's only 2 miles long, it climbs 1,000 feet, making for a heart-pounding equation to get your blood flowing and sweat glands activated. To add to the steepness, this trail is pretty rugged and undeveloped. A number of other trails branch off of this one, so it's challenging to keep the same line up and back. Don't let these things discourage you -- the views across the Truckee Meadows to the Carson Range at the top of the trail are well worth it. An added bonus is the occasional observation of wild horses that call the area home. Another nice thing about the Hidden Valley trail is, due to its western exposure, while other trails in the area can be snowed in longer, the sun tends to clear this trail first. Click here for more info.\n\nHuffaker Park Lookout Trail\n\nLooking for a less daunting hike, but still want sweeping views of the Truckee Meadows and downtown Reno? This is the hike for you. Starting in south Reno, Huffaker Park Lookout Trail wraps around a pair of hills that jut out of the valley high enough to give you the fresh Sierra air and eye candy your soul needs. This trail climbs approximately 200 feet and gives you a couple options -- a three-quarter-mile or 1.6-mile loop. Interpretive signs along the way give you a rundown of the history of the area. Well-placed picnic tables and benches await to give you a breather and a spot to enjoy a packed lunch above the valley below. Nestled in suburban Reno, the area is a favorite of not only hikers, but joggers and dog walkers as well. Click here for more info.\n\nTahoe Meadows (Mount Rose)\n\nNow we're at higher elevations, so pack accordingly as the temperatures and wind conditions can vary rapidly from the valley floor of downtown Reno. You'll be at an elevation of 8,870 feet (downtown Reno is at 4,505 feet), but the trail itself is fairly moderate. Snowshoes are almost always a must during the winter months and cross-country skis are also suitable. You'll meander through the Tahoe Meadows in a pristine valley above Lake Tahoe with nearby Mount Rose serving as your backdrop. The trail is 1.3 miles long and forms a loop with minimal elevation gain. If you want some fresh mountain air and snow, the Tahoe Meadows loop is the place to be this winter. Click here for more info.\n\nThere you have it. A nice handful of trails within a short drive of downtown Reno to enjoy. Depending on the weather, pack extra layers or, during the summer time, bring your hat, sunscreen and plenty of water. That's hiking, Reno-style.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/01/09/corrections-clarifications/1821023/", "title": "Corrections & Clarifications 2020", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nWe recognize that mistakes may happen – or that new information can emerge after a story is published – and we pledge to address all concerns quickly, fairly and transparently.

Wars in the early part of the 20th century led to the end of the colonial world and gave birth to new nations. These wars also cost millions of lives and trillions of dollars. These are the most expensive wars in U.S. history.\n\nThroughout the past century, technological innovations transformed our lives in ways we never dreamed. Progressive ideas also emerged and changed the world as women, African Americans, and the LGBTQ community demanded, and often won, equal rights – from the ratification of the 19th Amendment in the United States to the legalization of same-sex marriage in many countries around the world. Even so, recent civil rights protests tell us the fight for equality is not over.\n\nDunkin' or Starbucks:Among America's favorite brew-at-home coffee brands, which comes out ahead?\n\nPlanes, phones and automobiles:These are the top-selling products from each state in the US\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic that is ravaging the world in 2020 reminds us that for all of our scientific breakthroughs, we’re still vulnerable to deadly viruses that can shut down economies and disrupt society. People are hoping science can save Earth from the devastating changes to the climate that continue to imperil the ecosystems of our planet. In the coming years, natural disasters may have an increasingly impactful role on the course of history. Here are 26 disaster scenarios caused by climate change.\n\nTo determine the most important event the year you were born, 24/7 Tempo drew on research materials and media sources to compile its list. Deciding the most important event in a given year is by its nature a subjective exercise. In reaching our decisions, we chose the event that had the most far-reaching impact, even if it was not necessarily the most famous event in a given year.\n\nThe world's most important event every year since 1920\n\n1920: Women's Suffrage\n\n• Date: Aug. 26\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nThough the United States was founded under democratic principles, only a minority of its population – in the beginning only white landowning males over the age of 21 – could actually vote. But after the 19th Amendment of the Constitution was passed, women finally gain a voice and the right to cast their ballots, though the voting rights fight was far from over for many African American women, especially in the South.\n\n1921: Chinese Communists Rise\n\n• Date: July 1\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nIn a prequel to the rise of Mao Zedong and Red China, the Chinese Communist Party is founded and three weeks later it convenes its first National Congress that is attended by Mao. It would take another 28 years before the Republic of China becomes the People's Republic of China.\n\n1922: British Empire Shrinks\n\n• Date: Feb. 28\n\n• Location: London\n\nThe British Empire was at its peak toward the end of World War I, commanding a global population estimated to be as many as 570 million people, or about a fourth of the world's population at the time. The empire's size began to shrink in 1920, when Britain declared limited independence for Egypt, which leads to full independence two years later.\n\n1923: Great Kanto Earthquake\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Tokyo, Yokohama, Japan\n\nThe Great Kanto earthquake, also known as the Tokyo-Yokohama earthquake, strikes the Japanese mainland at noon on Sept. 1, 1923, with a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale. The death toll is estimated at 140,000 people. The force of the temblor destroys hundreds of thousands of homes that either collapse or are engulfed in fire. The quake sets off a tsunami that reaches a height of almost 40 feet at Atami in the Sagami Gulf, killing 60 people there. The most significant outcome of the catastrophe is the rebuilt Tokyo would become a modern metropolis.\n\n1924: From Lenin to Stalin\n\n• Date: Jan. 21\n\n• Location: Moscow\n\nFollowing the death of Vladimir Lenin on Jan. 21, the new leader of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, immediately begins a purge of political rivals. Some are simply moved to different positions, while others, like Leon Trotsky, the presumed successor to Lenin, are exiled. Stalin's paranoia grows as he takes control of the nation, and with it the level of violence and killing of anyone perceived to be a threat to his power and control.\n\n1925: Scopes Monkey Trial\n\n• Date: July 10\n\n• Location: Dayton, Tennessee\n\nAfter teaching the theory of evolution in a Tennessee high school, the state prosecutes science teacher John Thomas Scopes because state law prohibits such teaching as it runs counter to biblical beliefs. The trial pits well-known Christian fundamentalist and former presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan against renowned attorney Clarence Darrow. The jury rules against Scopes, forcing him to pay a fine of $100 (about $1,498 in 2020 dollars). It would take another 43 years before the U.S. Supreme Court would rule that laws punishing people for teaching evolution violate the First Amendment.\n\n1926: U.S. Starts Numbered Highway System\n\n• Date: Nov. 11\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nIn a precursor to the modern interstate highway system, the federal government introduces a national highway numbering system in an effort to standardize roadways, especially local roads and trails with names unfamiliar to outsiders. The U.S. Numbered Highway System makes it easier for the growing number of car owners to figure out how to get from one city or town to the next and opens the way for the great American road-trip tradition.\n\n1927: Lindbergh Nonstop to Paris\n\n• Date: May 21\n\n• Location: New York to Paris\n\nWhen the monoplane The Spirit of St. Louis touches down at Le Bourget Field in Paris on the evening of May 21, Charles Lindbergh becomes the first person to fly over the Atlantic Ocean nonstop, making him one of the heroes of the age. His feat fires the imagination of aspiring aviators about the commercial possibilities of flight. Lindbergh would stay in the news, but for regrettable reasons. A strong advocate for American isolationism in the 1930s, he is criticized for his admiration of Nazi Germany’s aircraft industry. Also, his infant son would be killed during a bungled kidnapping attempt in 1932.\n\n1928: Earhart Crosses Atlantic\n\n• Date: June 17-18\n\n• Location: Wales\n\nAmelia Earhart becomes the first woman to pilot a plane across the Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Wales, making her an American national heroine and feminist icon who would go on to set numerous aviation records. She would later set another record as the first person – man or woman – to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland. Earhart and her co-pilot Fred Noonan would vanish over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 during Earhart's attempt to circumnavigate the globe. Recent evidence has emerged indicating Earhart may have sent distress signals after surviving a crash, possibly on the remote Gardner Island in the western Pacific Ocean.\n\n1929: Wall Street Crashes\n\n• Date: Oct. 24-29\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nThe \"Roaring Twenties\" come to a halt on Black Tuesday in October 1929, when stocks take a nosedive, contributing to the Great Depression. Reasons for the worst economic downturn in American history include over-lending by weakly regulated banks, excessive stock price valuation, too many stocks purchased on margin, unrestrained exuberance that sends millions of people to convert their savings into stocks, tightening of the credit by the Federal Reserve, and an agricultural drought.\n\n1930: Ho Chi Minh Rises in Vietnam\n\n• Date: Feb. 2\n\n• Location: Hanoi\n\nIn an event that would have repercussions for U.S. foreign policy decades later, Vietnamese independence fighter Ho Chi Minh founds the Communist Party of Vietnam as part of his effort to oust French colonial occupiers. \"Uncle Ho,\" as he was known to his many supporters, was inspired by the Russian Bolsheviks, who oppose the Tsarist autocracy, seeing parallels between that struggle and the fight against the foreign occupiers of his country.\n\n1931: Empire State Building Completed\n\n• Date: May 1\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nU.S. President Herbert Hoover inaugurates the completion of the Empire State Building on May Day. It becomes the tallest building of the iconic Manhattan skyline until the construction of the World Trade Center Towers are completed in 1973. Incredibly, the 86-story office building took only 13 months to build, with construction starting in March of the previous year.\n\n1932: Hitler Becomes German\n\n• Date: Feb. 25\n\n• Location: Germany\n\nSeven years after Adolf Hitler renounces his Austrian citizenship, a fellow member of the Nazi Party gets him a low-level government job, which comes with automatic citizenship. This opens the way for him to run for office. Already a well-known party activist, it takes Hitler only two years from receiving his citizenship status to becoming the leader of Germany.\n\n1933: FDR Elected\n\n• Date: March 12\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nWith the Great Depression sending millions of Americans to soup kitchens and chasing whatever work they can find, newly elected President Franklin Delano Roosevelt begins his weekly \"Fireside Chats\" as Americans are eager for guidance and solace during those dark times. FDR's first radio talk explains to Americans in plain language why he ordered that banks would close temporarily at different time in different parts of the country. The purpose, he explains, is to curb panic rushes of withdrawals, which has been hurting efforts to stabilize the banking system.\n\n1934: Hitler Consolidates Power\n\n• Date: June 30\n\n• Location: Berlin\n\nGermans, who had been suffering from a disastrous economic depression in 1929-30, begin to embrace the ideas of the Nationalist Socialist Workers Party – the Nazi Party. It becomes the largest party after the 1932 elections. In 1933, Adolf Hitler is appointed chancellor of Germany. After President Paul von Hindenburg dies in 1934, Hitler then purges members of his own party – the bloody Night of the Long Knives – with the help of Nazi storm troopers and becomes the unquestioned leader of Germany.\n\n1935: FDR Launches New Deal\n\n• Date: Aug. 14\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nPresident Roosevelt, grappling with the Great Depression, signs into law his signature Social Security Act, a law that creates the country's first retirement security system. Earlier that year, as part of his \"New Deal\" policy, the president established the Works Progress Administration, a massive economic stimulus program, putting millions of Americans to work building the country's public infrastructure.\n\n1936: Owens Flouts Nazis\n\n• Date: Aug. 3\n\n• Location: Berlin\n\nAs the concept of racial purity and superiority dominates Germany in the 1930s, African-American sprinter Jesse Owens of Oakville, Alabama, shows them who is the master racer. During the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, and under the gaze of Adolf Hitler, Owens wins four Olympic gold medals for the 100-meter and 200-meter sprints, the long jump, and the 400-meter relay.\n\n1937: UAW Changes Car Industry\n\n• Date: Feb. 11\n\n• Location: Flint, Michigan\n\nNearly two years after the establishment of the United Automobile Workers (UAW), the union scores a major victory in Flint, Michigan. Workers at the General Motors Fisher Body Plant Number One lay down their tools and occupy the factory, demanding union representation, a fair minimum wage, safer working conditions, and not to outsource labor to non-union plants. Despite efforts by GM and local police to extricate them from the plant, including shutting off the heat, cutting off food supply, and attacks that leave 16 workers and 11 police officers injured, the strike lasts 44 days. The strike leads to an agreement between GM and the UAW, which includes a 5% pay raise and permission to talk in the lunchroom.\n\n1938: Anti-Semitism Surges\n\n• Date: Nov. 9\n\n• Location: Germany, Austria, Sudetenland\n\nGrowing anti-Semitic scapegoating amid Germany's crippling economic conditions culminates in the Kristallnacht, or \"Night of Broken Glass,\" a pogrom sparked by a speech from German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Storm troopers and other Nazi groups are ordered to attack and destroy Jewish businesses, homes, and houses of worship. In one night of attacks in Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking area of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, dozens of Jews are killed and tens of thousands are rounded up and sent to concentration camps.\n\n1939: World War II Starts\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Westerplatte, Poland\n\nUnder the cover of predawn darkness, a German battleship floats quietly into the center of Danzig Harbor and opens fire on a Polish stronghold in Westerplatte, the first shots of World War II. In the following weeks, Nazi forces, including 2,000 tanks and 1,000 aircraft, would shatter Polish defenses and surround Warsaw, which surrenders 26 days after the Danzig Harbor attack.\n\n1940: McDonald's Founded\n\n• Date: May 15\n\n• Location: San Bernardino, California\n\nBrothers Richard and Maurice McDonald open McDonald’s Barbecue Restaurant, offering BBQ ribs, pork sandwiches, and 23 other menu items. Eight years later, they would restructure their popular local business to focus on hamburgers, milkshakes, and fountain sodas, emphasizing speed, a simple menu, and low prices. In the 1950s, businessman Ray Kroc would buy out the brothers and grow McDonald’s into one of the world’s largest restaurant chains.\n\n1941: Pearl Harbor\n\n• Date: Dec. 7\n\n• Location: Oahu, Hawaii\n\nKnowing the U.S. is gearing up to engage them in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II, Japan deploys a massive air attack on U.S. Navy ships parked at Pearl Harbor. The surprise assault by 353 Japanese aircraft leads to the deaths of 2,403 people, including 1,177 sailors aboard the ill-fated USS Arizona, one of 19 vessels that were damaged or destroyed in the attack. Nearly 330 aircraft were also damaged or destroyed. The United States declares war on Japan the next day and three days later against Germany and Italy.\n\n1942: GIs Arrive in Europe\n\n• Date: Jan. 26\n\n• Location: Northern Ireland\n\nThe first U.S. troops destined to fight in Europe in the world's greatest war arrive in Northern Ireland. It is the beginning of a military buildup that would culminate in the invasion of France more than two years later. Before then, the United States was providing only material support to its ally across the Atlantic, while building up what President Roosevelt called the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" in anticipation for the inevitable entry of the United States into the war in Europe.\n\n1943: Invention of LSD\n\n• Date: April 19\n\n• Location: Basel, Switzerland\n\nSwiss chemist Albert Hoffman had been studying the potential medicinal value of lysergic compounds when he accidentally exposed himself to LSD-25, which he had created years earlier in his lab. This was the first LSD trip, a quarter-century before the counterculture endorses the hallucinogenic compound. Hoffman describes the \"not unpleasant\" experience as \"uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors.\" Hoffman takes a second dose and writes a paper about his discovery. The U.S. Army tests the drug on soldiers numerous times from 1955 to 1967, briefly toying with the idea of using LSD as a weapon to disorient enemy soldiers during combat.\n\n1944: D-Day\n\n• Date: June 6\n\n• Location: Normandy France\n\nThe plan for the biggest one-day military campaign in history, the invasion of Normandy by Allied forces to push the Nazis out of France, is hatched in extreme secrecy a year earlier. The plan is conceived during the Quebec Conference by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt. The invasion starts at 6:30 a.m. on five beaches, and over the next 24 hours about 4,900 Allied soldiers are killed, many of them the instant the doors of their Higgins transport boats opened directly into German machine gun fire.\n\n1945: World War II Ends\n\n• Date: Sept. 2\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nThe surrender of Japan marks the end of World War II amid one of the most tumultuous years of the 20th century. Earlier in the year, leaders of three nations – Benito Mussolini, Franklin Roosevelt, and Adolf Hitler – die and Nazi Germany surrenders. Though the surrender of Japan was inevitable, the prospect of a horrific Allied assault on the Japanese mainland convinces the United States to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The atomic bomb attacks, along with the entry of the Soviet Union in the war against Japan, compel the Japanese to surrender.\n\n1946: Baby Boom Starts\n\n• Date: Jan. 1\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nMore American babies are born – 3.4 million – in 1946 than in any year in U.S. history up to then. The number of births grows to 4 million per year from 1954 to 1964, the last year of the baby boomer generation, the biggest generation at that point in history.\n\n1947: India Gains Independence\n\n• Date: Aug. 15\n\n• Location: Washington D.C\n\nThe sun sets on the British Empire in India in 1947, as the Asian nation becomes the world's largest democracy. Independence is the culmination of decades of work by Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Indian nationalists committed to throwing off the yoke of British colonialism. The transition to independence comes at a price. The subcontinent is partitioned into two nations, Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. Violence erupts between Hindus and Muslims as Hindus migrate to India and Muslims shift to Pakistan. It is estimated that 1 million people die during the migration.\n\n1948: Birth of Israel\n\n• Date: May 15\n\n• Location: Middle East\n\nAfter Israel declares its independence following a UN resolution, neighboring Arab states with troops from Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Transjordan (now Jordan), Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia attack the former British-controlled Palestinian mandate. The Arab-Israeli War ended with an armistice that leaves Israel with some territories as Egypt and Jordan retains control over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, respectively.\n\n1949: NATO Founded\n\n• Date: April 4\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nWith the Cold War worsening, the Soviet Union detonates its first nuclear bomb and quickly exerts its influence over Eastern Europe. It attempts to do the same in Western Europe, which is still recovering from the massive destruction of World War II. To respond to the Soviet threat, U.S. and Western European allies form the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Among the reasons cited for the drop are rising tensions in the Persian Gulf, concern over higher interest rates, and the belief that the bull market is ending. Computerized trading, relatively new at the time, accelerates trade orders, which speeds up the market drop. As a result of the collapse, exchanges put in place so-called circuit breakers intended to halt trading when stocks fall too fast.

The final vote was cast in the state's largest city at 9:45 p.m., almost three hours after the polls closed.\n\nExplore the guide to Voting Rights across the US and in Puerto Rico. Read more\n\nMany of the state's Republicans argue a series of measures implemented in the last decade, such as requirements that voters produce a photo ID to vote, have helped Kansas strike a balance between election security and ensuring ease of access.\n\n\"I think it's easier to vote by far today than it was my first time when I voted,\" said Sen. Rob Olson, R-Olathe, who chairs the Senate committee that handles election bills.\n\nNot everyone agrees.\n\n\"Until we're as close to 100% turnout that we can possibly get, reduce the barriers as much as we can and make it possible for turnout to get that high, then we aren't doing enough,\" Alejandro Rangel-Lopez, lead organizer for the New Frontiers Project, a group focused on civic engagement in southwest Kansas, said.\n\nKansas voter ID law still prompts debate\n\nKansas is in a unique spot when it comes to election administration.\n\nThe state gives some measure of flexibility to each of the 105 counties on how elections are run. Kansas is one of only a few states, for instance, that give county clerks the option to offer in-person, advanced voting on weekends.\n\nSometimes, however, advocates say that information isn't widely distributed to voters.\n\nRangel-Lopez noted times for advanced voting can often be inconsistent and information is not always easy to access beyond difficult-to-navigate county websites.\n\nIn Dodge City, for instance, the city had a second polling place, as part of an effort to rectify a standoff that drew national attention in 2018, where one of the largest cities in the region only had one place to vote.\n\nBut Rangel-Lopez noted that not all voters knew where to go, even those who had been registered for years.\n\n\"Folks just don't know where to get this information that should be at their fingertips, but they are unaware of it,\" he said.\n\nDuring former Secretary of State Kris Kobach's tenure, Kansas became nationally notorious for its efforts to crack down on voter fraud. Chance Parker/Special to The Capital-Journal\n\nDuring former Secretary of State Kris Kobach's tenure, Kansas became nationally notorious for its efforts to crack down on voter fraud, including a prolonged legal battle over an invalidated law to require proof of citizenship when left to vote.\n\nThe 2011 voter ID law, a move proponents say is designed to make it harder to commit voter fraud and mirrors how residents access other public services, remains on the books.\n\n\"Voter ID ensures the voter is an actual person and protects the integrity of your vote,\" Secretary of State Scott Schwab wrote in an April Capital-Journal op-ed. \"It is a fundamental tool to ensure one vote equals one person.\"\n\nBut a 2017 report, compiled by the Kansas Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, said it was unclear how many instances of fraud were prevented.\n\n\"The number of eligible voters turned away from the polls in Kansas due to a lack of required identification or a failure to provide documentary proof of citizenship may far exceed the number of documented cases of voter fraud,\" the report said.\n\nEarlier this year, Gov. Laura Kelly signed a bill banning sanctuary cities in Kansas. As part of that, the legislation limited the issuance of municipal identification cards, which had been issued in Douglas County to help residents comply with the voter ID law — a strategy praised by experts to help ensure voters could still cast a ballot.\n\nIn Kansas, residents without a driver's license can obtain a free ID for voting purposes at the Kansas Division of Motor Vehicles. A resident can also obtain a birth certificate free of charge to prove their identity.\n\nStill, advocates argue that those in nursing homes or assisted care may not be able to have help accessing the documents needed for an ID. Low-income residents may still be in a similar bind.\n\n\"Kansas certainly doesn't have the worst voter ID law,\" said Davis Hammet, executive director of Loud Light, a civic engagement group targeted at young people. \"But those first couple of elections, it was a terrible and chaotic rollout. I mean, there are tons of people who didn't vote, who were unable to vote.\"\n\nKansas sees push to tighten mail voting, drop boxes\n\nBut Hammet said there is a second, parallel trajectory: Kansas officials have actually made it easier to vote in some respects in recent years.\n\nIn 2018, for instance, lawmakers voted to allow residents to drop off an advanced ballot at any polling place in a county by 7 p.m., along with the county election office, and allow it to be counted.\n\nOn at least two occasions, the Legislature voted to ensure residents have a chance to fix mistakes that would otherwise mean their ballot would go uncounted.\n\nPreserving those gains, however, is what Hammet is most worried about.\n\n\"That idea of these kinds of incremental steps, all of a sudden goes out the window, and we spend every day fighting just absurd, insane conspiracy theories, that would just disenfranchise tons of people.\"\n\nIn recent years, legislators have been increasingly interested in tightening portions of the state's election laws, often with mixed success.\n\nThe principal rationale, proponents argue, is to continue to cut down on instances of voter fraud. Many echo rhetoric used by former President Donald Trump to assail election results in larger states, such as Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nSchwab's office has routinely pushed back on this rhetoric, arguing the existing requirements — such as voter ID — have protected Kansas elections.\n\nAdvance voting signs inform Jackson County residents of the location to cast their ballots in the county courthouse. Evert Nelson/The Capital-Journal\n\nAnd while Kobach aggressively went after those he accused of voter fraud, such reports have been few and far between more recently.\n\nSince the state's voter fraud reporting portal was launched in December 2021, the Kansas secretary of state's office has received five inquiries regarding voter fraud, a spokesperson said, including two regarding the 2020 election. All were deemed to be non-fraudulent.\n\nNonetheless, lawmakers have considered changing the state's advanced voting law, which allows residents to request a mail ballot up until one week until an election. Legislators have not considered changing advanced in-person voting, which begins 15 days before an election.\n\nBills considered in each of the last two sessions would have ended the so-called three-day grace period. That allows advanced mail ballots postmarked by 7 p.m. on Election Day to be counted, provided they arrive at the county elections office by Friday afternoon, three days later.\n\n\"We are undermining confidence in our tallying procedures by allowing the ballots to keep trickling in over time,\" Rep. Charlotte Esau, R-Olathe, said during a House Elections Committee meeting in 2021.\n\nSen. Oletha Faust-Goodeau, D-Wichita, said the changes to mail voting would most squarely fall on the elderly, working-class residents and those who work third-shift jobs that would keep them from voting during business hours.\n\n\"My goal is to make sure we have safe elections and that everyone can cast their vote,\" she said on the Senate floor earlier this year.\n\nGroups expect ‘election integrity’ push to continue in Statehouse\n\nBut it is not clear legislators have the support for such a move — a bill ending the three-day grace period was adversely reported by the House Elections Committee earlier this year, a move that effectively kills a bill.\n\nAnd a separate bill, which would have sharply curbed the use of ballot drop boxes, died in negotiations between the two chambers after passing the Kansas Senate.\n\nRural lawmakers in particular, have expressed concerns about the idea given slow mail delivery in remote areas, as well as long drives to county seats.\n\n\"They keep getting voted down by coalitions of legislators who want to do what's best for their constituents,\" Caleb Smith, integrated voter engagement director for the advocacy group Kansas Appleseed, said.\n\nThat legislation is a response to concerns from some voters — fueled by baseless claims by Trump and others — that drop boxes are a vehicle for fraud.\n\nOlson said his frustration stemmed from the lack of uniformity, with counties free to differ in their approach to drop boxes. Some don't use the receptacles, while Johnson County has eight.\n\nThis lack of consistency, he said, is what breeds mistrust — even though he maintains he has no problem with drop boxes themselves.\n\n\"I wish the secretary of state's office would have spent some time and put some policies together and said 'This is how the votes are going to be counted,\" he said. \"And we're going to do it every day, or, or these are the policies to have drop boxes. ... There's just no fairness across the board.\"\n\nLawmakers have succeeded in passing laws to restrict how advanced ballots are collected, a move to prevent so-called ballot harvesting, which Republicans have said facilitates fraud.\n\nTweet Facebook Reddit Share this article on Reddit Email Email this story Share Share this story Alejandro Rangel-Lopez, lead organizer for the New Frontiers Project Until we're as close to 100% turnout that we can possibly get, reduce the barriers as much as we can and make it possible for turnout to get that high, then we aren't doing enough. Quote icon\n\nLast year, legislators voted to limit the number of advance ballots an individual can bring to the polls on behalf of someone else. The same bill also restricts candidates from collecting another person's ballot.\n\nThat law is currently being challenged in court. Hammet said they are a sign that lawmakers are more broadly intent on sowing confusion and fear among voters.\n\n\"They make so many rules around so many small obscure things, and they make it very high crimes so that it becomes very intimidating to participate at all,\" he said.\n\nVoting rights advocates have pushed for other measures that have been implemented in other states but are unlikely to become law in Kansas anytime soon.\n\nThat includes same-day voter registration, compared with the current law, where the deadline to register slams shut 20 days before an election.\n\nSmith said the focus would instead be on holding the line.\n\n\"We do see another year or two of folks being just really interested in making sure that that election integrity sort of messaging stays front and center,\" he said.\n\nOlson didn't commit to what election law changes he might take a look at in 2023 but said the issue would be one of many discussed in his committee.\n\n\"Who knows, maybe we'll have a great election year and people will be happy,\" he quipped.\n\nAndrew Bahl is a senior statehouse reporter for the Topeka Capital-Journal.

Being a lifelong resident I know where we have been and want to help make sure we know where we need to go and how to get there properly to benefit all. I ran for this same office 4 years ago and lost in a close race to the current incumbent. Immediately after that election many people constantly contacted me and asked if I would run again, I declined. this continued and then after certain actions and votes made by the current commissioner on issues such as our lagoon, county health insurance cost and many other issues I decided last August to pursue this seat again, to bring it back to you, the citizens of this county and District #3.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nRight now it would have to be the affects of COVID-19 on the county economy, businesses and the finances of the county. Are the affects going to be long or short term. Let's hope short term, but if not tough decisions will have to be made and I will be able to make those tough calls bases on the best interest of our entire county.\n\nNon COVID-19 issues would be to tackle our water quality and Lagoon heath, make sure or growth is \"smart\" and properly managed, find a way to make employee and retiree health insurance affordable for all and that our public safety officials have the needed resources they require.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nTo get straight to the point, my opponent, the current commission has made himself totally ineffective as a commissioner. He can not get two more votes on any initiative he would try to get through so technically our commission is working at 80%. I will not pander for votes and flip flop on issues and will do what I say as you will know where I stand on the issues. I will be a good listener and will make your concerns my priority. I do this not for the paycheck or personal gain and satisfaction but to further my service. I also believe in term limits for elected officials as public office should be a service and not a career.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

As your County Commissioner I have worked closely with the county’s health department, the county’s administrator, local businesses, and area non-profits to meet the challenge. I am running to continue to work for solutions to problems posed by this once in a lifetime scourge. An emergency like the one we are now facing requires an understanding of the issues and experience when so much hangs in the balance.\n\nThe world is in disarray! Every day seems to have a new challenge. I want to continue to protect our slice of paradise. My first job as a county commissioner is to ensure that our citizens are safe and secure. I tell you this, I will NEVER ever Defund Law Enforcement.\n\nFreeze taxes and spending. Like almost every citizen in Indian River County, the county is sure to face tough economic times. I have proposed a policy of no tax increases and to freeze spending at last years levels. I am running to make sure that government does not just continue on its merry way while citizens lose their jobs, their businesses, their homes and even their lives.\n\nControl of Special Interest. One major danger we face is meeting the demands of some our unions. I am running to provide what is needed to protect our citizens but not to open the floodgate by giving the unions direct access to the county’s general fund. My opponent is a one issue candidate hiding behind his past of being a recent former president the union heavily backing him with money and manpower. He has openly committed to providing “anything they want and need”. You want a financial disaster? Give a blank check to my opponent.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nI see over the next year a litany of particularly important decision that we as a commission are going to have to overcome. You have my personal commitment to advocating for:\n\n1. Protecting the community from the Covid-19 pandemic and securing the health and safety for our citizens.\n\n2. Providing funding for law enforcement as a top priority.\n\n3. Freezing government spending, hiring, and rolling back expenses to 2019-2020 levels.\n\n4. Doing what is necessary to help businesses get back in operation and for people to return to work. County government cannot continue to add to the cost of business through regulations, red tape, and fees.\n\n5. Do not forget our children! While we fight battles and worry about budgets, we cannot forget our responsibility to our youngest citizens. I have and will continue to be a dedicated children’s advocate. The Children’s Service Council, volunteer service for adoption, and foster care just scratch the surface of the things needed to adequately address the areas important for poverty-stricken kids and families. I am proud to be known as the children’s commissioner.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nExperience: I have been a County Commissioner for eight of the toughest years Indian River County has ever faced. We defeated the great recession and hurricanes. We continue to battle threats to our environment, threats to health, and safety posed by the train. We now face new challenges and my experience is needed to help meet those challenges.\n\nPublic Sector Experience: I have 40 years of experience as a business owner and a businessman. At age of 19, I was one of the youngest to ever pass the Florida General Contractors exam. I have long career of understanding the challenges and struggles that individuals face in trying to run a business. My opponent on the other hand will never experience a loss of income because as an employee of IRC he retired with a lucrative union retirement package, but yet, he claims to know what families and small business owners are going through.\n\nLoyalty: My loyalty is to the residents of Indian River County. As a third generation native my love for my home community runs deep. This is where I have chosen to build my business and raise my family. It concerns me that my opponent’s first loyalty is to the union where he served as President.\n\nIndependently representing the people verses special interest: Another difference is my list of endorsers. My supporters are solution driven and understand the contributions I have made during my time on the commission.\n\n1. I am being supported by individuals that worked tirelessly on the sale of Vero Beach Electric with FPL. For example, Dr. Stephen Faherety and many others who brought the sale to a successful conclusion saving our citizens millions. My opponent on the other hand is supported by people who opposed the Sale of Vero Electric.\n\n2. I strongly support limited government.\n\nMy opponent is backed by people who tried to get charter government in Indian River County, that allows for a powerful interest group to appoint officials including the sheriff.\n\n3. I am being supported by entrepreneurs that are job creators and contribute heavily to the local tax base. My opponents list includes officials who loaded down businesses with burdensome fees and regulations that became job and business killers.\n\nI will always bring integrity and independency to the District 3 Commission seat. I am not a “yes” man for special interest. That does not mean I do not get along with people. For me what that means is quite the opposite, it means I come to my own conclusions based on what is in the best for the entire community, not just one little group. I am someone that ask a lot of questions and researches the issues. I do not rubber stamp items that comes across the commission just because I am being pressured. I am known to stand up to special interest groups, working hard for the people, and not bowing down to individuals with influence.\n\nI would encourage you to visit my website to read the extensive list of my accomplishments and initiatives. Over my term I have been working hard to protect our community. To name just a few areas:\n\n1. I played an instrumental part in selling Vero Electric saving our residents and businesses. Each and every day local rate payers now save $54,000 or $20 million on their local electric bills.\n\n2. The Indian River Lagoon Council was formed but Indian River County was not a voting member. I brought forward three separate vote attempts to secure Indian River County as a voting member before final successful. (The Indian River Lagoon Council is responsible to develop and implement the IRLNEP Lagoon National Estuary Plan. This plan is the roadmap to help recover and restore the Lagoon.)\n\n3. The Bethel Creek Flushing study has been a goal of mine prior to being elected. After years of effort and community support the state approved funding to FIT Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne to conduct the Phase I of the study. Preliminary results are back, and they are very encouraging. Phase II of the flushing study was recently approved by Governor DeSantis in the state budget.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy? If yes, please explain:\n\nYes. As we are seeing in the current market not all economic downturns can be forecasted. As a general contractor during the beginning of the housing depression my partners and I had in hand signed customer contracts with deposits on a multitude of homes valuing in the millions of dollars. The clients walked away from their obligation to close and left us with carrying the burden of the construction finance loans. These experiences have made me a wiser better commissioner because I have walked in the shoes of the business owners that are struggling under the current market conditions.\n\nLink to campaign website or social media page:\n\nwww.TimZorc2020.com\n\nCounty Commission, District 5\n\n2016 Editorial Board recommendation\n\n2020 Editorial Board Recommendation\n\nVideo: TCPalm editorial board interview\n\nVideo: Taxpayers Association of Indian River County Commission Forum\n\nBob Auwaerter , Indian River Shores\n\nAge: 64\n\nEducational background:\n\nBachelors in Finance--Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, MBA from Northwestern University\n\nCurrent occupation and work history:\n\nVice Mayor--Town of Indian River Shores (current)\n\nHead of the Fixed Income Group--Vanguard Group (managed a global investment team of 125 persons responsible for the investment of $750 Billion of bond and money market assets) 2003-2014\n\nSenior Portfolio Manager--Vanguard Group (managed a variety of money market and bond funds investing in Treasury, corporate, sovereign, and municipal bonds) 1981-2003\n\nPortfolio Manager--Continental Illinois National Bank (managed a money market fund) 1978-1981\n\nVolunteer and civic engagement:\n\nChairman of the Indian River County Metropolitan Planning Commission\n\nChairman of the Indian River County School District School Board Audit Committee\n\nChairman/Vice Chairman of the City of Vero Beach Utilities Commission\n\nVice Chairman of the Indian River County Property Appraiser Citizens Audit Advisory Committee\n\nCounty Representative to the Treasure Coast Regional Planning Council\n\nRotary Club of Vero Beach\n\nBike/Walk IRC\n\nWhy are you running for office?\n\nFrom the moment when Nancy, my wife of 42 years, and I made Indian River County our home, we found a welcoming community. I asked myself how I could give back to my fellow citizens to make it an even better place to live. I realized that local government has an enormous impact on our lives, much more so than the state and Federal governments that get all the press. I decided to take the knowledge that I had acquired working 36 years in the investment management business, especially municipal finance, to help government provide its services more effectively and cost-efficiently. It is easy to sit on the sidelines and complain. It is a lot more work to roll up one’s sleeves and be part of the solution. As you can see from my list of community involvement and accomplishments in local governments (all without any compensation) I have taken the hard work route. I believe that, when possible, conduct analysis using hard numbers and facts. One of the most powerful things you can take into a government meeting is a spreadsheet.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nTop initial priority is to deal with the impact of the pandemic on the County’s people, economy, and government finances. It is unlikely over the near term that there will be a miracle cure that will reverse its effects or an effective vaccine (I hope that I am wrong on these points) so what steps should the County be taking in conjunction with the medical community and other experts to protect our citizens and get our economy going again. Economic hardship is a major component of this disease that has to be addressed. The County’s finances have been impacted by the sharp dropoff in sales tax revenues and tourist tax revenues. In addition, it is likely that aid from the State and Federal governments will decline. The question is how temporary is this. This situation will have to be analyzed very carefully.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nThree things distinguish me from my opponents in this race--my skill set, work ethic, and a record of accomplishment. The financial analysis skills that I have acquired in my 36 years of managing hundreds of Billions of dollars of other people's money give me a leg up in ensuring that the taxpayer's money is used efficiently to deliver government's essential services. I have a very strong work ethic as can be seen by all the government boards and commissions that I have served on. Government officials reach out to me to serve on those boards, and I do so willingly to make the County a better place to live. Importantly, I have done this government service while receiving ZERO compensation.\n\nFinally, I have a record of getting things accomplished. The Indian River Taxpayers Association gave me their \"Fiscal Conservative of the Year\" award in 2018 \"in recognition of your efforts to save taxpayer dollars for all citizens of Indian River County.\" Three examples of accomplishments: #1--As Councilman on the Town of Indian River Shores Council I proposed the sale of Town owned surplus property ($4.6 MM sales price). I persuaded Council to use the money to fully fund the Public Safety Pension Fund and the Other Post- Employment Benefit (OPEB) Fund (which funds future retiree healthcare benefits) rather than do a one-time tax cut as another Councilman wanted. Results: Pension Fund as of the close of the Fiscal Year 2019 was 107% funded and the OPEB Trust was 142% funded. We were able to reduce the Town's ongoing contributions to these two Funds resulting in a cut of the Town's property tax millage rate by 19%. #2--I served as Chairman of the Indian River County School District School Board Audit Committee. Based on information I gathered regarding School Board attorney compensation in other counties, we recommended that the School Board attorney contract (which currently pays $264,000 a year plus expenses) be put out to bid to see if we could save the School District money to use to teach students. That is occurring now. #3--I proposed ways to FDOT to speed hurricane evacuation westbound on State Route 60 near the Florida Turnpike that is now being implemented.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

I raised my family here, started a business over 36 years ago and feel it is time to give back to the community. My adult children reside in Indian River County, run businesses, and now they are raising their children (my grandchildren) in the county. Based on my 36 years of living and working on the Treasure Coast, I’ve had the opportunity to work with numerous governmental agencies, cities, and counties while studying the area growth. This provides me a unique perspective on what needs to be achieved to maintain the quality-of-life in Indian River County. My goal is to help guide the county in the direction that will maintain and improve the quality of life that we currently enjoy for the future generations to come.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\n1) Institute programs to help clean up the Indian River Lagoon. Two important programs include water storage to clean runoff and septic tank conversion.\n\n2) Growth is inevitable. Therefore, it is necessary to control the growth for the protection of the citizens and the environment. Every decision that I make will be based on how it will impact the safety of the citizens and the environment.\n\n3) Institute and support programs to help bring and keep quality jobs to Indian River County. I would support the Chamber of Commerce, support businesses that want to expand and/or relocate here through tax incentives, reduction of impact fees and by streamlining existing programs that are currently making it too difficult for a business to qualify.\n\n4) Support local business by making sure that when a local business bids on a county contract that they are given preference over out of county businesses. I would work to keep taxes low so businesses can afford to stay in the county.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nI have resided and worked on the Treasure Coast for 36+ years and raised my family here. I am 100% invested in our county. I own multiple properties in Indian River County. My children live here and have businesses in the county.\n\nI have a very diversified business background. In conjunction with running my business, I have worked with the Florida Department of Transportation, South Florida and Saint Johns River Water Management Districts, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the Florida Inland Navigation District, the Federal Aviation Administration, Florida Communities Trust, the Indian River Land Trust, and the US Fish and Wildlife Services plus most all of the local city and county governments.\n\nI am not a politician and have never run for or a held a political office.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

Being Mayor and holding local elected office is the best job of my life. Coming in first in the 2016 general election for Vero Beach City Council then first again in the general election of 2018 is a great honor. I thank each and every individual who took the time to make his/her will known. You gave me a mandate and the confidence that comes with it. I never forget that all power comes from you.\n\nSince 2016, when I became the first woman ever to start her City Council term as Mayor in the 100-year history of Vero Beach, I proudly have worn my official name badge everyday everywhere I go. This simple act has served to encourage people to speak with me anytime anywhere about anything on their minds. It keeps me in-touch with their hopes and dreams, as well as their fears and concerns, for our community.\n\nPeople can come away from me with the knowledge that they have direct access to local government. That their thoughts and feelings are important and will be considered in the decision-making process. It is not a one-time event; it is the start of a relationship. I invite them to contact me at any time. I view local government and my role in it as a partnership with the People. A sacred trust. There should be no rulers from on-high. A grassroots leader in touch with the People is more important than ever today. I delight in people. I relish problem-solving. I am blessed with the grit to drill deeply into the necessary data then hold a position based upon it, and the grace to build the partnerships that advance those positions for the benefit of all. For that combination of grit and grace, I thank my parents.\n\nMy late-parents lived in the Vero Beach Highlands. My father served elected terms as President and as Treasurer of the Vero Beach Highlands Property Owners Association. And he called the letters at their bingo! Yes, he loved people. As do I. My mother served as a volunteer for the Indian River Memorial Hospital Auxiliary at their thrift shop for twenty years. I’m proud of their service to our community and thankful for the fine example they set. They loved Vero. My only regret is that they did not live to see me as Mayor.\n\nThe sale of Vero Electric to FPL is an example of “grit and grace”.\n\nExcerpts from Standard + Poor’s Global Market Intelligence about my role in the electric sale:\n\n“But how were the parties able to orchestrate Vero Beach’s exit from the Florida Municipal Power Agency (FMPA), a challenge that had for decades derailed prior attempts at reaching a deal? A key to facilitating negotiations was that the city and the agency both saw leadership changes in 2016.\n\nVero Beach elected Laura Moss mayor with a mandate to effect a sale of its utility, an issue with which she was familiar from her time on the city’s Utilities Commission. Moss and Williams (CEO, FMPA) said they decided at the outset of talks to view each other as partners, not adversaries. Both Williams and Moss spoke of how they wanted to clear things up, both substantively and stylistically. ‘You make progress by having good communication and good will’, Moss said. With fresh perspectives and a collaborative approach, the parties reached a rapid resolution.”\n\nNote: Full article, “How FPL-Vero Deal went from “War” to “Godsend”, reprinted with permission of Standard + Poor’s Global Market Intelligence at votelauramoss.com\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nLeadership with grit and grace.\n\nBuild good working relationships and new partnerships between the County Commission and the County’s people, municipalities, businesses, non-profits, and churches, in order to enhance and protect our sense of community and the natural beauty of this place.\n\nGood working relationships and new partnerships can provide a solid foundation for fresh perspectives and a collaborative approach to resolving problems, even long-standing ones.\n\nSee my response to the previous question for an example, the sale of Vero Electric to FPL. Visit votelauramoss.com for the S+P Global Market Intelligence article, “How FPL-Vero Deal went from “War” to “Godsend” describing it.\n\nBudgets will change and new issues may arise in the next four years. Issues currently facing us include our safety/security as related to the threat of COVID, our aging infrastructure, our economic growth, our viability as a home to our hardworking middle-class, our environmental health, our children, our homeless and less fortunate, and other important matters such as negotiating optimal safety measures with regard to the high-speed trains that are expected to travel through our County.\n\nLawsuits should be a last resort. Legal bills are the worst case scenario. Exhaust diplomacy before you empty the taxpayers’ wallets. The County’s current history with regard to lawsuits is disappointing, to say the least. For example, total budgeted legal expenses to-date expended to stop the Train are $3,979,421. The Train still is coming. Meanwhile, according to the Affordable Housing Resolution passed jointly by the South Florida and Treasure Coast Regional Planning Councils last October, 51% of Indian River County is ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) and that money spent on losing lawsuits could have gone a long way toward solving their problems or addressing any of the issues cited above.\n\nBefore I became Mayor, $335,038 was spent on lawsuits (2013-2016) on the the sale of Vero electric, yet the six parties (Indian River County, Vero Beach, Indian River Shores, FPL, Orlando Utilities Commission, and FMPA) were refusing even to speak with each other by phone when I came onboard. The ill will seemed insurmountable, and probably would have been without the change in leadership that occurred in 2016 when I became Mayor and Mr. Jacob Williams assumed control of FMPA. The year I was Mayor, the County’s legal bill dropped to $880.\n\nNote: Source for all expenditures is ircgov.com. See votelauramoss.com for reprint of S+P Global Market Intelligence article, “How FPL-Vero Deal went from “War” to “Godsend”.\n\nWhen I became the first civilian elected to the Board of Directors of Veterans Council, Chairman Martin Zickert said, \"As an organization, we are seeking to diversify our board with members who reach out to the community in new ways and create new partnerships. Laura Moss is well-known for her ability to do this. We are pleased to have her aboard. \"\n\nWe are one community. Several specific matters ripe for City/County cooperation are:\n\n1) Vero Beach Regional Airport; creation of a port authority, perhaps?\n\n2) Leisure Square Pool; an interlocal agreement, perhaps?\n\n3) Use of Tourist Tax for a lifeguard command center at Humiston Beach Park. This is a public safety issue. Vero Beach Lifeguard Association reports that beach attendance in May 2020 broke the previous year’s record with visitors.\n\n4) Sebastian Annexation. The County could have facilitated better communication among the parties perhaps avoiding the lawsuit and some of the turmoil that ensued.\n\nImprovements in any of the above enhance the quality of life for many residents of the County.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nLeadership.\n\nBeing Mayor.\n\nEven better, the only woman to start City Council as Mayor in the 100-year history of Vero Beach.\n\nThe first civilian to be elected to the Board of Directors of Veterans Council of Indian River County.\n\nProven experience. Accomplishing the will of the People.\n\nI started as Mayor on 11/21/2016, and I signed the contract for the electric sale on 10/24/2017.\n\nFor details, see “How FPL-Vero Deal went from “War” to “Godsend”, reprinted with permission of Standard + Poor’s Global Market Intelligence at votelauramoss.com.\n\nLove of the People.\n\nListen to them.

Separate sources and unknown to me until now. They have been following my actions in the community over a period of time and requested to be a part of my life as Vice Mayor and candidate for County Commission to learn from me. Both are interested in Political Science. Each is a delight to me.\n\nAlready have run for a countywide office and established contacts throughout the county.\n\nIn 2014, I received 19,147 (46%) of the vote for Hospital District, Seat 2. My first race and close enough to whet my appetite for more. Very exciting and it gave me an opportunity to meet all kinds of people around the County and to make friends I still hold dear today.

We can break the norms that are holding us back and be a fantastic district with innovative thinking. Since May of 2019, the SDIRC has been heading in a new direction and it is extremely exciting to be a part of creating the change. Now under new district leadership we are on our way to being the top 10 school districts in the state.\n\nI spent my first three years on the School Board challenging the status quo, questioning the budget, and bringing the issues to the forefront concerning the mismanagement occurring behind the scenes.\n\nDuring my short amount of time in office my education and career experience has been a critical asset to the Indian River County School Board. I understand the mechanisms that create a well- functioning school district. I understand that sound management and astute financial decision-making drives any organization. I have worked diligently to put every dollar available into the classroom and student services by identifying wasteful spending in the budget.\n\nIn my term I have made tough decisive decisions to advocate for fiscal responsible budgets, strategies, plans, implementing processes and protocols, retaining and recruiting stellar employees because it takes all these areas working together in tandem in order to focus on closing the achievement gap and produce the outcomes our students deserve.\n\nI want to keep the momentum going because we have come too far as a district in the last year to go back to the ways of the past that did not work.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nRight now, my attention is focused on the Re-Opening of the schools for the 2020-21 school year. The district team has invested a significant amount of time problem solving and planning around the return of students in August. All our planning involves a variety of options to accommodate and ensure we provide safe options for students, families, and staff according to their needs. In addition, we need to ensure that we have all the supports in place to provide meaningful learning in all scenarios as we navigate through the 2020-2021 school year.\n\nThis is a monumental task. Providing a variety of options for 16,000 students and 2150 employees takes a great deal of understanding of organizational management and strategic budgeting to cover the additional cost.\n\nAlso, on the horizon is the projected 10-20% reduction in state revenues for the 2021-2022 budget year. We have to start preparing now for additional areas of efficiencies in operations in order to mitigate the projected loss in revenues.\n\nWe are in unprecedented times, but I am confident with the talent we have within the school district that we get through these challenging times as we continue on our new path of transformational change, with the new Superintendent.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race? *\n\nCurrently serving on the School Board with me are three lifelong educators: two former principals and one university professor. The District 5 seat is to be decided in August.\n\nMy background balances the five-member board by bringing a diversity of education, knowledge, and experiences. With any well-functioning School Board, it takes more than just the background in education to transform a district. It is also going to take tough knowledgeable budget decision making and asking the right questions to challenge the status quo.\n\nAdditionally, we need to keep a balance in maintaining the parents voice on the board. When re-appointed in November besides me there will only be one other board member with an enrolled public-school student. I have two children currently in high school, a son starting middle school, two grandchildren in elementary school and my oldest daughter is a 2011 graduate.\n\nAs a School Board member, I have the unique experience of 22 continuous years of having a child in the school system! Moreover, as the parent of children of such diverse ages, from the boardroom to the classroom I have a professional and personal understanding of the impact of School Board decisions regarding policy, curriculum, budget, and special programs.\n\nLong before running for the School Board in 2016, I showed that I cared about the children, parents, and community through countless volunteer hours as an education advocate on the local and state level. With grace and determination, I have proven that when it comes to our kids, I have high expectations.\n\nI began my journey as an education advocate because as a parent I was not satisfied with the quality of education being provided to my own children. And, now as a Board Member I am not only a voice for my own children but an advocate for all children in Indian River County to receive a quality world class 21st century education.\n\nI have high expectations for all IRC students, and I will continue to advocate for policies and initiatives that are in the best interests of our diverse student body—among them\n\n* Enhance Vocational/Certification training programs for Middle and High School Students.\n\n* Increase Dual high school enrollment at Indian River State College.\n\n* Expansion of school choice opportunities.\n\n* Intensify measures to improve literacy scores.\n\n* Closing the achievement gap for all students.\n\n* Continue to identify opportunities to improve campus safety and security.\n\n* Support initiatives that puts struggling students on a healthy pathway through positive social and\n\nemotional skills.\n\n* Support initiatives to improve recruitment and retention of a High-Quality Workforce.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

I spent 33 years in financial services holding executive management positions at Merrill Lynch and PaineWebber. I was the managing principal of a LLP that purchased and developed a 150,000 sq. foot indoor entertainment center in NJ. I was CEO of a technology company then became President of Babson College and served from 2001-2008. I chaired either the Finance committee or Audit Committee of Blue Cross Blue Shield of MA over an 11 year span until retiring but continue as a member of its Investment Committee. I am a director of both a bank and a blockchain technology company in Boston and serve as a senior advisor to a middle market investment bank in NYC and two VC/PE firms, one of which is in Vero Beach.\n\nVolunteer and civic engagement:\n\nIn Indian River County I was a Trustee of St. Edwards School (Advancement Committee Chair) for 6 years and am currently a Vice Chair of Indian River Medical Center (Audit Chair)/Cleveland Clinic Indian River Hospital Foundation. I was twice elected Mayor of Indian River Shores and served from 2013-2018. I have served over 40 years on the boards of 4 educational institutions as a Trustee, Trustee/Treasurer and Board Chair (Babson College) located in Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Vermont. As a result I have a deep understanding of the mission of educational institutions and their finances. I also currently serve as a Trustee of Southwestern Vermont Medical Center.\n\nWhy are you running for office?\n\nArne Duncan, US Education Secretary from 2009-2015, in a speech given on MLK Day in 2011 stated that \"education is the civil rights issue of our generation\" and I believe it continues to be. I have been committed to education for many years and to think the IRC public schools rank toward the bottom in the state is unacceptable. Given my experience in education and demonstrated leadership ability throughout my career, I would work with the new Superintendent and other school board members to improve outcomes for all students and help the Superintendent achieve his vision of all A schools by 2025. A top ranked school system along with the top ranked health system in the world at work in our community should bode very well for the future of IRC.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nHaving transparent finances and helping to allocate resources to areas in the school district where taxpayers can get the highest return. This would include teacher salaries, technology as a tool to enhance learning and many other resources to close the achievement gap for all students, but especially African American students. Allocation to ESE students and their needs must also be addressed. Additionally, doing whatever small part I can play to eliminate the desegregation order if it has not already been removed.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nI have experience in finance, education and overall leadership that is an unusual combination that would compliment the experience of the existing board members. I do not believe my opponent's qualifications can compare to mine. I have a proven track record of accomplishment in both the public and private sector and if elected, will bring that same mindset and commitment to the school board and the community.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

I’ve been actively involved with the community for the past 12 years. I am a mother of 2 children who attended 5 IRC schools: both public and charter. I’ve been a volunteer in the classroom for 10 years. I know firsthand the issues, expectations and concerns that we face here. Also being a small business owner I will use my financial experience to make fiscally responsible decisions. I will utilize my financial background to effectively put your tax dollars to work.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nFirst and foremost I believe in improving academic achievement. Few years go most of our schools were A & B. This is not a case now. We need to provide a setting where each student can achieve his/her potential. Empower them to build self-esteem and set them up for success. I am a strong supporter for vocational school where they can learn trade and give students an alternative to college path. Other issues are: restoring communication with parents to ensure more parental involvement. We need to work as a team and restore the relationships with parents and teachers; mental health of our students; health safety.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nI am a full-time resident here. My husband and I raised our kids here. We know IRC, we know this community we have been actively involved with for the past 15 years. Our children went through 5 IRC schools. I have been an ACTIVE volunteer in the classroom for 10 years. I have degrees in Education and was a teacher. I am a healthcare worker. Have the knowledge on infection control and will use it to ensure the safety of our children when we are ready to open the schools in August.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

I was blessed to be hired as a Deputy Sheriff to protect our county. All of my immediate family and my wife’s family live here. I know how special Indian River County is to me, and I am running to be your Sheriff to ensure that Indian River County will continue to be that special place for my son and generations to come. Our county founders had the foresight to establish building codes and other regulations to keep our little paradise different from other places. It is my goal to honor their legacy by protecting our community, to keep us from becoming South Florida or overrun like other counties. Along my career path, I had employment opportunities at the federal level, but declined those offers knowing I would one day be in a position to run to be your Sheriff. I am committed to our community, committed to protecting your family and mine, and dedicated to the future of the Indian River County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain *\n\nMy goal when I take office is to set a vision for 2030. Having turned 40 this year, I plan to be your Sheriff for years to come. This is a career for me, not a retirement job. By establishing a ten year plan for our agency, we will immediately begin to think about the next generation of criminals we will face and how to combat them. How do we get from our current staffing, equipment, and technological position to where we will need to be in 2030, while also being fiscally responsible and accountable to the tax payers? By establishing a clear cut plan that includes timely upgrades such as body worn cameras, mental health professionals to assist with those in crisis, and leveraging technology against 21st century criminals, we will immediately start budgeting and preparing for the future. Law enforcement is all about being prepared for the unknown. As we improve our skills, technology, and assets, the community will benefit by having the best trained and equipped law enforcement now and in the future.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nI began my journey in law enforcement 17 years ago when Sheriff Roy Raymond hired me as a Deputy at the Indian River County Sheriff’s Office. My institutional knowledge, interactions with agency members throughout my career, and trusted relationships are just one aspect that separate me from others. EXPERIENCE - As a member of the Executive Command Staff, I have been on the front lines of major projects and ongoing operations. I am regularly briefed on the progress of jail renovations, facility improvements, long term plans, technology upgrades, and more. I am the only candidate that can start on day one without having to learn these operational necessities. I know the names, I know the players, and I know how to create immediate, meaningful change and improvements the first day I am your Sheriff. Additionally, I have been part of the budget process and know areas we can make further cuts to squeeze every taxpayer dollar. As a fiscal conservative and tax payer, I know that other tax payers want to know that their government officials are spending those hard earned dollars wisely. I promise to always have the tax payer in mind when making financial decisions. EDUCATION - I have pursued education throughout my entire career, having starting with only some college. I obtained my Associate’s degree during my first year, eventually obtaining my Bachelor and Masters degrees all while also working full time. As a PhD Candidate and graduate of the FBI National Academy, Leadership Florida, and Leadership Indian River, I feel my education further distinguishes me from others. ENERGY - At 40 years old, I am in the prime of my career. Being Sheriff is a 24/7 lifestyle. I have been living that life for years now and am committed to being available for our agency members and community. In today’s law enforcement climate, the 11th Sheriff of Indian River County will need unstoppable energy to make meaningful connections with the community, motivate and encourage personnel, while also making good fiscal decisions for the tax payer. I am the only candidate with the dedication and drive necessary, which I have shown throughout my education and career.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

Explain:\n\n1. Restore Public Trust\n\nI will shift the focus of our policies and practices to prioritize the sanctity of human life while implementing strategies that do not result in racial disparities.\n\n2. Improve Public Safety\n\nI will take a data-driven approach to focus resources where they will best achieve our defined core missions: to protect our community, prevent crimes and solve problems.\n\nI will attract and retain the best and brightest employees by establishing a competitive step-pay plan; and a fair, consistent process for promotions and selections to return the Sheriff's Office to the list of \"Best Places to Work” in Indian River County.\n\nI will cut the current command staff by half eliminating the ranks of Major and Captain. Fewer redundant layers will empower our (sworn and civilian) first line supervisors and mid-managers with greater decision making authority and responsibility.\n\n3. Provide Transparency\n\nI will transform the Indian River County Sheriff’s Office into a model agency that will follow best practices for the handling of public records requests.\n\nI will provide a complete picture of how all tax dollars are spent, curtail year-end spending surges and return unused funds to the taxpayers.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nExperience – Experience - Experience\n\nAlong with traditional patrol, investigative and traffic duties, as Sheriff you are responsible for the safety and security of the jail; executes writs, process and warrants for the courts; provide county-wide 911 dispatch; and are designated as the lead law enforcement agency under our county’s comprehensive emergency management plan.\n\nI am the lone candidate in this race who holds dual certifications in corrections as well as law enforcement with the operational experience to be Indian River County’s next great Sheriff.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

Crime is high, transparency is nonexistent, and in my opinion, too many people have sold out to a powerful few who have too much influence on the agency. The organization culture at the command level has decayed. These issues erode public confidence and create a dangerous culture which breeds corruption. Fixing dysfunctional agencies is what I do. The leadership of the Sheriff's Office needs to be directed into the 21st century with national best practices. The rank and file are not an issue. They simply need responsible, very experienced leadership.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nGoal #1: Address the growing concern related to disparate treatment of the minority community.\n\n• Create and implement an early warning system to uncover potential discriminatory behavior in police patrol practices.\n\n• Create a substantive Community Affairs Unit, with rank, to solve real-life problems in the community, not just secure votes for the next Sheriff’s election.\n\n• Implement and manage a realistic and effective Offender Reentry program.\n\nGoal # 2: Make the leadership of the Sheriff’s Office accountable to the public\n\n• Release all public records in accordance with the law.\n\n• Never again pay an attorney taxpayer money to avoid releasing records which may be embarrassing to the agency.\n\n• Increase the number of upper-level managers who are direct reports to the Sheriff in order to hold management accountable for the actions of the rank and file deputies, rather than continue to erode the morale of the rank and file by blaming them for everything.\n\nGoal #3: Repair the relationship between the Sheriff and the bargaining association\n\n• Reopen the unfair contract.\n\n• Allow the union to recommend the shift of their choice.\n\n• Install a fair step plan.\n\n• Create a reasonable pay scale.\n\n• Give unprecedented policy making power to the deputies.\n\nGoal #4: Stop the opioid crisis in its tracks\n\n• Immediately implement the DITEP program in the schools.\n\n• Completely reorganize the narcotics enforcement efforts by doubling the use of undercover narcotics operatives.\n\nGoal #5: Reduce the burglaries in the county\n\n• Utilize a Management Accountability Program to hold all leaders accountable for reducing the number of burglaries and increasing the closure rate.\n\n• Increase staffing in both patrol and investigations.\n\n• Implement an Intelligence-led Policing model which is more effective than the current model.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nExperience and qualifications. In most aspects of law enforcement, the other three candidates combined do not have the experience or qualifications I have. Here is a very brief overview of experience and qualifications which no other candidate has:\n\n-Thirty-eight years of public safety and investigative experience\n\n-Chief executive in three different municipal agencies\n\n-Policy advisor and Strategic Initiatives Officer for a 3000 member agency\n\n-Two Master's degrees, and currently over halfway through my Doctorate\n\n-Created a COMPSTAT-based anti-crime accountability program for a large organization\n\n-Created the first draft of a State Homeland Security Strategy\n\n-Created and taught police and homeland security curriculum at the graduate level\n\n-Created complex initiatives designed to identify discriminatory police patrol practices\n\n-Created antiterrorism plans for a major NFL Stadium\n\n-Managed large, complex public safety agency budgets\n\n-Led and managed in excess of 250 officers\n\n-Led and managed in excess of 200 officers in Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts\n\n-Written and implemented multiple strategic plans\n\n-Published author and staff writer for a national Law Enforcement magazine\n\n-Assisted in the creation of a national best practice offender reentry manual for the IACP\n\n-Served 32 years in the Marine Corps and the Army, retiring in November 2019\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

Prior to that I spent nearly 25 years with the Vero Beach Police Department. I left there as a captain and second in command to become the chief in Fellsmere. I have served in uniform patrol, K9, SWAT, criminal investigations, and held supervisory and command level positions in both operation and support roles. I am adjunct faculty at the Florida Institute of Technology where I serve as the primary ethics instructor for their online criminal justice degree program. I am the primary ethics instructor at the Indian River State College criminal justice leader program and I teach ethics in several program hosted by the Florida Police Chiefs Association and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. I am a veteran of the Marine Corps and Army Reserve.\n\nVolunteer and civic engagement:\n\nMember of the Florida Police Chiefs Association (FPCA). Member of the FPCA Legislative Committee. Member and past Chairman of the FPCA Professional Standards Committee. Member and past President of the Treasure Coast Chiefs of Police and Sheriffs Association. Chairman of the FDLE Region XI Training Council at IRSC. Member and past chairman of the Executive Roundtable of Indian River County.

Member of the Moonshot Community Action Network (MCAN). Member of the Fellsmere Exchange Club. Mentor, Big Brothers and Big Sisters of St. Lucie and Indian River Counties.\n\nWhy are you running for office?\n\nI am running for sheriff because I have a vision for policing in Indian River County that involves greater collaboration with the community; collaboration based on the premise that crime is a social problem and all of us must work together if we are to reduce crime and enhance our quality of life. I am also running to address the dysfunctional organizational culture at the sheriffs office brought about by a leadership style that values personal loyalty over talent and ability. A style that does not adequately address salary discrepancies or make opportunities available to all members in a fair, impartial, and consistent manner. This leadership style has driven away numerous quality people and resulted in low morale and poor service. Many in the community have lost respect for, and trust in our sheriffs office.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nTo address the many challenges facing our community and the law enforcement profession as a whole. COVID-19, criminal justice reform, and the threat of terrorism top the list, but we must also remain focused on the many issues that continue to require our attention: crime, drugs, traffic concerns, mental health, and an increasing homeless population. These are all top priorities but they cannot be adequately addressed until we fix the leadership and accountability issues that contribute to the loss of quality personnel and the loss of public trust.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nI am the chief executive law enforcement officer of a police department with 31 years of law enforcement experience in Indian River County. I have long established relationships with many people through my work and professional affiliations and have a history of getting the job done. I offer a vision for policing in Indian River County based on an award winning philosophy initiated when I became the police chief in Fellsmere. That vision is also the product of citizen input obtained during twelve town hall meetings conducted since June 2019. As a result of my 31 years of service to this community, my knowledge of the issues currently plaguing our sheriffs office and citizen input, I am convinced that our sheriffs office needs an experienced leader with a proven track record for success at the executive level; one who recognizes the greatest threats to our safety, understands the need to collaborate, and has the skills and ability to bring a diverse population together to focus on the vision: reducing crime and enhancing our quality of life while we restore public trust. I am that leader\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

For example: the newly opened beach office that is not even equipped to issue a driver‘s license. It has been closed since March (not even a year after opening) and taxpayers are on the hook for about $6k monthly to cover the rent,utilities, etc., why was this new office even considered when proper research had not even been completed, such as the cost of fiber optics. $24,000 Annually at $2,000 monthly being spent to be on the radio to advertise the office. Excessive salary increases for perceived loyalty - the executive assistant received almost a $20,000 increase in salary last year and is currently making $87,769 annually! This is a government office!\n\nI will bring much needed transparency, accountability, ethical leadership and fiscal responsibility to the office.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nEmployee retention, sensitivity training, performance based reviews, increases based on merit based performance and mentoring for succession in critical positions. In the 11 years of the current administration, 106 employees have left the office. The 2019/2020 budget reflects 68 positions. The current Tax Collector was appointed to office in 2009 with a staff of 46. I was employee #61 to leave in 2016, that means 45 more employees have left in 3 1/2 years! It takes an average of $8,000 to fully train an employee, that equates to $848,000 in lost taxpayer dollars! Two separate employee leasing companies (one in Tallahassee???) are being used. The Tallahassee firm is being used to manage the retiring employees that are being brought back as independent contractors! This should not be happening! Mentoring and promoting from entry level not only creates a positive work environment, it ensures the institutional knowledge is being passed on to secure a solid and sound succession plan of key positions.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nEthics. I am not a career politician and have no desire to climb the political ladder in Tallahassee. I am deeply involved in our community through civic and non-profit organizations. I have 14 years of hands on executive level experience at the Tax Collector’s office combined with 22 years of banking experience. I believe that experience far exceeds the 11 years the current Tax Collector has been on the job. I do not look at this job as a lifetime position. I do believe in term limits! Because of my operational and customer service skills; as the Chief of Staff for 5 of the 7 years working for the current tax collector, I played an instrumental role in the implementation of many policy and procedures that currently exist in the Tax Collector’s office. I am deeply rooted in our community and believe that giving personally of my time, talent and treasure is just important as being paid professionally in our local offices.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

She worked in the male-dominated aviation industry until moving to Vero Beach with her family to become a small businesswoman. In 1973, she and her husband, Bill, founded Jordan Sprinkler Systems, Inc., an irrigation company serving Vero Beach. Shortly thereafter, Jordan took over the day-to-day business operations, including oversight of customer service, financial management, and employee relations. Today, the company is serving the Treasure Coast under the management of their son, Billy.\n\nJordan overcame numerous challenges while developing her business, including balancing the demands of business ownership and motherhood while learning management skills on the job, working within ever-changing local and state regulations, and actively overseeing job sites before women’s presence in construction became more commonly accepted. Jordan’s commitment to superb customer service, constant networking, and frequently adding innovative services were major factors in growing Jordan Sprinkler Systems to its current success.\n\nJordan transferred her experience and management skills from the corporate world to the political arena. Elected Chairman of the Republican Party of Florida in 2003, she reshaped the organization by implementing contemporary business-based practices in an effort to foster efficiency, better organization, positive public relations, and develop sound fiscal policy. Under her leadership, the Party eliminated nearly three million dollars in debt, as well as entirely satisfying the mortgage on the George H.W. Bush Republican Center in Tallahassee, Florida, and instituted sensible financial procedures to administer the millions of dollars raised and expended on behalf of its candidates. In 2003, she chartered the Florida Federation of Black Republicans, the first statewide black Republican organization. President George W. Bush was re-elected during her chairmanship in 2004 by nearly 400,000 votes statewide. Additionally, Florida was one of only three states to elect a Republican to the open gubernatorial seat in 2006. The success of her leadership was quickly recognized, which led to her election as the Chairman of the Republican National Committee’s Council of State Chairmen.\n\nIn 2005, Jordan was appointed to the President’s Commission on White House Fellowships, a program that offers young men and women first hand experience working at the highest levels of the Federal government. As a Commissioner, she worked side-by-side with her colleagues to guide this highly competitive process to select the White House Fellows from the exceptional group of national finalists.\n\nCarole Jean Jordan was appointed by the President to serve as a member of the National Women’s Business Council in 2007. The NWBC serves as an advisory board to the White House, the Congress, and the Small Business Administration on issues pertinent to women business owners.\n\nJordan has served on several international delegations, including trips to Russia, Taiwan and Hong Kong. In addition, she has appeared on MSNBC, CNN, NBC, FOX and scores of other national and international radio and television stations.\n\nCarole Jean Jordan currently serves as Tax Collector of Indian River County. She was elected in November 2008 and is the first woman to hold this constitutional office.\n\nVolunteer and civic engagement:\n\nCity of Vero Beach Airport Commission, Board Member\n\nDaughters of the American Revolution\n\nFlorida Tax Collector's Association, former Legislative Chair and former Concealed Weapons License Chair\n\nFlorida Friend of the Taxpayer Award, Recipient, awarded by then State Senator Bill Posey\n\nKids Tag Art - Indian River, Inc., Founding Member\n\nLive Like Cole, Founding Member and Current Ambassador\n\nMaggie's List, Founding Member\n\nNational Women's Business Council, Chairperson/Presidential Appointee\n\nOrder of the Eastern Star\n\nPresident's Commission of White House Fellowships, Member\n\nQuality Floridian Award, Recipient, awarded by Congress Bill Posey (FL-8)\n\nWhy are you running for office?\n\nI am running because we are on a positive path, on which we need to continue. We have made significant improvements as our office focused on adaptability, convenience, and efficiency. Upon taking office as Tax Collector, the leadership team and staff shifted to a “how may we help you?” service model.\n\nFor our team, adaptability is central to almost everything we do. Adaptability in the Tax Collector’s Office is needed to achieve a high tech/low tech balance depending on the customer’s interest and resources, offering new services or localizing services that residents desire to be within easy reach, mobility-related concerns, and most recently adjustments in response to state guidance related to COVID-19. Accelerating the use and functionality of technology in the office was critical. From the moment people awaken, their day is filled with smartphones, TVs, tablets, and computers. As people became more comfortable with transacting government business over their devices, we adapted to ensure we were well-positioned to accommodate that. On the other side of the coin, we have maintained traditional options for people not comfortable with higher tech processes. Our leadership team has worked together to strike a good balance between these two preferences. Bringing national programs to the local community has received positive feedback and a good amount of use. For example, in the almost three years we have served as a TSA Pre-Check application acceptance agent, we have processed nearly 6,000 applications. Mobility issues can stem from physical or medical situations or from lack of access to reliable transportation. We have received positive feedback from individuals stating that being able to conduct business on our website or through the drive-thru lanes has greatly aided in alleviating some of these struggles when conducting business.\n\nConvenience is a key to creating a positive customer interaction. We amplified the convenience of Tax Collector Office services in multiple ways. First, we absorbed the state-run DMV local office. This process was one step toward our creation of a one-stop shop for obtaining local government services. Second, we created additional customer service positions to serve more individuals simultaneously – and we were able to do this while still returning over $31 million to Indian River County. Third, we added a fourth office at the Oceanside County Complex. This location did two things: reduced wait times at the Main Office by removing the need for beach residents to come to the County Administration Building and gave our easternmost residents and businesses a closer location for service. We expect to announce the addition of driver license services to the beach office in the coming weeks. Lastly, we implemented Express Lane services, which created an opportunity for residents to renew their vehicle registrations via our secure online portal and then retrieve their little yellow sticker through the Express Lane at the West, Main, and Sebastian offices and through the Main Office drive-thru, often the same day.\n\nEfficiency is a hallmark of a well-run government office. Our overarching business model of being a one-stop shop for over a dozen government services helps to create this for customers. In one visit, an Indian River County resident can make their Florida driver license Real ID Act compliant, renew their vehicle registration and collect their little yellow sticker, buy a SunPass transponder, pay their property taxes, buy a Hunting and Fishing License, apply for domestic known traveler status with the TSA Pre-Check program, and submit their application for a Concealed Weapons License. If that person owns a business or a boat, they can manage those taxes and registrations, as well. Additionally, if they are a commercial truck driver or hospitality worker, we can assist with the TWIC card application process. If that person also requires fingerprinting for a Florida professional license, such as a mortgage loan originator or attorney, or a HazMat certification, we can also provide that through our contract with IdentoGO.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nIt is my honor to serve as your Tax Collector. My top priority from the first day I took office and moving forward remains to create a positive and efficient customer service experience that adapts to changing times, new service offerings, and Indian River County’s growing population.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nAs a small business owner since 1973, I understand what it takes to balance exceptional customer service with cost-saving measures. Finding that balance is not something consistently taught in corporate careers at giant corporations. Having an entrepreneurial background in addition to decades of executive leadership experience, uniquely positions me to continue to eliminate bureaucracy, focus on positive customer interactions, and continue to return excess dollars to Indian River County through conservative fiscal management.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy? If yes, please explain: No.\n\nLink to campaign website or social media page\n\nwww.CaroleJeanJordan.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/01"}]}

It should be heeded by the SNP – our country is already headed into uncertainty and the last thing we need is any more constitutional chaos.”\n\nScottish Green Party politician Ross Greer added: “As the Tories ramp up the racist rhetoric, this economic research underlines the need for Scotland’s voice to be heard in Brexit negotiations.”\n\n“Every avenue must be explored to keep Scotland in Europe and protect the right to free movement and that has to include a referendum on independence.”\n\nBut Scottish Conservative economy spokesman Dean Lockhart said: “No-one doubts the impact of Brexit will be challenging on a range of levels. However, this makes clear the impact on Scotland will be comparatively less than the rest of the U.K. The SNP’s go-to excuse for Scottish economic under-performance has been completely blown out the water.”\n\nA U.K. government spokesperson said: “We have not begun negotiating our exit from the EU, so it seems very premature to draw conclusions from some highly speculative models. We are determined to get the best deal possible for the whole of the U.K. in the negotiations.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/06"}]}

Using this as a pretext to smear China is unacceptable.” Instead, China has claimed the facilities are administrative hubs, set up to help Chinese expatriates with tasks like renewing their driver’s licenses. China has also said the offices were a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which had left many citizens locked down in other countries and locked out of China, unable to renew documentation.\n\nWhen approached by CNN last month about Safeguard Defenders’ original allegations, China’s foreign affairs ministry said the overseas stations were staffed by volunteers. However, the organization’s latest report claims one police network it examined had hired 135 people for its first 21 stations.\n\nThe organization also sourced a three-year contract for a worker hired at an overseas station in Stockholm.\n\nUndeclared consular activities outside of a nation’s official diplomatic missions are highly unusual and illegal, unless a host nation has given their explicit consent, and the Safeguard Defenders report claims China’s overseas offices predate the pandemic by several years.\n\nTheir reports have prompted investigations in at least 13 different countries so far and enflamed an increasingly heated diplomatic tussle between China and nations like Canada, home to a large Chinese diaspora.\n\nChina isn’t the only superpower to be accused of employing extrajudicial means to reach targets for law enforcement or for the purposes of political persecution abroad.\n\nRussia, for instance, has on two occasions been accused of deploying lethal chemical and radioactive substances on British soil to try to assassinate its former spies – allegations Russia has always denied.\n\nIn the United States, the CIA was embroiled in a scandal over the extraordinary rendition of terrorism suspects from the streets of Italy to Guantanamo Bay after 9/11.\n\nYet the suggestion of widescale repression of Chinese citizens in foreign countries comes at a pivotal time for a nation contending with its own unrest at home, amid fatigue at the country’s restrictive zero-Covid policy, as leader Xi Jinping’s third term in power gets under way. Last week, China indicated it would loosen some of its pandemic restrictions, three years after the onset of Covid-19.\n\nAs the second largest economy in the world, China has developed a deepening relationship with many of the countries where the new police stations have been allegedly found, raising awkward questions for national governments balancing commercial interests against national security.\n\nChina signs police patrol agreements with nations\n\nItaly, which signed a series of bilateral security deals with China over successive governments since 2015, has kept largely silent during the revelations of alleged activities on its soil.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2018 Italian police conducted multiple joint patrols with Chinese police – first in Rome and Milan – and later in other cities including Naples where at the same time, Safeguard Defenders says, it has found evidence that a video surveillance system was added to a Chinese residential area ostensibly “to effectively deter crimes there.”\n\nIn 2016, an Italian police official told NPR that joint policing would “lead to a wider international cooperation, exchange of information and sharing resources to combat the criminal and terrorist groups that afflict our countries.”\n\nThe NGO determines Italy has hosted 11 Chinese police stations, including in Venice and in Prato, near Florence.\n\nOne ceremony in Rome to mark the opening of a new station was attended by Italian police officials in 2018, according to videos posted on Chinese websites, demonstrating the close ties between police forces in the two countries.\n\nA Chinese national flag is flown at half-staff to mourn the death of former leader Jiang Zemin at the Chinese Embassy in Italy on November 30, 2022. The NGO determines Italy has hosted 11 Chinese police stations, including in Venice and in Prato, near Florence. Jin Mamengni/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nEarlier this year, the Italian newspaper La Nazione reported local investigations into one of the stations had not unearthed any illegal activity. Il Foglio quoted police chiefs as saying recently that the stations did not present any particular concern as they appeared to be merely bureaucratic.\n\nItaly’s foreign and interior ministries did not reply to questions from CNN.\n\nChina also struck similar joint police patrol agreements with Croatia and Serbia between 2018 and 2019 as part of the nation’s increasing strategic footprint along the path of Xi’s defining foreign policy, dubbed the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nChinese officers were seen on a joint patrol with their Croatian counterparts on the streets of the capital Zagreb as recently as July of this year, Chinese media reported.\n\nA Zagreb police official interviewed by Xinhua said the patrols were essential for “protecting and attracting foreign tourists.”\n\nA 2019 report from Reuters said Chinese officers had joined Serbian officers on patrol in Belgrade to help address the influx of Chinese tourists. One Serbian officer noted the Chinese didn’t have the power to make arrests.\n\nSafeguard Defenders also says Chinese stations were able to get a toehold in South Africa, and in nearby nations thanks to a similar accord with Pretoria, in place for years.\n\nChina began laying the foundations for closer policing ties with South Africa’s law enforcement agencies almost two decades ago, later setting up a network of what are officially called “Overseas Chinese Service Centers” in cooperation with the government of South Africa thanks to successive bilateral security agreements.\n\nChina’s consulate in Cape Town has said the plan “unites all the communities, both South Africans and foreign citizens in South Africa.”\n\nSince its establishment, the framework “has been actively preventing crimes against the community and reducing the number of cases significantly,” the consulate has said while noting that the centers are non-profit associations with no “law enforcement authority.”\n\nSouth African government officials have frequently been featured by Chinese media expressing support for the centers and saying their work has helped police deepen their relationship with Chinese expatriates who live there, according to a 2019 report from the Jamestown China Brief.\n\nCNN reached out to the South African Police Service, but it has not yet received comment.\n\nChina tries to return people against their will\n\nSafeguard Defenders stumbled on the police networks while trying to assess the scale of China’s efforts to persuade some of its people to return to China even against their will, which, based on official Chinese data, could number almost a quarter of a million people around the world during the time Xi has been in power.\n\n“What we see coming from China is increasing attempts to crack down on dissent everywhere in the world, to threaten people, harass people, make sure that they are fearful enough so that they remain silent or else face being returned to China against their will,” said Safeguard Defenders Campaign director Laura Harth.\n\n“It will start with phone calls. They might start to intimidate your relatives back in China, to threaten you, do everything really to coax the targets abroad to come back. If that doesn’t work, they will use covert agents abroad. They will send them from Beijing and use methods such as luring and entrapment,” Harth said.\n\nThe French interior ministry declined to comment on the allegation that a Chinese citizen was coerced into returning home by a Chinese police station in a Paris suburb.\n\nReports spark anger and investigations\n\nThe revelations have prompted vocal outrage in some countries and a conspicuous silence in others.\n\nLast month, FBI Director Christopher Wray told a Homeland Security Committee he was deeply concerned about the revelations. “It is outrageous to think that the Chinese police would attempt to set up shop, you know, in New York, let’s say, without proper coordination. It violates sovereignty and circumvents standard judicial and law enforcement cooperation processes,” he said.\n\nIreland has shut down the Chinese police station found on its territory, while the Netherlands, which has taken similar measures, has a probe underway, as does Spain.\n\nHarth told CNN the organization will likely find more stations in the future. “It’s the tip of the iceberg,” she said.\n\n“China is not hiding what it is doing. They expressly say that they are going to expand these operations so let’s take that seriously.\n\n“This is a moment when countries have to consider that it’s a question of upholding the rule of law and human rights in their countries as much for people from China, as for everyone else around the world,” she said.", "authors": ["Nina Dos Santos"], "publish_date": "2022/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/23/politics/fbi-investigation-huawei-china-defense-department-communications-nuclear/index.html", "title": "CNN Exclusive: FBI investigation determined Chinese-made ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nOn paper, it looked like a fantastic deal. In 2017, the Chinese government was offering to spend $100 million to build an ornate Chinese garden at the National Arboretum in Washington DC. Complete with temples, pavilions and a 70-foot white pagoda, the project thrilled local officials, who hoped it would attract thousands of tourists every year.\n\nBut when US counterintelligence officials began digging into the details, they found numerous red flags. The pagoda, they noted, would have been strategically placed on one of the highest points in Washington DC, just two miles from the US Capitol, a perfect spot for signals intelligence collection, multiple sources familiar with the episode told CNN.\n\nAlso alarming was that Chinese officials wanted to build the pagoda with materials shipped to the US in diplomatic pouches, which US Customs officials are barred from examining, the sources said.\n\nFederal officials quietly killed the project before construction was underway. The Wall Street Journal first reported about the security concerns in 2018.\n\nThe canceled garden is part of a frenzy of counterintelligence activity by the FBI and other federal agencies focused on what career US security officials say has been a dramatic escalation of Chinese espionage on US soil over the past decade.\n\nSince at least 2017, federal officials have investigated Chinese land purchases near critical infrastructure, shut down a high-profile regional consulate believed by the US government to be a hotbed of Chinese spies and stonewalled what they saw as clear efforts to plant listening devices near sensitive military and government facilities.\n\nAmong the most alarming things the FBI uncovered pertains to Chinese-made Huawei equipment atop cell towers near US military bases in the rural Midwest. According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, the FBI determined the equipment was capable of capturing and disrupting highly restricted Defense Department communications, including those used by US Strategic Command, which oversees the country’s nuclear weapons.\n\nWhile broad concerns about Huawei equipment near US military installations have been well known, the existence of this investigation and its findings have never been reported. Its origins stretch back to at least the Obama administration. It was described to CNN by more than a dozen sources, including current and former national security officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nF.E. Warren Air Force Base, a strategic missile base, is located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, an area near a host of cell towers using Huawei equipment. From F.E. Warren Air Force Base/Facebook\n\nIt’s unclear if the intelligence community determined whether any data was actually intercepted and sent back to Beijing from these towers. Sources familiar with the issue say that from a technical standpoint, it’s incredibly difficult to prove a given package of data was stolen and sent overseas.\n\nThe Chinese government strongly denies any efforts to spy on the US. Huawei in a statement to CNN also denied that its equipment is capable of operating in any communications spectrum allocated to the Defense Department.\n\nBut multiple sources familiar with the investigation tell CNN that there’s no question the Huawei equipment has the ability to intercept not only commercial cell traffic but also the highly restricted airwaves used by the military and disrupt critical US Strategic Command communications, giving the Chinese government a potential window into America’s nuclear arsenal.\n\n“This gets into some of the most sensitive things we do,” said one former FBI official with knowledge of the investigation. “It would impact our ability for essentially command and control with the nuclear triad. “That goes into the ‘BFD’ category.”\n\n“If it is possible for that to be disrupted, then that is a very bad day,” this person added.\n\nTurning doves into hawks\n\nFormer officials described the probe’s findings as a watershed moment. The investigation was so secret that some senior policymakers in the White House and elsewhere in government weren’t briefed on its existence until 2019, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThat fall, the Federal Communications Commission initiated a rule that effectively banned small telecoms from using Huawei and a few other brands of Chinese made-equipment. “The existence of the investigation at the highest levels turned some doves into hawks,” said one former US official.\n\nIn 2020, Congress approved $1.9 billion to remove Chinese-made Huawei and ZTE cellular technology across wide swaths of rural America.\n\nBut two years later, none of that equipment has been removed and rural telecom companies are still waiting for federal reimbursement money. The FCC received applications to remove some 24,000 pieces of Chinese-made communications equipment—but according to a July 15 update from the commission, it is more than $3 billion short of the money it needs to reimburse all eligible companies.\n\nAbsent more money from Congress, the FCC says it plans to begin reimbursing approved companies for about 40 percent of the costs of removing Huawei equipment. The FCC did not specify a timeframe on when the money will be disbursed.\n\nIn late 2020, the Justice Department referred its national security concerns about Huawei equipment to the Commerce Department, and provided information on where the equipment was in place in the US, a former senior US law enforcement official told CNN.\n\nAfter the Biden administration took office in 2021, the Commerce Department then opened its own probe into Huawei to determine if more urgent action was needed to expunge the Chinese technology provider from US telecom networks, the former law enforcement official and a current senior US official said.\n\nThat probe has proceeded slowly and is ongoing, the current US official said. Among the concerns that national security officials noted was that external communication from the Huawei equipment that occurs when software is updated, for example, could be exploited by the Chinese government.\n\nDepending on what the Commerce Department finds, US telecom carriers could be forced to quickly remove Huawei equipment or face fines or other penalties.\n\nReuters first reported the existence of the Commerce Department probe.\n\n“We cannot confirm or deny ongoing investigations, but we are committed to securing our information and communications technology and services supply chain. Protecting US persons safety and security against malign information collection is vital to protecting our economy and national security,” a Commerce Department spokesperson said.\n\n\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Inside Huawei's connection to rural America 02:55 - Source: CNN\n\nUS counterintelligence officials have recently made a priority of publicizing threats from China. This month, the US National Counterintelligence and Security Center issued a warning to American businesses and local and state governments about what it says are disguised efforts by China to manipulate them to influence US policy.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray just traveled to London for a joint meeting with top British law enforcement officials to call attention to the Chinese threats.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN, Wray said the FBI opens a new China counterintelligence investigation every 12 hours. “That’s probably about 2,000 or so investigations,” said Wray. “And that’s not even talking about their cyber theft, where they have a bigger hacking program than that of every other major nation combined, and have stolen more of Americans’ personal and corporate data than every nation combined.”\n\nAsked why after years of national security concerns raised over Huawei, the equipment is still largely in place atop cell towers near US military bases, Wray said that, “We’re concerned about allowing any company that is beholden to a nation state that doesn’t adhere to and share our values, giving that company the ability to burrow into our telecommunications infrastructure.”\n\nHe noted that in 2020, the DOJ indicted Huawei with racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to steal trade secrets.\n\n“And I think that’s probably about all I can say on the topic,” said Wray.\n\nCritics see xenophobic overreach\n\nDespite its tough talk, the US government’s refusal to provide evidence to back up its claims that Huawei tech poses a risk to US national security has led some critics to accuse it of xenophobic overreach. The lack of a smoking gun also raises questions of whether US officials can separate legitimate Chinese investment from espionage.\n\n“All of our products imported to the US have been tested and certified by the FCC before being deployed there,” Huawei said in its statement to CNN. “Our equipment only operates on the spectrum allocated by the FCC for commercial use. This means it cannot access any spectrum allocated to the DOD.”\n\n“For more than 30 years, Huawei has maintained a proven track record in cyber security and we have never been involved in any malicious cyber security incidents,” the statement said.\n\nIn its zeal to sniff out evidence of Chinese spying, critics argue the feds have cast too wide a net — in particular as it relates to academic institutions. In one recent high-profile case, a federal judge acquitted a former University of Tennessee engineering professor whom the Justice Department had prosecuted under its so-called China Initiative that targets Chinese spying, arguing “there was no evidence presented that [the professor] ever collaborated with a Chinese university in conducting NASA-funded research.”\n\nAnd on Jan. 20, the Justice Department dropped a separate case against an MIT professor accused of hiding his ties to China, saying it could no longer prove its case. In February, the Biden administration shut down the China Initiative entirely.\n\nThe federal government’s reticence across multiple administrations to detail what it knows has led some critics to accuse the government of chasing ghosts.\n\n“It really comes down to: do you treat China as a neutral actor — because if you treat China as a neutral actor, then yeah, this seems crazy, that there’s some plot behind every tree,” said Anna Puglisi, a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. “However, China has shown us through its policies and actions it is not a neutral actor.”\n\nChinese tech in the American heartland\n\nAs early as the Obama administration, FBI agents were monitoring a disturbing pattern along stretches of Interstate 25 in Colorado and Montana, and on arteries into Nebraska. The heavily trafficked corridor connects some of the most secretive military installations in the US, including an archipelago of nuclear missile silos.\n\nFor years, small, rural telecom providers had been installing cheaper, Chinese-made routers and other technology atop cell towers up and down I-25 and elsewhere in the region. Across much of these sparsely populated swaths of the west, these smaller carriers are the only option for cell coverage. And many of them turned to Huawei for cheaper, reliable equipment.\n\nBeginning in late 2011, Viaero, the largest regional provider in the area, inked a contract with Huawei to provide the equipment for its upgrade to 3G. A decade later, it has Huawei tech installed across its entire fleet of towers, roughly 1,000 spread over five western states.\n\nAs Huawei equipment began to proliferate near US military bases, federal investigators started taking notice, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Of particular concern was that Huawei was routinely selling cheap equipment to rural providers in cases that appeared to be unprofitable for Huawei — but which placed its equipment near military assets.\n\nFederal investigators initially began “examining [Huawei] less from a technical lens and more from a business/financial view,” explained John Lenkart, a former senior FBI agent focused on counterintelligence issues related to China. Officials studied where Huawei sales efforts were most concentrated and looked for deals that “made no sense from a return-on-investment perspective,” Lenkart said.\n\n“A lot of [counterintelligence] concerns were uncovered based on” those searches, Lenkart said.\n\nBy examining the Huawei equipment themselves, FBI investigators determined it could recognize and disrupt DOD-spectrum communications — even though it had been certified by the FCC, according to a source familiar with the investigation.\n\n“It’s not technically hard to make a device that complies with the FCC that listens to nonpublic bands but then is quietly waiting for some activation trigger to listen to other bands,” said Eduardo Rojas, who leads the radio spectrum lab at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida. “Technically, it’s feasible.”\n\nTo prove a device had clandestine capabilities, Rojas said, would require technical experts to strip down a device “to the semi-conductor level” and “reverse engineer the design.” But, he said, it can be done.\n\nAnd there was another big concern along I-25, sources familiar with the investigation said.\n\nWeather camera worries\n\nAround 2014, Viaero started mounting high-definition surveillance cameras on its towers to live-stream weather and traffic, a public service it shared with local news organizations. With dozens of cameras posted up and down I-25, the cameras provided a 24-7 bird’s eye view of traffic and incoming weather, even providing advance warning of tornadoes.\n\nBut they were also inadvertently capturing the movement of US military equipment and personnel, giving Beijing — or anyone for that matter — the ability to track the pattern of activity between a series of closely guarded military facilities.\n\nThe intelligence community determined the publicly posted live-streams were being viewed and likely captured from China, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Two sources briefed on the investigation at the time said officials believed that it was possible for Beijing’s intelligence service to “task” the cameras — hack into the network and control where they pointed. At least some of the cameras in question were running on Huawei networks.\n\nViaero CEO Frank DiRico said it never occurred to him the cameras could be a national security risk.\n\n“There’s a lot of missile silos in areas we cover. There is some military presence,” DiRico said in an interview from his Colorado office. But, he said, “I was never told to remove the equipment or to make any changes.”\n\nIn fact, DiRico first learned of government concerns about Huawei equipment from newspaper articles — not the FBI — and says he has never been briefed on the matter.\n\nDiRico doesn’t question the government’s insistence that he needs to remove Huawei equipment, but he is skeptical that China’s intelligence services can exploit either the Huawei hardware itself or the camera equipment.\n\n“We monitor our network pretty good,” DiRico said, adding that Viaero took over the support and maintenance for its own networks from Huawei shortly after installation. “We feel we’ve got a pretty good idea if there’s anything going on that’s inappropriate.”\n\nScouring the country for Chinese investments\n\nBy the time the I-25 investigation was briefed to the White House in 2019, counterintelligence officials begin looking for other places Chinese companies might be buying land or offering to develop a piece of municipal property, like a park or an old factory, sometimes as part of a “sister city” arrangement.\n\nIn one instance, officials shut down what they believed was a risky commercial deal near highly sensitive military testing installations in Utah sometime after the beginning of the I-25 investigation, according to one former US official. The military has a test and training range for hypersonic weapons in Utah, among other things. Sources declined to provide more details.\n\nFederal officials were also alarmed by what sources described as a host of espionage and influence activities in Houston and, in 2020, shut down the Chinese consulate there.\n\nUS Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Richard P. Donoghue announcing indictments against China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, several of its subsidiaries and its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on January 28, 2019. Joshua Roberts/Reuters\n\nBill Evanina, who until early last year ran the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, told CNN that it can sometimes be hard to differentiate between a legitimate business opportunity and espionage — in part because both might be happening at the same time.\n\n“What we’ve seen is legitimate companies that are three times removed from Beijing buy [a given] facility for obvious logical reasons, unaware of what the [Chinese] intelligence apparatus wants in that parcel [of land],” Evanina said. “What we’ve seen recently — it’s been what’s underneath the land.”\n\n“The hard part is, that’s legitimate business, and what city or town is not going to want to take that money for that land when it’s just sitting there doing nothing?” he added.\n\nA complicated problem\n\nAfter the results of the I-25 investigation were briefed to the Trump White House in 2019, the FCC ordered that telecom companies who receive federal subsidies to provide cell service to remote areas — companies like Viaero — must “rip and replace” their Huawei and ZTE equipment.\n\nThe FCC has since said that the cost could be more than double the $1.9 billion appropriated in 2020 and absent an additional appropriation from Congress, the agency is only planning to reimburse companies for a fraction of their costs.\n\nGiven the staggering strategic risk, Lenkart said, “rip and replace is a very blunt and inefficient remediation.”\n\nDiRico, the CEO of Viaero, said the cost of “rip and replace” is astronomical and that he doesn’t expect the reimbursement money to be enough to pay for the change. According to the FCC, Viaero is expected to receive less than half of the funding it is actually due. Still, he expects to start removing the equipment within the next year.\n\n“It’s difficult and it’s a lot of money,” DiRico said.\n\nSome former counterintelligence officials expressed frustration that the US government isn’t providing more granular detail about what it knows to companies — or to cities and states considering a Chinese investment proposal. They believe that not only would that kind of detail help private industry and state and local governments understand the seriousness of the threat as they see it, but also help combat the criticism that the US government is targeting Chinese companies and people, rather than Chinese state-run espionage.\n\n“This government has to do a better job of letting everyone know this is a Communist Party issue, it’s not a Chinese people issue,” Evanina said. “And I’ll be the first to say that the government has to do better with respect to understanding the Communist Party’s intentions are not the same intentions of the Chinese people.”\n\nA current FBI official said the bureau is giving more defensive briefings to US businesses, academic institutions and state and local governments that include far more detail than in the past, but officials are still fighting an uphill battle.\n\n“Sometimes I feel like we’re a lifeguard going out to a drowning person, and they don’t want our help,” said the current FBI official. But, this person said, “I think sometimes we [the FBI] say ‘China threat,’ and we take for granted what all that means in our head. And it means something else to the people that we’re delivering it to.”\n\n“I think we just need to be more careful about how we speak about it and educate folks on why we’re doing what we’re doing.”\n\nIn the meantime, the “rip and replace” program has remained fiercely controversial.\n\n“It’s not going to be easy,” DiRico said. “I’m going to be up nights worrying about it, but we’ll do what we’re told to do.”\n\nThis story has been updated to reference Wall Street Journal reporting.", "authors": ["Katie Bo Lillis"], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/business/tesla-barred-china-suspicions-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Tesla is still battling spying suspicions in China | CNN Business", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nTesla cars are being kept off some roads in China as authorities bar them from sensitive areas, reportedly including a seaside resort town where a top leadership gathering could take place next month.\n\nThe reports suggest that the automaker continues to face deep mistrust from officials about whether its vehicles could be used for spying, despite repeated personal assurances from CEO Elon Musk.\n\nReuters reported Monday that Tesla (TSLA) cars would be barred from entering Beidaihe, a beach resort near Beijing, for at least two months starting in July, citing an unidentified local traffic police official. The town traditionally hosts the annual summer gathering of the country’s most powerful politicians, though dates for the summit are not typically publicly disclosed.\n\nTesla drivers were also stopped from using certain roads in Chengdu earlier this month when President Xi Jinping was visiting the metropolis in southwestern China, according to Reuters.\n\nAuthorities in Qinhuangdao, which administers Beidaihe, and Chengdu did not immediately respond to queries from CNN Business, while Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTu Le, founder of Beijing-based consulting firm Sino Auto Insights, said that he had heard from Tesla owners who live in Beidaihe, or frequently visit the resort, that they may not be able to drive their vehicles there soon.\n\nRecently, Chinese government officials have been leery of the data collected by Tesla’s onboard cameras.\n\nSince last year, some Chinese government ministries have barred Teslas from entering their office compounds in Beijing, a source who regularly visits these agencies for business meetings with officials told CNN. The source asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject.\n\nSimilarly, the Chinese military reportedly banned Tesla vehicles from entering its complexes in 2021 over fears about potential leaks of sensitive information.\n\nLe said that the reports about the latest restrictions weren’t particularly surprising, given those concerns.\n\n“To me, this is just a continuation of current policy,” he told CNN Business.\n\nTesla has addressed the concerns directly, pledging to keep any data it collects from locally sold cars within China’s borders.\n\nLast May, the company announced a new data center in mainland China as well as plans to “add more” in the country in the future.\n\nMusk has also sought to personally reassure the Chinese government, meeting officials and rolling out a charm offensive in local media.\n\n“There’s a very strong incentive for us to be very confidential with any information,” the world’s richest man said last March at a conference organized by a unit of the government.\n\n“If Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere, we will get shut down,” he added.\n\nThose assurances, however, don’t seem to have done enough.\n\n“It’s a very sensitive time,” Le noted. “So I think every precaution is being taken.”\n\nChina’s ruling Communist Party is currently gearing up for a key meeting in the fall, where Xi is expected to formally assume a historic third term. That comes as the country’s leadership continues to face mounting tensions with the United States over issues including Russia’s war in Ukraine, as well as heightened criticism of its unwavering “zero Covid” policy.\n\nChina is critical\n\nMusk, who is known for being particularly outspoken on Twitter, has stayed noticeably silent despite the headlines of potential curbs on his company in China, noted Le.\n\n“If this was any other country, Elon would throw a fit,” he said. “His silence speaks volumes to me.”\n\nChina is crucial to Tesla. It serves as a huge production base for the automaker, and made up a quarter of its revenue last year, a proportion that Musk expects to swell. Last year, the CEO predicted that the country would ultimately become its “biggest market.”\n\nHowever, Tesla has faced a series of headwinds in China this year, mostly due to a stringent, two-month lockdown in Shanghai. The company’s Gigafactory in the city was shut down for several weeks, while its sales in the country in April nearly flatlined as more people stayed home.\n\nMusk’s critics also worry that his Tesla interests in China could ultimately be used as leverage over other parts of his sprawling empire, including his space exploration ventures, and potentially Twitter (TWTR) if his takeover of the platform is completed.\n\nSome academics have expressed concerns, for instance, that the businessman could be pressured to tamp down on criticism of China around the world — should he become the social media network’s new owner — in exchange for maintaining Tesla’s position in the world’s biggest auto market.\n\nMusk has also assisted the Ukrainian military with his Starlink internet satellite system, which has aroused suspicion in Chinese state media. Some users on Chinese social media have questioned where the CEO’s political loyalty lies.\n\n“Any leverage points will try to be exploited,” said Le.\n\nTesla vehicles waiting for shipping transport in a lot near the Waigaoqiao Container Port in Shanghai in June.

It also alleges that some of the company’s senior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter’s serious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees may be working for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, who was previously the company’s head of security, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges that Twitter’s leadership has misled its own board and government regulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that could allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation, hacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also alleges Twitter does not reliably delete users’ data after they cancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost track of the information, and that it has misled regulators about whether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The whistleblower also says Twitter executives don’t have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become central to Elon Musk’s attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk’s claims).\n\nZatko was fired by Twitter (TWTR) in January for what the company claims was poor performance. According to Zatko, his public whistleblowing comes after he attempted to flag the security lapses to Twitter (TWTR)’s board and to help Twitter (TWTR) fix years of technical shortcomings and alleged non-compliance with an earlier privacy agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. Zatko is being represented by Whistleblower Aid, the same group that represented Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.\n\nJohn Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid and Zatko’s lawyer, told CNN that Zatko has not been in contact with Musk, and said Zatko began the whistleblower process before there was any indication of Musk’s involvement with Twitter.\n\nAfter this article was initially published, Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, told CNN, “We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding.”\n\nCNN sought comment from Twitter on more than 50 specific questions regarding the disclosure.\n\nIn a statement, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN that security and privacy are both longtime priorities for the company. Twitter also said the company provides clear tools for users to control privacy, ad targeting and data sharing, and added that it has created internal workflows to ensure users know that when they cancel their accounts, Twitter will deactivate the accounts and start a deletion process. Twitter declined to say whether it typically completes the process.\n\n“Mr. Zatko was fired from his senior executive role at Twitter in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance,” the Twitter spokesperson said. “What we’ve seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context. Mr. Zatko’s allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be.”\n\nSome of Zatko’s most damning claims spring from his apparently tense relationship with Parag Agrawal, the company’s former chief technology officer who was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. According to the disclosure, Agrawal and his lieutenants repeatedly discouraged Zatko from providing a full accounting of Twitter’s security problems to the company’s board of directors. The company’s executive team allegedly instructed Zatko to provide an oral report of his initial findings on the company’s security condition to the board rather than a detailed written account, ordered Zatko to knowingly present cherry-picked and misrepresented data to create the false perception of progress on urgent cybersecurity issues, and went behind Zatko’s back to have a third-party consulting firm’s report scrubbed to hide the true extent of the company’s problems.\n\nThe disclosure is generally much kinder to Dorsey, who hired Zatko and whom Zatko believes wanted to see the problems within the company fixed. But it does depict him as extremely disengaged in his final months leading Twitter – so much so that some senior staff even considered the possibility he was sick.\n\nCNN has reached out to Dorsey for comment. A person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at Twitter told CNN the company investigated several claims he brought forward around the time he was fired, and ultimately found them unpersuasive; the person added that Zatko at times lacked understanding of Twitter’s FTC obligations.\n\nZatko believes his firing was in retaliation for his sounding the alarm about the company’s security problems.\n\nThe scathing disclosure, which totals around 200 pages, including supporting exhibits – was sent last month to a number of US government agencies and congressional committees, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The existence and details of the disclosure have not previously been reported. CNN obtained a copy of the disclosure from a senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill. The SEC, DOJ and FTC declined to comment; the Senate Intelligence Committee, which received a copy of the report, is taking the disclosure seriously and is setting a meeting to discuss the allegations, according to Rachel Cohen, a committee spokesperson.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and also received the report, vowed to investigate “and take further steps as needed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations.”\n\nThe claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, the same panel’s top Republican and an avid Twitter user, also expressed deep concerns about the allegations in a statement to CNN.\n\n“Take a tech platform that collects massive amounts of user data, combine it with what appears to be an incredibly weak security infrastructure and infuse it with foreign state actors with an agenda, and you’ve got a recipe for disaster,” Grassley said. “The claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns as well as privacy issues, and they must be investigated further.”\n\nThe FTC should investigate the claims, and impose fines and individual liability on specific Twitter executives if a probe finds they were responsible for security lapses, Sen. Richard Blumenthal wrote to the agency in a letter on Tuesday obtained by CNN.\n\nThe letter by Blumenthal — who chairs the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection — highlights the pressure Twitter now faces from Washington as a result of the disclosure.\n\n“If the Commission does not vigorously oversee and enforce its orders, they will not be taken seriously and these dangerous breaches will continue,” Blumenthal wrote.\n\nZatko may be eligible for a monetary award from the US government as a result of his whistleblower activities. “Original, timely and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action” by the SEC can earn whistleblowers up to a 30% cut of agency fines related to the action if the penalties amount to more than $1 million, the SEC has said. The SEC has awarded more than $1 billion to nearly 300 whistleblowers since 2012.\n\nTye told CNN that Zatko filed his disclosure to the SEC “to help the agency enforce the laws,” and to gain federal whistleblower protections. “The prospect of a reward was not a factor in Mudge’s decision, and in fact he didn’t even know about the reward program when he decided to become a lawful whistleblower.”\n\nThe Whistleblower\n\nZatko first came to national attention in 1998 when he took part in the first congressional hearings on cybersecurity.\n\n“All my life, I’ve been about finding places where I can go and make a difference. I’ve done that through the security field. That’s my main lever,” he told CNN in an interview earlier this month.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Twitter whistleblower was on CNN 22 years ago. Here's what he had to say 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\nThe events leading to his decision to become a whistleblower began before he worked at Twitter, with a devastating hack in 2020 in which the Twitter accounts of some of the world’s most famous people, including then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, Kim Kardashian and Musk, were compromised. Twitter told CNN that in response to the incident, the company began compartmentalizing access to customer support tools.\n\nAfter the attack, Dorsey recruited Zatko, a well-known “ethical hacker” turned cybersecurity insider and executive who previously held senior roles at Google, Stripe and the US Department of Defense, and who told CNN that he’d been offered a senior, day-one cyber position in the Biden administration.\n\nZatko, center, was among a group of hackers who testified before Congress on cybersecurity in 1998. Douglas Graham/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images\n\nWhat Zatko says he found was a company with extraordinarily poor security practices, including giving thousands of the company’s employees — amounting to roughly half the company’s workforce — access to some of the platform’s critical controls. His disclosure describes his overall findings as “egregious deficiencies, negligence, willful ignorance, and threats to national security and democracy.”\n\nAfter the January 6 insurrection, Zatko was concerned about the possibility someone within Twitter who sympathized with the insurrectionists could try to manipulate the company’s platform, according to his disclosure. He sought to clamp down on internal access that allows Twitter engineers to make changes to the platform, known as the “production environment.”\n\nBut, the disclosure says, Zatko soon learned “it was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did…. Nobody knew where data lived or whether it was critical, and all engineers had some form of critical access to the production environment.” Twitter also lacked the ability to hold workers accountable for information security lapses because it has little control or visibility into employees’ individual work computers, Zatko claims, citing internal cybersecurity reports estimating that 4 in 10 devices do not meet basic security standards.\n\nTwitter’s flimsy server infrastructure is a separate yet equally serious vulnerability, the disclosure claims. About half of the company’s 500,000 servers run on outdated software that does not support basic security features such as encryption for stored data or regular security updates by vendors, according to the letter to regulators and a February email Zatko wrote to Patrick Pichette, a Twitter board member, that is included in the disclosure.\n\n[I]t was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did. From Zatko's disclosure\n\nThe company also lacks sufficient redundancies and procedures to restart or recover from data center crashes, Zatko’s disclosure says, meaning that even minor outages of several data centers at the same time could knock the entire Twitter service offline, perhaps for good.\n\nTwitter did not respond to questions about the risk of data center outages, but told CNN that people on Twitter’s engineering and product teams are authorized to access the production environment if they have a specific business justification for doing so. Twitter’s employees use devices overseen by other IT and security teams with the power to prevent a device from connecting to sensitive internal systems if it is running outdated software, Twitter added.\n\nThe company also said it uses automated checks to ensure laptops running outdated software cannot access the production environment, and that employees may only make changes to Twitter’s live product after the code meets certain record-keeping and review requirements.\n\nTwitter has internal security tools that are tested by the company regularly, and every two years by external auditors, according to the person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at the company. The person added that some of Zatko’s statistics surrounding device security lacked credibility and were derived by a small team that did not properly account for Twitter’s existing security procedures.\n\nBut Twitter’s security concerns had come to light prior to 2020. In 2010, the FTC filed a complaint against Twitter for its mishandling of users’ private information and the issue of too many employees having access to Twitter’s central controls. The complaint resulted in an FTC consent order finalized the following year in which Twitter vowed to clean up its act, including by creating and maintaining “a comprehensive information security program.”\n\nZatko alleges that despite the company’s claims to the contrary, it had “never been in compliance” with what the FTC demanded more than 10 years ago. As a result of its alleged failures to address vulnerabilities raised by the FTC as well as other deficiencies, he says, Twitter suffers an “anomalously high rate of security incidents,” approximately one per week serious enough to require disclosure to government agencies. “Based on my professional experience, peer companies do not have this magnitude or volume of incidents,” Zatko wrote in a February letter to Twitter’s board after he was fired by Twitter in January.\n\nThe stakes of Zatko’s disclosure are enormous. It could lead to billions of dollars in new fines for Twitter if it’s found to have violated its legal obligations, according to Jon Leibowitz, who was chair of the FTC at the time of Twitter’s original 2011 consent order.\n\nThe agency now has another opportunity to show the tech industry it is serious about holding platforms accountable, Leibowitz added, after officials opted not to name top Facebook execs including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg in the FTC’s $5 billion privacy settlement with that company in 2019.\n\n[I]f there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order. Jon Leibowitz, former chair of the FTC\n\n“One of the big disappointments in the Facebook order violation case was that the FTC let executives off the hook; they should’ve been named,” Leibowitz told CNN in an interview. “And if there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order.”\n\nTwitter told CNN its FTC compliance record speaks for itself, citing third-party audits filed to the agency under the 2011 consent order in which it said Zatko did not participate. Twitter also said it is in compliance with relevant privacy rules and that it has been transparent with regulators about its efforts to fix any shortcomings in its systems.\n\nZatko’s allegations are based in part on a failure to grasp how Twitter’s existing programs and processes work to fulfill Twitter’s FTC obligations, the person familiar with his tenure told CNN, saying that misunderstanding has prompted him to make inaccurate claims about the company’s level of compliance.\n\nForeign threats\n\nTwitter is exceptionally vulnerable to foreign government exploitation in ways that undermine US national security, and the company may even have foreign spies currently on its payroll, the disclosure alleges.\n\nThe whistleblower report says the US government provided specific evidence to Twitter shortly before Zatko’s firing that at least one of its employees, perhaps more, were working for another government’s intelligence service. The report does not say whether Twitter was already aware or if it subsequently acted on the tip.\n\nParag Agrawal, Twitter's former chief technology officer, was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nLast year, prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Agrawal — then Twitter’s chief technology officer — proposed to Zatko that Twitter comply with Russian demands that could result in broad-based censorship or surveillance of the platform, Zatko alleges.\n\nThe disclosure does not provide details of Agrawal’s suggestion. Last summer, however, Russia passed a law pressuring tech platforms to open local offices in the country or face potential advertising bans, a move western security experts said was intended to give Russia greater leverage over US tech companies.\n\nWhile Agrawal’s suggestion was ultimately discarded, it was still an alarming sign of how far Twitter was willing to go in pursuit of growth, according to Zatko.\n\n“The fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on U.S. national security,” Zatko’s disclosure says.\n\nThe fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on US national security, From Zatko's disclosure\n\nZatko’s report is becoming public just two weeks after a former Twitter manager was convicted of spying for Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi case underscores the gravity of the allegations Zatko now levels at Twitter. His report could further inflame bipartisan concerns in Washington about foreign adversaries and the cybersecurity threats they pose to Americans, ranging from the theft of US citizens’ data to manipulating US voters or stealing technology and trade secrets.\n\nTwitter did not respond to specific questions about its alleged foreign intelligence vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Musk element\n\nZatko’s disclosure comes at a particularly fortuitous moment for Musk, who is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Musk has accused Twitter of lying about the number of spam bots on its platform, an issue that he claims should let him terminate the deal.\n\nWhile the binding acquisition agreement that Musk signed with Twitter in April did not include any bot-related exemptions, the billionaire claims that the number of bots on the platform affect the user experience and that having more bots than previously known could therefore impact the company’s long-term value. After Musk moved to terminate the purchase, Twitter responded with a lawsuit alleging that he is using bots as a pretext to get out of a deal over which he now has buyers’ remorse following the recent market downturn, and asking a court to force him to close the deal. The case is set to go to trial in Delaware Chancery Court in October.\n\nTwitter employees walk by the company's headquarters in San Francisco.

But figures about how many users a service has, or how many people actually view a given ad on a site, are notoriously unreliable throughout the tech and media industries due to manipulation and error.\n\nAlone among social media companies, Twitter reports its user numbers to investors and advertisers using a measurement it calls monetizable daily active users, or mDAUs. Its rivals simply count and report all active users; until 2019, Twitter had worked that way as well. But that meant Twitter’s figures were subject to significant swings in certain situations, including takedowns of major bot networks. So Twitter switched to mDAUs, which it says counts all users that could be shown an advertisement on Twitter – leaving all accounts that for some reason can’t, for instance because they’re known to be bots, in a separate bucket, according to Zatko’s disclosure.\n\nThe company has repeatedly reported that less than 5% of its mDAUs are fake or spam accounts, and a person familiar with the matter both affirmed that assessment to CNN this week and pointed to other investor disclosures saying the figure relies on significant judgement that may not accurately reflect reality. But Zatko’s disclosure argues that by reporting bots only as a percentage of mDAU, rather than as a percentage of the total number of accounts on the platform, Twitter obscures the true scale of fake and spam accounts on the service, a move Zatko alleges is deliberately misleading.\n\nZatko says he began asking about the prevalence of bot accounts on Twitter in early 2021, and was told by Twitter’s head of site integrity that the company didn’t know how many total bots are on its platform. He alleges that he came away from conversations with the integrity team with the understanding that the company “had no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bots,” in part because if the true number became public, it could harm the company’s value and image.\n\nJack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I’m still performing that mission. Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, former Twitter head of security\n\nExperts on inauthentic behavior online say it can be difficult to quantify “bots” because there isn’t a widely agreed upon definition of the term, and because bad actors constantly change their tactics. There are also many harmless bots on Twitter (and across the internet), such as automated news accounts, and Twitter offers an opt-in feature to allow such accounts to transparently label themselves as automated. Twitter told CNN that the claim it doesn’t know how many bots are on its platform lacks context, reiterating that not all bots are bad and adding that to focus on the total number of bots on Twitter would include those the company may have already identified and taken action against. The company also does not believe it can catch every spam account on the platform, Twitter said, which is why it reports its less-than-5% figure, which reflects a manual estimate, in its financial filings.\n\nBut Zatko told CNN he thinks there would still be value in attempting to measure the total number of spam, false or otherwise potentially harmful automated accounts on the platform. “The executive team, the board, the shareholders and the users all deserve an honest answer as to what it is that they are consuming as far as data and information and content [on the platform … At least from my point of view, I want to invest in a company where I know what’s actually going on because I want to invest strategically in the long-term value of an organization,” he said.\n\nTwitter says that it allows bots on its platform, but its rules prohibit those that engage in spam or platform manipulation. But, as with all social media platforms’ rules, the challenge often lies in enforcing its policies.\n\nElon Musk is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe company says it regularly challenges, suspends and removes accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation, including typically removing more than one million spam accounts each day. Twitter said the total number of bots on the platform is not a useful number. The company declined to answer questions about the total number of accounts on the platform or the average number of new accounts added on the platform daily as context around its daily bot deletion figure.\n\nBut in casting doubt on Twitter’s ability to estimate the true number of fake and spam accounts, Zatko’s allegations could provide ammunition to Musk’s central claim that the figure is much higher than Twitter has publicly reported.\n\nBy going public, Zatko says, he believes he is doing the job he was hired to do for a platform he says is critical to democracy. “Jack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter.

The aircraft’s manifest stated it was loaded with cookies. Sudan rarely, if ever, exports cookies.\n\nA heated debate transpired between officials in a back office of Khartoum International Airport. They feared that inspecting the plane would vex the country’s increasingly pro-Russian military leadership. Multiple previous attempts to intercept suspicious Russian carriers had been stopped. Ultimately, however, the officials decided to board the plane.\n\nInside the hold, colorful boxes of cookies stretched out before them. Hidden just beneath were wooden crates of Sudan’s most precious resource. Gold. Roughly one ton of it.\n\nThis incident in February – recounted by multiple official Sudanese sources to CNN – is one of at least 16 known Russian gold smuggling flights out of Sudan, Africa’s third largest producer of the precious metal, over the last year and a half.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter confronts staff at alleged Russian operation in Sudan 08:55 - Source: CNN\n\nMultiple interviews with high-level Sudanese and US officials and troves of documents reviewed by CNN paint a picture of an elaborate Russian scheme to plunder Sudan’s riches in a bid to fortify Russia against increasingly robust Western sanctions and to buttress Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine.\n\nThe evidence also suggests that Russia has colluded with Sudan’s beleaguered military leadership, enabling billions of dollars in gold to bypass the Sudanese state and to deprive the poverty-stricken country of hundreds of millions in state revenue.\n\nIn exchange, Russia has lent powerful political and military backing to Sudan’s increasingly unpopular military leadership as it violently quashes the country’s pro-democracy movement.\n\nFormer and current US officials told CNN that Russia actively supported Sudan’s 2021 military coup which overthrew a transitional civilian government, dealing a devastating blow to the Sudanese pro-democracy movement that had toppled President Omar al-Bashir two years earlier.\n\n“We’ve long known Russia is exploiting Sudan’s natural resources,” one former US official familiar with the matter told CNN. “In order to maintain access to those resources Russia encouraged the military coup.”\n\n“As the rest of the world closed in on [Russia], they have a lot to gain from this relationship with Sudan’s generals and from helping the generals remain in power,” the former official added. “That ‘help’ runs the gamut from training and intelligence support to jointly benefiting from Sudan’s stolen gold.”\n\nAt the heart of this quid pro quo between Moscow and Sudan’s military junta is Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian oligarch and key ally of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe heavily sanctioned 61-year-old controls a shadowy network of companies that includes Wagner, a paramilitary group linked to alleged torture, mass killings and looting in several war-torn countries including Syria and the Central African Republic (CAR). Prigozhin denies links to Wagner.\n\nIn Sudan, Prigozhin’s main vehicle is a US-sanctioned company called Meroe Gold – a subsidiary of Prigozhin owned M-invest – which extracts gold while providing weapons and training to the country’s army and paramilitaries, according to invoices seen by CNN.\n\n“Through Meroe Gold, or other companies associated with Prigozhin employees, he has developed a strategy to loot the economic resources of the African countries where he intervenes, as a counterpart to his support to the governments in place,” said Denis Korotkov, investigator at the London-based Dossier Center, which tracks the criminal activity of various people associated with the Kremlin. The center was started by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once the richest man in Russia, now living in exile in London.\n\nCNN, in collaboration with the Dossier Center, can also reveal that at least one high-level Wagner operative – Alexander Sergeyevich Kuznetsov – has overseen operations in Sudan’s key gold mining, processing and transit sites in recent years.\n\nKuznetsov – also known by his call signs “Ratibor” and “Radimir” – is a convicted kidnapper who fought in neighboring Libya and commanded Wagner’s first attack and reconnaissance company in 2014. He is a four-time recipient of Russia’s Order of Courage award and was pictured alongside Putin and Dmitri Utkin – Wagner’s founder – in 2017. The European Union sanctioned Kuznetsov in 2021.\n\nThe growing bond between Sudan’s military rulers and Moscow has spawned an intricate gold smuggling network. According to Sudanese official sources as well as flight data reviewed by CNN in collaboration with flight tracker Twitter account Gerjon, at least 16 of the flights intercepted by Sudanese officials last year were operated by military plane that came to and from the Syrian port city of Latakia where Russia has a major airbase.\n\nGold shipments also follow a land route to the CAR, where Wagner has propped up a repressive regime and is reported to have meted out some of its cruelest tactics on the country’s population, according to multiple Sudanese official sources and the Dossier Center.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Russian foreign ministry, the Russian defense ministry and the parent organization for the group of companies run by Prigozhin for comment. None has responded.\n\nResponding to the findings of CNN’s investigation, a US State Department spokesperson said: “We are monitoring this issue closely, including the reported activities of Meroe Gold, the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group, and other sanctioned actors in Sudan, the region, and throughout the gold trade.\n\n“We support the Sudanese people in their pursuit of a democratic and prosperous Sudan that respects human rights,” the spokesperson added. “We will continue to make clear our concerns to Sudanese military officials about the malign impact of Wagner, Meroe Gold, and other actors.”\n\nReceding into the shadows\n\nRussia’s meddling in Sudan’s gold began in earnest in 2014 after its invasion of Crimea prompted a slew of Western sanctions. Gold shipments proved an effective way of accumulating and transferring wealth, bolstering Russia’s state coffers while sidestepping international financial monitoring systems.\n\n“The downside of gold is that it’s physical and a lot more cumbersome to use than international wire transfers but the flip side is that it’s much harder if not impossible to freeze or seize,” said Daniel McDowell, sanctions specialist and associate professor of Political Science at Syracuse University.\n\nThe hub of Russia’s gold extraction operation lies deep in the desert of northeast Sudan, a bleached landscape peppered with gaping chasms where miners toil in searing heat, with only tents fashioned from scraps of tarpaulin and sandbags providing any respite.\n\nAlex Platt, CNN\n\nMiners from those remote artisanal mines converge on al-Ibaidiya – known as ‘gold town’ – every morning, lugging sacks of gold in carts hauled by donkeys along the town’s unpaved roads. The highest bidders for their goods, many of them say, are almost invariably merchants dispatched from a nearby processing plant known by locals as ‘the Russian company.’\n\nIt’s a helter-skelter selling process that sources tell CNN is the nerve center of Russia’s gold siphoning. Some 85% of the gold in Sudan is sold this way, according to official statistics seen by CNN. The transactions are mostly off-the-books, and Russia dominates this market, according to multiple sources, including mining whistleblowers and security sources.\n\nFor at least a decade, Russia has hidden its Sudanese gold dealings from the official record. Sudan’s official Foreign Trade Statistics since 2011 consistently list Russia’s total gold exports from the country at zero, despite copious evidence of Moscow’s extensive dealings in this sector.\n\nBecause Russia has benefited from considerable government blind spots, it is difficult to ascertain the exact amount of gold it has removed from Sudan. But at least seven sources familiar with events accuse Russia of driving the lion’s share of Sudan’s gold smuggling operations – which is where most of Sudan’s gold has ended up in recent years, according to official statistics.\n\nMilling machines grind gold ore in the al-Ibaidiya milling plant.

Alex Platt, CNN Al-Ibaidiya is known as 'gold town' and sources say it lies at the center of Russia's gold smuggling operation. Alex Platt, CNN Al-Ibaidiya, Sudan Prev Next\n\nA whistleblower from inside the Sudanese Central Bank showed CNN a photo of a spreadsheet showing that 32.7 tons was unaccounted for in 2021. Using current prices, this amounts to $1.9 billion worth of missing gold, at $60 million a ton.\n\nBut multiple former and current officials say that the amount of missing gold is even larger, arguing that the Sudanese government vastly underestimates the gold produced at informal artisanal mines, distorting the real number.\n\nMost of CNN’s insider sources claim that around 90% of Sudan’s gold production is being smuggled out. If true, that would amount to roughly $13.4 billion worth of gold that has circumvented customs and regulations, with potentially hundreds of millions of dollars lost in government revenue. CNN cannot independently verify those figures.\n\nAn anti-corruption Sudanese investigator who has tracked Russia’s gold dealings in Sudan for years provided CNN with the coordinates of a key Russian processing plant. When CNN arrived at the site, some five miles from al-Ibaidiya, a Soviet flag fluttered above the compound. A Russian fuel truck was parked outside.\n\nA casual encounter with the guard – who confirmed that the facility belonged to the so-called “Russian company” – quickly turned into a tense confrontation.\n\nThe guard spoke through a walkie talkie, conveying CNN’s request to speak to “the Russian manager.” A group of Sudanese men then rushed to the scene and ordered the CNN crew to leave, before the CNN car was tailed by the security detail.\n\n“You need to go,” another Sudanese employee at the plant told CNN. “This isn’t a Russian company. It is a Sudanese company called al-Solag.”\n\nA Soviet flag flies over the processing plant deep in the Sudanese desert, a facility known to locals as the \"Russian company.\" Alex Platt, CNN\n\nAl-Solag is a Sudanese front company for Meroe Gold, the US-sanctioned Russian mining business, according to five official Sudanese sources and company registration documents reviewed by CNN.\n\nAl-Solag’s formation over the last year has marked a key turning point for Russia’s presence in Sudan. Under the new model, Russia’s dealings have receded into the shadows, making the arrangements more reliant on Sudan’s military leadership and further enabling Russian actors to circumvent state institutions, including regulations pertaining to foreign companies, under the guise of a local business. CNN has reached out to Sudan’s military leadership for comment, and received no reply.\n\n‘Too much US scrutiny’\n\nIn 2021, Russia’s Sudan envoy, Vladimir Zheltov, called for an impromptu meeting with Sudanese mining officials.\n\nAppearing visibly nervous, Zheltov demanded that Meroe Gold be “obscured” after becoming subject to “too much US scrutiny,” according to a whistleblower from Sudan’s Ministry of Mining who had first-hand knowledge of the meeting.\n\nBy June of this year, Zheltov’s demands had materialized. The transfer of Meroe Gold’s assets to the Sudanese-owned al-Solag appeared to have been completed. An analysis of the registration documents of the two companies revealed striking similarities, including two identical lists of legal penalties.\n\nUnder Sudanese law, a company wishing to transfer their holdings must also transfer judgments against it. It is illegal to have an undeclared foreign partner.\n\nSudan’s anti-corruption committee, a watchdog set up to assist Sudan’s transition to democracy, then blocked the attempted subterfuge, according to a former civilian official with direct knowledge of the events. The anti-corruption committee sent a detailed report to the armed forces in September 2021 with evidence of the Meroe Gold transfer to al-Solag, urging them to stop what they dubbed a “crime against the state.”\n\nThe watchdog also accused the military of complicity in Russia’s dealings, drawing the ire of the military leadership who lambasted the committee for “harming the armed forces,” according to the former civilian official.\n\n“The Russians and Sudanese officers saw the civilians in the government as an obstacle to their plans,” the former official added.\n\nIn October 2021, a month after the anti-corruption committee stopped the transfer of holdings from Meroe Gold to al-Solag, Sudan’s military staged a coup – which US official and former official sources accuse Russia of backing – and the junta immediately dismantled the committee.\n\n“Russia is a parasite,” the former official told CNN. “It pillaged Sudan. And it has exacted a very large political penalty by terminating a democratic project that could have turned Sudan into a great nation.”\n\nGen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary unit, is a key beneficiary from Russian support, as the primary recipient of Moscow’s weapons and training. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan – the country’s military ruler – is also believed by CNN’s Sudanese sources to be backed by Russia.\n\nHuman rights groups have implicated both Burhan and Dagalo (known as Hemedti) in alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during Sudan’s Darfur conflict that started in 2003.\n\nOn the same day that Russia launched its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Hemedti was heading a Sudanese delegation in Moscow to “advance relations” between the two countries.\n\nWagner boots on the ground\n\nOn a dusty border-crossing between the CAR and Sudan in March 2019, a bespectacled 34-year-old Russian frantically sent his boss – Meroe Gold owner Mikhail Potepkin – a plea for help.\n\n“Radimir is pissed that no one was warned,” wrote Aleksei Pankov in a Telegram conversation which the Dossier Center shared with CNN. He was referring to Kuznetsov, the menacing high-level Wagner operative, depicted as manning the border alongside Sudanese intelligence operatives.\n\n“Tell Radimir that it was a ‘closed’ operation. That’s why we didn’t warn him about it,” came Potepkin’s reply.\n\n“F**k, Radimir is scary. I almost s**t my pants,” Pankov wrote back.\n\nThis exchange is part of a string of evidence collected by CNN that establishes Kuznetsov as a key Wagner enforcer across key locations in Sudan.\n\nCNN has also seen official Sudanese communiques referencing Kuznetsov as a “problematic” armed Russian who was overseeing security at the Russian gold processing plant near al-Ibaidiya. A source familiar with Meroe Gold’s activities in Sudan told CNN that Kuznetsov also frequented the company’s offices in Khartoum.\n\nWagner operatives deploy to Sudan on a rotational basis, the Dossier Center told CNN, and Kuznetsov may be one of several Wagner men in the country. These are strategically dispatched to protect Russia’s smuggling scheme that has grown in importance since Russia launched its war on Ukraine.\n\nThose Wagner operatives appear to be part of a growing climate of fear as Moscow tightens its grip on Sudan’s gold pipeline, sources say.\n\nSeveral local journalism networks whose work CNN has drawn on for this report – such as Mujo Press, al-Bahshoum and activist journalist Hisham Ali’s Facebook page – have been targeted in recent months, driven into exile under the threat of assassination. Ten protesters were gunned down in demonstrations in June alone, three of whom were prominent pro-democracy activists. CNN security sources believe they were deliberately targeted.\n\nHigh-level Sudanese officials repeatedly urged CNN’s Nima Elbagir to steer clear of protest sites. Since CNN began this investigation, Elbagir has been put on the military junta’s hit list, according to multiple Sudanese security sources.\n\nAs images of Russian tanks encircling Kyiv were flashing on TV screens at Khartoum International Airport, employees watched as the plane laden with cookies and gold took off last February. Senior army brass had intervened and a sense of foreboding set in.\n\nSome of the officials who uncovered the haul were reassigned, some to regional duty stations, and others were sent to army reserves, according to a source with direct knowledge of the incident.\n\n“They paid for doing their jobs,” the source told CNN.", "authors": ["Nima Elbagir Barbara Arvanitidis Tamara Qiblawi Gianluca Mezzofiore Mohammed Abo Al Gheit Marco Chacón Natalie Croker Henrik Pettersson", "Cnn Exclusive", "Nima Elbagir", "Barbara Arvanitidis", "Tamara Qiblawi", "Gianluca Mezzofiore", "Mohammed Abo Al Gheit", "Marco Chacón", "Natalie Croker", "Henrik Pettersson"], "publish_date": "2022/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/politics/trump-mar-a-lago-investigation/index.html", "title": "FBI took 11 sets of classified material from Trump's Mar-a-Lago ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Justice Department removed 11 sets of classified documents from former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence while executing a search warrant this week for possible violations of the Espionage Act and other crimes, according to court documents unsealed and released on Friday.\n\nThe property receipt, which was also released on Friday, for Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home shows that some of the materials recovered were marked as “top secret/SCI” – one of the highest levels of classification.\n\nThe search warrant identifies three federal crimes that the Justice Department is looking at as part of its investigation: violations of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice and criminal handling of government records. The inclusion of the crimes indicates the Justice Department has probable cause to investigate those offenses as it was gathering evidence in the search. No one has been charged with a crime at this time.\n\nThe warrant receipt didn’t detail the subject of these classified documents but did note that federal agents seized just one set marked “top secret/SCI.”\n\nAgents also took four sets of “top secret” documents, three sets of “secret” documents, and three sets of “confidential” documents, court documents show. In total, the unsealed warrant shows the FBI collected more than 20 boxes, as well as binders of photos, sets of classified government materials and at least one handwritten note.\n\nThe warrant, which was unsealed and released publicly following a federal judge’s order, was obtained by CNN ahead of its release. The moment marks an unprecedented week that began with the search – an evidence-gathering step in a national security investigation.\n\nSearch warrant reveals new details about scope of FBI probe\n\nWhile details about the documents themselves remain scarce, the laws cited in the warrant offer new insight into what the FBI was looking for when it searched Trump’s home, an unprecedented step that has prompted a firestorm of criticism from the former President’s closest allies.\n\nThe laws cover “destroying or concealing documents to obstruct government investigations” and the unlawful removal of government records, according to the search warrant released Friday.\n\nAlso among the laws listed is one known as the Espionage Act, which relates to the “retrieval, storage, or transmission of national defense information or classified material.”\n\nAll three criminal laws cited in the warrant are from Title 18 of the United States Code. None of them solely hinge on whether information was deemed to be unclassified.\n\nOne of the less-sensitive items taken from Trump’s resort, according to a the property receipt, was a document about pardoning Roger Stone, a staunch Trump ally who was convicted in 2019 of lying to Congress during its probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. (Trump pardoned Stone before leaving office, shielding Stone from a three-year prison term.)\n\nIt’s unclear how the Stone-related document seized during the search is tied to the broader criminal probe into Trump’s potential mishandling of classified materials.\n\nDuring the search, FBI agents also recovered material about the “President of France,” according to the warrant receipt. The French embassy in Washington declined to respond Friday to the development.\n\nFBI agents searched ’45 Office’ at Mar-a-Lago\n\nThe court documents released Friday also offer new details about the search itself and revealed that FBI agents were only allowed access to specific locations within Mar-a-Lago as they combed Trump’s resort residence for potential evidence of crimes.\n\nThe judge authorized the FBI to search what the bureau called the “45 Office,” an apparent reference to Trump’s place in history as the 45th President. Agents were also permitted to search “all other rooms or areas” at Mar-a-Lago that were available to Trump and his staff for storing boxes and documents.\n\n“The locations to be searched include the ’45 Office,’ all storage rooms, and all other rooms or areas within the premises used or available to be used by FPOTUS and his staff and in which boxes or documents could be stored, including all structures or buildings on the estate,” the warrant says, using the acronym “FPOTUS” to refer to the Former President of the United States.\n\nThe FBI’s warrant application to the judge specifically said that federal agents would avoid areas being rented or used by third parties, “such as Mar-a-Lago members” and “private guest suites.” Trump owns the sprawling estate, and it is his primary residence as well as a members-only club and resort.\n\n“It is described as a mansion with approximately 58 bedrooms, 33 bathrooms, on a 17-acre estate,” FBI agents told the judge in their application, describing the Mar-a-Lago property.\n\nTrump did not oppose release of search warrant\n\nThe FBI search at the resort in Palm Beach, Florida, on Monday was followed by days of silence from the Justice Department, as is the department’s normal practice for ongoing investigations.\n\nThen on Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the department had moved to unseal the search warrant and two attachments, including an inventory list, but also stressed that some of the department’s work must happen outside of public view.\n\n“We do that to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans and to protect the integrity of our investigations,” Garland said, while explaining that he would not provide more detail about the basis of the search.\n\nTrump said in a late-night post on his Truth Social platform Thursday that he would “not oppose the release of documents” and that he was “going a step further by ENCOURAGING the immediate release of those documents.”\n\nThe court had instructed the Justice Department to confer with Trump about its request to unseal the warrant documents and set a Friday deadline to report back on whether he opposed their release.\n\nTrump’s team had contacted outside attorneys about how to proceed, and the former President’s orbit was caught off guard by Garland’s announcement.\n\nIn a pair of posts to Truth Social following Garland’s statement, Trump continued to claim that his attorneys were “cooperating fully” and had developed “very good relationships” with federal investigators prior to Monday’s search at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n“The government could have had whatever they wanted, if we had it,” Trump said. “Everything was fine, better than most previous Presidents, and then, out of nowhere and with no warning, Mar-a-Lago was raided, at 6:30 in the morning, by VERY large numbers of agents, and even ‘safecrackers.’”\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Katelyn Polantz Zachary Cohen Sara Murray Marshall Cohen", "Katelyn Polantz", "Zachary Cohen", "Sara Murray", "Marshall Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/23/europe/russia-belgorod-submarine-nuclear-torpedo-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "title": "Belgorod submarine: Russian Navy's massive sub could set the ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nThe Russian Navy has taken delivery of what is the world’s longest known submarine, one its maker touts as a research vessel – but what others say is a platform for espionage and possibly nuclear weapons.\n\nThe Belgorod was turned over to the Russian Navy earlier this month in the port of Severodvinsk, according to the country’s largest shipbuilder, Sevmash Shipyard.\n\nExperts say its design is a modified version of Russia’s Oscar II class guided-missile submarines, made longer with the aim to eventually accommodate the world’s first nuclear-armed stealth torpedoes and equipment for intelligence gathering.\n\nIf the Belgorod can successfully add those new capabilities to the Russian fleet, it could in the next decade set the stage for a return to scenes of the Cold War under the ocean, with US and Russian subs tracking and hunting each other in tense face-offs.\n\nAt more than 184 meters (608 feet), the Belgorod is the longest submarine in the ocean today – longer even than the US Navy’s Ohio class ballistic and guided missile submarines, which come in at 171 meters (569 feet).\n\nThe Belgorod was floated in 2019 and was expected to be delivered to the Russian Navy in 2020 after trials and testing, but those were delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, Russia’s state-run TASS news agency reported. No timeline for the sub’s first deployment was given.\n\n‘Mega torpedo’\n\nWhat sets the Belgorod apart from any of the nuclear-powered submarines in the Russian fleet – or indeed from any of the nuclear submarines operated anywhere in the world – is its mission.\n\nTASS has reported that the sub will carry the in-development Poseidon nuclear-capable torpedoes, which are being designed to be launched from hundreds of miles away and to sneak past coastal defenses by traveling along the sea floor.\n\n“This nuclear ‘mega torpedo’ is unique in the history of the world,” American submarine expert H. I. Sutton wrote on his Covert Shores website in March.\n\n“Poseidon is a completely new category of weapon. It will reshape naval planning in both Russia and the West, leading to new requirements and new counter-weapons,” Sutton wrote.\n\nBoth US and Russian officials have said the torpedoes could deliver warheads of multiple megatons, causing radioactive waves that would render swathes of the target coastline uninhabitable for decades.\n\nIn November 2020, Christopher A. Ford, then assistant secretary of state for international security and non-proliferation, said Poseidons are being designed to “inundate US coastal cities with radioactive tsunamis.”\n\nA US Congressional Research Service (CRS) report in April said Poseidons are intended as retaliatory weapons, designed to hit back at an enemy after a nuclear strike on Russia.\n\nAccording to the CRS report, the Belgorod would be capable of carrying up to eight Poseidons, though some weapons experts say its payload is more likely to be six torpedoes.\n\nSutton wrote in 2019 that the Poseidon, which is expected to be 2 meters (6.5 feet) in diameter and over 20 meters (65 feet) long, “is the largest torpedo ever developed in any country.”\n\nThat’s “thirty times the size of a regular ‘heavyweight’ torpedo,” Sutton wrote.\n\nTorpedo doubts\n\nThe CRS reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin had touted the Poseidons in a 2018 speech, saying, “They are quiet, highly maneuverable and have hardly any vulnerabilities for the enemy to exploit.”\n\nIf armed with conventional warheads, the Poseidons could be used against targets “including aircraft carrier groups, shore fortifications, and infrastructure,” Putin reportedly said.\n\nBut there are doubts about the weapon and whether it will eventually be added to Russia’s arsenal.\n\n“This is still a technology in development, both the torpedo and the platform,” said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists.\n\nThe Poseidon is not expected to be ready for deployment until the second half of this decade, he said. The CRS said it did not expect the Poseidon torpedoes to be deployed until 2027.\n\nAnd Kristensen points out that the Belgorod itself is really a test vessel for the coming Khabarovsk class of nuclear-powered submarines, the first of which could be launched this year.\n\nThen there is the poor performance of the Russian military in its war on Ukraine, part of which analysts blame on bad weapons design and corruption which has seen maintenance of Russian military hardware neglected.\n\n“Ukraine is a reminder that Russian advanced weapons are not silver bullets but suffer from reliability issues. There is every reason to believe that an intercontinental-range nuclear-powered torpedo will have its fair share of problems,” Kristensen said.\n\nBut other experts caution against any assumption that the sub or the Poseidon torpedoes may not be what is advertised.\n\n“Transposing impressions of the Russian ground and tactical air forces to Russian undersea and nuclear forces – in particular, impressions based on watching the execution of a pretty bad plan in Ukraine – could lead to a dangerous underestimation of those Russian strategic forces’ competence and capability,” said Thomas Shugart, a former US Navy submarine captain and now an analyst at the Center for a New American Security.\n\n“It would be sort of like observing the US’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, and then as a result questioning the ability of its ballistic missile submarines to execute their nuclear mission – a conclusion the US’ adversaries would draw only at their own great peril.”\n\n‘Underwater game of cat and mouse’\n\nThe Belgorod may be only the first in a fleet of four submarines that could carry the Poseidon torpedoes, the CRS said, with two destined for service in Russia’s Pacific Fleet and two in its Northern Fleet.\n\nSutton, of Covert Shores, wrote in 2020 that the next three Poseidon-armed subs, the aforementioned Khabarovsk class, “are likely to be the defining submarine of the 2020s because they represent a novel and difficult adversary.”\n\n“Other navies are unlikely to emulate it, but they will want to counter it,” Sutton said of the Khabarovsk class. “The underwater game of cat and mouse where US Navy and (British) Royal Navy hunter-killer submarines stalk the Russians could be reinvigorated. A new Cold War in the Arctic, North Atlantic and North Pacific” could be coming, he wrote.\n\nWhile the Belgorod could be the future Poseidon test launcher, Sutton said the submarine would likely also operate as an intelligence gathering platform.\n\n“It will be crewed by the Russian Navy but operated under GUGI, the secretive Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research organization,” and carry a range of midget submarines and submersibles “to conduct covert special missions,” Sutton wrote.\n\nIn a news release earlier this month, the Russian shipbuilder highlighted the Belgorod’s non-lethal capabilities, saying it opened up “new opportunities for Russia” to conduct “scientific expeditions and rescue operations in the most remote areas of the world ocean.”", "authors": ["Brad Lendon"], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/02/politics/china-hacking-espionage-us-agencies/index.html", "title": "Chinese hacking group targeting US agencies and companies has ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nAn elite Chinese hacking group with ties to operatives indicted by a US grand jury in 2020 has surged its activity this year, targeting sensitive data held by companies and government agencies in the US and dozens of other countries, according to an expert at consulting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\nThe findings highlight the biggest cyber-espionage challenge facing the Biden administration: combating a Chinese hacking program that the FBI has called more prolific than that of all other governments in the world combined.\n\nThe Justice Department has aggressively sought to expose the alleged data-stealing campaigns through indictments, and made the case that Chinese hackers have robbed American companies of intellectual property, causing huge losses. But China-based hackers have often developed new tools or otherwise altered their operations, according to analysts.\n\nOne of the Chinese groups tracked by PwC has targeted dozens of US organizations in the last year, including government agencies and software or tech firms, said Kris McConkey, who leads PwC’s global cyber threat intelligence practice. The intruders often comb networks for data that could offer insights into foreign or trade policy, he said, but also dabble in cryptocurrency schemes for personal profit. He declined to detail what types of US government agencies, whether at the federal, state or local level, were targeted.\n\n“They are, by far, the most active and globally impactful [hacking group] that we track at the minute,” McConkey, who closely follows China-based hackers, told CNN. He believes the attackers have been successful in breaching at least some organizations because they operate on a vast scale, targeting organizations in at least 35 countries this year alone.\n\nMcConkey traced part of the activity to an ostensibly legitimate cybersecurity company based in the Chinese city of Chengdu, but he stopped short of publicly connecting the hacking to the Chinese government. US officials have for years accused China of using front companies to conduct hacking that feeds the government’s sprawling intelligence collection efforts.\n\nChina has repeatedly denied allegations of hacking and Beijing has in recent months stepped up its own accusations that Washington has conducted cyber operations against Chinese assets.\n\nCybersecurity issues have been a repeated source of friction between the world’s two biggest economies; President Joe Biden raised the subject on a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping last year.\n\nMcConkey was one of multiple private cyber specialists who exposed the operations, and sometimes the alleged locations, of hackers from China, Iran and elsewhere at a recent conference called LABScon, hosted by US security firm SentinelOne, in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nAdam Kozy, who tracked Chinese hackers at the FBI from 2011 to 2013, showed the audience a photo of a People’s Liberation Army building in the city of Fuzhou that allegedly houses officers who conduct information operations against Chinese adversaries. That unit has targeted Taiwan, Kozy said, and “is the main area for China’s disinformation operations.”\n\nIn their investigations of foreign hackers, the FBI and Justice Department prosecutors have drawn on those types of revelations from private researchers.\n\nAt least one FBI agent and officials from the National Security Agency and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency attended the conference, a reminder of how reliant government officials are on data held by tech firms to pursue spies and cybercriminals. Sometimes that work happens not in a classified facility but in the halls of a luxury hotel.\n\nMorgan Adamski, a senior NSA official, told conference attendees that the coronavirus pandemic changed how her agency worked with private firms to guard sensitive data targeted by hackers.\n\n“The pandemic actually helped because it no longer revolved around big government meetings in a room, in a SCIF [Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Facility], where you couldn’t use any of the information,” said Adamski, who heads the NSA’s Cybersecurity Collaboration Center, which works with defense contractors to blunt the impact of foreign hacking.\n\nAfter US defense contractors began working from home during the pandemic, she said, Chinese government hackers exploited the virtual private networking (VPN) software the contractors were using. One hacked contractor, which she didn’t name, shared data with federal agencies so they could build a clearer picture of what was going on.\n\nAsked by CNN whether the NSA and other federal agencies responding to the hacks were able to evict the Chinese hackers, Adamski said it’s an iterative process.\n\n“When you talk about nation-state actors, you kick them out, but they’re going to come back,” Adamski said, “especially if you’re a defense industrial base company that is producing critical military intelligence for the Department of Defense.”", "authors": ["Sean Lyngaas"], "publish_date": "2022/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/05/31/suspected-chinese-spies-posing-as-tourists-discovered-in-alaska/70260712007/", "title": "Suspected Chinese spies posing as tourists discovered in Alaska", "text": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska – Chinese citizens posing as tourists but suspected of being spies have made several attempts in recent years to gain access to military facilities in this vast state studded with sensitive bases, according to U.S. officials.\n\nIn one incident, a vehicle with Chinese citizens blew past a security checkpoint at Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks, several soldiers told USA TODAY. The vehicle was eventually stopped, and a search found a drone inside the vehicle. The occupants claimed they were tourists who had gotten lost.\n\nMany of the encounters have been chalked up to innocent mistakes by foreign visitors intent on viewing the northern lights and other attractions in Alaska, officials say. Other attempts to enter U.S. military bases, however, seem to be probes to learn about U.S. military capabilities in Alaska, according to multiple soldiers familiar with the incidents but who were not authorized to speak publicly about them.\n\nNot all who appear to be tourists in Alaska, are, in fact tourists, one Army officer said. Instead, they are foreign spies.\n\nDetails about the incidents remain mostly classified. However, military briefings and publicly available information lay out why the Chinese government would be interested in Alaska where some of the Pentagon's most sophisticated military capabilities and high-end war games reside.\n\nThe Pentagon's No. 2 official, Kathleen Hicks, demurred when asked to comment on suspected Chinese spying at military facilities in Alaska. She said the military is taking a number of steps to make sure those bases are secure but she gave no specifics.\n\nFBI and Justice Department involvement\n\nThe FBI and Department of Justice take over cases from the military involving suspected spies.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray regularly sounds alarms about Chinese government-sponsored espionage, blaming Communist leaders there, not its citizens or Chinese Americans.\n\nWray has estimated that the FBI opens a new investigation on Chinese-government sponsored espionage every 12 hours.\n\n“There is no doubt that the greatest long-term threat to our nation’s ideas, our economic security and our national security is that posed by the Chinese communist government,” Wray said in a speech in April.\n\nA key concern about instrusions on U.S. military bases may have as much to do about what is left behind than photos taken, said David Deptula, a retired three-star Air Force general who was the service's senior officer for intelligence.\n\nSpies could leave behind sensors that could pick up sensitive communications, according to Deptula, who is now dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Power Studies.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to emails and phone calls requesting comment.\n\nWhy Alaska? Radars, missiles, cutting-edge war games\n\nAlaska hosts three large military bases – Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, and Fort Wainwright and Eielson Air Force Base near Fairbanks – along with several smaller installations. Once regarded as a backwater in the military, Alaska has seen the Pentagon increasingly funnel resources and troops to the state in recent years as competition in the Arctic heats up. The state is also seen as key to homeland defense given its proximity to Russia, the ballistic missile threat from North Korea and, increasingly, China.\n\nThe Air Force has based its top fighter jets, F-22s and F-35s, in Alaska. The Army's Fort Greely, near Fairbanks, has sophisticated radars and missiles poised to defend against nuclear attack. Last year, the Army activated the 11th Airborne Division in Alaska as arctic warfare specialists. There are about 12,000 soldiers and 10,000 active-duty Air Force personnel stationed in Alaska.\n\nAlaska's vast wilderness affords the Pentagon the opportunity to conduct major military exercises over land and at sea. Thousands of troops and more than 150 warplanes from the United States, United Kingdom and Australia warplanes took part in the recent Northern Edge war game. The annual exercise helps troops train against the United States' greatest military adversaries: Russia and China.\n\nTensions between the United States and China have risen over the last year. The Chinese spy balloon crossed the United States caused a diplomatic rupture, prompting secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a trip to Beijing. China's support for Russia after its illegal invasion of Ukraine is another point of friction. And China's designs on Taiwan, the recipient of billions in U.S. military aid, have deepened distrust.\n\nThose tensions were highlighted May 26 when a Chinese fighter jet had a dangerous encounter with a U.S. spy plane flying over international waters in the South China Sea, according to the Pentagon's Indo-Pacific Command. The Chinese jet flew in front of the U.S. Air Force Rivet Joint reconnaisance, forcing it to encounter turbulence, the Indo-Pacific Command announced Tuesday.\n\nAlaska's size – two-and-a-half times the size of Texas – remoteness and savage winter cold, once viewed as protective barriers, provide less security for prying eyes. Global warming has opened shipping lanes in the Arctic, and the Pentagon has tracked Chinese fishing fleets moving farther north toward Alaska in recent years in search of greater catches.\n\nBeefed up security at military sites\n\nSecurity at some military sites in Alaska has been beefed up as the Pentagon focuses on the arctic, two officials said.\n\nIn a September interview with the Pentagon's news agency last fall, Iris Ferguson, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Arctic and Global Resiliences said Chinese leaders have \"been trying to insert themselves into the Arctic.\"\n\n\"So, we're being very mindful about their activity and in wanting to ensure that our interests are protected in the region,\" Ferguson said.\n\nIn late January, the Chinese spy balloon, rigged with high-tech sensors, first penetrated U.S. airspace over Alaska's Aleutian Islands, an 1,100-mile archipelago. The incident seized public attention as it drifted across the continent and maneuvered over sensitive military sites before being shot down off the coast of South Carolina. The long-range radar installations that ring the state, once focused mainly on Russian warplanes, are now calibrated to detect spy balloons from China.\n\nDuring a recent visit to Alaska, Hicks was asked about potential incidents of Chinese spying. She did not acknowledge them, instead focusing on efforts in general to keep bases secure.\n\n\"We take the safety and security of our people in our installations very seriously,\" said Hicks, the deputy defense secretary. \"We always live with the possibility of intrusion on our installations, and so we work very hard to make sure, working alongside state and local authorities and others, that those bases and installations are protected from threats. We take a lot of measures to do that. And we're going to make sure we can continue to protect our installation so our folks can perform their missions.\"\n\nIn recent years, there have been other intrusions at military bases in the Lower 48 states.\n\nIn 2019, a federal judge sentenced a Chinese student to a year in prison for illegally taking photos at Naval Air Station Key West in Florida. His lawyer said Zhao Qianli, 20, was just a tourist who had gotten lost, according to The Associated Press. But the naval base, where F-35 pilots train, is not a tourist hotspot. It is clearly marked off limits, and Zhao's camera and cellphone had only photos from the air station.\n\nJust 10 years ago, women were banned from combat. Now, they're on the front lines, climbing the ranks.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/31"}]}

And — for the time being — he is atop the all-time leaderboard for career Grand Slams among men's players.\n\nDjokovic, 36, defeated Casper Ruud on Sunday in straight sets 7-6 (1), 6-3, 7-5 to win the French Open championship at Court Philippe-Chatrier in the outskirts of Paris. The title surpasses the mark that he had shared with Rafael Nadal, who skipped the French Open due to a hip injury. Djokovic's 23 Grand Slams puts him in a tie with women's tennis icon Serena Williams for career slams and Margaret Court is the record holder with 24.\n\nThe victory follows Djokovic's title at the Australian Open in January, which means that he is now two Grand Slams away from winning the Calendar Slam for the 2023 season; Wimbledon starts next month and the U.S. Open begins in late August. This is Djokovic's third French Open title.\n\nDjokovic, who wore a custom red jacket with the number 23 on the right breast after he won, sat on the bench after briefly celebrating with his family and draped a towel over his head where he became emotional.\n\n“I am beyond fortunate in my life to win 23 times Grand Slams,” Djokovic said during the trophy presentation. “It’s an incredible feeling.”\n\nThe match started with a grueling opening set that took more than an hour and 20 minutes to complete. Ruud was in position to take the set, which would've been his first ever against Djokovic, after he raced out to an early 3-0 lead. Djokovic, however, chipped away and eventually brought the set to a tiebreak, where he took control with an assertive serve and precise ball placement on his shots, winning the tiebreak, 7-1.\n\nAfter the first set, Ruud continued his slide in large part due to unforced errors and apparent sluggishness. Djokovic, meanwhile, course corrected from his early-match struggles and ramped up his focus, peppering shots past Ruud to win the first three games of the set. Djokovic also alternated the speeds of his shots far more efficiently than he had early in the match.\n\nRuud, who has only once in his career come back from a two-set deficit to win a match, took the first game of the third set but Djokovic responded by not allowing Ruud to score a single point in the second game. Ruud battled back to take the third game of the set, but Djokovic again answered to take the fourth. Both players continued to alternate games until they were tied at 5-5 before Djokovic broke serve to put himself in position to claim the title. He would go on to easily win the final game of the tournament.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/961293/quiz-of-the-week-10-16-june", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 10 - 16 June | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

It’s not easy and I’m not the first victim – I know that there have been many before.”\n\nNadal was defeated by Djokovic in the semifinals of last year’s French Open – ending a run of four consecutive titles – but defeated his rival in the quarters this year before a walkover against Alexander Zverev in the semis.\n\nThe win against Ruud backs up the Australian Open title he won in January, the first time in his career Nadal has won the first two grand slams in the calendar year.\n\nNadal and Ruud pose after Sunday's game.

The first set was tight until 6-all, and then Djokovic simply took over, dominating the tiebreaker — as he often does — and the second set, before grabbing 12 of the last 13 points to seal the victory.\n\nThat allowed Djokovic to break his tie with Nadal at 22 majors.

Djokovic has dominated on Melbourne’s hard courts with 10 of his 23 slams coming in Australia. Nadal is the all-time “king of clay” with 14 French Open victories out of his 22.

I am sure that’s going to happen; 14 Roland Garros is something … very difficult.”\n\nNadal celebrates with his 14th French Open title. Clive Brunskill/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nIn the 17 years between Nadal’s first and most recent French Open titles, he has lost just three matches on the Paris clay – two against Djokovic, including in the semifinals last year, and one against Robin Soderling.\n\nSunday’s win saw Nadal, who turned 36 on Friday, become the oldest men’s champion at Roland Garros, and it was also the first time he has won both the Australian Open and French Open in the same calendar year to take him clear of Federer and Djokovic’s grand slam tallies.\n\n“Of course, I want to be the player with (most) grand slams in history – that’s competition,” said Nadal.\n\n“But it’s not something that I am obsessed (with) and it’s not something that changed my mind … Honestly, it’s something that does not bother me if Novak wins 23 and I stay with 22. I think my happiness will not change at all, not even one percent.”\n\nPlaying while injured\n\nEvents leading up to this year’s French Open are likely to make this title seem particularly special – not least improbable – to Nadal.\n\nAt last month’s Italian Open, he bowed out of the tournament against Denis Shapovalov in the last 16 while battling a foot injury – an ongoing problem that Nadal said required daily injections at the French Open in order to keep playing and training.\n\nIt meant he played the final without any feeling in his foot.\n\n“After the pandemic, something happened in my foot. I am not able to manage the pain to play often and even practice,” said Nadal, who has been beset by injury problems throughout his career.\n\n“The only thing I can say is going through all these challenges, I always hold the passion to keep going and I always hold the love for the game,” he added. “I always wanted to keep going. That’s probably why I am in the position that I am today.”\n\nNadal holds aloft La Coupe des Mousquetaires (The Musketeers' Trophy) at Roland Garros. Ryan Pierse/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nIn Sunday’s press conference, Nadal said he would undergo “radio frequency injection” on the nerve in his foot in a bid to ease the pain and continue playing.\n\nWhether he competes at Wimbledon later this month depends on the success of that treatment, and for now, his long-term future in the sport is unclear.\n\n“I never had in my mind (plans) to announce any retirement after this event, but of course, there is a possibility that things are not improving,” he said. “Then I don’t know what can happen.”\n\nIs the ‘King of Clay’ now just ‘The King’?\n\nWinning the first two grand slams of the year means Nadal, for the first time in his career, can potentially win a calendar grand slam by triumphing at Wimbledon and the US Open.\n\nIt’s a feat Djokovic came one game away from completing last year, and one no male player has achieved since Rod Laver in 1969.\n\n“The chances are small in this health situation,” tennis journalist Christopher Clarey told CNN Sport’s Christina Macfarlane on Monday about the likelihood of Nadal triumphing at the next two grand slam tournaments.\n\n“Wimbledon is not his best surface anymore; it’s been a while since he won. But how can you not try for that if you’re healthy?”\n\nNadal plays a forehand against Ruud in the French Open final. ANNE-CHRISTINE POUJOULAT/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nEven if he does not add to his grand slam tally, it will be impossible to ever question Nadal’s status as one of the greatest to play the game. And in time, “the King of Clay” may be remembered simply as “the King.”\n\n“I achieved my dream and I enjoy what I am doing,” said Nadal, who remains unconcerned about how he ranks among his peers.\n\n“I know the press and people are always caring a lot about this stuff, but in some way, I am an important part of the history of the sport and that makes me feel proud and happy.\n\n“At the end, it doesn’t matter much.”", "authors": ["George Ramsay Christiane Amanpour Alicia Lloyd", "George Ramsay", "Christiane Amanpour", "Alicia Lloyd"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/french/2016/06/05/novak-djokovic-beats-andy-murray-final-makes-history/85444468/", "title": "Novak Djokovic beats Andy Murray in final, makes history", "text": "Nick McCarvel\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY Sports\n\nPARIS — For Novak Djokovic, the fifth time was the charm.\n\nThe world No. 1 captured the French Open for the first time in his career, coming from behind to beat No. 2-ranked Andy Murray 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 and making history in Paris by completing the career Grand Slam. Djokovic becomes the first man to hold all four major titles at the same time since 1969.\n\nDjokovic, 29, had tried four times previously to win here having already won the other three majors in this sport. From 2012 to 2015, he reached the final three times, but Sunday he finally joined Rod Laver, Andre Agassi, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal as the only men to claim the career Grand Slam in the Open era.\n\nIt’s the most precious jewel Djokovic can add to his already heavy tennis crown. He is by far the best man in the world over the last two years and winner of 12 majors, behind only Federer (17) , Nadal (14) and Pete Sampras (14) in Grand Slams won during the Open era.\n\n“It's incredibly flattering to know that Rod Laver is the last one that managed to do that,” Djokovic said of holding all Grand Slam titles at once. “There is not many words that can describe it. It's one of the ultimate challenges that you have as a tennis player.”\n\n\"I’m very proud, very thrilled, obviously,\" he added. \"It's hard for me to reflect on what has happened before and what's gonna happen after. I mean, I'm just so overwhelmed with having this trophy next to me that I'm just trying to enjoy this moment.”\n\nWhile Djokovic made more history on Sunday, he put himself halfway to the calendar Grand Slam, not done in men’s tennis since Laver in 1969. American Jim Courier was the last men’s player to get halfway to the Slam, having won the Australian and French Opens back-to-back in 1992.\n\nIt’s another oh-so-close result for Murray, a known boxing fan who has become Djokovic’s punching bag at the finish line of the majors. Djokovic has won eight out of 10 meetings at the Slams between the two, including the last three finals: the 2015 and 2016 Australian Opens, and again here on Sunday.\n\n\"This is his day today,\" Murray said on court of Djokovic, his voice cracking. \"What he has achieved the last 12 months is phenomenal. Winning all four of the Grand Slams in one year is an amazing achievement. This is something that is so rare in tennis, it hasn’t happened in an extremely long time. And it’s not going to happen for a long time.\"\n\nGarbine Muguruza wins first Grand Slam, emerges as young star\n\nHe then added, in great humor: \"Me, personally, being on the opposite side of the net, it sucks to lose the match but… I’m proud to be part of today.\"\n\nDjokovic lost the first set to Murray, after a rip-roaring start in which he broke the Briton to love before losing six out of the next eight games, Murray taking the set in 45 minutes when Djokovic netted a routine backhand.\n\nBut Djokovic – with a loud Serbian contingent willing him on – pounced in set two, taking a 3-0 lead and taking command in the match with his court-extending, carefully aggressive tennis. His buoyant, physical game is most apparent on clay, rarely a ball gets past him as he rules the baseline. He won the second set 6-1 in 33 minutes and then the third 6-2 in 43 minutes.\n\nWhile Djokovic-Murray battles are always characterized by lengthy baseline exchanges and are a test of which man is the fittest, this one lost its air after the first set. Djokovic appeared nervous early – perhaps mindful of the history he was on court to chase, again – as Murray came out as the aggressor.\n\nFrom there it was one-way traffic as he approached the finish line, Djokovic’s tennis suffocating an already-breathless Murray, who topped the 20-hour mark on court midway through the match.\n\nDjokovic sprinted to a 5-2 double-break lead in the fourth and looked to have the trophy in his hands as he served for the championship, but Murray had other ideas. In a final plot twist, the Dunbane, Scotland, native broke for the first time since the first set and then held, putting the pressure back on Djokovic’s shoulders.\n\nIt was here, at 5-4 in the fourth, that Djokovic would finally realize his dream, however. He sped to a 40-15 lead only to double fault at his first championship point, then missed a backhand up the line on number two. As the clock ticked over the three-hour mark, however, he completed history, he and Murray exchanging baseline blows when Murray missed a backhand into the net, match – and career Slam – done.\n\nDjokovic fell to his back, then drew a heart in the clay with his racket, laying in the middle of it, an ode to former champion Gustavo Kuerten, the Brazilian who won here three times and was who watching from the crowd.\n\n“In the last point I don't even remember what happened,” Djokovic said. “It was really one of those moments where you just try to be there. It's like my spirit has left my body and I was just observing my body fight the last three, four exchanges, going left to right and hoping that Andy will make a mistake. It was a thrilling moment. One of the most beautiful I have had in my career.”\n\nPHOTOS: FRENCH OPEN FINALS\n\nDjokovic moves to 44-3 in 2016, capturing a sixth title this season to bring his career total to 65. He is now an astonishing 17-1 against the top 10 this year, as well.\n\nThat one loss came against Murray, their most recent encounter when Murray triumphed 6-3, 6-3 in the Rome final three weeks ago. But that was Murray’s first win over the Serbian in five tries on clay, Djokovic was 15-2 in their last 17 meetings otherwise (and 23-10 overall).\n\nDjokovic got his 24th victory against the persistent Murray, a counterpuncher by nature who has progressed his game on clay over the last two years, winning 33 of 36 matches played on the red dirt prior to Sunday.\n\nMurray has now lost his last four Grand Slam finals in a row, dating to his 2013 win at Wimbledon, the second of his two major titles.\n\n\"I could have served better, that's for sure,\" Murray told reporters. \"I spent more time defending off the back foot than I wanted to.\"\n\nMurray served only at 50 percent, while Djokovic put in 69 percent of his first deliveries. Djokovic was the more lethal of the two, hitting 41 winners to 23 from Murray. Djokovic broke Murray seven times and won an astonishing 48 percent of return points that he played.\n\nDjokovic wins €2 million ($2.27 million USD) for his efforts, having already crossed the $100 million career mark earlier this tournament.\n\nIt was far from his easiest major title, but Djokovic was keyed in from the start, saying after his Australian Open win in January that his eyes were focused solely on winning in Paris and completing the career Grand Slam.\n\nHe lost the first set of his fourth round encounter against Roberto Bautista Agut, which was played at the point of a grey and dreary tournament that was particularly ravaged by rain. Tested, Djokovic played three rounds over four days, his first day off coming Saturday.\n\nBut he is now 12-8 in major finals overall, winning six out of the last seven that he’s played, dating to the Wimbledon final in 2014. Three have been over Murray, another three coming over Federer.\n\nIt’s the Federer conversation, the best-of-all-time debate, that Djokovic continues to thrust himself into. He has a winning record against Roger, Rafa and Andy in a group known as “The Big Four.” And while Federer is no doubt the biggest name in this sport globally, Djokovic continues to press the issue with his growing list of accolades.\n\nTennis watched Serena Williams come within just two matches of the calendar Grand Slam last year, and now Djokovic is halfway there himself: Two Slams down, two to go.\n\nBut – like Serena – he has now outplayed any descriptor or hyperbole that can be written about him. He’s playing for history at every match, something few in the sport can say they have done.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/french/2023/06/09/novak-djokovic-one-win-away-from-record-23rd-grand-slam-at-french-open/70306875007/", "title": "Novak Djokovic tops Carlos Alcaraz, faces Ruud in French Open final", "text": "Novak Djokovic moved one win away from his 23rd Grand Slam singles title with a four-set victory Friday over World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz in the French Open men's semifinals.\n\nDjokovic thrived in the 85-degree heat at Roland Garros, while Alcaraz appeared to be slowed by cramping issues, which turned a competitive match into a relatively easy 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1 victory for Djokovic.\n\nThe turning point may have come early in the third set, when Alcaraz needed to take a break for treatment, forcing him to forfeit the third game because the interruption didn't come during a changeover.\n\n“I feel for him.

What drove him. What inspired him. The biggest titles from his sport’s biggest stages were Djokovic’s main aim and now he finally stands alone — ahead of Rafael Nadal, ahead of Roger Federer, ahead of every man who ever has swung a racket.\n\nIf Djokovic could wait this long to hold this record, he certainly could wait for the half-hour or so it took to straighten out his strokes in the French Open final. And so, after a bit of a shaky start in thick, humid air and under foreboding clouds Sunday, he imposed himself. The opponent at Court Philippe Chatrier, Casper Ruud, never really stood a serious chance after that.\n\nDjokovic earned his men’s-record 23rd Grand Slam singles championship, breaking a tie with Nadal and moving three in front of the retired Federer, with a 7-6 (1), 6-3, 7-5 victory over Ruud that was not in doubt for most of its 3 hours, 13 minutes.\n\nDjokovic puts this one alongside the French Open titles he earned in 2016 and 2021, making him the only man with at least three from each major. He won his very first at the 2008 Australian Open and now possesses a total of 10 trophies from there, seven from Wimbledon and three from the U.S. Open.\n\n“I knew that going into the tournament, going into the match, especially, today, that there is history on the line, but I try to focus my attention and my thoughts into preparing for this match in the best way possible to win, like any other match,” Djokovic said, wearing a red jacket with “23” stitched on the chest. “Of course I would lie if I say that I didn’t think about the finish line that is right there and that one more match is needed to win a trophy — a historic one.”\n\nAlso worth noting: He again is halfway to a calendar-year Grand Slam — winning all four majors in one season — something no man has achieved since Rod Laver in 1969. Djokovic came close in 2021, when he won the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon and made it all the way to the title match at the U.S. Open before losing to Daniil Medvedev.\n\nDjokovic will resume that pursuit at Wimbledon, which begins on the grass of the All England Club on July 3.\n\n“He has this software in his head that he can switch (on) when a Grand Slam comes,” said his coach, Goran Ivanisevic. “The day we arrived here, he was better, he was more motivated, he was more hungry. Every day, he played better and better.”\n\nEntering the 2011 season, this is how the Slam count looked: 16 for Federer, nine for Nadal, one for Djokovic.\n\n“Pretty decent 12 years, I must say, for me,” Djokovic said with a smile.\n\nThe climb began with a trio that year and accelerated lately: He has clutched the trophy at 11 of the last 20 Slams, a remarkable run made even more so when considering that he did not participate in two majors during that span because he did not get vaccinated against COVID-19. Djokovic was deported in January 2021 before the Australian Open, and he was not allowed to fly to the United States ahead of last year’s U.S. Open under a rule that since has been lifted.\n\nGetting to 23 not only sets the mark for men, but it also lets Djokovic equal Serena Williams, who wrapped up her career last year, for the most by anyone in the Open era, which began in 1968. Margaret Court won some of her all-time record of 24 Slam trophies in the amateur era.\n\nAt 20 days past his 36th birthday, the Serb is the oldest singles champion at Roland Garros, considered the most grueling of the majors because of the lengthy, grinding points required by the red clay, which is slower than the grass or hard courts underfoot elsewhere.\n\nNadal’s 22nd major arrived in Paris a year ago, two days after he turned 36. He has been sidelined since January by a hip injury and had arthroscopic surgery on June 2.\n\n“Many congrats on this amazing achievement,” Nadal tweeted shortly after the final concluded. “23 is a number that just a few years back was (impossible) to think about, and you made it!”\n\nDjokovic’s triumph on Sunday means he will return to No. 1 in the ATP rankings on Monday, replacing Carlos Alcaraz. Djokovic already has spent more weeks at the top spot than any player — man or woman — since the inception of computerized tennis rankings a half-century ago.\n\nIt was Djokovic who eliminated Alcaraz in the semifinals on Thursday, wearing him down over two thrilling sets until the 20-year-old Spaniard’s body cramped up badly. Alcaraz continued to play, but the scores of the last two sets of the four-set match told the story: 6-1, 6-1.\n\nThis was the third Slam final in the past five events for Ruud, a 24-year-old from Norway, but he is now 0-3. He lost to Nadal at the French Open a year ago and to Alcaraz at the U.S. Open last September.\n\nPerhaps due to an awareness of all that was at stake, Djokovic, in his 34th major final, was the one who got off to a shaky start.\n\n“Maybe feeling a bit nervous, little stressed,” Ruud said about his opponent.\n\nBut by the close of the first set, Djokovic was downright Djokovic-esque, as he was while taking 12 of the last 13 points of the match, most accompanied by spectators' thunderous chants of his two-syllable nickname, “No-le! No-le! No-le!”\n\nWhen one last miscue from Ruud landed out, Djokovic dropped onto his back with limbs spread wide.\n\n“He kind of pressures you, in a way, to go for more risks, and that’s tough,” Ruud said. “He just stepped up, like he knows how to do.”\n\nAt first, though, Djokovic kept missing forehands — into the net, wide, long — then made a different sort of mistake, shanking an overhead from near the net way beyond the opposite baseline to get broken and trail 2-0.\n\nFor whatever reason, that shot always has been Djokovic’s “bête noire,” and he missed another overhead later in the set.\n\nSoon, Ruud led 4-1, thanks in part to Djokovic’s troubles. By then, Djokovic accumulated 13 unforced errors, while Ruud made just four.\n\nAnd then everything changed.\n\nAfter finishing the first set with 18 unforced errors, Djokovic recalibrated himself, with merely 14 over the last two sets combined.\n\nThen it was Ruud’s turn to flub an overhead, rocking back and depositing his into the net to end a 29-stroke point. Djokovic's first service break made it 4-3, and he shook his right fist.\n\n“A bit devastating,” Ruud called it.\n\nThey went to a tiebreaker, truly Djokovic’s dominion. When the import rises, along with the tension, he simply excels.\n\n“He sort of just goes into this mode,” Ruud said, “where he just becomes like a wall.”\n\nDuring the first-to-7 segment, Djokovic contributed four winners and zero unforced errors.\n\nThat made his career mark in tiebreakers 308-162, a winning percentage of .655. In 2023, he is 15-4, including 6-0 in Paris — there were 55 points played across that half-dozen, and Djokovic’s sum total of unforced errors was zero.\n\n“He just steps up,” Ruud said. “Either he plays ridiculous defense or he plays beautiful winners. Just doesn’t do any mistakes.”\n\nThat set alone lasted 1 hour, 21 minutes, chock full of extended exchanges, the sort of points about which entire stories could be written. There were those that lasted 20, 25, 29 strokes. One was won by Ruud with the help of a back-to-the-net, between-the-legs shot. On another, Djokovic tumbled behind the baseline, smudging his red shirt, blue shorts and skin with the rust-colored clay.\n\nDjokovic's scrambling and stretching and bending and twisting on defense shows up on the scoreboard, for sure. But all of the long points also sap an opponent's energy and will.\n\n“It's just annoying for me,” Ruud said, “but it’s very, very impressive.”\n\nWhen Djokovic broke to lead 3-0 in the second set, his powers now on full display, he jabbed his right index finger against his temple over and over and over. He wheeled to face his nearby box in the stands, where the group included Ivanisevic, Djokovic's wife and two children, his parents, his agent and even seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady.\n\nThe retired Brady is widely viewed as the NFL’s “Greatest Of All Time” — or “GOAT,” for short — and there has been a debate in the tennis world for quite some time over which among Djokovic, Nadal or Federer deserves that sobriquet.\n\nIf the barometer is Grand Slam championships, no one can argue against Djokovic’s status at the moment.\n\n“I leave those kind of discussions of ‘who is the greatest?’ to someone else. I have, of course, huge faith and confidence and belief (in) myself and for everything that I am and who I am and what I am capable of doing,\" Djokovic said at his news conference, the Coupes des Mousquetaires at arm's length. “So this trophy obviously is another confirmation of the quality of tennis that I’m still able to produce, I feel.”\n\n___\n\nAP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/11"}]}

Now what?\n\nThe inquiry into Johnson's behavior is highly critical but has no legal consequences. If he were still a lawmaker, he could have faced a 90-day suspension. But he's not, so it's academic, though lawmakers will vote Monday on whether to endorse the report's findings and sanctions. Johnson resigned ahead of the report's release, claiming there was a “witch hunt under way, to take revenge for Brexit and ultimately to reverse the 2016 referendum result,” references to Britain's controversial vote to leave the European Union, which he backed.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Johnson said that the report \"twisted the truth\" and that its findings were the \"final knife-thrust in a protracted political assassination − that is beyond contempt.\"\n\nA separate public inquiry into how Johnson's government responded to the pandemic, complete with emotional impact statements from witnesses, is expected to continue for the next six weeks. At the height of the pandemic, Britain had one of the world's highest COVID-19 death rates, according to Our World in Data. Johnson pursued policies that relaxed restrictions far earlier than many other European countries did.\n\nJohnson has not been barred from running for reelection as a lawmaker. He may not need a job straight away: The British press has reported he has made millions of dollars in speaking fees since leaving office last year.\n\nWorld leaders facing court cases, charges, hearings\n\nStill, Johnson isn't the only world leader, former or current, who has been in the hot seat in the form of being the subject of a court case, hearing or legal inquiry of one kind or another.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump faces many legal challenges.\n\nHe was indicted on June 14 by the Department of Justice over the potential mishandling of classified documents. He pleaded not guilty to the charges against him − all 37 of them. Trump was also indicted in March on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, including paying \"hush money\" to a former adult film star, Stormy Daniels. He pleaded not guilty to all those charges. He is being investigated in a separate federal case involving his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol and an inquiry in Georgia into efforts to overturn the 2020 election in that state.\n\nAge and indictment:Biden and Trump face big liabilities with voters-Poll\n\nIsraeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu has been marred by allegations of corruption for years.

In a tweet, he wrote, “The United Kingdom is a great country but we face a profound economic crisis. That’s why I am standing to be Leader of the Conservative Party and your next Prime Minister. I want to fix our economy, unite our Party and deliver for our country.”\n\nThe former chancellor of the exchequer has already reached the 100-nomination threshold to make it to the voting stage, while Johnson’s allies said the former PM had returned from a holiday in the Caribbean with the intention of joining the race, PA news reported, but he has yet to declare he is standing.\n\nA runoff between the two men could prove divisive for the ruling Conservative party, not least because many of Johnson’s supporters blame Sunak’s resignation in July for sparking the downfall of his government. Some outlets have speculated that the two men could strike some kind of deal.\n\nThe BBC reported that a meeting took place between Johnson and Sunak but “it wasn’t disclosed what they discussed,” while Britain’s PA Media news agency reported the two “were said to be locked in talks late into the evening” Saturday.\n\nSky News, meanwhile, referred to the meeting as a “secret summit.”\n\nSunak and Johnson, if he decides to run, will be up against Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt, who said Sunday she regretted the so-called “mini budget” that led to economic turmoil in Britain and the resignation of Truss.\n\n“I very much regret the mini-budget … I raised concerns even before I was in cabinet,” Mordant told the BBC in a Sunday interview, adding there were details about the budget “the cabinet was not aware of.”\n\nThe last time the Conservatives held a leadership race – following the demise of Johnson’s government – Truss came first, Sunak second and Mordaunt third.\n\nGraham Brady, the Conservative official responsible for the process, has said any candidate must receive at least 100 nominations from the party’s MPs by 2 p.m. local time Monday.\n\nThe threshold effectively narrows the field of potential candidates to a maximum of three as the party has 357 MPs.\n\nIf only one candidate meets that threshold, they will automatically become leader. Otherwise, the remaining candidates will be put to an online vote by Conservative Party members which will close on Friday October 28.\n\nTruss resigned on Thursday, just six weeks into her disastrous term that pitched Britain deep into political and economic turmoil. Her successor will be the fifth PM to lead the country since it voted for Brexit in 2016.\n\nKeir Starmer, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, renewed calls for a general election on Sunday, after claiming people are “fed up to the back teeth” with the Conservative leadership and the consequences of their government’s decisions.\n\n“There is a choice to be made. We need a general election! Let the public into decide… Do they want to continue with this utter chaos, or do they want stability under a Labour government?” Starmer asked during a BBC interview.\n\nFormer Home Secretary Priti Patel on Saturday became one of the most high-profile supporters of Johnson in his quest to become PM. “Boris has the mandate to deliver our elected manifesto and a proven track record getting the big decisions right,” she said in a tweet.\n\nBut his possible return to the top job has split opinions within the Conservative Party, with many lawmakers horrified at the prospect of a second Johnson premiership.\n\nJohnson’s former deputy prime minister and foreign secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC, “we cannot go backwards” and pointed out that Johnson still faces a probe into the so-called partygate scandal into illegal gatherings in Downing Street.\n\nThe former PM is expected to appear in the next few weeks before the Commons Privileges Committee which is investigating whether he misled Parliament over the parties, which could potentially see him suspended or expelled as an MP.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hauser Tara Subramaniam", "Jennifer Hauser", "Tara Subramaniam"], "publish_date": "2022/10/23"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/956477/what-is-the-privileges-committee", "title": "Privileges committee: who are its members and what powers does it ...", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

People could not leave home without a reasonable excuse and could only meet one person outside while exercising, according to rules at the time. An investigation by The Guardian in December 2021 led to the publication of a picture of Johnson, flanked by Carrie Symonds and his then chief adviser Dominic Cummings, drinking wine and eating cheese in the No. 10 garden. That day, the health secretary at the time, Matt Hancock, had urged “people to stick to the rules and not take advantage of the good weather over the May weekend to socialise in groups”. When asked about it later, Johnson said: “Those people were at work talking about work.” The event was not investigated by the police.\n\n20 May 2020 One of the most explosive of the lockdown parties was revealed when an email leaked to ITV News showed more than 100 Downing Street staff were invited for “socially distanced drinks” in the garden of No. 10 to “make the most of the lovely weather”. Sent by Johnson’s principal private secretary Martin Reynolds, the email invited employees including advisers, speech writers and door staff to come over and “bring your own booze”. Johnson told Prime Minister’s Questions in January 2022 that he attended for around “25 minutes” but thought it was “a work event”.\n\n19 June 2020 ITV News reported in January 2022 that a birthday party was held in the Cabinet Room for Johnson with up to 30 people. His then girlfriend Carrie Symonds apparently presented him with a cake and “led staff in a chorus of happy birthday”, said the broadcaster. Johnson famously claimed he had been “ambushed by cake”, and that he was there for less than 10 minutes. Police determined that the event breached the rules, which at the time banned most indoor gatherings involving more than two people. Johnson and Symonds both received fixed-penalty notices, as did the then chancellor, Rishi Sunak. The latter claimed to have been “unintentionally present” when the cake was served, while waiting for a meeting.\n\n13 November 2020 In early November new lockdown restrictions were introduced to deal with rising Covid-19 infections and hospitalisations, banning indoor gatherings and leaving the home for non-essential activities. Two gatherings allegedly took place eight days later, the evening No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings was sacked. A spokesman for Johnson’s then fiancée denied that these events, reported in The Daily Telegraph, had taken place. According to the police investigation an event on this day did breach the rules in place at the time, but it did not confirm whether it was one or both.\n\n25 November 2020 The Times revealed in December 2021 that an “impromptu” party was held in late November 2020, to celebrate Sunak’s autumn spending review. A spokesperson for the Treasury told The Guardian that a “small number” had remained after work to celebrate at their desks. According to The Times, “about two dozen civil servants” took part in the drinks after “wine and beer were brought into the Treasury”. “They’d all been working really hard,” sources told the paper.\n\n27 November 2020 Two days later, it was alleged that the prime minister attended a leaving event for Cleo Watson, a former Downing Street adviser. A source told The Guardian “that Johnson personally attended and gave a speech”, mentioning how crowded it was in the room before leaving shortly afterwards to continue working.\n\n10 December 2020 Eight days after the second national lockdown was replaced with the tier system and indoor meetings of two or more were banned in London, the Department for Education (DoE) held a Christmas party at which two dozen people drank in the department canteen. Susan Acland-Hood, a senior civil servant, said it had been organised at the request of former education secretary Gavin Williamson, The Guardian reported. The DoE confirmed that the party had taken place “to thank staff for their work during the pandemic”.\n\n14 December 2020 Shaun Bailey, the Conservative candidate for London mayor, was forced to apologise in December 2021 after the Daily Mirror published a photograph of him at a Christmas party held at the Tories’ campaign headquarters in London, alongside 24 other people, on 14 December. The photo showed the group smiling at the camera, next to catered food. The Conservative Party would later admit that an “unauthorised gathering” took place at its Westminster headquarters. Bailey stepped down as chair of the London Assembly police and crimes committee over the revelations. Police said there was insufficient evidence to determine whether rules had been broken, and the event was not included in the eventual report into parties in and around Downing Street by senior civil servant Sue Gray.\n\n15 December 2020 Pictures published in the Sunday Mirror in December 2021 showed Johnson hosting an online quiz in Downing Street in December 2020. He was with two members of his team wearing tinsel and a Santa hat. Johnson denied breaking any guidance or rules at this event.

The result was a surprisingly seamless and performance-heavy show, led by standout numbers from Ben Platt (\"Parade\") and Lea Michele (\"Funny Girl\").\n\n\"Kimberly Akimbo,\" a musical about a 16-year-old girl (Victoria Clark) who ages four times faster than the average person, picked up the night's biggest trophy for best musical, along with prizes for best actress (Clark), best score and best book. Tom Stoppard's \"Leopoldstadt,\" a decades-spanning drama about a Jewish family and the horrors of antisemitism, earned best play. And Emmy winners Sean Hayes (\"Good Night, Oscar\") and Jodie Comer (\"Prima Facie\") took top acting honors for their powerhouse turns in new plays.\n\nHere are the top moments of the night:\n\nAriana DeBose does the thing with unscripted opening number\n\nAfter starting last year's show with a frenetic mashup of show tunes, DeBose returned to the Tonys with a remarkable, wordless opening number. After leafing through a blank script, she proceeded to twirl, kick, leap and flip through the United Palace with a group of dancers and musicians. She then expressed her support for striking Writers Guild of America members and explained what the strike meant for Sunday's ceremony.\n\n\"To anyone who may have thought that last year was a bit unhinged, to them I say, 'Darlings, buckle up,' \" DeBose said, before pointing out the lack of teleprompters in the theater. \"In all seriousness, yes, I am unscripted as is every presenter who comes on stage tonight. We're just making it up as we go along.\"\n\nBonnie Milligan delivers inspiring speech with 'Kimberly Akimbo' win\n\nMilligan brought home the Tony for best featured actress in a musical, for her hilarious and nuanced portrayal of small-time con Aunt Debra in \"Kimberly Akimbo.\" The beloved scene-stealer paid an emotional tribute to her late father and grandmother in her acceptance speech, before offering words of encouragement to others who may feel like outsiders.\n\n\"I want to tell everybody that doesn't look like what the world is telling you should look like − whether you're not pretty enough, you're not fit enough, your identity is not right, who you love isn't right,\" Milligan said. \"That doesn't matter because guess what? It’s right and you belong.\"\n\nBackstage, she talked about her long road to Broadway, growing up in a trailer in the Midwest with \"not much, no connections.\" She added, \"It took a while to get here. For some years, I had shame about how long it took me to get here.\"\n\n2023 Tony Awards nominations:'Some Like It Hot' leads; Jessica Chastain, Samuel L. Jackson score\n\nAlex Newell, J. Harrison Ghee make Tonys history as nonbinary acting winners\n\nNewell, the \"independently owned\" showstopper of corn comedy \"Shucked,\" tearfully picked up the trophy for best featured actor in a musical. The actor, who is nonbinary and uses he/she/they pronouns, thanked their mom for \"teaching me what strength is,\" while also expressing gratitude for the Broadway community.\n\n\"I've wanted this my entire life and I thank each and every one of you in this room right now,\" Newell said in their speech. \"Thank you, Broadway, for seeing me. I should not be up here as a queer, nonbinary, fat, Black little baby from Massachusetts.\"\n\nLater, Ghee took the stage to accept best actor in a musical for \"Some Like It Hot,\" playing a jazz musician coming into their gender identity.\n\nGhee, who uses he/they pronouns, became the second openly nonbinary performer in Tony history to win an acting award, after Newell earlier in the night. \"For every trans, nonbinary, gender non-conforming human − whoever was told they couldn’t be, couldn’t be seen, this is for you,\" Ghee said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the media room, Ghee elaborated on their own coming-out journey, saying it's wonderful to \"break labels and limits and boundaries for myself, first and foremost, and to hopefully be that inspiration for others.\"\n\nDenée Benton compares Ron DeSantis to KKK leader\n\nBenton, star of HBO's \"The Gilded Age,\" earned huge cheers from the United Palace audience with her pointed remarks about DeSantis. While introducing an award, the Carnegie Mellon University alum compared the Republican governor of Florida to a \"grand wizard,” referring to a leader of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\n\"Earlier tonight, CMU and the Tony Awards presented the 2023 Excellence in Theater Education Award,” Benton said. “And while I am certain that the current grand wizard − I’m sorry, excuse me − governor of my home state of Florida will be changing the name of this following town immediately, we were honored to present this award to the truly incredible and life-changing Jason Zembuch-Young, enhancing the lives of students at South Plantation High School in Plantation, Florida.”\n\nCelebrities including \"Abbott Elementary\" actress Sheryl Lee Ralph praised Benton's statement on Twitter, writing \"Yesssssss @DeneeBenton I caught it!! The grand wizard.\"\n\nJodie Comer wins best actress for harrowing 'Prima Facie'\n\nComer, who shot to fame on BBC America's \"Killing Eve,\" won the best actress in a play Tony for her tour-de-force performance in \"Prima Facie.\" In the grueling one-woman show, Comer plays a lawyer named Tessa who represents men accused of sexual assault. Her perspective shifts when she is raped by a male colleague and she struggles to confront a system that enables abuse.\n\nThe actress says \"Prima Facie\" is different from other projects she's seen about sexual assault.\n\n\"For me, the distinction is that she’s in control of the whole narrative and the execution of telling the story, and I was really moved by that,\" Comer told reporters backstage. \"And that's why I think it resonates so deeply with people: that you’re experiencing every moment with her.\"\n\nComer expressed admiration for her character's sense of self, saying that playing Tessa helped her \"become a woman.\" She also recalled the emotional responses she's received from survivors.\n\n\"The letters we get on a weekly basis from hundreds of women, saying very clearly what this play has done for them,\" Comer said. \"We see firsthand the effect this play is having. … Not every job is like this, and we just savor every second.\"\n\nMore:Chris Stapleton concert postponed, Broadway performances canceled amid New York air quality crisis", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2023/05/02/tony-awards-nominations-2023-announcement-full-list/70173612007/", "title": "2023 Tony Awards nominations: 'Some Like It Hot' leads; Jessica ...", "text": "“Some Like It Hot” sizzled in Tuesday’s Tony Awards nominations.\n\nThe new Broadway production, adapted from the 1959 screwball comedy starring Marilyn Monroe, led this year’s crop with 13 nods, including best musical, best actor (Christian Borle and J. Harrison Ghee) and best featured actress (NaTasha Yvette Williams). The show features an original score by “Hairspray” team Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, and counts pop/R&B icon Mariah Carey among its producers.\n\nA-listers cropped up in multiple categories in this season’s nominations. Jessica Chastain (“A Doll’s House”) and Jodie Comer (“Prima Facie”) are going head-to-head in best leading actress in a play for their powerhouse performances, while Samuel L. Jackson (“August Wilson’s The Piano Lesson”) earned his first Tony nod in the featured actor category.\n\nSingers-turned-actors Sara Bareilles (“Into the Woods”) and Josh Groban (“Sweeney Todd”) were also recognized for their respective shows, which are both vying for myriad prizes including best revival of a musical.\n\nNow in their 76th year, the Tony Awards honor the best of Broadway, with nominees voted on by an independent committee of 40 theater professionals. This year's ceremony will be held at New York’s historic United Palace on June 11 and broadcast on CBS (8 EDT/5 PDT).

The Academy Awards, or Oscars, is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony.\n\nEach year, actors, actresses, directors, writers and more vie for the chance to win an Oscar.

Most categories are decided by members of the corresponding branches: actors nominate actors, directors nominate directors and so on.\n\nFrom there, members vote online, and the results are announced on awards night. The votes are certified by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has counted for the Oscars since 1935.\n\nTo be eligible for an Oscar, there are certain rules that must be fulfilled.

He's a Tony voter, too.\n\nSince the nominations were announced on May 1, Nocciolino has been busy seeing shows to cast his votes for the coveted awards. Nominees can vote only in categories in which they have seen all of the productions, logging this using an online portal.\n\nThe winners of the ceremony, named for actress and American Theatre Wing co-founder Antoinette Perry, are determined by about 846 eligible voters who are members of theatrical trade organizations.\n\nThe Tony Awards telecast will be aired on CBS at 8 p.m. Sunday.\n\nRecently, Nocciolino shared his thoughts for the season and future of Broadway.\n\nStanding out in this year's season is a a striking amount of new musicals based on other material.\n\nOf the four musicals nominated for the Best Musical Tony Award — \"The Band's Visit,\"\"Frozen,\" \"Mean Girls\" and \"SpongeBob SquarePants: The Musical\" — two are based on major American motion pictures (\"Frozen\" and \"Mean Girls\"), one is based on a popular kid's television show (\"SpongeBob SquarePants: The Musical\") and another (\"The Band's Visit\") is based on an Israeli film.\n\nAt last year's Tony Awards, Best Musical winner \"Dear Evan Hansen\" was an original story not based on any source material.\n\n\"I think with the level of risk that's attached to them and the kind of money it takes to produce a Broadway musical these days, which is on average $15 million, I think you're finding that producers are looking for something that has awareness, that has a brand, if you will, although I hate that word,\" Nocciolino said. \"But something that's recognizable.\"\n\nThe play \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts One and Two\" — a transfer from London — also brought a major brand to the Great White Way. (It has been nominated for Best Play.)\n\nAside from movies-turned-musicals, Nocciolino has seen play revivals bringing in actors with box-office appeal.\n\nMajor stars including Denzel Washington, Glenda Jackson and Andrew Garfield all starred in plays this year. New plays have also brought in major stars, with Amy Schumer garnering a nomination for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play for \"Meteor Shower.\"\n\n\"You have a lot of actors who are movie stars who want to go to the stage,\" Nocciolino said. \"At some level, in some sense, it gives them a kind of a credibility and exposure that's so different from shooting a film or TV. So, that's not a new trend but it's one that continues.\"\n\nMany titles like \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts One and Two\" are a draw for young people, who are often a challenge to attract to non-musical plays.\n\n\"To get people, and young people in particular, going to see a play is pretty extraordinary, and I think is just wonderful for our business and for the arts in general,\" Nocciolino said.\n\nAnd they're not only targeting young people, but people who may not typically be theatergoers.\n\n\"This is one of those seasons that's doing its own audience development,\" Nocciolino said. \"In a crazy way, it makes sense.\"\n\nLooking forward, Nocciolino predicts more musicals based on source material coming to Broadway.\n\nHe is currently involved with \"The Cher Show,\" a new musical based on pop icon Cher's scheduled to open at the Oriental Theatre in Chicago on June 12 and plans to transfer to Broadway next season.\n\nFamiliar titles including \"Pretty Woman\" (a retelling of the 1990 film) and \"Jagged Little Pill\" (based on the Alanis Morissette album of the same name) also have plans to come to Broadway next season.\n\n\"When you look at the economics of producing a musical, it starts to make sense to have something to help get attention,\" Nocciolino said.\n\nNocciolino's Predictions\n\nWhile he is not allowed to reveal his votes, he divulged his predictions for who will take home the trophy on Sunday.\n\nBest musical\n\nNominees: \"The Band's Visit,\" \"Frozen,\" \"Mean Girls,\" \"SpongeBob SquarePants: The Broadway Musical\"\n\n\"The Band's Visit,\" \"Frozen,\" \"Mean Girls,\" \"SpongeBob SquarePants: The Broadway Musical\" Nocciolino's prediction: \"The Band's Visit.\"\n\nBest play\n\nNominees: \"The Children,\" \"Farinelli and the King,\" \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,\" \"Junk,\" \"Latin History for Morons.\"\n\n\"The Children,\" \"Farinelli and the King,\" \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,\" \"Junk,\" \"Latin History for Morons.\" Nocciolino's prediction: \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.\"\n\nBest revival of a musical\n\nNominees: \"Carousel,\" \"My Fair Lady,\" \"Once on this Island.\"\n\n\"Carousel,\" \"My Fair Lady,\" \"Once on this Island.\" Nocciolino's prediction: \"I think 'Carousel' will win, but if one of the others did, it wouldn't surprise me.\"\n\nBest revival of a play\n\nNominees: \"Angels in America,\" \"Lobby Hero,\" \"Three Tall Women,\" \"The Iceman Cometh,\" \"Travesties\"\n\n\"Angels in America,\" \"Lobby Hero,\" \"Three Tall Women,\" \"The Iceman Cometh,\" \"Travesties\" Nocciolino's prediction: \"Angels in America\"\n\nBest performance by an actress in a leading role in a musical\n\nNominees: Lauren Ambrose (\"My Fair Lady\"), Hailey Kilgore (\"Once on this Island\"), LaChanze (\"Summer: The Donna Summer Musical\"), Katrina Lenk (\"The Band's Visit\"), Taylor Louderman (\"Mean Girls\"), Jessie Mueller (\"Rogers & Hammerstein's Carousel\")\n\nLauren Ambrose (\"My Fair Lady\"), Hailey Kilgore (\"Once on this Island\"), LaChanze (\"Summer: The Donna Summer Musical\"), Katrina Lenk (\"The Band's Visit\"), Taylor Louderman (\"Mean Girls\"), Jessie Mueller (\"Rogers & Hammerstein's Carousel\") Nocciolino's prediction: \"That for me is a no-brainer.

But his condition is headed in the right direction.”\n\nThe 75-year-old award-winning author – whose writings have for decades brought him death threats – remains in critical condition, according to a family statement released Sunday by his son, but he was “able to say a few words” on Saturday.\n\n“Though his life changing injuries are severe, his usual feisty & defiant sense of humor remains intact,” the statement said.\n\nRushdie was preparing to give a lecture at the Chautauqua Institution on Friday when a man jumped on stage and stabbed him in several places, including the neck and stomach.\n\nStaff members and guests then rushed onto the stage and held down the suspect, identified as 24-year-old Hadi Matar, of Fairview, New Jersey, before a state trooper assigned to the event took him into custody, according to New York State Police.\n\n“It was very difficult to understand. It looked like a sort of bad prank, and it didn’t have any sense of reality,” said Ralph Henry Reese, another speaker at the event who suffered a minor head injury during the attack. He was taken to a hospital by ambulance and later released with a facial injury.\n\n“And then when there was blood behind him, it became real,” Reese told CNN’s “Reliable Sources” on Sunday.\n\nThe author’s injuries include three stab wounds to the right side of the front of his neck, four stab wounds to his stomach, puncture wounds to his right eye and chest, and a laceration on his right thigh, Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt said Saturday during Matar’s arraignment. Wylie previously told the New York Times the attack left Rushdie with liver and nerve damage.\n\nRushdie was airlifted to a hospital following the attack and underwent surgery, police said. The author may end up losing his right eye, Schmidt said.\n\n“We are so grateful to all the audience members who bravely leapt to his defense and administered first aid along with the police and doctors who have cared for him,” the statement said, “and for the outpouring of love and support from around the world.”\n\nIn a tweet Sunday, Padma Lakshmi, the TV host and author’s former wife, said she was “relieved” Rushdie is “pulling through after Friday’s nightmare.”\n\n“Worried and wordless, can finally exhale. Now hoping for swift healing,” she said.\n\nHadi Matar, 24, arrives for an arraignment in the Chautauqua County Courthouse in Mayville, New York, Saturday, Aug. 13, 2022. Gene J. Puskar/AP\n\nThe suspect has pleaded not guilty\n\nMatar pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree attempted murder and second-degree assault with intent to cause physical injury with a deadly weapon, his public defender, Nathaniel Barone, told CNN on Saturday.\n\nThe attorney said Matar has been “very cooperative” and communicating openly, but he did not discuss what was said during those conversations.\n\nMatar was refused bail and remanded to the Chautauqua County Jail. His next court appearance is Friday.\n\nHe faces up to 32 years if convicted of both charges, Schmidt said.\n\nThe FBI is now working with local and international authorities to investigate the attack at the Chautauqua Institution, which happened in front of an audience as Rushdie was being introduced.\n\nA witness, Joyce Lussier, was sitting in the second row when she saw a man leap across the stage and lunge at Rushdie. She heard people screaming and crying, she told CNN, and saw people from the audience rushing up to the stage.\n\nAnother witness, Stephen Davies, who captured video of the moments just after Rushdie was attacked, said he couldn’t tell if the attacker had a knife in his hand, though the felony complaint against Matar indicates he used a knife.\n\n“He lunged onto Mr. Rushdie and started pummeling him with his hand, very quickly,” Davies said. “I was completely stunned and shocked.”\n\nThe suspect had a pass to the event that now faces questions over its security procedures\n\nThe suspect arrived in Chautauqua at least a day before the event and bought a pass to the event two days prior, Schmidt said during Matar’s arraignment.\n\nMatar traveled to Chautauqua by bus and had cash, pre-paid Visa cards and false identification with him, said Schmidt, who called the stabbing a “targeted, pre-planned, unprovoked attack on Mr. Rushdie.”\n\nThere were no security searches or metal detectors at the event, a person who witnessed the attack told CNN. The witness is not being identified because they expressed concerns for their personal safety.\n\nThe attack has raised questions about the security precautions at the host institution.\n\nThe institution’s leadership had rejected recommendations for basic security measures, including bag checks and metal detectors, fearing that would create a divide between speakers and the audience, according to two sources who spoke with CNN on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nInstitution President Michael Hill defended his organization’s security plans when asked during a news conference Friday whether there would be more precautions at future events.\n\n“We assess for every event what we think the appropriate security level is, and this one was certainly one that we thought was important which is why we had a State Trooper and Sheriff presence there,” Hill said. “We will assess for each of the events at the Institution what we think the appropriate level of security is and that’s an ongoing process that we work in concert with local law enforcement on.”\n\nMatar – who authorities say has no documented criminal history – was described as being a quiet person who mostly kept to himself. CNN exclusively spoke with State of Fitness Boxing Club owner Desmond Boyle, who said Matar enrolled at the gym in North Bergen, New Jersey in April.\n\n“You know that look, that ‘it’s the worst day of your life’ look? He came in every day like that,” Boyle told CNN on Saturday.\n\nAs the investigation continued, police on Friday evening were seen at a New Jersey home believed to be connected to the suspect.\n\nA view from the round of the home of Hadi Matar, as FBI members and local police forces are being carried out search, in Fairview, New Jersey, United States on August 13, 2022. Islam Dogru/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nRushdie had a bounty on his head\n\nRushdie’s writings have won him several literary prizes, but it was his fourth novel, “The Satanic Verses,” that drew the greatest scrutiny as some Muslims found the book to be sacrilegious. The book, which sparked demonstrations, was banned in multiple countries.\n\nThe late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who described the book as an insult to Islam and Prophet Mohammed, issued a religious decree, or fatwa, calling for Rushdie’s death in 1989.\n\nAs a result, Rushdie began a decade under British protection.\n\nThe bounty against Rushdie has never been lifted, though in 1998 the Iranian government sought to distance itself from the fatwa by pledging not to seek to carry it out.\n\nHowever, in 2017, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was asked if the “fatwa against Rushdie was still in effect,” and he confirmed it was, saying, “The decree is as Imam Khomeini issued.”", "authors": ["Nouran Salahieh Nicki Brown Liam Reilly Samantha Beech", "Nouran Salahieh", "Nicki Brown", "Liam Reilly", "Samantha Beech"], "publish_date": "2022/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2022/05/15/b-a-shapiro-author-art-forger-has-new-book-metropolis/9613469002/", "title": "B.A. Shapiro, author of The Art Forger, has new book, Metropolis", "text": "Nancy Gilson\n\nSpecial to The Columbus Dispatch\n\nWith her novels “The Collector’s Apprentice,” “The Muralist” and “The Art Forger,” B.A. Shapiro attracted readers who revel in literary thrillers set in the world of art.\n\nFor her new novel, Shapiro pivoted to a vastly different world — storage units.\n\n“Metropolis,” which will be released on Tuesday, involves a death (suicide or murder?) in a cavernous Boston storage unit and a cast of characters of all types and ages. Some of them, escaping past or present demons, live in their units in the storage warehouse. All of them merge in the novel’s complicated plot.\n\nShapiro, 70, has a doctorate in sociology and has worked as a systems analyst and statistician as well as a professor of sociology and creative writing. Born in Connecticut, she lives in Boston and in Naples, Florida, and is a mother and a grandmother.\n\nDownload today:Download our app for the latest arts and entertainment news\n\nShe will appear May 23, at Gramercy Books in Bexley. In advance of the event, she spoke recently with The Dispatch.\n\nVisual arts:Exhibit at Franklin Park Conservatory uses items from nature -- naturally\n\nQ: How did you decide to set “Metropolis” in a Boston storage unit? Have you ever used a storage unit?\n\nShapiro: No! One of the things about writing fiction is that you get to learn a lot about things you don’t know. I had always wanted to write a book about people who are from all different walks of life and then, because of a single event, are thrown together … One day, I opened the newspaper and there was an article about this big storage-unit building that looked like a medieval castle and how people were moving out of it. I said, that’s it.\n\nQ: Do people actually live in storage units?\n\nShapiro: They do. Obviously, it’s illegal but people do it. Some of the things that are stored there — artworks, musical instruments, wine — need climate control, so a lot of those units have good ventilation.\n\nQ: One of the “Metropolis” characters is a young immigrant working on her doctorate in sociology. How did your background figure into the character of Marta?\n\nShapiro: Originally, her dissertation was similar to mine but in the third or fourth draft, I realized that the theme of the book is life chance: You’re born with a set of privileges or non-privileges that have nothing to do with you. So I made that (socioeconomic resources from birth) her topic. In America, we want to believe that people can pull themselves up by their bootstraps and that everyone is equal and that was an idea I wanted to disprove.\n\nQ: How did you happen to write literary thrillers set in the world of art?\n\nShapiro: By accident. I wrote five books published in the 1990s and they basically came out and died. Then I wrote four more books that I couldn’t even sell to a publisher. And then I wrote a book that was going to be my very last book — “The Art Forger” — and it got published and became a New York Times bestseller. I got a two-book contract and decided I really liked writing about this art stuff.\n\nQ: Will you return to the world of art?\n\nShapiro: Well, I didn’t want to get pegged so “Metropolis” isn’t set there — although there is a photographer in it … I’m working on a book now that has art in it, but in another way. This is about a woman who has multiple personality disorder and each of her different personalities is an artist, although they all work in different mediums. It’s a murder mystery/legal thriller with the working title “Multiplicity.” … It probably won’t be out for two or three years.\n\nPrizewinner:James McBride, author of 'Deacon King Kong,' winner of Thurber Prize for American Humor\n\nQ: Your novel “The Muralist” speaks of European refugees during the build up to and during World War II. Are you Jewish, and were there similar experiences in your family?\n\nShapiro: I am Jewish. Most of my grandparents came here at the beginning of the 20th century, running from the pogroms in Russia. My grandmother was one of six children in Odessa. Five came to the U.S. and one stayed there and had a family. So I have cousins and half-cousins in the Ukraine and am so distressed about the war. These things just never end, thanks to autocratic, sociopathic men.\n\nQ: When did you become B.A. Shapiro and not Barbara Shapiro?\n\nShapiro: Everyone thinks that was because I wanted to hide my gender, but it wasn’t. My first five books that nobody read were published under Barbara Shapiro. The first things book sellers look at before ordering your new book are your past sales and Barbara’s past sales were not good, so that’s how I became B.A.\n\nnegilson@gmail.com\n\nAt a glance\n\nB.A. Shapiro will appear in conversation with Nancy Gilson at 7 p.m. May 23, at Gramercy Books, 2424 E.

During the preview, the patches on Cruise’s jacket, which originally bore flags that represent Taiwan and Japan, appeared to have been swapped out and replaced with two ambiguous symbols in the same color scheme.\n\nThat omission had angered some critics, prompting speculation that the change was made to appease Chinese censors and the film’s Chinese backer, Tencent (TCEHY). At the time, Tencent (TCEHY) Pictures, a subsidiary of the Shenzhen-based tech giant, was an investor of the highly anticipated sequel to the 1986 classic.\n\nNow, however, the company has pulled out. The Wall Street Journal reported last week, citing unidentified sources, that Tencent had relinquished its role as a financier of the film in late 2019, amid geopolitical concerns between China and the United States.\n\nThe firm was worried about falling out of line with officials in Beijing for promoting a movie that celebrated the American military as US-Chinese relations soured, according to the report. Tencent and Paramount (PGRE) Pictures, the studio behind the film, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA sensitive topic\n\nChina and Taiwan have a complex relationship. Beijing’s communist leadership has long claimed Taiwan, a self-governed democratic island, as part of its territory, despite having never ruled over it.\n\nAs part of its campaign, the Chinese government has pressured multinational companies to refer to Taiwan as a Chinese territory, in exchange for accessing its lucrative market.\n\nThe drive has been largely successful, with players like United Airlines (UAL), Delta Airlines (DAL), Marriott (MAR), American Express (AXP), and Goldman Sachs (GS) falling in line. Hollywood films have also been increasingly censored over the years as China grew in importance to the global box office.\n\nChinese and Japanese relations have also long been fraught, with tensions flaring in recent years over disputed islands in the East China Sea.\n\nIn the trailer of \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" two jacket patches that had originally shown the Japanese and Taiwanese flags (left) appeared to have been swapped out and replaced with two ambiguous symbols in the same color scheme. @markmackinnon/TWITTER\n\nNow, the film’s update is likely to anger some fans and officials in mainland China.\n\n“There’s a high probability Beijing will ban the release and monetization of ‘Top Gun’ in China,” said Chris Fenton, former president of DMG Entertainment and author of the book “Feeding the Dragon: Inside the Trillion-Dollar Dilemma Facing Hollywood, the NBA, and American Business.”\n\n“There’s also a probability the Chinese government will blackball the studio, filmmakers, and actors from the market for an extended period of time,” Fenton added. “We’ve witnessed similar punishments in the past.”\n\nSince 2020, China’s strict “zero Covid” restrictions have left many cinemas shuttered for extended periods of time, including in Shanghai and Beijing. That’s in sharp contrast with how moviegoers elsewhere have recently flocked back to theaters around the world.\n\nCurrently, “Top Gun: Maverick” has not been released in mainland China, and does not have a set opening date.\n\nBut Fenton noted “that may have been a forgone conclusion anyway,” given the heightened geopolitical tensions between the world’s two largest economies.\n\n“A film strongly promoting Western ideals and US military hegemony probably never stood a chance for approval,” he said.\n\nHe also noted that the Chinese film market has recently eschewed Hollywood movies in favor of other titles. In recent months, patriotic propaganda war movies have topped the box office domestically.\n\n“That’s a likely calculation that led to the decision [for producers to include Taiwan’s flag],” said Fenton. “The global goodwill generated by reinstating the flags easily outweighs any potential revenues from China.”\n\nThe move delighted fans in Taiwan: Social media users there cheered the decision online this week, with some calling it a “pleasant surprise.”\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick,” in which Cruise reprises his role as Navy fighter pilot Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, has already smashed box office records, taking in more than $300 million worldwide, according to IMDB’s Box Office Mojo.\n\nPaul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst for Comscore, said that the latest round of blockbusters, including “Top Gun” and “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” were still able to enjoy “massive international success” despite limitations from “some countries.”\n\n“Hollywood is starting to realize the aggravation of attempting to please China’s fickle and unpredictable censors is no longer worth the potential payoff,” said Fenton.\n\n— CNN’s Beijing bureau and Jessie Yeung contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Michelle Toh Wayne Chang", "Michelle Toh", "Wayne Chang"], "publish_date": "2022/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/01/23/russia-bans-death-stalin-movie-theaters/1058528001/", "title": "'The Death of Stalin': Russia bans movie from theaters", "text": "Deutsche Welle\n\nRussia's Culture Ministry on Tuesday banned the satirical film The Death of Stalin from Russian theaters after politicians and prominent film figures criticized it for mocking Russian history.\n\nThe ministry said it decided to pull the movie's license because it contained \"information whose distribution is legally banned in Russia,\" according to AFP news agency.\n\nThe film by Scottish writer-director Armando Iannucci, based on a French graphic novel of the same name, comically portrays the power struggle after Soviet leader Josef Stalin's death in 1953.

Stalin led the Soviet Union to victory in the Second World War and oversaw much of its industrialization.\n\nThe government sparked controversy in recent years after it edited school textbooks to show the history of Stalin more positively.\n\nThis article was originally published on DW.com.

That should especially be the case when there is once-in-a-generation inflation and when the vast majority of Americans think the country is on the wrong track.\n\nInstead, Biden and the Democrats are in a position to have one of the four best midterms for the party controlling the White House in the last century.\n\nSo just what happened? It’s pretty clear that general election voters punished Republican candidates they saw as too extreme – on issues such as abortion and/or for being too closely tied to former President Donald Trump.\n\nStill, the election results were extremely unusual. I went back through the record books. Since 1922, there have been three previous instances of the president’s party gaining (or losing no) Senate seats and losing fewer than 10 House seats in the president’s first midterm.\n\nAll of them – 1934, 1962 and 2002 – are thought to be monumental achievements for the president’s party and major exceptions to rule, which suggests the party controlling the White House usually loses seats in a midterm.\n\nDemocrats’ performance this year has funneled down to the state level as well. We already know, based on projected races, that this will be the first time since 1934 that the president’s party had a net gain of governorships in a president’s first midterm. (1986 is the only other post-1934 midterm, regardless of when it fell in a presidency, when the president’s party had a net gain of governorships, though Ronald Reagan’s GOP had massive losses in the Senate that year.)\n\nThe shocking thing about this year (assuming the current trends hold) is that Biden is quite unpopular. His approval rating was 44% in the exit polls. His favorable rating was 41%.\n\nWe don’t have any polling from 1934, though considering Franklin Roosevelt won two landslide victories on either end of that midterm, he was likely quite popular.\n\nThe polling from 1962 and 2002 shows the presidents at the time (John F. Kennedy and George W. Bush respectively) with approval ratings north of 60%.\n\nGOP’s ‘candidate problem’\n\nThe ability for Democrats to defy expectations this year starts simply with whom Republicans nominated for statewide elections. Analysts, myself included, noted that Republicans seemed to have a candidate likability problem. Pre-election polling showed that Republicans in all the key races had negative net favorability ratings. Democrats in pretty much all the key races were better liked than their opponents.\n\nMany of those Republicans were endorsed by Trump and had said (at least at one point) that they believed he had won the 2020 election. (This, of course, is false, as Biden won the election.)\n\nThe exit polls bear out Republicans’ “candidate problem” in the 2022 midterms. In every Senate race (save Georgia) that Inside Elections had rated as a toss-up or only tilting toward a party before the election, more voters said the Republican candidate’s views were too extreme than said the same for the Democratic candidate.\n\nWe see this in gubernatorial elections, as well. Republicans nominated 2020 election deniers for governor in a number of blue or swing states. None of them has been projected a winner, and only Republican Kari Lake of Arizona has any chance of winning.\n\nPerhaps the lack of success by these GOP candidates shouldn’t be a surprise given that some 60% of voters – both in pre-election surveys and the exit polls – believe Biden was legitimately elected.\n\nStill, Democrats look to have scored an incredible achievement in the 2022 midterms, especially given how unpopular polls showed Biden was.\n\nThe last two Democratic presidents with approval ratings matching Biden’s in their first midterm (Bill Clinton in 1994 and Barack Obama in 2010) saw their party suffer a net loss of more than 50 House seats, at least five Senate seats and at least five governorships.\n\nTwo presidents on the trail\n\nOf course, bad Senate or gubernatorial candidates weren’t the only reason Republicans had a disappointing midterm election.\n\nOn the national level, there are two presidents in the spotlight: the current one (Biden) and the former one (Trump). Both men sported negative net favorable ratings, per the exit polls.\n\nThe fact that you have a current president and a former president who are both unpopular isn’t unusual. Both Obama and George W. Bush were unpopular before the 2010 midterm.\n\nWhat is unusual is that of the 18% who viewed neither Biden nor Trump favorably in the exit polls, 40% of them voted for Democrats. The backlash against one president this year may have been canceled out by the backlash against the other.\n\nIn 2010, a September CNN poll had Democrats winning just 21% of those who viewed neither Bush nor Obama favorably.\n\nThe reason for the difference between 2010 and 2022 is pretty obvious. I had pointed out before the election that Trump was getting more Google search traffic than Biden (i.e. the former president was in the minds of voters). Bush wasn’t receiving anywhere near the search traffic as Obama in 2010, though.\n\n‘Abortion first’ voters\n\nArguably, what truly made this midterm unique was abortion. Despite high inflation, only 31% of voters in the exit poll said it was the most important issue to their vote. A nearly identical percentage (27%) said abortion, and these voters overwhelmingly chose Democratic candidates for Congress.\n\nThis matches the dynamic we saw in the special House elections following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in June. Democrats started doing considerably better than before the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nAnd while Republicans somewhat recovered their standing in national House polls in the closing weeks of the campaign, they never made it back to where they were during the spring.\n\nThe fact that “abortion first” voters overwhelmingly chose Democrats makes sense given that 60% of exit poll respondents said the procedure should be legal in all or most cases.\n\nWhen you put it all together, Biden and the Democrats appear to have done something others have tried – and failed – in previous midterms: They turned the election into a choice between two parties instead of the usual referendum on the president’s party.", "authors": ["Harry Enten"], "publish_date": "2022/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/09/europe/russia-ukraine-school-blackboard-letters-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Russian soldiers smashed up a Ukrainian school. Then they ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen Ukrainian forces regained control of Katyuzhanka, a village north of Kyiv that had been under Russian occupation for more than a month in March, they found the local school wrecked. Any equipment that hadn’t been stolen was smashed, there was a makeshift cemetery in the school yard and deep trenches had been dug across the football pitch.\n\nInside one of the destroyed classrooms, written in chalk on a big, green blackboard hanging on the wall just below a portrait of Isaac Newton, was a letter addressed to the pupils and signed “the Russians.”\n\nIt read: “Children, we’re sorry for such a mess, we tried to save the school, but there was shelling. Live in peace, take care of yourselves and don’t repeat the mistakes your elders made. Ukraine and Russia are one people!!! Peace be with you, brothers and sisters!”\n\nThe note, written in Russian, as opposed to Ukrainian – the school’s language of instruction, was one of several left on blackboards and whiteboards scattered around the building. “We are for the peace in the whole world,” another one said. CNN cannot independently verify who wrote the notes.\n\nA note that was found on a blackboard in a school in Katyuzhanka after Russian troops left the area. One phrase says: \"Ukraine and Russia are one people!!!\" courtesy Volodymyr Runets\n\nMikola Mikitchik, the principal of the Secondary School of Katyuzhanka, told CNN last month he felt disgusted when he found the notes.\n\n“They wrote ‘Russians and Ukrainians are brothers’ and at the same time they robbed the school … they ruined computers, they took out hard drives, they took away laptops, printers, they left nothing at the school! It’s barbarism and hypocrisy,” he said.\n\nMikitchik told CNN three anti-tank mines, several stun grenades and machine gun magazines with bullets were found on the school grounds. The kitchen, recently refurbished with new equipment that was used to feed more than 500 children on a daily basis before the war started, was completely wrecked.\n\nAccording to an operational update published by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense on March 3, Russian troops were in control of Katyuzhanka at that time, having established logistics camps there and in other villages in the area.\n\nKatyuzhanka is a small village, but strategically important due to its position on one of the main roads leading to Kyiv. Satellite images from early March revealed a 40-mile-long (64-kilometer-long) Russian military convoy composed of tanks, armored vehicles and towed artillery in this area.\n\nMikitchik has estimated the material damage caused by the Russian troops – and in his mind there’s no doubt it was them who looted the school – amounted to about 5 million Ukrainian hryvnia ($170,000) and said he cannot imagine pupils coming back any time soon.\n\n‘We hope we will be friends’\n\n“Everything was taken out. Even the cables were stolen. We had electrical cables made of copper wire and 100 meters of the cable were stolen,” he said.\n\nAt the same time, another note left in the school said: “Be fair and honest with each other, give a helping hand to everyone who needs it. We hope we will be friends! Become doctors, engineers, teachers – those who bring peace!”\n\nThe school in Katyuzhanka suffered tremendous damage because of the fighting. courtesy Galina Kapytan\n\nTrenches were dug across the school's sports field. courtesy Galina Kapytan\n\nThe notes scribbled on the blackboard in Katyuzhanka were among dozens of messages found in schools in previously occupied areas of Ukraine after the withdrawal of Russian troops.\n\nIn Ukraine, photos of these notes became a symbol of the cruelty and the enormous toll of Russia’s unprovoked aggression.\n\nBut in Russia, they generated a very different response when they first emerged in April and quickly became part of the propaganda portraying Moscow’s assault against Ukraine as a “liberation.”\n\nThe Russian news website Lenta.ru ran an article about “touching messages to Ukrainian children” left behind by the Russian military, while the website of the Russian TV channel Tsargrad reported a “sincere” note that wished Ukrainian children “success in their studies.”\n\nFormer Russian culture minister Vladimir Medinsky even shared a picture of one of the notes, saying he was “touched” by its message.\n\n‘We’re sorry, we didn’t want this war’\n\nIn Novyi Bykiv, a village in the Chernihiv region east of Kyiv, principal Natalia Vovk also found a number of notes written on blackboards, many of them calling for peace and friendship between the Ukrainian and Russian people.\n\nThe Novobykivsky General Secondary Education School was hit hard during the fighting. The roof was severely damaged by shelling and all of the windows were broken, Vovk told CNN last month.\n\n“The library is damaged. School textbooks are completely burned, not a single textbook remained. Desks are broken, equipment was taken away, computers were taken out,” she said.\n\nYet in numerous classrooms, notes calling for peace were left by the Russian troops, she said.\n\n“We’re sorry, we didn’t want this war. Slavic brothers, you’re being deceived. War is bad, don’t fight, children!!” read one sign, written in large letters across a green blackboard.\n\nThis note on a blackboard found in Novyi Bykiv says \"Let's live in friendship!!!\" courtesy Natalia Vovk\n\n“Let’s live in friendship!!!” was jotted down on another board, Vovk said. A picture from another classroom shows a sign that says, “We are all Slavic. It is not good for brothers to go [against each other] with a knife.”\n\nLike Mikitchik, Vovk is now cataloging the damage done to her school during the occupation.\n\n“We had an interactive panel, that cost us 100,000 hryvnias ($3,700) and they stole it. Printers and laptops were stolen. What they couldn’t steal, they broke, made it unusable,” she said.\n\nA training grenade was found in the Novyi Bykiv school. courtesy Natalia Vovk\n\nMuch of the school's equipment was destroyed or stolen. courtesy Natalia Vovk\n\nThe Novyi Bykiv school building is shaped in a letter U, enclosing the school yard on three sides.\n\n“This was convenient for them, they put a rocket launcher in the center and launched rockets from the center of the school,” Vovk said, adding that the school’s layout and its basements made it easier for the Russian troops to hide from incoming danger.\n\n“There are many passages in the school: You can enter from one side and exit from the other side and they were very comfortable with it. They even had a dining room there,” she added.\n\nVovk said she believed some of the messages left by the Russian troops showed their personal desperation. Many were expressing anti-war sentiments, she said, and at least five of the notes were calling for friendship.\n\nThere was one inscription that said “We all want to LIVE” with the word “live” written in capital letters, she said. Another one said, “We do not understand what we are doing here.”\n\n“I believe these notes show they understood the doom. Perhaps they were waiting for death,” she said. “But they also thought about the fact that they would be punished for the evil they did. It seemed like the [writer] wanted to live, have a baby and do everything as normal, but they understood that after all this they would no longer be able to return to normal life,” she said.\n\n‘Putin is your president’\n\nIn the Zdvyzhivka Grammar School in the village of Zdvyzhivka, northwest of Kyiv, another kind of message was found.\n\n“Putin is your president. Children, study diligently, Russia needs educated citizens,” said a note found on a blackboard that was decorated with children’s drawings depicting different planets of the solar system.\n\nThis message found on a blackboard in a school in Zdvyzhivka says \"Putin is your president. Children, study diligently, Russia needs educated citizens!\" obtained by CNN\n\nAn employee of the school, who wished to remain anonymous because of safety fears, said tripwire mines were found on the school’s premises after the Russians withdrew from the area in late March.\n\nUnder Russian control, the Zdvyzhivka school became the headquarters for OMON, the special-police branch of the National Guard of Russia, he said. Like Katyuzhanka, Zdvyzhivka is also located on one of the main roads leading to Kyiv from the north.\n\nAs in the two other schools, almost all of the Zdvyzhivka school’s equipment was either stolen or destroyed.\n\n“They smashed the children’s tables, destroyed the kindergarten, the windows are broken. They stole smartboards and laptops,” the employee said.\n\n“We had a large LCD TV. They couldn’t steal it because it was too big. So they shot it and left it in the classroom,” the employee added.\n\nOn a blackboard near the smashed-up TV screen, another message was found written on a blackboard: “Forgive us!”", "authors": ["Sanyo Fylyppov Ivana Kottasová", "Sanyo Fylyppov", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/politics/donald-trump-book/index.html", "title": "New book reveals Melania Trump criticized her husband's handling ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s top general feared he would authorize a strike on Iran as his presidency ended. His intelligence chief wondered what Russia had on him. A billionaire friend convinced him to try buying Greenland. A half-dozen top officials considered resigning en masse.\n\nEven his wife, first lady Melania Trump, was “rattled by the coronavirus and convinced that Trump was screwing up,” according to a forthcoming book from New York Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker and New Yorker staff writer and CNN global affairs analyst Susan Glasser set to publish on Tuesday.\n\nIn a phone call with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who maintained ties to the White House despite occasional criticism of Trump, Melania Trump sought help convincing her husband to take the pandemic more seriously.\n\n“‘You’re blowing this,” she recalled telling her husband,” the authors write. “’This is serious. It’s going to be really bad, and you need to take it more seriously than you’re taking it.’ He had just dismissed her. ‘You worry too much,’ she remembered him saying. ‘Forget it.’ “\n\nThe razor’s-edge instability clouding Trump’s four-year tenure in the White House led many of his senior-most advisers to worry about the fate of the country. The volatility is laid bare in new detail in “The Divider: Trump in the White House, 2017-2021.” The reporting for the book included two interviews with the former President at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\nBaker and Glasser write that many of the well-known fears about Trump’s presidency were in fact closer to reality than previously reported, leading to widespread attempts among those who worked for him to head off disaster.\n\nThe revelations could also foretell the presidency Trump might oversee should he return to the White House in 2025. Trump’s associates have told CNN he could announce a presidential bid after November’s midterm elections. But, as Trump told Baker and Glasser, he won’t invite former Vice President Mike Pence to join his ticket after Pence refused to interfere in the certification of the 2020 election.\n\n“It would be totally inappropriate,” Trump said. “Mike committed political suicide by not taking votes that he knew were wrong.”\n\nThe book describes deep concerns among Trump’s national security team, led by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley and others, that the then-President would ignite a conflict with Iran in the waning days of his presidency or that he could stumble into nuclear war with North Korea.\n\nOne administration official told Trump before the 2020 election that if he lost, he should strike Iran’s nuclear program, the authors report. “Milley at the time told his staff it was a ‘What the f— are these guys talking about?’ moment,” they write. “Now, it seemed frighteningly possible.”\n\nThe tensions with Iran even permeated the walls of Mar-a-Lago. Trump told guests at a cocktail party over the holidays in 2020 that he was leaving early to return to Washington because of fears Iran may be trying to assassinate him to avenge the US killing of the country’s top general a year earlier.\n\nConcerns over Trump’s behavior on the world stage began nearly as soon as he took office. More than simply a passing grudge, Trump’s desire to withdraw the United States from NATO was in fact a sustained effort that was “much more serious than people realized,” one senior White House official said – an outcome that could have dramatically altered the current war in Ukraine.\n\nFollowing a 2018 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland – after which Trump sided with Putin over US intelligence agencies who had determined Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 election – the top US intelligence official was left wondering what Trump’s real motives were.\n\n“I never could come to a conclusion. It raised the question in everybody’s mind: What does Putin have on him that causes him to do something that undermines his credibility?” Dan Coats, the then-director of national intelligence, reflected to associates afterward, according to the book.\n\nAnd a months-long fixation with purchasing Greenland from Denmark went far deeper than previously disclosed, inspired in the early days of Trump’s presidency by a wealthy friend from New York, the cosmetics heir Ron Lauder.\n\n“I said, ‘Why don’t we have that?’ You take a look at a map. I’m a real estate developer, I look at a corner, I say, ‘I’ve got to get that store for the building that I’m building,’ etc. It’s not that different,” Trump told the reporters for their book.\n\nLauder proposed to Trump’s then-national security adviser John Bolton that he act as a “back channel” to the Danish government. Instead, top National Security Council aides engaged for months in secret talks with Denmark’s ambassador to the United States about Greenland.\n\nEventually, however, public revelations about Trump’s plans to buy the island prompted indignation in both Greenland and Denmark, scuttling any effort to enhance the US role in an increasingly strategic area. Trump called the Danish leader “nasty” for rejecting his idea and canceled a trip to Copenhagen.\n\nTrump enjoyed friendlier relations with other world leaders, but often imposed his own brand of chaos.\n\nBaker and Glasser report Trump once abruptly phoned Jordan’s King Abdullah II to inform him he was “going to give you the West Bank,” prompting the monarch to tell a friend he thought he was having a heart attack.\n\n“I couldn’t breathe. I was bent doubled over,” he said.\n\nAnd while Trump liked to frequently tout that then-Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe – who was assassinated in July – had nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize, Trump had actually explicitly made the request to Abe during dinner in New York.\n\n“The President asked Abe over dinner to nominate him,” a senior Trump national security official says in the book.\n\nBaker and Glasser describe previously unreported plans by members of Trump’s Cabinet to collectively resign amid the chaos, only to remain in their posts out of concern for whohe might select to replace them.\n\nIn encrypted text messages, then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told a top aide that five senior officials in the Trump administration – including the secretaries of Defense, Education and Interior – were on the verge of quitting amid a particularly chaotic period ahead of the 2018 midterms.\n\n“Ok for the first time I am actually scared for the country. The insanity has been loosed,” she wrote in the messages.\n\nTrump’s demands on his team included outlandish requests like abolishing the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals after it blocked one of his immigration policies.\n\n“Let’s just cancel it,” he told Nielsen, according to the book. He told Nielsen if such a move required legislation, “then draft a bill to ‘get rid of the f–king judges’ and have it sent to Congress as soon as possible.”\n\nWhen it came to responding to the Covid-19 pandemic, however, it was his most trusted advisers who were encouraging him to do more, particularly in the early days when Trump appeared nonchalant about the severity of the crisis.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/us/lgbtq-books-pulled-ny-library-children-section/index.html", "title": "Four libraries in New York pulled their LGBTQ book displays from its ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA library board in New York reversed its decision to remove all LGBTQ-related displays from its children’s section in four of its libraries during Pride month after the removal was criticized.\n\nOn Tuesday, four out of seven Smithtown Library Board of Trustees had voted to remove all Pride material displays from the children’s section in its Commack, Kings Park, Nesconset and Smithtown locations on Long Island.\n\n“All books on this subject are still part of the Library’s Children’s collection and can be checked out by anyone wishing to do so,” The Smithtown Library Board of Trustees had written on its website about the vote. “These titles have not been removed from the collection.”\n\nThe library said at the time that they would continue to display Pride month materials in the teen and adult areas of the building.\n\nOn Thursday, however, the board met once again for an emergency meeting to talk about the ban, resulting in a reversal on a 4-2 vote. The Pride month material will remain on display through July 15 and be removed afterward at the supervisory librarian’s discretion.\n\nCNN has contacted the Smithtown Library Board for a comment.\n\n“Earlier this evening, the Board of Trustees from the Smithtown Library rescinded our earlier decision to remove Pride displays from our library’s children’s room,” the Smithtown Library Board of Trustees said in an online statement. “The majority of the board recognizes that our earlier decision was made without the time, care, or due diligence that a decision of this type deserves and that it was the wrong decision.”\n\nPatrons and parents had expressed concern about the content in the Pride display material, Marie Gergenti, a library trustee, said during Thursday’s meeting, which is why she voted twice in support of the removal.\n\n“They (patrons) felt that little children were exposed to some images in some of these books and they weren’t happy about it,” she said. “The original recommendation was to remove sensitive material from the children’s section only based upon complaints by parents in the community.”\n\nBooks that tell the stories of Black and LGBTQ people or by authors in those communities topped a 2021 list of the 10 titles that were targeted the most for removal or censorship in schools, libraries and universities, the American Library Association said.\n\nThe majority of those books were called inappropriate because some people considered them to be sexually explicit, have sexually explicit images or include sexual references. Some books dealt with the LGBTQ experience, and one was challenged for allegedly promoting “an anti-police message,” the ALA said.\n\n“For many LGBTQ+ youth, libraries are the only safe, affirmative, and welcoming space during these formative years of their personal development,” the New York Library Association said in an online statement. “Libraries, for our LGBTQ+ youth, are the first place where they see themselves for exactly who they are without retribution.”\n\n“The removal of Pride displays and all related materials on display further perpetuates the cycle of shame and silence of our LGBTQ+ youth. This directly contributes to the increasing risk of LGBTQ+ youth suicide and escalated mental health crisis, while also violating libraries’ universal commitment to protecting the freedom to read.”\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul shared a similar sentiment and tweeted her support of the LGBTQ youth Wednesday evening. In a statement Thursday, she said, “Public places are prohibited by law from engaging in discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Everyone – and particularly our state’s young people – deserves to feel welcome at the library.”", "authors": ["Alisha Ebrahimji"], "publish_date": "2022/06/24"}]}
